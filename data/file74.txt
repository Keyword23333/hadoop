740000 you will find it useful at the trial but this is what we really wanted
740001 where i was sure it must be ill make the whole matter clear to you presently i think colonel that you and watson might return now and i will be with you again in an hour at the furthest the inspector and i must have a word with the prisoners but you will certainly see me back at luncheon time
740002 i wished mr acton to be present while i demonstrated this small matter to you
740003 for it is natural that he should take a keen interest in the details i am afraid my dear colonel that you must regret the hour that you took in such a stormy petrel as i am
740004 i consider it the greatest privilege to have been permitted to study your methods of working i confess that they quite surpass my expectations and that i am utterly unable to account for you result i have not yet seen the vestige of a clue
740005 i am afraid that my explanation may disillusion you but it has always been my habit to hide none of my methods either from my friend watson or from any one who might take an intelligent interest in them but first as i am rather shaken by the knocking about which i had in the dressing room i think that i shall help myself to a dash of your brandy colonel my strength had been rather tried of late
740006 i trust that you had no more of those nervous attacks
740007 it is of the highest importance in the art of
740008 and now i made a very careful examination of the corner of paper which the inspector had submitted to us it was at once clear to me that it formed part of a very remarkable document here it is do you not now observed something very suggestive about it
740009 there cannot be the least doubt in the world that it has been written by two persons doing alternate words when i draw your attention to the strong ts of at and to and ask you to compare them with the weak ones of quarter and twelve you will instantly recognize the fact a very brief analysis of these four words would enable you to say with the utmost confidence that the learn and the maybe are written in the stronger hand and the what in the weaker
740010 why on earth should two men write a letter in such a fashion
740011 obviously the business was a bad one and one of the men who distrusted the other was determined that whatever was done each should have an equal hand in it now of the two men it is clear that the one who wrote the at and to was the ringleader
740012 we might deduce it from the mere character of the one hand as compared with the other but we have more assured reasons than that for supposing it if you examine this scrap with attention you will come to the conclusion that the man with the stronger hand wrote all his words first leaving blanks for the other to fill up these blanks were not always sufficient and you can see that the second man had a squeeze to fit his quarter in between the at and the to showing that the latter were already written the man who wrote all his words first in undoubtedly the man who planned the affair
740013 we come now however to a point which is of importance you may not be aware that the deduction of a mans age from his writing is one which has brought to considerable accuracy by experts in normal cases one can place a man in his true decade with tolerable confidence i say normal cases because ill health and physical weakness reproduce the signs of old age even when the invalid is a youth in this case looking at the bold strong hand of the one and the rather broken backed appearance of the other which still retains its legibility although the ts have begun to lose their crossing we can say that the one was a young man and the other was advanced in years without being positively decrepit
740014 having got so far my next step was of course to
740015 and now i have to consider the motive of this singular crime to get at this i endeavored first of all to solve the reason of the original burglary at mr actons i understood from something which the colonel told us that a lawsuit had been going on between you mr acton and the cunninghams of course it instantly occurred to me that they had broken into your library with the intention of getting at some document which might be of importance in the case
740016 there can be no possible doubt as to their intentions i have the clearest claim upon half of their present estate and if they could have found a single paper which fortunately was in the strong box of my solicitors they would undoubtedly have crippled our case
740017 do you mean to say all our sympathy was wasted and your fit an imposture
740018 when i recovered i managed by a device which had perhaps some little merit of ingenuity to get old cunningham to write the word twelve so that i might compare it with the twelve upon the paper
740019 i could see that you were commiserating me over my weakness
740020 i had a little talk with old cunningham afterwards as to the motive of the crime he was tractable enough though his son was a perfect demon ready to blow out his own or anybody elses brains if he could have got to his revolver when cunningham saw that the case against him was so strong he lost all heart and made a clean breast of everything it seems that william had secretly followed his two masters on the night when they made their raid upon mr actons and having thus got them into his power proceeded under threats of exposure to levy black mail upon them mr alec however was a dangerous man to play games of that sort with it was a stroke of positive genius on his part to see in the burglary scare which was convulsing the country side an opportunity of plausibly getting rid of the man whom he feared william was decoyed up and shot and had they only got the whole of the note and paid a little more attention to detail in the accessories it is very possible that suspicion might never have been aroused
740021 it is very much the sort of thing that i expected
740022 of course we do not yet know what the relations may have been between alec cunningham william kirwan and annie morrison the results shows that the trap was skillfully baited i am sure that you cannot fail to be delighted with the traces of heredity shown in the ps and in the tails of the gs the absence of the i dots in the old mans writing is also most characteristic watson i think our quiet rest in the country has been a distinct success and i shall certainly return much invigorated to baker street to morrow
740023 i hoped that i might not be too late to catch you
740024 you look surprised and no wonder relieved too i fancy hum you still smoke the arcadia mixture of your bachelor days then theres no mistaking that fluffy ash upon your coat its easy to tell that you have been accustomed to wear a uniform watson youll never pass as a pure bred civilian as long as you keep that habit of carrying your handkerchief in your sleeve could you put me up tonight
740025 you told me that you had bachelor quarters for one and i see that you have no gentleman visitor at present your hat stand proclaims as much
740026 thank you ill fill the vacant peg then sorry to see that youve had the british workman in the house hes a token of evil not the drains i hope
740027 ah he has left two nail marks from his boot upon your linoleum just where the light strikes it no thank you i had some supper at waterloo but ill smoke a pipe with you with pleasure
740028 i see that you are professionally rather busy just now
740029 i have the advantage of knowing your habits my dear watson
740030 when your round is a short one you walk and when it is a long one you use a hansom as i perceive that your boots although used are by no means dirty i cannot doubt that you are at present busy enough to justify the hansom
740031 it is one of those instances where the reasoner can produce an effect which seems remarkable to his neighbor because the latter has missed the one little point which is the basis of the deduction the same may be said my dear fellow for the effect of some of these little sketches of your which is entirely meretricious depending as it does upon your retaining in your own hands some factors in the problem which are never imparted to the reader now at present i am in the position of these same readers for i hold in this hand several threads of one of the strangest cases which ever perplexed a mans brain and yet i lack the one or two which are needful to complete my theory but ill have them watson ill have them
740032 i may even say exceptional features of interest i have already looked into the matter and have come as i think within sight of my solution if you could accompany me in that last step you might be of considerable service to me
740033 very good i want to start by the 11 10 from waterloo
740034 then if you are not too sleepy i will give you a sketch of what has happened and of what remains to be done
740035 i was sleepy before you came i am quite wakeful now
740036 i will compress the story as far as may be done without omitting anything vital to the case it is conceivable that you may even have read some account of the matter it is the supposed murder of colonel barclay of the royal munsters at aldershot which i am investigating
740037 the royal munsters is as you know one of the most
740038 colonel barclay had married at the time when he was a
740039 now for the events at lachine between nine and ten on the evening of last monday
740040 mrs barclay was it appears a member of the roman
740041 there is a room which is used as a morning room at
740042 the tea which had been ordered was brought up at the
740043 that was the state of things watson when upon the
740044 there was one thing in the case which had made the
740045 from the police i learned that miss morrison who you
740046 having gathered these facts watson i smoke several pipes over them trying to separate those which were crucial from others which were merely incidental there could be no question that the most distinctive and suggestive point in the case was the singular disappearance of the door key a most careful search had failed to discover it in the room therefore it must have been taken from it but neither the colonel nor the colonels wife could have taken it that was perfectly clear therefore a third person must have entered the room and that third person could only have come in through the window it seemed to me that a careful examination of the room and the lawn might possibly reveal some traces of this mysterious individual you know my methods watson there was not one of them which i did not apply to the inquiry and ones from those which i had expected there had been a man in the room and he had crossed the lawn coming from the road i was able to obtain five very clear impressions of his foot marks one in the roadway itself at the point where he had climbed the low wall two on the lawn and two very faint ones upon the stained boards near the window where he had entered he had apparently rushed across the lawn for his toe marks were much deeper than his heels but it was not the man who surprised me it was his companion
740047 did you ever hear of a dog running up a curtain i found distinct traces that this creature had done so
740048 neither dog nor cat nor monkey nor any creature that we are familiar with i have tried to reconstruct it from the measurements here are four prints where the beast has been standing motionless you see that it is no less than fifteen inches from fore foot to hind add to that the length of neck and head and you get a creature not much less than two feet long probably more if there is any tail but now observe this other measurement the animal has been moving and we have the length of its stride in each case it is only about three inches you have an indication you see of a long body with very short legs attached to it it has not been considerate enough to leave any of its hair behind it but its general shape must be what i have indicated and it can run up a curtain and it is carnivorous
740049 because it ran up the curtain a canarys cage was hanging in the window and its aim seems to have been to get at the bird
740050 ah if i could give it a name it might go a long way towards solving the case on the whole it was probably some creature of the weasel and stoat tribe and yet it is larger than any of these that i have seen
740051 that also is still obscure but we have learned a good deal you perceive we know that a man stood in the road looking at the quarrel between the barclays the blinds were up and the room lighted we know also that he ran across the lawn entered the room accompanied by a strange animal and that he either struck the colonel or as is equally possible that the colonel fell down from sheer fright at the sight of him and cut his head on the corner of the fender finally we have the curious fact that the intruder carried away the key with him when he left
740052 you discoveries seem to have left the business more obscure that it was before
740053 quite so they undoubtedly showed that the affair was much deeper than was at first conjectured i thought the matter over and i came to the conclusion that i must approach the case from another aspect but really watson i am keeping you up and i might just as well tell you all this on our way to aldershot to morrow
740054 thank you you have gone rather too far to stop
740055 it is quite certain that when mrs barclay left the
740056 miss morrison is a little ethereal slip of a girl
740057 i promised my friend that i would say nothing of the
740058 i want to have a word with this man there is nothing to be afraid of
740059 i did as she asked me and they talked together for
740060 there was her statement watson and to me as you
740061 so now my dear fellow you see exactly how we stand and why it is i want you it is perfectly plain that after the ladies parted from this man he followed them at a distance that he saw the quarrel between husband and wife through the window that he rushed in and that the creature which he carried in his box got loose that is all very certain but he is the only person in this world who can tell us exactly what happened in that room
740062 if you will be so good if he can clear the matter up well and good if he refuses we have no alternative but to apply for a warrant
740063 but how do you know hell be there when we return
740064 you may be sure that i took some precautions i have one of my baker street boys mounting guard over him who would stick to him like a burr go where he might we shall find him in hudson street to morrow watson and meanwhile i should be the criminal myself if i kept you out of bed any longer
740065 ive come over this little matter of colonel barclays death
740066 thats what i want to ascertain you know i suppose that unless the matter is cleared up mrs barclay who is an old friend of yours will in all probability be tried for murder
740067 nor how you come to know what you do know but will you swear that this is true that you tell me
740068 why they are only waiting for her to come to her senses to arrest her
740069 it was a just providence that killed him but mind
740070 it was in this way sir you see me now with my back
740071 well though i had her heart her father was set upon
740072 we were shut up in bhurtee the regiment of us with
740073 my way ran down a dried up watercourse which we
740074 well theres no need for me to dwell on that part of
740075 but when one gets old one has a longing for home for years ive been dreaming of the bright green fields and the hedges of england at last i determined to see them before i died i saved enough to bring me across and then i came here where the soldiers are for i know their ways and how to amuse them and so earn enough to keep me
740076 i have already heard of your meeting with mrs barclay and your mutual recognition you then as i understand followed her home and saw through the window an altercation between her husband and her in which she doubtless cast his conduct to you in his teeth your own feelings overcame you and you ran across the lawn and broke in upon them
740077 i did sir and at the sight of me he looked as i have never seen a man look before and over he went with his head on the fender but he was dead before he fell i read death on his face as plain as i can read that text over the fire the bare sight of me was like a bullet through his guilty heart
740078 then nancy fainted and i caught up the key of the door from her hand intending to unlock it and get help but as i was doing it it seemed to me better to leave it alone and get away for the thing might look black against me and any way my secret would be out if i were taken in my haste i thrust the key into my pocket and dropped my stick while i was chasing teddy who had run up the curtain when i got him into his box from which he had slipped i was off as fast as i could run
740079 well some call them that and some call them ichneumon
740080 well we may have to apply to you again if mrs barclay should prove to be in serious trouble
740081 but if not there is no object in raking up this scandal against a dead man foully as he has acted you have at least the satisfaction of knowing that for thirty years of his life his conscience bitterly reproached him for this wicked deed ah there goes major murphy on the other side of the street good by wood i want to learn if anything has happened since yesterday
740082 i suppose you have heard that all this fuss has come to nothing
740083 the inquest is just over the medical evidence showed conclusively that death was due to apoplexy you see it was quite a simple case after all
740084 come watson i dont think we shall be wanted in aldershot any more
740085 if the husbands name was james and the other was henry what was this talk about david
740086 that one word my dear watson should have told me the whole story had i been the ideal reasoner which you are so fond of depicting it was evidently a term of reproach
740087 yes david strayed a little occasionally you know and on one occasion in the same direction as sergeant james barclay you remember the small affair of uriah and bathsheba my biblical knowledge is a trifle rusty i fear but you will find the story in the first or second of samuel
740088 it does seem a very preposterous way of settling a dispute
740089 that some little time ago when i read you the passage in one of poes sketches in which a close reasoner follows the unspoken thought of his companion you were inclined to treat the matter as a mere tour de force of the author on my remarking that i was constantly in the habit of doing the same thing you expressed incredulity
740090 perhaps not with your tongue my dear watson but certainly with your eyebrows so when i saw you throw down your paper and enter upon a train of thought i was very happy to have the opportunity of reading it off and eventually of breaking into it as a proof that i had been in rapport with you
740091 the reasoner drew his conclusions from the actions of the man whom he observed if i remember right he stumbled over a heap of stones looked up at the stars and so on but i have been seated quietly in my chair and what clews can i have given you
740092 you do yourself an injustice the features are given to man as the means by which he shall express his emotions and yours are faithful servants
740093 do you mean to say that you read my train of thoughts from my features
740094 your features and especially your eyes perhaps you cannot yourself recall how your reverie commenced
740095 then i will tell you after throwing down your paper which was the action which drew my attention to you you sat for half a minute with a vacant expression then your eyes fixed themselves upon your newly framed picture of general gordon and i saw by the alteration in your face that a train of thought had been started but it did not lead very far your eyes turned across to the unframed portrait of henry ward beecher which stands upon the top of your books you then glanced up at the wall and of course your meaning was obvious you were thinking that if the portrait were framed it would just cover that bare space and correspond with gordons picture over there
740096 so far i could hardly have gone astray but now your thoughts went back to beecher and you looked hard across as if you were studying the character in his features then your eyes ceased to pucker but you continued to look across and your face was thoughtful you were recalling the incidents of beechers career i was well aware that you could not do this without thinking of the mission which he undertook on behalf of the north at the time of the civil war for i remember you expressing your passionate indignation at the way in which he was received by the more turbulent of our people you felt so strongly about it that i knew you could not think of beecher without thinking of that also when a moment later i saw your eyes wander away from the picture i suspected that your mind had now turned to the civil war and when i observed that your lips set your eyes sparkled and your hands clinched i was positive that you were indeed thinking of the gallantry which was shown by both sides in that desperate struggle but then again your face grew sadder you shook your head you were dwelling upon the sadness and horror and useless waste of life your hand stole towards your own old wound and a smile quivered on your lips which showed me that the ridiculous side of this method of settling international questions had forced itself upon your mind at this point i agreed with you that it was preposterous and was glad to find that all my deductions had been correct
740097 and now that you have explained it i confess that i am as amazed as before
740098 it was very superficial my dear watson i assure you i should not have intruded it upon your attention had you not shown some incredulity the other day but the evening has brought a breeze with it what do you say to a ramble through london
740099 not been long in practice but has had a good deal to do come to consult us i fancy lucky we came back
740100 i am glad to see that you have only been waiting a very few minutes
740101 no it was the candle on the side table that told me pray resume your seat and let me know how i can serve you
740102 are you not the author of a monograph upon obscure nervous lesions
740103 i so seldom hear of the work that i thought it was quite dead
740104 my publishers gave me a most discouraging account of its sale you are yourself i presume a medical man
740105 my own hobby has always been nervous disease i should wish to make it an absolute specialty but of course a man must take what he can get at first this however is beside the question mr sherlock holmes and i quite appreciate how valuable your time is the fact is that a very singular train of events has occurred recently at my house in brook street and to night they came to such a head that i felt it was quite impossible for me to wait another hour before asking for your advice and assistance
740106 pray let me have a detailed account of what the circumstances are which have disturbed you
740107 i am compelled to begin with to say something of my
740108 but the one great stumbling block lay in my want of
740109 this was a visit from a gentleman of the name of
740110 you are the same percy trevelyan who has had so
740111 i could not help smiling at the abruptness of the
740112 quite right thats all right but i was bound to
740113 oh its for my sake not for yours he cried
740114 ill tell you ill take the house furnish it pay
740115 i may say with confidence that he never had occasion
740116 so much mr holmes for my past history and my
740117 some weeks ago mr blessington came down to me in as
740118 what happened was this two days ago i received the
740119 you will excuse my coming in doctor said he to
740120 not for the world he cried with a gesture of
740121 to this of course i assented and the young man
740122 my first feeling as i have just said was one of
740123 of course my first act was to run into the
740124 well i never thought that i should see anything more
740125 i feel that i owe you a great many apologies for my
740126 i confess that i was very much surprised at it
740127 and i said the son seeing my father pass the
740128 for half an hour or so i discussed that old
740129 i passed over the grossness of his language as he
740130 mr blessington seemed more excited over the matter than i should have thought possible though of course it was enough to disturb anybodys peace of mind he actually sat crying in an arm chair and i could hardly get him to speak coherently it was his suggestion that i should come round to you and of course i at once saw the propriety of it for certainly the incident is a very singular one though he appears to completely overtake its importance if you would only come back with me in my brougham you would at least be able to soothe him though i can hardly hope that you will be able to explain this remarkable occurrence
740131 i give you my word that ill fire if you come any nearer
740132 but those other gentlemen are they what they pretend to be
740133 you can come up and i am sorry if my precautions have annoyed you
740134 i am sure i am very much obliged to you for coming round no one ever needed your advice more than i do i suppose that dr trevelyan has told you of this most unwarrantable intrusion into my rooms
740135 who are these tow men mr blessington and why do they wish to molest you
740136 of course it is hard to say that you can hardly expect me to answer that mr holmes
740137 come in here if you please just have the kindness to step in here
740138 i have never been a very rich man mr holmes never made but one investment in my life as dr trevelyan would tell you but i dont believe in bankers i would never trust a banker mr holmes between ourselves what little i have is in that box so you can understand what it means to me when unknown people force themselves into my rooms
740139 i cannot possibly advise you if you try to deceive me
740140 my advice to your sir is to speak the truth
740141 sorry to bring you out on such a fools errand watson
740142 it is an interesting case too at the bottom of it
740143 well it is quite evident that there are two men more perhaps but at least two who are determined for some reason to get at this fellow blessington i have no doubt in my mind that both on the first and on the second occasion that young man penetrated to blessingtons room while his confederate by an ingenious device kept the doctor from interfering
740144 a fraudulent imitation watson though i should hardly dare to hint as much to our specialist it is a very easy complaint to imitate i have done it myself
740145 by the purest chance blessington was out on each occasion their reason for choosing so unusual an hour for a consultation was obviously to insure that there should be no other patient in the waiting room it just happened however that this hour coincided with blessingtons constitutional which seems to show that they were not very well acquainted with his daily routine of course if they had been merely after plunder they would at least have made some attempt to search for it besides i can read in a mans eye when it is his own skin that he is frightened for it is inconceivable that this fellow could have made two such vindictive enemies as these appear to be without knowing of it i hold it therefore to be certain that he does know who these men are and that for reasons of his own he suppresses it it is just possible that to morrow may find him in a more communicative mood
740146 grotesquely improbably no doubt but still just conceivable might the whole story of the cataleptic russian and his son be a concoction of dr trevelyans who has for his own purposes been in blessingtons rooms
740147 it was one of the first solutions which occurred to me but i was soon able to corroborate the doctors tale this young man has left prints upon the stair carpet which made it quite superfluous for me to ask to see those which he had made in the room when i tell you that his shoes were square toed instead of being pointed like blessingtons and were quite an inch and a third longer than the doctors you will acknowledge that there can be no doubt as to his individuality but we may sleep on it now for i shall be surprised if we do not hear something further from brook street in the morning
740148 look at this a sheet from a note book with for gods sake come at once p t scrawled upon it in pencil our friend the doctor was hard put to it when he wrote this come along my dear fellow for its an urgent call
740149 the police are already upstairs it has shaken me most dreadfully
740150 he has a cup of tea taken in to him early every morning when the maid entered about seven there the unfortunate fellow was hanging in the middle of the room he had tied his cord to the hook on which the heavy lamp used to hang and he had jumped off from the top of the very box that he showed us yesterday
740151 i should like to go upstairs and look into the matter
740152 you wont think me an intruder i am sure have you heard of the events which led up to this affair
740153 as far as i can see the man has been driven out of his senses by fright the bed has been well slept in you see theres his impression deep enough its about five in the morning you know that suicides are most common that would be about his time for hanging himself it seems to have been a very deliberate affair
740154 i should say that he has been dead about three hours judging by the rigidity of the muscles
740155 found a screw driver and some screws on the wash hand stand seems to have smoked heavily during the night too here are four cigar ends that i picked out of the fireplace
740156 oh this is an havana and these others are cigars of the peculiar sort which are imported by the dutch from their east indian colonies they are usually wrapped in straw you know and are thinner for their length than any other brand
740157 two of these have been smoked from a holder and two without
740158 two have been cut by a not very sharp knife and two have had the ends bitten off by a set of excellent teeth this is no suicide mr lanner it is a very deeply planned and cold blooded murder
740159 why should any one murder a man in so clumsy a fashion as by hanging him
740160 i saw their traces excuse me a moment and i may be able to give you some further information about it
740161 he was morbidly nervous of fire and always kept this beside him so that he might escape by the window in case the stairs were burning
740162 yes the actual facts are very plain and i shall be surprised if by the afternoon i cannot give you the reasons for them as well i will take this photograph of blessington which i see upon the mantelpiece as it may help me in my inquiries
740163 oh there can be no doubt as to the sequence of events
740164 there were three of them in it the young man the old man and a third to whose identity i have no clue the first two i need hardly remark are the same who masqueraded as the russian count and his son so we can give a very full description of them they were admitted by a confederate inside the house if i might offer you a word of advice inspector it would be to arrest the page who as i understand has only recently come into your service doctor
740165 the maid and the cook have just been searching for him
740166 he has played a not unimportant part in this drama
740167 having secured him it is evident to me that a
740168 well it ended by their taking blessington and hanging him the matter was so prearranged that it is my belief that they brought with them some sort of block or pulley which might serve as a gallows that screw driver and those screws were as i conceive for fixing it up seeing the hook however they naturally saved themselves the trouble having finished their work they made off and the door was barred behind them by their confederate
740169 both the inspector and the doctor will meet me here at that hour and i hope by that time to have cleared up any little obscurity which the case may still present
740170 well at least i have got their identity this so called blessington is as i expected well known at headquarters and so are his assailants their names are biddle hayward and moffat
740171 five men were in it these four and a fifth called cartwright tobin the care taker was murdered and the thieves got away with seven thousand pounds this was in 1875 they were all five arrested but the evidence against them was by no means conclusive this blessington or sutton who was the worst of the gang turned informer on his evidence cartwright was hanged and the other three got fifteen years apiece when they got out the other day which was some years before their full term they set themselves as you perceive to hunt down the traitor and to avenge the death of their comrade upon him twice they tried to get at him and failed a third time you see it came off is there anything further which i can explain dr trevelyan
740172 no doubt the day on which he was perturbed was the day when he had seen of their release in the newspapers
740173 quite so his talk about a burglary was the merest blind
740174 well my dear sir knowing the vindictive character of his old associates he was trying to hide his own identity from everybody as long as he could his secret was a shameful one and he could not bring himself to divulge it however wretch as he was he was still living under the shield of british law and i have no doubt inspector that you will see that though that shield may fail to guard the sword of justice is still there to avenge
740175 from all that you have told me it seems obvious that your faculty of observation and your peculiar facility for deduction are due to your own systematic training
740176 my ancestors were country squires who appear to have led much the same life as is natural to their class but none the less my turn that way is in my veins and may have come with my grandmother who was the sister of vernet the french artist art in the blood is liable to take the strangest forms
740177 because my brother mycroft possesses it in a larger degree than i do
740178 i cannot agree with those who rank modesty among the virtues to the logician all things should be seen exactly as they are and to underestimate ones self is as much a departure from truth as to exaggerate ones own powers when i say therefore that mycroft has better powers of observation than i you may take it that i am speaking the exact and literal truth
740179 oh he is very well known in his own circle
740180 the diogenes club is the queerest club in london and mycroft one of the queerest men hes always there from quarter to five to twenty to eight its six now so if you care for a stroll this beautiful evening i shall be very happy to introduce you to two curiosities
740181 why it is that mycroft does not use his powers for detective work he is incapable of it
740182 i said that he was my superior in observation and deduction if the art of the detective began and ended in reasoning from an arm chair my brother would be the greatest criminal agent that ever lived but he has no ambition and no energy he will not even go out of his way to verify his own solution and would rather be considered wrong than take the trouble to prove himself right again and again i have taken a problem to him and have received an explanation which has afterwards proved to be the correct one and yet he was absolutely incapable of working out the practical points which must be gone into before a case could be laid before a judge or jury
740183 by no means what is to me a means of livelihood is to him the merest hobby of a dilettante he has an extraordinary faculty for figures and audits the books in some of the government departments mycroft lodges in pall mall and he walks round the corner into whitehall every morning and back every evening from years end to years end he takes no other exercise and is seen nowhere else except only in the diogenes club which is just opposite his rooms
740184 very likely not there are many men in london you know who some from shyness some from misanthropy have no wish for the company of their fellows yet they are not averse to comfortable chairs and the latest periodicals it is for the convenience of these that the diogenes club was started and it now contains the most unsociable and unclubable men in town no member is permitted to take the least notice of any other one save in the strangers room no talking is under any circumstances allowed and three offences if brought to the notice of the committee render the talker liable to expulsion my brother was one of the founders and i have myself found it a very soothing atmosphere
740185 i hear of sherlock everywhere since you became his chronicler by the way sherlock i expected to see you round last week to consult me over that manor house case i thought you might be a little out of your depth
740186 to any one who wishes to study mankind this is the spot
740187 look at the magnificent types look at these two men who are coming towards us for example
740188 it is not hard to say that a man with that bearing expression of authority and sunbaked skin is a soldier is more than a private and is not long from india
740189 that he has not left the service long is shown by his still wearing is ammunition boots as they are called
740190 he had not the cavalry stride yet he wore his hat on one side as is shown by the lighter skin of that side of his brow his weight is against his being a sapper he is in the artillery
740191 then of course his complete mourning shows that he has lost some one very dear the fact that he is doing his own shopping looks as though it were his wife he has been buying things for children you perceive there is a rattle which shows that one of them is very young the wife probably died in childbed the fact that he has a picture book under his arm shows that there is another child to be thought of
740192 he lodges on the floor above me and i have some slight acquaintance with him which led him to come to me in his perplexity mr melas is a greek by extraction as i understand and he is a remarkable linguist he earns his living partly as interpreter in the law courts and partly by acting as guide to any wealthy orientals who may visit the northumberland avenue hotels i think i will leave him to tell his very remarkable experience in his own fashion
740193 i do not believe that the police credit me on my word i do not
740194 just because they have never heard of it before they think that such a thing cannot be but i know that i shall never be easy in my mind until i know what has become of my poor man with the sticking plaster upon his face
740195 i say into the cab but i soon became doubtful as to
740196 i am sorry to cut off your view mr melas said
740197 as you can imagine i was utterly taken aback by such
740198 it is somewhat of a liberty no doubt said he
740199 his words were quiet but he had a rasping way of
740200 for nearly two hours we drove without my having the
740201 there was a colored gas lamp inside which was turned
740202 well done well done no ill will mr melas i
740203 only to ask a few questions of a greek gentleman who
740204 as he spoke he opened a door and showed the way into
740205 have you the slate harold cried the older man as
740206 on no condition i asked at the bidding of our
740207 only if i see her married in my presence by a greek
740208 you can do no good by this obstinacy who are you
740209 your fate will be upon your own head how long have
740210 it shall not go to villains they are starving me
740211 you shall go free if you sign what house is this
740212 you are not doing her any service what is your
740213 you shall see her if you sign where are you from
740214 these last words were in greek and at the same
740215 there are five sovereigns here said he walking up to me which will i hope be a sufficient fee but remember he added tapping me lightly on the chest and giggling if you speak to a human soul about this one human soul mind well may god have mercy upon your soul
740216 i cannot tell you the loathing and horror with which
740217 we shall know if you speak of this said he we
740218 i was hurried through the hall and into the vehicle
740219 he opened the door as he spoke and i had hardly time
740220 the carriage which had brought me was already out of
740221 can you tell me what place this is i asked
740222 if you walk on a mile or so to clapham junction
740223 so that was the end of my adventure mr holmes i do not know where i was nor whom i spoke with nor anything save what i have told you but i know that there is foul play going on and i want to help that unhappy man if i can i told the whole story to mr mycroft holmes next morning and subsequently to the police
740224 anybody supplying any information to the whereabouts of a greek gentleman named paul kratides from athens who is unable to speak english will be rewarded a similar reward paid to any one giving information about a greek lady whose first name is sophy x 2473 that was in all the dailies no answer
740225 a wire to the head of the athens police then
740226 well you take the case up by all means and let me know if you do any good
740227 ill let you know and mr melas also in the meantime mr melas i should certainly be on my guard if i were you for of course they must know through these advertisements that you have betrayed them
740228 our evening has been by no means wasted some of my most interesting cases have come to me in this way through mycroft the problem which we have just listened to although it can admit of but one explanation has still some distinguishing features
740229 well knowing as much as we do it will be singular indeed if we fail to discover the rest you must yourself have formed some theory which will explain the facts to which we have listened
740230 it seemed to me to be obvious that this greek girl had been carried off by the young englishman named harold latimer
740231 this young man could not talk a word of greek the lady could talk english fairly well inference that she had been in england some little time but he had not been in greece
740232 well then we will presume that she had come on a visit to england and that this harold had persuaded her to fly with him
740233 then the brother for that i fancy must be the relationship comes over from greece to interfere he imprudently puts himself into the power of the young man and his older associate they seize him and use violence towards him in order to make him sign some papers to make over the girls fortune of which he may be trustee to them this he refuses to do in order to negotiate with him they have to get an interpreter and they pitch upon this mr melas having used some other one before the girl is not told of the arrival of her brother and finds it out by the merest accident
740234 i really fancy that you are not far from the truth you see that we hold all the cards and we have only to fear some sudden act of violence on their part if they give us time we must have them
740235 well if our conjecture is correct and the girls name is or was sophy kratides we should have no difficulty in tracing her that must be our main hope for the brother is of course a complete stranger it is clear that some time has elapsed since this harold established these relations with the girl some weeks at any rate since the brother in greece has had time to hear of it and come across if they have been living in the same place during this time it is probable that we shall have some answer to mycrofts advertisement
740236 you dont expect such energy from me do you sherlock but somehow this case attracts me
740237 yes it came within a few minutes of your leaving
740238 do you not think that we might drive to him now sherlock and learn these particulars
740239 my dear mycroft the brothers life is more valuable than the sisters story i think we should call at scotland yard for inspector gregson and go straight out to beckenham we know that a man is being done to death and every hour may be vital
740240 send the boy for a four wheeler and we shall be off at once
740241 i should say from what we have heard that we are dealing with a particularly dangerous gang
740242 i only know that he drove away with the gentleman in a carriage
740243 oh nor sir he was a little gentleman with glasses thin in the face but very pleasant in his ways for he was laughing al the time that he was talking
740244 these men have got hold of melas again he is a man of no physical courage as they are well aware from their experience the other night this villain was able to terrorize him the instant that he got into his presence no doubt they want his professional services but having used him they may be inclined to punish him for what they will regard as his treachery
740245 a carriage heavily loaded with luggage has passed out during the last hour
740246 i saw the wheel tracks in the light of the gate lamp but where does the luggage come in
740247 you may have observed the same wheel tracks going the other way but the outward bound ones were very much deeper so much so that we can say for a certainty that there was a very considerable weight on the carriage
740248 it will not be an easy door to force but we will try if we cannot make some one hear us
740249 it is a mercy that you are on the side of the force and not against it mr holmes
740250 well i think that under the circumstances we may enter without an invitation
740251 where is a candle i doubt if we could strike a match in that atmosphere hold the light at the door and we shall get them out mycroft now
740252 if this paper remains blue all is well if it turns red it means a mans life
740253 i will be at your service in an instant watson you will find tobacco in the persian slipper
740254 youve got something better i fancy you are the stormy petrel of crime watson what is it
740255 no a womans and a woman of rare character you see at the commencement of an investigation it is something to know that your client is in close contact with some one who for good or evil has an exceptional nature my interest is already awakened in the case if you are ready we will start at once for woking and see this diplomatist who is in such evil case and the lady to whom he dictates his letters
740256 percy has been inquiring for you all morning ah poor old chap he clings to any straw his father and his mother asked me to see you for the mere mention of the subject is very painful to them
740257 i perceive that you are not yourself a member of the family
740258 of course you saw the j h monogram on my locket
740259 for a moment i thought you had done something clever joseph harrison is my name and as percy is to marry my sister annie i shall at least be a relation by marriage you will find my sister in his room for she has nursed him hand and foot this two months back perhaps wed better go in at once for i know how impatient he is
740260 i should never have known you under that moustache and i dare say you would not be prepared to swear to me this i presume is your celebrated friend mr sherlock holmes
740261 i was as watson may have told you in the foreign
740262 nearly ten weeks ago to be more accurate on the 23d
740263 this said he taking a gray roll of paper from his bureau is the original of that secret treaty between england and italy of which i regret to say some rumors have already got into the public press it is of enormous importance that nothing further should leak out the french or the russian embassy would pay an immense sum to learn the contents of these papers they should not leave my bureau were it not that it is absolutely necessary to have them copied you have a desk in your office
740264 then take the treaty and lock it up there i shall
740265 my uncles voice is always remarkably low i hardly spoke at all
740266 i did exactly what he indicated and waited until the
740267 when i came to examine the treaty i saw at once that
740268 to my surprise it was a woman who answered the
740269 i wrote two more articles and then feeling more drowsy than ever i rose and walked up and down the room to stretch my legs my coffee had not yet come and i wondered what was the cause of the delay could be opening the door i started down the corridor to find out there was a straight passage dimly lighted which led from the room in which i had been working and was the only exit from it it ended in a curving staircase with the commissionnaires lodge in the passage at the bottom half way down this staircase is a small landing with another passage running into it at right angles this second one leads by means of a second small stair to a side door used by servants and also as a short cut by clerks when coming from charles street here is a rough chart of the place
740270 it is of the utmost importance that you should notice
740271 i came down to see if my coffee was ready
740272 i was boiling the kettle when i fell asleep sir
740273 if you was here sir then who rang the bell he
740274 its the bell of the room you were working in
740275 a cold hand seemed to close round my heart some one then was in that room where my precious treaty lay upon the table i ran frantically up the stair and along the passage there was no one in the corridors mr holmes there was no one in the room all was exactly as i left it save only that the papers which had been committed to my care had been taken from the desk on which they lay the copy was there and the original was gone
740276 i recognized in an instant that the thief must have come up the stairs from the side door of course i must have met him if he had come the other way
740277 you were satisfied that he could not have been concealed in the room all the time or in the corridor which you have just described as dimly lighted
740278 it is absolutely impossible a rat could not conceal himself either in the room or the corridor there is no cover at all
740279 the commissionnaire seeing by my pale face that something was to be feared had followed me upstairs now we both rushed along the corridor and down the steep steps which led to charles street the door at the bottom was closed but unlocked we flung it open and rushed out i can distinctly remember that as we did so there came three chines from a neighboring clock it was quarter to ten
740280 the night was very dark and a thin warm rain was
740281 i have been standing here for a quarter of an hour
740282 then it must be the other way that the thief took
740283 but i was not satisfied and the attempts which he
740284 i dont know sir i noticed her pass but i had no
740285 but i was after him in an instant and caught him by
740286 nothing was to be lost by following his advice with
740287 then we returned to the office and searched the stairs and the passage without result the corridor which led to the room was laid down with a kind of creamy linoleum which shows an impression very easily we examined it very carefully but found no outline of any footmark
740288 how is it then that the woman who came into the room about nine left no traces with her muddy boots
740289 i am glad you raised the point it occurred to me at the time the charwomen are in the habit of taking off their boots at the commissionnaires office and putting on list slippers
740290 we examined the room also there is no possibility of a secret door and the windows are quite thirty feet from the ground both of them were fastened on the inside the carpet prevents any possibility of a trap door and the ceiling is of the ordinary whitewashed kind i will pledge my life that whoever stole my papers could only have come through the door
740291 they use none there is a stove the bell rope hangs from the wire just to the right of my desk whoever rang it must have come right up to the desk to do it but why should any criminal wish to ring the bell it is a most insoluble mystery
740292 ah a scent of tobacco would have been worth a great deal to us in such an investigation
740293 i never smoke myself so i think i should have
740294 the alarm had reached scotland yard by this time and
740295 about ten minutes later a knock came at the door and
740296 why if it isnt mr phelps of the office she
740297 come come who did you think we were when you ran
740298 i thought you were the brokers said she we have
740299 it was in vain that she protested and resisted a
740300 then for the first time the horror of my situation
740301 you can imagine the state of things here when they were roused from their beds by the doctors ringing and found me in this condition poor annie here and my mother were broken hearted dr ferrier had just heard enough from the detective at the station to be able to give an idea of what had happened and his story did not mend matters it was evident to all that i was in for a long illness so joseph was bundled out of this cheery bedroom and it was turned into a sick room for me here i have lain mr holmes for over nine weeks unconscious and raving with brain fever if it had not been for miss harrison here and for the doctors care i should not be speaking to you now she has nursed me by day and a hired nurse has looked after me by night for in my mad fits i was capable of anything slowly my reason has cleared but it is only during the last three days that my memory has quite returned sometimes i wish that it never had the first thing that i did was to wire to mr forbes who had the case in hand he came out and assures me that though everything has been done no trace of a clue has been discovered the commissionnaire and his wife have been examined in every way without any light being thrown upon the matter the suspicions of the police then rested upon young gorot who as you may remember stayed over time in the office that night his remaining behind and is french name were really the only two points which could suggest suspicion but as a matter of fact i did not begin work until he had gone and his people are of huguenot extraction but as english in sympathy and tradition as you and i are nothing was found to implicate him in any way and there the matter dropped i turn to you mr holmes as absolutely my last hope if you fail me then my honor as well as my position are forever forfeited
740302 that you have really left me very few questions to ask there is one of the very utmost importance however did you tell any one that you had this special task to perform
740303 no i had not been back to woking between getting the order and executing the commission
740304 and none of your people had by chance been to see you
740305 did any of them know their way about in the office
740306 oh yes all of them had been shown over it
740307 still of course if you said nothing to any one about the treaty these inquiries are irrelevant
740308 thank you i have no doubt i can get details from forbes the authorities are excellent at amassing facts though they do not always use them to advantage what a lovely thing a rose is
740309 there is nothing in which deduction is so necessary as in religion
740310 do you see any prospect of solving this mystery mr holmes
740311 well it would be absurd to deny that the case is a very abstruse and complicated one but i can promise you that i will look into the matter and let you know any points which may strike me
740312 you have furnished me with seven but of course i must test them before i can pronounce upon their value
740313 i think watson we cannot do better do not allow yourself to indulge in false hopes mr phelps the affair is a very tangled one
740314 i shall be in a fever until i see you again
740315 well ill come out be the same train to morrow though its more than likely that my report will be a negative one
740316 it gives me fresh life to know that something is being done by the way i have had a letter from lord holdhurst
740317 he was cold but not harsh i dare say my severe illness prevented him from being that he repeated that the matter was of the utmost importance and added that no steps would be taken about my future by which he means of course my dismissal until my health was restored and i had an opportunity of repairing my misfortune
740318 come watson for we have a goody days work before us in town
740319 its a very cheery thing to come into london by any of these lines which run high and allow you to look down upon the houses like this
740320 look at those big isolated clumps of building rising up above the slates like brick islands in a lead colored sea
740321 light houses my boy beacons of the future capsules with hundreds of bright little seeds in each out of which will spring the wise better england of the future i suppose that man phelps does not drink
740322 nor should i but we are bound to take every possibility into account the poor devil has certainly got himself into very deep water and its a question whether we shall ever be able to get him ashore what did you think of miss harrison
740323 yes but she is a good sort or i am mistaken she and her brother are the only children of an iron master somewhere up northumberland way he got engaged to her when traveling last winter and she came down to be introduced to his people with her brother as escort then came the smash and she stayed on to nurse her lover while brother joseph finding himself pretty snug stayed on too ive been making a few independent inquiries you see but to day must be a day of inquiries
740324 oh if you find your own cases more interesting than
740325 i was going to say that my practice could get along very well for a day or two since it is the slackest time in the year
740326 well we have several but we can only test their value by further inquiry the most difficult crime to track is the one which is purposeless now this is not purposeless who is it who profits by it there is the french ambassador there is the russian there is who ever might sell it to either of these and there is lord holdhurst
740327 well it is just conceivable that a statesman might find himself in a position where he was not sorry to have such a document accidentally destroyed
740328 not a statesman wit the honorable record of lord holdhurst
740329 it is a possibility and we cannot afford to disregard it we shall see the noble lord to day and find out if he can tell us anything meanwhile i have already set inquiries on foot
740330 yes i sent wires from woking station to every evening paper in london this advertisement will appear in each of them
740331 l10 reward the number of the cab which dropped a fare at or about the door of the foreign office in charles street at quarter to ten in the evening of may 23d apply 221 b baker street
740332 you are confident that the thief came in a cab
740333 if not there is no harm done but if mr phelps is correct in stating that there is no hiding place either in the room or the corridors then the person must have come from outside if he came from outside on so wet a night and yet left no trace of damp upon the linoleum which was examined within a few minutes of his passing then it is exceeding probably that he came in a cab yes i think that we may safely deduce a cab
740334 that is one of the clues of which i spoke it may lead us to something and then of course there is the bell which is the most distinctive feature of the case why should the bell ring was it the thief who did it out of bravado or was it some one who was with the thief who did it in order to prevent the crime or was it an accident or was it
740335 you are ready enough to use all the information that the police can lay at your disposal and then you try to finish the case yourself and bring discredit on them
740336 out of my last fifty three cases my name has only appeared in four and the police have had all the credit in forty nine i dont blame you for not knowing this for you are young and inexperienced but if you wish to get on in your new duties you will work with me and not against me
740337 ive certainly had no credit from the case so far
740338 tangey the commissionnaire has been shadowed he left the guards with a good character and we can find nothing against him his wife is a bad lot though i fancy she knows more about this than appears
740339 we have set one of our women on to her mrs tangey drinks and our woman has been with her twice when she was well on but she could get nothing out of her
740340 i understand that they have had brokers in the house
740341 that was all right his pension was due they have not shown any sign of being in funds
740342 what explanation did she give of having answered the bell when mr phelps rang for the coffee
740343 she said that he husband was very tired and she wished to relieve him
740344 well certainly that would agree with his being found a little later asleep in his chair there is nothing against them then but the womans character did you ask her why she hurried away that night her haste attracted the attention of the police constable
740345 she was later than usual and wanted to get home
740346 did you point out to her that you and mr phelps who started at least twenty minutes after he got home before her
740347 she explains that by the difference between a bus and a hansom
740348 did she make it clear why on reaching her house she ran into the back kitchen
740349 because she had the money there with which to pay off the brokers
740350 she has at least an answer for everything did you ask her whether in leaving she met any one or saw any one loitering about charles street
740351 well you seem to have cross examined her pretty thoroughly what else have you done
740352 the clerk gorot has been shadowed all these nine weeks but without result we can show nothing against him
740353 well we have nothing else to go upon no evidence of any kind
740354 have you formed a theory about how that bell rang
740355 well i must confess that it beats me it was a cool hand whoever it was to go and give the alarm like that
740356 yes it was queer thing to do many thanks to you for what you have told me if i can put the man into your hands you shall hear from me come along watson
740357 we are now going to interview lord holdhurst the cabinet minister and future premier of england
740358 and of course i cannot pretend to be ignorant of the object of your visit there has only been once occurrence in these offices which could call for your attention in whose interest are you acting may i ask
740359 ah my unfortunate nephew you can understand that our kinship makes it the more impossible for me to screen him in any way i fear that the incident must have a very prejudicial effect upon his career
740360 i had one or two questions which i wished to ask you lord holdhurst
740361 i shall be happy to give you any information in my power
740362 was it in this room that you gave your instructions as to the copying of the document
740363 did you ever mention to any one that it was your intention to give any one the treaty to be copied
740364 well since you never said so and mr phelps never said so and nobody else knew anything of the matter then the thiefs presence in the room was purely accidental he saw his chance and he took it
740365 there is another very important point which i wish to discuss with you
740366 you feared as i understand that very grave results might follow from the details of this treaty becoming known
740367 if the treaty had reached let us say the french or russian foreign office you would expect to hear of it
740368 since nearly ten weeks have elapsed then and nothing has been heard it is not unfair to suppose that for some reason the treaty has not reached them
740369 we can hardly suppose mr holmes that the thief took the treaty in order to frame it and hang it up
740370 if he waits a little longer he will get no price at all the treaty will cease to be secret in a few months
740371 and now lord holdhurst we have already taken up too much of your valuable time and we shall wish you good day
740372 every success to your investigation be the criminal who it may
740373 but he has a struggle to keep up his position he is far from rich and has many calls you noticed of course that his boots had been resoled now watson i wont detain you from your legitimate work any longer i shall do nothing more to day unless i have an answer to my cab advertisement but i should be extremely obliged to you if you would come down with me to woking to morrow by the same train which we took yesterday
740374 i have seen forbes and i have seen your uncle and i have set one or two trains of inquiry upon foot which may lead to something
740375 if we keep our courage and our patience the truth must come out
740376 we have more to tell you than you have for us
740377 yes we have had an adventure during the night and one which might have proved to be a serious one
740378 that i begin to believe that i am the unconscious centre of some monstrous conspiracy and that my life is aimed at as well as my honor
740379 it sounds incredible for i have not as far as i know an enemy in the world yet from last nights experience i can come to no other conclusion
740380 you must know that last night was the very first
740381 there was a pause then for about ten minutes as if the person were waiting to see whether the noise had awakened me then i heard a gentle creaking as the window was very slowly opened i could stand it no longer for my nerves are not what they used to be i sprang out of bed and flung open the shutters a man was crouching at the window i could see little of him for he was gone like a flash he was wrapped in some sort of cloak which came across the lower part of his face one thing only i am sure of and that is that he had some weapon in his hand it looked to me like a long knife i distinctly saw the gleam of it as he turned to run
740382 i should have followed him through the open window if i had been stronger as it was i rang the bell and roused the house it took me some little time for the bell rings in the kitchen and the servants all sleep upstairs i shouted however and that brought joseph down and he roused the others joseph and the groom found marks on the bed outside the window but the weather has been so dry lately that they found it hopeless to follow the trail across the grass theres a place however on the wooden fence which skirts the road which shows signs they tell me as if some one had got over and had snapped the top of the rail in doing so i have said nothing to the local police yet for i thought i had best have your opinion first
740383 do you think you could walk round the house with me
740384 oh yes i should like a little sunshine joseph will come too
740385 i think i must ask you to remain sitting exactly where you are
740386 i dont think any one could make much of this
740387 let us go round the house and see why this particular room was chose by the burglar i should have thought those larger windows of the drawing room and dining room would have had more attractions for him
740388 ah yes of course there is a door here which he might have attempted what is it for
740389 it is the side entrance for trades people of course it is locked at night
740390 do you keep plate in the house or anything to attract burglars
740391 you found some place i understand where the fellow scaled the fence let us have a look at that
740392 do you think that was done last night it looks rather old does it not
740393 there are no marks of any one jumping down upon the other side no i fancy we shall get no help here let us go back to the bedroom and talk the matter over
740394 you must stay where you are all day let nothing prevent you from staying where you are all day it is of the utmost importance
740395 when you go to bed lock the door of this room on the outside and keep the key promise to do this
740396 it is for his sake you can serve him quick promise
740397 no thank you joseph i have a slight headache and this room is deliciously cool and soothing
740398 well in investigating this minor affair we must not lose sight of our main inquiry it would be a very great help to me if you would come up to london with us
740399 well as soon as you conveniently can say in an hour
740400 i feel quite strong enough if i can really be of any help
740401 perhaps you would like me the stay there to night
740402 then if my friend of the night comes to revisit me he will find the bird flown we are all in your hands mr holmes and you must tell us exactly what you would like done perhaps you would prefer that joseph came wit us so as to look after me
740403 oh no my friend watson is a medical man you know and hell look after you well have our lunch here if you will permit us and then we shall al three set off for town together
740404 there are one or two small points which i should desire to clear up before i go
740405 your absence mr phelps will in some ways rather assist me watson when you reach london you would oblige me by driving at once to baker street with our friend here and remaining with him until i see you again it is fortunate that you are old school fellows as you must have much to talk over mr phelps can have the spare bedroom to night and i will be with you in time for breakfast for there is a train which will take me into waterloo at eight
740406 we can do that to morrow i think that just at present i can be of more immediate use here
740407 you might tell them at briarbrae that i hope to be back to morrow night
740408 i suppose he wants to find out some clue as to the burglary last night if a burglar it was for myself i dont believe it was an ordinary thief
740409 upon my word you may put it down to my weak nerves or not but i believe there is some deep political intrigue going on around me and that for some reason that passes my understanding my life is aimed at by the conspirators it sounds high flown and absurd but consider the fats why should a thief try to break in at a bedroom window where there could be no hope of any plunder and why should he come with a long knife in his hand
740410 oh no it was a knife i saw the flash of the blade quite distinctly
740411 but why on earth should you be pursued with such animosity
740412 well if holmes takes the same view that would account for his action would it not presuming that your theory is correct if he can lay his hands upon the man who threatened you last night he will have gone a long way towards finding who took the naval treaty it is absurd to suppose that you have two enemies one of whom robs you while the other threatens your life
740413 but holmes said that he was not going to briarbrae
740414 but i never knew him do anything yet without a very good reason
740415 but he never brought light into anything quite so dark as this
740416 oh yes i have known him solve questions which presented fewer clues than yours
740417 i dont know that to my certain knowledge he has acted on behalf of three of the reigning houses of europe in very vital matters
740418 but you know him well watson he is such an inscrutable fellow that i never quite know what to make of him do you think he is hopeful do you think he expects to make a success of it
740419 on the contrary i have noticed that when he is off the trail he generally says so it is when he is on a scent and is not quite absolutely sure yet that it is the right one that he is most taciturn now my dear fellow we cant help matter by making ourselves nervous about them so let me implore you to go to bed and so be fresh for whatever may await us to morrow
740420 the clue of the matter lies probably here in town
740421 but i had hoped for so much from his return but surely his hand was not tied up like that yesterday what can be the matter
740422 tut it is only a scratch through my own clumsiness
740423 this case of yours mr phelps is certainly one of the darkest which i have ever investigated
740424 after breakfast my dear watson remember that i have breathed thirty mile of surrey air this morning i suppose that there has been no answer from my cabman advertisement well well we cannot expect to score every time
740425 her cuisine is a little limited but she has as good an idea of breakfast as a scotch woman what have you here watson
740426 good what are you going to take mr phelps curried fowl or eggs or will you help yourself
740427 i suppose that you have no objection to helping me
740428 it was too bad to spring it on you like this but watson here will tell you that i never can resist a touch of the dramatic
740429 i assure you it is just as hateful to me to fail in a case as it can be to you to blunder over a commission
740430 i have not the heart to interrupt your breakfast any further and yet i am dying to know how you got it and where it was
740431 ill tell you what i did first and how i came to do it afterwards
740432 well i waited until the road was clear it is never a very frequented one at any time i fancy and then i clambered over the fence into the grounds
740433 yes but i have a peculiar taste in these matters i
740434 the blind was not down in your room and i could see
740435 i heard her shut the door and felt quite sure that she had turned the key in the lock
740436 the night was fine but still it was a very weary vigil of course it has the sort of excitement about it that the sportsman feels when he lies beside the water course and waits for the big game it was very long though almost as long watson as when you and i waited in that deadly room when we looked into the little problem of the speckled band there was a church clock down at woking which struck the quarters and i thought more than once that it had stopped at last however about two in the morning i suddenly heard the gentle sound of a bolt being pushed back and the creaking of a key a moment later the servants door was opened and mr joseph harrison stepped out into the moonlight
740437 he was bare headed but he had a black coat thrown
740438 from where i lay i had a perfect view of the inside
740439 well he has rather more viciousness than i gave him
740440 do you tell me that during these long ten weeks of agony the stolen papers were within the very room with me all the time
740441 hum i am afraid josephs character is a rather deeper and more dangerous one than one might judge from his appearance from what i have heard from him this morning i gather that he has lost heavily in dabbling with stocks and that he is ready to do anything on earth to better his fortunes being an absolutely selfish man when a chance presented itself he did not allow either his sisters happiness or your reputation to hold his hand
740442 lay in the fact of there being too much evidence what was vital was overlaid and hidden by what was irrelevant of all the facts which were presented to us we had to pick just those which we deemed to be essential and then piece them together in their order so as to reconstruct this very remarkable chain of events i had already begun to suspect joseph from the fact that you had intended to travel home with him that night and that therefore it was a likely enough thing that he should call for you knowing the foreign office well upon his way when i heard that some one had been so anxious to get into the bedroom in which no one but joseph could have concealed anything you told us in your narrative how you had turned joseph out when you arrived with the doctor my suspicions all changed to certainties especially as the attempt was made on the first night upon which the nurse was absent showing that the intruder was well acquainted with the ways of the house
740443 the facts of the case as far as i have worked them
740444 he made his way to woking by the first train and having examined his booty and assured himself that it really was of immense value he had concealed it in what he thought was a very safe place with the intention of taking it out again in a day or two and carrying it to the french embassy or wherever he thought that a long price was to be had then came your sudden return he without a moments warning was bundled out of his room and from that time onward there were always at least two of you there to prevent him from regaining his treasure the situation to him must have been a maddening one but at last he thought he saw his chance he tried to steal in but was baffled by your wakefulness you remember that you did not take your usual draught that night
740445 i fancy that he had taken steps to make that draught efficacious and that he quite relied upon your being unconscious of course i understood that he would repeat the attempt whenever it could be done with safety your leaving the room gave him the chance he wanted i kept miss harrison in it all day so that he might not anticipate us then having given him the idea that the coast was clear i kept guard as i have described i already knew that the papers were probably in the room but i had no desire to rip up all the planking and skirting in search of them i let him take them therefore from the hiding place and so saved myself an infinity of trouble is there any other point which i can make clear
740446 why did he try the window on the first occasion
740447 in reaching the door he would have to pass seven bedrooms on the other hand he could get out on to the lawn with ease anything else
740448 that he had any murderous intention the knife was only meant as a tool
740449 i can only say for certain that mr joseph harrison is a gentleman to whose mercy i should be extremely unwilling to trust
740450 yes i have been using myself up rather too freely
740451 i have been a little pressed of late have you any objection to my closing your shutters
740452 i think that you know me well enough watson to understand that i am by no means a nervous man at the same time it is stupidity rather than courage to refuse to recognize danger when it is close upon you might i trouble you for a match
740453 and i must further beg you to be so unconventional as to allow me to leave your house presently by scrambling over your back garden wall
740454 on the contrary it is solid enough for a man to break his hand over is mrs watson in
740455 then it makes it the easier for me to propose that you should come away with me for a week to the continent
740456 aye theres the genius and the wonder of the thing
740457 the man pervades london and no one has heard of him thats what puts him on a pinnacle in the records of crime i tell you watson in all seriousness that if i could beat that man if i could free society of him i should feel that my own career had reached its summit and i should be prepared to turn to some more placid line in life between ourselves the recent cases in which i have been of assistance to the royal family of scandinavia and to the french republic have left me in such a position that i could continue to live in the quiet fashion which is most congenial to me and to concentrate my attention upon my chemical researches but i could not rest watson i could not sit quiet in my chair if i thought that such a man as professor moriarty were walking the streets of london unchallenged
740458 his career has been an extraordinary one he is a
740459 as you are aware watson there is no one who knows
740460 now if i could have done this without the knowledge
740461 the fact is that upon his entrance i had instantly
740462 on the contrary i answered i think it is fairly
740463 all that i have to say has already crossed your
740464 he clapped his hand into his pocket and i raised the
740465 you crossed my patch on the 4th of january said
740466 you must drop it mr holmes said he swaying his
740467 tut tut said he i am quite sure that a man of
740468 i am afraid said i rising that in the pleasure
740469 he rose also and looked at me in silence shaking his
740470 well well said he at last it seems a pity
740471 i can promise you the one but not the other he
740472 that was my singular interview with professor moriarty i confess that it left an unpleasant effect upon my mind his soft precise fashion of speech leaves a conviction of sincerity which a mere bully could not produce of course you will say why not take police precautions against him the reason is that i am well convinced that it is from his agents the blow will fall i have the best proofs that it would be so
740473 my dear watson professor moriarty is not a man who lets the grass grow under his feet i went out about mid day to transact some business in oxford street as i passed the corner which leads from bentinck street on to the welbeck street crossing a two horse van furiously driven whizzed round and was on me like a flash i sprang for the foot path and saved myself by the fraction of a second the van dashed round by marylebone lane and was gone in an instant i kept to the pavement after that watson but as i walked down vere street a brick came down from the roof of one of the houses and was shattered to fragments at my feet i called the police and had the place examined there were slates and bricks piled up on the roof preparatory to some repairs and they would have me believe that the wind had toppled over one of these of course i knew better but i could prove nothing i took a cab after that and reached my brothers rooms in pall mall where i spent the day now i have come round to you and on my way i was attacked by a rough with a bludgeon i knocked him down and the police have him in custody but i can tell you with the most absolute confidence that no possible connection will ever be traced between the gentleman upon whose front teeth i have barked my knuckles and the retiring mathematical coach who is i dare say working out problems upon a black board ten miles away you will not wonder watson that my first act on entering your rooms was to close your shutters and that i have been compelled to ask your permission to leave the house by some less conspicuous exit than the front door
740474 no my friend you might find me a dangerous guest i have my plans laid and all will be well matters have gone so far now that they can move without my help as far as the arrest goes though my presence is necessary for a conviction it is obvious therefore that i cannot do better than get away for the few days which remain before the police are at liberty to act it would be a great pleasure to me therefore if you could come on to the continent with me
740475 and i have an accommodating neighbor i should be glad to come
740476 oh yes it is most necessary then these are your instructions and i beg my dear watson that you will obey them to the letter for you are now playing a double handed game with me against the cleverest rogue and the most powerful syndicate of criminals in europe now listen you will despatch whatever luggage you intend to take by a trusty messenger unaddressed to victoria to night in the morning you will send for a hansom desiring your man to take neither the first nor the second which may present itself into this hansom you will jump and you will drive to the strand end of the lowther arcade handling the address to the cabman upon a slip of paper with a request that he will not throw it away have your fare ready and the instant that your cab stops dash through the arcade timing yourself to reach the other side at a quarter past nine you will find a small brougham waiting close to the curb driven by a fellow with a heavy black cloak tipped at the collar with red into this you will step and you will reach victoria in time for the continental express
740477 at the station the second first class carriage from the front will be reserved for us
740478 i have reason to think that they are hot upon our trail ah there is moriarty himself
740479 with all our precautions you see that we have cut it rather fine
740480 they set fire to our rooms last night no great harm was done
740481 they must have lost my track completely after their bludgeon man was arrested otherwise they could not have imagined that i had returned to my rooms they have evidently taken the precaution of watching you however and that is what has brought moriarty to victoria you could not have made any slip in coming
740482 it was my brother mycroft it is an advantage to get about in such a case without taking a mercenary into your confidence but we must plant what we are to do about moriarty now
740483 as this is an express and as the boat runs in connection with it i should think we have shaken him off very effectively
740484 my dear watson you evidently did not realize my meaning when i said that this man may be taken as being quite on the same intellectual plane as myself you do not imagine that if i were the pursuer i should allow myself to be baffled by so slight an obstacle why then should you think so meanly of him
740485 by no means this train stops at canterbury and there is always at least a quarter of an hours delay at the boat he will catch us there
740486 one would think that we were the criminals let us have him arrested on his arrival
740487 it would be to ruin the work of three months we should get the big fish but the smaller would dart right and left out of the net on monday we should have them all no an arrest is inadmissible
740488 well then we must make a cross country journey to newhaven and so over to dieppe moriarty will again do what i should do he will get on to paris mark down our luggage and wait for two days at the depot in the meantime we shall treat ourselves to a couple of carpet bags encourage the manufactures of the countries through which we travel and make our way at our leisure into switzerland via luxembourg and basle
740489 there are limits you see to our friends intelligence it would have been a coup de ma re had he deduced what i would deduce and acted accordingly
740490 and what would he have done had he overtaken us
740491 there cannot be the least doubt that he would have made a murderous attack upon me it is however a game at which two may play the question now is whether we should take a premature lunch here or run our chance of starving before we reach the buffet at newhaven
740492 they have secured the whole gang with the exception of him he has given them the slip of course when i had left the country there was no one to cope with him but i did think that i had put the game in their hands i think that you had better return to england watson
740493 because you will find me a dangerous companion now this mans occupation is gone he is lost if he returns to london if i read his character right he will devote his whole energies to revenging himself upon me he said as much in our short interview and i fancy that he meant it i should certainly recommend you to return to your practice
740494 i think that i may go so far as to say watson that i have not lived wholly in vain
740495 if my record were closed to night i could still survey it with equanimity the air of london is the sweeter for my presence in over a thousand cases i am not aware that i have ever used my powers upon the wrong side of late i have been tempted to look into the problems furnished by nature rather than those more superficial ones for which our artificial state of society is responsible your memoirs will draw to an end watson upon the day that i crown my career by the capture or extinction of the most dangerous and capable criminal in europe
740496 well ive a conscience sir and when i chanced to see you go into this house as i came hobbling after you i thought to myself ill just step in and see that kind gentleman and tell him that if i was a bit gruff in my manner there was not any harm meant and that i am much obliged to him for picking up my books
740497 well sir if it isnt too great a liberty i am a neighbour of yours for youll find my little bookshop at the corner of church street and very happy to see you i am sure maybe you collect yourself sir heres british birds and catullus and the holy war a bargain every one of them with five volumes you could just fill that gap on that second shelf it looks untidy does it not sir
740498 i owe you a thousand apologies i had no idea that you would be so affected
740499 is it really you can it indeed be that you are alive is it possible that you succeeded in climbing out of that awful abyss
740500 are you sure that you are really fit to discuss things i have given you a serious shock by my unnecessarily dramatic reappearance
740501 i am all right but indeed holmes i can hardly believe my eyes good heavens to think that you you of all men should be standing in my study
740502 my dear chap i am overjoyed to see you sit down and tell me how you came alive out of that dreadful chasm
740503 it is no joke when a tall man has to take a foot off his stature for several hours on end now my dear fellow in the matter of these explanations we have if i may ask for your co operation a hard and dangerous nights work in front of us perhaps it would be better if i gave you an account of the whole situation when that work is finished
740504 i am full of curiosity i should much prefer to hear now
740505 this is indeed like the old days we shall have time for a mouthful of dinner before we need go well then about that chasm i had no serious difficulty in getting out of it for the very simple reason that i never was in it
740506 no watson i never was in it my note to you was absolutely genuine i had little doubt that i had come to the end of my career when i perceived the somewhat sinister figure of the late professor moriarty standing upon the narrow pathway which led to safety i read an inexorable purpose in his grey eyes i exchanged some remarks with him therefore and obtained his courteous permission to write the short note which you afterwards received i left it with my cigarette box and my stick and i walked along the pathway moriarty still at my heels when i reached the end i stood at bay he drew no weapon but he rushed at me and threw his long arms around me he knew that his own game was up and was only anxious to revenge himself upon me we tottered together upon the brink of the fall i have some knowledge however of baritsu or the japanese system of wrestling which has more than once been very useful to me i slipped through his grip and he with a horrible scream kicked madly for a few seconds and clawed the air with both his hands but for all his efforts he could not get his balance and over he went with my face over the brink i saw him fall for a long way then he struck a rock bounded off and splashed into the water
740507 i saw with my own eyes that two went down the path and none returned
740508 it came about in this way the instant that the professor
740509 i stood up and examined the rocky wall behind me in your
740510 at last when you had all formed your inevitable and
740511 i did not take long to think about it watson again i
740512 i had only one confidant my brother mycroft i owe you many apologies my dear watson but it was all important that it should be thought i was dead and it is quite certain that you would not have written so convincing an account of my unhappy end had you not yourself thought that it was true several times during the last three years i have taken up my pen to write to you but always i feared lest your affectionate regard for me should tempt you to some indiscretion which would betray my secret for that reason i turned away from you this evening when you upset my books for i was in danger at the time and any show of surprise and emotion upon your part might have drawn attention to my identity and led to the most deplorable and irreparable results as to mycroft i had to confide in him in order to obtain the money which i needed the course of events in london did not run so well as i had hoped for the trial of the moriarty gang left two of its most dangerous members my own most vindictive enemies at liberty i travelled for two years in tibet therefore and amused myself by visiting lhassa and spending some days with the head llama you may have read of the remarkable explorations of a norwegian named sigerson but i am sure that it never occurred to you that you were receiving news of your friend i then passed through persia looked in at mecca and paid a short but interesting visit to the khalifa at khartoum the results of which i have communicated to the foreign office returning to france i spent some months in a research into the coal tar derivatives which i conducted in a laboratory at montpelier in the south of france having concluded this to my satisfaction and learning that only one of my enemies was now left in london i was about to return when my movements were hastened by the news of this very remarkable park lane mystery which not only appealed to me by its own merits but which seemed to offer some most peculiar personal opportunities i came over at once to london called in my own person at baker street threw mrs hudson into violent hysterics and found that mycroft had preserved my rooms and my papers exactly as they had always been so it was my dear watson that at two oclock to day i found myself in my old arm chair in my own old room and only wishing that i could have seen my old friend watson in the other chair which he has so often adorned
740513 work is the best antidote to sorrow my dear watson
740514 and i have a piece of work for us both to night which if we can bring it to a successful conclusion will in itself justify a mans life on this planet
740515 we have three years of the past to discuss let that suffice until half past nine when we start upon the notable adventure of the empty house
740516 exactly we are in camden house which stands opposite to our own old quarters
740517 because it commands so excellent a view of that picturesque pile might i trouble you my dear watson to draw a little nearer to the window taking every precaution not to show yourself and then to look up at our old rooms the starting point of so many of our little adventures 1 we will see if my three years of absence have entirely taken away my power to surprise you
740518 i trust that age doth not wither nor custom stale my
740519 i should be prepared to swear that it was you
740520 the credit of the execution is due to monsieur oscar meunier of grenoble who spent some days in doing the moulding it is a bust in wax the rest i arranged myself during my visit to baker street this afternoon
740521 because my dear watson i had the strongest possible reason for wishing certain people to think that i was there when i was really elsewhere
740522 by my old enemies watson by the charming society whose leader lies in the reichenbach fall you must remember that they knew and only they knew that i was still alive sooner or later they believed that i should come back to my rooms they watched them continuously and this morning they saw me arrive
740523 because i recognised their sentinel when i glanced out of my window he is a harmless enough fellow parker by name a garroter by trade and a remarkable performer upon the jews harp i cared nothing for him but i cared a great deal for the much more formidable person who was behind him the bosom friend of moriarty the man who dropped the rocks over the cliff the most cunning and dangerous criminal in london that is the man who is after me to night watson and that is the man who is quite unaware that we are after him
740524 am i such a farcical bungler watson that i should erect an obvious dummy and expect that some of the sharpest men in europe would be deceived by it we have been in this room two hours and mrs hudson has made some change in that figure eight times or once in every quarter of an hour she works it from the front so that her shadow may never be seen ah
740525 yes mr holmes i took the job myself its good to see you back in london sir
740526 i think you want a little unofficial help three undetected murders in one year wont do lestrade but you handled the molesey mystery with less than your usual thats to say you handled it fairly well
740527 journeys end in lovers meetings as the old play says i dont think i have had the pleasure of seeing you since you favoured me with those attentions as i lay on the ledge above the reichenbach fall
740528 this gentlemen is colonel sebastian moran once of her majestys indian army and the best heavy game shot that our eastern empire has ever produced i believe i am correct colonel in saying that your bag of tigers still remains unrivalled
740529 i wonder that my very simple stratagem could deceive so old a shikari
740530 it must be very familiar to you have you not tethered a young kid under a tree lain above it with your rifle and waited for the bait to bring up your tiger this empty house is my tree and you are my tiger you have possibly had other guns in reserve in case there should be several tigers or in the unlikely supposition of your own aim failing you these
740531 i confess that you had one small surprise for me
740532 i did not anticipate that you would yourself make use of this empty house and this convenient front window i had imagined you as operating from the street where my friend lestrade and his merry men were awaiting you with that exception all has gone as i expected
740533 you may or may not have just cause for arresting me
740534 but at least there can be no reason why i should submit to the gibes of this person if i am in the hands of the law let things be done in a legal way
740535 nothing further you have to say mr holmes before we go
740536 noiseless and of tremendous power i knew von herder the blind german mechanic who constructed it to the order of the late professor moriarty for years i have been aware of its existence though i have never before had an opportunity of handling it i commend it very specially to your attention lestrade and also the bullets which fit it
740537 you can trust us to look after that mr holmes
740538 what charge sir why of course the attempted murder of mr sherlock holmes
740539 not so lestrade i do not propose to appear in the matter at all to you and to you only belongs the credit of the remarkable arrest which you have effected yes lestrade i congratulate you with your usual happy mixture of cunning and audacity you have got him
740540 the man that the whole force has been seeking in vain colonel sebastian moran who shot the honourable ronald adair with an expanding bullet from an air gun through the open window of the second floor front of no 427 park lane upon the 30th of last month thats the charge lestrade and now watson if you can endure the draught from a broken window i think that half an hour in my study over a cigar may afford you some profitable amusement
740541 i went to it on my knees sir just as you told me
740542 excellent you carried the thing out very well did you observe where the bullet went
740543 yes sir im afraid it has spoilt your beautiful bust for it passed right through the head and flattened itself on the wall i picked it up from the carpet here it is
740544 a soft revolver bullet as you perceive watson theres genius in that for who would expect to find such a thing fired from an air gun all right mrs hudson i am much obliged for your assistance and now watson let me see you in your old seat once more for there are several points which i should like to discuss with you
740545 the old shikaris nerves have not lost their steadiness nor his eyes their keenness
740546 plumb in the middle of the back of the head and smack through the brain he was the best shot in india and i expect that there are few better in london have you heard the name
740547 well well such is fame but then if i remember aright you had not heard the name of professor james moriarty who had one of the great brains of the century just give me down my index of biographies from the shelf
740548 moriarty himself is enough to make any letter illustrious and here is morgan the poisoner and merridew of abominable memory and mathews who knocked out my left canine in the waiting room at charing cross and finally here is our friend of to night
740549 moran sebastian colonel unemployed formerly 1st bengalore pioneers born london 1840 son of sir augustus moran c b once british minister to persia educated eton and oxford served in jowaki campaign afghan campaign charasiab despatches sherpur and cabul author of heavy game of the western himalayas 1881 three months in the jungle 1884 address conduit street clubs the anglo indian the tankerville the bagatelle card club
740550 up to a certain point he did well he was always a man of iron nerve and the story is still told in india how he crawled down a drain after a wounded man eating tiger there are some trees watson which grow to a certain height and then suddenly develop some unsightly eccentricity you will see it often in humans i have a theory that the individual represents in his development the whole procession of his ancestors and that such a sudden turn to good or evil stands for some strong influence which came into the line of his pedigree the person becomes as it were the epitome of the history of his own family
740551 well i dont insist upon it whatever the cause colonel
740552 you may think that i read the papers with some attention during my sojourn in france on the look out for any chance of laying him by the heels so long as he was free in london my life would really not have been worth living night and day the shadow would have been over me and sooner or later his chance must have come what could i do i could not shoot him at sight or i should myself be in the dock there was no use appealing to a magistrate they cannot interfere on the strength of what would appear to them to be a wild suspicion so i could do nothing but i watched the criminal news knowing that sooner or later i should get him then came the death of this ronald adair my chance had come at last knowing what i did was it not certain that colonel moran had done it he had played cards with the lad he had followed him home from the club he had shot him through the open window there was not a doubt of it the bullets alone are enough to put his head in a noose i came over at once i was seen by the sentinel who would i knew direct the colonels attention to my presence he could not fail to connect my sudden return with his crime and to be terribly alarmed i was sure that he would make an attempt to get me out of the way at once and would bring round his murderous weapon for that purpose i left him an excellent mark in the window and having warned the police that they might be needed by the way watson you spotted their presence in that doorway with unerring accuracy i took up what seemed to me to be a judicious post for observation never dreaming that he would choose the same spot for his attack now my dear watson does anything remain for me to explain
740553 you have not made it clear what was colonel morans motive in murdering the honourable ronald adair
740554 ah my dear watson there we come into those realms of conjecture where the most logical mind may be at fault each may form his own hypothesis upon the present evidence and yours is as likely to be correct as mine
740555 i think that it is not difficult to explain the facts it came out in evidence that colonel moran and young adair had between them won a considerable amount of money now moran undoubtedly played foul of that i have long been aware i believe that on the day of the murder adair had discovered that moran was cheating very likely he had spoken to him privately and had threatened to expose him unless he voluntarily resigned his membership of the club and promised not to play cards again it is unlikely that a youngster like adair would at once make a hideous scandal by exposing a well known man so much older than himself probably he acted as i suggest the exclusion from his clubs would mean ruin to moran who lived by his ill gotten card gains he therefore murdered adair who at the time was endeavouring to work out how much money he should himself return since he could not profit by his partners foul play he locked the door lest the ladies should surprise him and insist upon knowing what he was doing with these names and coins will it pass
740556 i have no doubt that you have hit upon the truth
740557 it will be verified or disproved at the trial meanwhile come what may colonel moran will trouble us no more the famous air gun of von herder will embellish the scotland yard museum and once again mr sherlock holmes is free to devote his life to examining those interesting little problems which the complex life of london so plentifully presents
740558 london has become a singularly uninteresting city since the death of the late lamented professor moriarty
740559 i can hardly think that you would find many decent citizens to agree with you
740560 the community is certainly the gainer and no one the loser
740561 you mustnt blame me i am nearly mad mr holmes i am the unhappy john hector mcfarlane
740562 i am sure that with your symptoms my friend dr watson here would prescribe a sedative the weather has been so very warm these last few days now if you feel a little more composed i should be glad if you would sit down in that chair and tell us very slowly and quietly who you are and what it is that you want you mentioned your name as if i should recognise it but i assure you that beyond the obvious facts that you are a bachelor a solicitor a freemason and an asthmatic i know nothing whatever about you
740563 yes i am all that mr holmes and in addition i am the most unfortunate man at this moment in london for heavens sake dont abandon me mr holmes if they come to arrest me before i have finished my story make them give me time so that i may tell you the whole truth i could go to gaol happy if i knew that you were working for me outside
740564 this is really most grati most interesting on what charge do you expect to be arrested
740565 upon the charge of murdering mr jonas oldacre of lower norwood
740566 it was only this moment at breakfast that i was saying to my friend dr watson that sensational cases had disappeared out of our papers
740567 if you had looked at it sir you would have seen at a glance what the errand is on which i have come to you this morning i feel as if my name and my misfortune must be in every mans mouth
740568 here it is and with your permission i will read it to you listen to this mr holmes the head lines are mysterious affair at lower norwood disappearance of a well known builder suspicion of murder and arson a clue to the criminal that is the clue which they are already following mr holmes and i know that it leads infallibly to me i have been followed from london bridge station and i am sure that they are only waiting for the warrant to arrest me it will break my mothers heart it will break her heart
740569 watson would you have the kindness to take the paper and to read me the paragraph in question
740570 may i ask in the first place mr mcfarlane how it is that you are still at liberty since there appears to be enough evidence to justify your arrest
740571 i live at torrington lodge blackheath with my parents mr holmes but last night having to do business very late with mr jonas oldacre i stayed at an hotel in norwood and came to my business from there i knew nothing of this affair until i was in the train when i read what you have just heard i at once saw the horrible danger of my position and i hurried to put the case into your hands i have no doubt that i should have been arrested either at my city office or at my home a man followed me from london bridge station and i have no doubt great heaven what is that
740572 i arrest you for the wilful murder of mr jonas oldacre of lower norwood
740573 half an hour more or less can make no difference to you and the gentleman was about to give us an account of this very interesting affair which might aid us in clearing it up
740574 i think there will be no difficulty in clearing it up
740575 none the less with your permission i should be much interested to hear his account
740576 well mr holmes it is difficult for me to refuse you anything for you have been of use to the force once or twice in the past and we owe you a good turn at scotland yard
740577 at the same time i must remain with my prisoner and i am bound to warn him that anything he may say will appear in evidence against him
740578 all i ask is that you should hear and recognise the absolute truth
740579 here is my will said he i want you mr mcfarlane
740580 i set myself to copy it and you can imagine my
740581 you can imagine mr holmes that i was not in a humour
740582 a middle aged woman who was i suppose his housekeeper
740583 and it was she i presume who mentioned your name
740584 i was shown by this woman into a sitting room where a frugal supper was laid out afterwards mr jonas oldacre led me into his bedroom in which there stood a heavy safe this he opened and took out a mass of documents which we went over together it was between eleven and twelve when we finished he remarked that we must not disturb the housekeeper he showed me out through his own french window which had been open all this time
740585 i will not be sure but i believe that it was only half down yes i remember how he pulled it up in order to swing open the window i could not find my stick and he said never mind my boy i shall see a good deal of you now i hope and i will keep your stick until you come back to claim it i left him there the safe open and the papers made up in packets upon the table it was so late that i could not get back to blackheath so i spent the night at the anerley arms and i knew nothing more until i read of this horrible affair in the morning
740586 anything more that you would like to ask mr holmes
740587 oh yes no doubt that is what i must have meant
740588 i think i should like to have a word with you presently mr sherlock holmes
740589 now mr mcfarlane two of my constables are at the door and there is a four wheeler waiting
740590 there are some points about that document lestrade are there not
740591 i can read the first few lines and these in the middle of the second page and one or two at the end those are as clear as print
740592 but the writing in between is very bad and there are three places where i cannot read it at all
740593 that it was written in a train the good writing represents stations the bad writing movement and the very bad writing passing over points a scientific expert would pronounce at once that this was drawn up on a suburban line since nowhere save in the immediate vicinity of a great city could there be so quick a succession of points granting that his whole journey was occupied in drawing up the will then the train was an express only stopping once between norwood and london bridge
740594 you are too many for me when you begin to get on your theories mr holmes
740595 well it corroborates the young mans story to the extent that the will was drawn up by jonas oldacre in his journey yesterday it is curious is it not that a man should draw up so important a document in so haphazard a fashion it suggests that he did not think it was going to be of much practical importance if a man drew up a will which he did not intend ever to be effective he might do it so
740596 well he drew up his own death warrant at the same time
740597 well it is quite possible but the case is not clear to me yet
740598 not clear well if that isnt clear what could be clear here is a young man who learns suddenly that if a certain older man dies he will succeed to a fortune what does he do he says nothing to anyone but he arranges that he shall go out on some pretext to see his client that night he waits until the only other person in the house is in bed and then in the solitude of the mans room he murders him burns his body in the wood pile and departs to a neighbouring hotel the blood stains in the room and also on the stick are very slight it is probable that he imagined his crime to be a bloodless one and hoped that if the body were consumed it would hide all traces of the method of his death traces which for some reason must have pointed to him is all this not obvious
740599 it strikes me my good lestrade as being just a trifle too obvious
740600 you do not add imagination to your other great qualities but if you could for one moment put yourself in the place of this young man would you choose the very night after the will had been made to commit your crime would it not seem dangerous to you to make so very close a relation between the two incidents again would you choose an occasion when you are known to be in the house when a servant has let you in and finally would you take the great pains to conceal the body and yet leave your own stick as a sign that you were the criminal confess lestrade that all this is very unlikely
740601 as to the stick mr holmes you know as well as i do that a criminal is often flurried and does things which a cool man would avoid he was very likely afraid to go back to the room give me another theory that would fit the facts
740602 here for example is a very possible and even probable one i make you a free present of it the older man is showing documents which are of evident value a passing tramp sees them through the window the blind of which is only half down exit the solicitor enter the tramp he seizes a stick which he observes there kills oldacre and departs after burning the body
740603 possibly the tramp wanted to hide that any murder at all had been committed
740604 well mr sherlock holmes you may look for your tramp and while you are finding him we will hold on to our man the future will show which is right just notice this point mr holmes that so far as we know none of the papers were removed and that the prisoner is the one man in the world who had no reason for removing them since he was heir at law and would come into them in any case
740605 i dont mean to deny that the evidence is in some ways very strongly in favour of your theory
740606 i only wish to point out that there are other theories possible as you say the future will decide good morning i dare say that in the course of the day i shall drop in at norwood and see how you are getting on
740607 must as i said be in the direction of blackheath
740608 because we have in this case one singular incident coming close to the heels of another singular incident the police are making the mistake of concentrating their attention upon the second because it happens to be the one which is actually criminal but it is evident to me that the logical way to approach the case is to begin by trying to throw some light upon the first incident the curious will so suddenly made and to so unexpected an heir it may do something to simplify what followed no my dear fellow i dont think you can help me there is no prospect of danger or i should not dream of stirring out without you i trust that when i see you in the evening i will be able to report that i have been able to do something for this unfortunate youngster who has thrown himself upon my protection
740609 its all going wrong watson all as wrong as it can go i kept a bold face before lestrade but upon my soul i believe that for once the fellow is on the right track and we are on the wrong all my instincts are one way and all the facts are the other and i much fear that british juries have not yet attained that pitch of intelligence when they will give the preference to my theories over lestrades facts
740610 yes watson i went there and i found very quickly that
740611 yes i knew him well in fact he was an old suitor of
740612 well said i at least he has forgiven you now since
740613 neither my son nor i want anything from jonas oldacre
740614 well i tried one or two leads but could get at nothing
740615 this place deep dene house is a big modern villa of
740616 well after this fiasco i went into the bedroom and
740617 only one little gleam of hope did i get and yet it
740618 finally having drawn every other cover and picked up no
740619 so my dear watson theres my report of a failure and
740620 i know its all wrong i feel it in my bones there is something that has not come out and that housekeeper knows it there was a sort of sulky defiance in her eyes which only goes with guilty knowledge however theres no good talking any more about it watson but unless some lucky chance comes our way i fear that the norwood disappearance case will not figure in that chronicle of our successes which i foresee that a patient public will sooner or later have to endure
740621 that is a dangerous argument my dear watson you remember that terrible murderer bert stevens who wanted us to get him off in 87 was there ever a more mild mannered sunday school young man
740622 unless we succeed in establishing an alternative theory this man is lost you can hardly find a flaw in the case which can now be presented against him and all further investigation has served to strengthen it by the way there is one curious little point about those papers which may serve us as the starting point for an inquiry on looking over the bank book i found that the low state of the balance was principally due to large cheques which have been made out during the last year to mr cornelius i confess that i should be interested to know who this mr cornelius may be with whom a retired builder has such very large transactions is it possible that he has had a hand in the affair cornelius might be a broker but we have found no scrip to correspond with these large payments failing any other indication my researches must now take the direction of an inquiry at the bank for the gentleman who has cashed these cheques but i fear my dear fellow that our case will end ingloriously by lestrade hanging our client which will certainly be a triumph for scotland yard
740623 important fresh evidence to hand mcfarlanes guilt definitely established advise you to abandon case lestrade
740624 and yet it may be premature to abandon the case after all important fresh evidence is a two edged thing and may possibly cut in a very different direction to that which lestrade imagines take your breakfast watson and we will go out together and see what we can do i feel as if i shall need your company and your moral support to day
740625 at present i cannot spare energy and nerve force for digestion
740626 well mr holmes have you proved us to be wrong yet have you found your tramp
740627 but we formed ours yesterday and now it proves to be correct so you must acknowledge that we have been a little in front of you this time mr holmes
740628 you certainly have the air of something unusual having occurred
740629 you dont like being beaten any more than the rest of us do
740630 a man cant expect always to have it his own way can he dr watson step this way if you please gentlemen and i think i can convince you once for all that it was john mcfarlane who did this crime
740631 this is where young mcfarlane must have come out to get his hat after the crime was done
740632 you are aware that no two thumb marks are alike
740633 well then will you please compare that print with this wax impression of young mcfarlanes right thumb taken by my orders this morning
740634 well now who would have thought it and how deceptive appearances may be to be sure such a nice young man to look at it is a lesson to us not to trust our own judgment is it not lestrade
740635 yes some of us are a little too much inclined to be cocksure mr holmes
740636 what a providential thing that this young man should press his right thumb against the wall in taking his hat from the peg such a very natural action too if you come to think of it
740637 it was the housekeeper mrs lexington who drew the night constables attention to it
740638 he remained on guard in the bedroom where the crime was committed so as to see that nothing was touched
740639 well we had no particular reason to make a careful examination of the hall besides its not in a very prominent place as you see
740640 no no of course not i suppose there is no doubt that the mark was there yesterday
740641 i dont know whether you think that mcfarlane came out of gaol in the dead of the night in order to strengthen the evidence against himself
740642 i leave it to any expert in the world whether that is not the mark of his thumb
740643 i am a practical man mr holmes and when i have got my evidence i come to my conclusions if you have anything to say you will find me writing my report in the sitting room
740644 dear me this is a very sad development watson is it not
740645 and yet there are singular points about it which hold out some hopes for our client
740646 i would hardly go so far as to say that my dear watson the fact is that there is one really serious flaw in this evidence to which our friend attaches so much importance
740647 only this that i know that that mark was not there when i examined the hall yesterday and now watson let us have a little stroll round in the sunshine
740648 there are really some very unique features about this case watson
740649 i think it is time now that we took our friend lestrade into our confidence he has had his little smile at our expense and perhaps we may do as much by him if my reading of this problem proves to be correct yes yes i think i see how we should approach it
740650 i understood that you were writing a report of this case
740651 dont you think it may be a little premature i cant help thinking that your evidence is not complete
740652 only that there is an important witness whom you have not seen
740653 i will do my best how many constables have you
740654 may i ask if they are all large able bodied men with powerful voices
740655 i have no doubt they are though i fail to see what their voices have to do with it
740656 perhaps i can help you to see that and one or two other things as well
740657 in the outhouse you will find a considerable quantity of straw
740658 i will ask you to carry in two bundles of it i think it will be of the greatest assistance in producing the witness whom i require thank you very much i believe you have some matches in your pocket watson now mr lestrade i will ask you all to accompany me to the top landing
740659 would you kindly send one of your constables for two buckets of water put the straw on the floor here free from the wall on either side now i think that we are all ready
740660 i dont know whether you are playing a game with us mr sherlock holmes
740661 if you know anything you can surely say it without all this tomfoolery
740662 i assure you my good lestrade that i have an excellent reason for everything that i do you may possibly remember that you chaffed me a little some hours ago when the sun seemed on your side of the hedge so you must not grudge me a little pomp and ceremony now might i ask you watson to open that window and then to put a match to the edge of the straw
740663 now we must see if we can find this witness for you
740664 watson a bucket of water over the straw that will do lestrade allow me to present you with your principal missing witness mr jonas oldacre
740665 no harm you have done your best to get an innocent man hanged if it wasnt for this gentleman here i am not sure that you would not have succeeded
740666 i am sure sir it was only my practical joke
740667 oh a joke was it you wont find the laugh on your side i promise you take him down and keep him in the sitting room until i come mr holmes
740668 i could not speak before the constables but i dont mind saying in the presence of dr watson that this is the brightest thing that you have done yet though it is a mystery to me how you did it you have saved an innocent mans life and you have prevented a very grave scandal which would have ruined my reputation in the force
740669 instead of being ruined my good sir you will find that your reputation has been enormously enhanced just make a few alterations in that report which you were writing and they will understand how hard it is to throw dust in the eyes of inspector lestrade
740670 not at all the work is its own reward perhaps i shall get the credit also at some distant day when i permit my zealous historian to lay out his foolscap once more eh watson well now let us see where this rat has been lurking
740671 he was able to fix up his own little hiding place without any confederate save of course that precious housekeeper of his whom i should lose no time in adding to your bag lestrade
740672 ill take your advice but how did you know of this place mr holmes
740673 i made up my mind that the fellow was in hiding in the house when i paced one corridor and found it six feet shorter than the corresponding one below it was pretty clear where he was i thought he had not the nerve to lie quiet before an alarm of fire we could of course have gone in and taken him but it amused me to make him reveal himself besides i owed you a little mystification lestrade for your chaff in the morning
740674 well sir you certainly got equal with me on that but how in the world did you know that he was in the house at all
740675 the thumb mark lestrade you said it was final and so it was in a very different sense i knew it had not been there the day before i pay a good deal of attention to matters of detail as you may have observed and i had examined the hall and was sure that the wall was clear therefore it had been put on during the night
740676 very simply when those packets were sealed up jonas oldacre got mcfarlane to secure one of the seals by putting his thumb upon the soft wax it would be done so quickly and so naturally that i dare say the young man himself has no recollection of it very likely it just so happened and oldacre had himself no notion of the use he would put it to brooding over the case in that den of his it suddenly struck him what absolutely damning evidence he could make against mcfarlane by using that thumb mark it was the simplest thing in the world for him to take a wax impression from the seal to moisten it in as much blood as he could get from a pin prick and to put the mark upon the wall during the night either with his own hand or with that of his housekeeper if you examine among those documents which he took with him into his retreat i will lay you a wager that you find the seal with the thumb mark upon it
740677 wonderful its all as clear as crystal as you put it but what is the object of this deep deception mr holmes
740678 well i dont think that is very hard to explain a very deep malicious vindictive person is the gentleman who is now awaiting us downstairs you know that he was once refused by mcfarlanes mother you dont i told you that you should go to blackheath first and norwood afterwards well this injury as he would consider it has rankled in his wicked scheming brain and all his life he has longed for vengeance but never seen his chance during the last year or two things have gone against him secret speculation i think and he finds himself in a bad way he determines to swindle his creditors and for this purpose he pays large cheques to a certain mr cornelius who is i imagine himself under another name i have not traced these cheques yet but i have no doubt that they were banked under that name at some provincial town where oldacre from time to time led a double existence he intended to change his name altogether draw this money and vanish starting life again elsewhere
740679 it would strike him that in disappearing he might throw all pursuit off his track and at the same time have an ample and crushing revenge upon his old sweetheart if he could give the impression that he had been murdered by her only child it was a masterpiece of villainy and he carried it out like a master the idea of the will which would give an obvious motive for the crime the secret visit unknown to his own parents the retention of the stick the blood and the animal remains and buttons in the wood pile all were admirable it was a net from which it seemed to me a few hours ago that there was no possible escape but he had not that supreme gift of the artist the knowledge of when to stop he wished to improve that which was already perfect to draw the rope tighter yet round the neck of his unfortunate victim and so he ruined all let us descend lestrade there are just one or two questions that i would ask him
740680 it was a joke my good sir a practical joke nothing more
740681 i assure you sir that i simply concealed myself in order to see the effect of my disappearance and i am sure that you would not be so unjust as to imagine that i would have allowed any harm to befall poor young mr mcfarlane
740682 anyhow we shall have you on a charge of conspiracy if not for attempted murder
740683 and youll probably find that your creditors will impound the banking account of mr cornelius
740684 i fancy that for some few years you will find your time very fully occupied
740685 by the way what was it you put into the wood pile besides your old trousers a dead dog or rabbits or what you wont tell dear me how very unkind of you well well i dare say that a couple of rabbits would account both for the blood and for the charred ashes if ever you write an account watson you can make rabbits serve your turn
740686 you do not propose to invest in south african securities
740687 i ought to make you sign a paper to that effect
740688 because in five minutes you will say that it is all so absurdly simple
740689 i am sure that i shall say nothing of the kind
740690 it is not really difficult to construct a series of inferences each dependent upon its predecessor and each simple in itself if after doing so one simply knocks out all the central inferences and presents ones audience with the starting point and the conclusion one may produce a startling though possibly a meretricious effect now it was not really difficult by an inspection of the groove between your left forefinger and thumb to feel sure that you did not propose to invest your small capital in the goldfields
740691 very likely not but i can quickly show you a close connection here are the missing links of the very simple chain 1 you had chalk between your left finger and thumb when you returned from the club last night 2 you put chalk there when you play billiards to steady the cue 3 you never play billiards except with thurston 4 you told me four weeks ago that thurston had an option on some south african property which would expire in a month and which he desired you to share with him 5 your cheque book is locked in my drawer and you have not asked for the key 6 you do not propose to invest your money in this manner
740692 every problem becomes very childish when once it is explained to you here is an unexplained one see what you can make of that friend watson
740693 that is what mr hilton cubitt of riding thorpe manor norfolk is very anxious to know this little conundrum came by the first post and he was to follow by the next train theres a ring at the bell watson i should not be very much surprised if this were he
740694 they told me that you were fond of queer mysteries and i dont think you can find a queerer one than that i sent the paper on ahead so that you might have time to study it before i came
740695 at first sight it would appear to be some childish prank it consists of a number of absurd little figures dancing across the paper upon which they are drawn why should you attribute any importance to so grotesque an object
740696 i never should mr holmes but my wife does it is frightening her to death she says nothing but i can see terror in her eyes thats why i want to sift the matter to the bottom
740697 this promises to be a most interesting and unusual case
740698 you gave me a few particulars in your letter mr hilton cubitt but i should be very much obliged if you would kindly go over it all again for the benefit of my friend dr watson
740699 youll just ask me anything that i dont make clear ill
740700 she was very straight about it was elsie i cant say
740701 well we have been married now for a year and very happy
740702 well now i come to the queer part of my story about a week ago it was the tuesday of last week i found on one of the window sills a number of absurd little dancing figures like these upon the paper they were scrawled with chalk i thought that it was the stable boy who had drawn them but the lad swore he knew nothing about it anyhow they had come there during the night i had them washed out and i only mentioned the matter to my wife afterwards to my surprise she took it very seriously and begged me if any more came to let her see them none did come for a week and then yesterday morning i found this paper lying on the sun dial in the garden i showed it to elsie and down she dropped in a dead faint since then she has looked like a woman in a dream half dazed and with terror always lurking in her eyes it was then that i wrote and sent the paper to you mr holmes it was not a thing that i could take to the police for they would have laughed at me but you will tell me what to do i am not a rich man but if there is any danger threatening my little woman i would spend my last copper to shield her
740703 that your best plan would be to make a direct appeal to your wife and to ask her to share her secret with you
740704 a promise is a promise mr holmes if elsie wished to tell me she would if not it is not for me to force her confidence but i am justified in taking my own line and i will
740705 then i will help you with all my heart in the first place have you heard of any strangers being seen in your neighbourhood
740706 i presume that it is a very quiet place any fresh face would cause comment
740707 in the immediate neighbourhood yes but we have several small watering places not very far away and the farmers take in lodgers
740708 these hieroglyphics have evidently a meaning if it is a purely arbitrary one it may be impossible for us to solve it if on the other hand it is systematic i have no doubt that we shall get to the bottom of it but this particular sample is so short that i can do nothing and the facts which you have brought me are so indefinite that we have no basis for an investigation i would suggest that you return to norfolk that you keep a keen look out and that you take an exact copy of any fresh dancing men which may appear it is a thousand pities that we have not a reproduction of those which were done in chalk upon the window sill make a discreet inquiry also as to any strangers in the neighbourhood when you have collected some fresh evidence come to me again that is the best advice which i can give you mr hilton cubitt if there are any pressing fresh developments i shall be always ready to run down and see you in your norfolk home
740709 because i had a wire from hilton cubitt this morning you remember hilton cubitt of the dancing men he was to reach liverpool street at one twenty he may be here at any moment i gather from his wire that there have been some new incidents of importance
740710 its bad enough to feel that you are surrounded by unseen unknown folk who have some kind of design upon you but when in addition to that you know that it is just killing your wife by inches then it becomes as much as flesh and blood can endure shes wearing away under it just wearing away before my eyes
740711 no mr holmes she has not and yet there have been times when the poor girl has wanted to speak and yet could not quite bring herself to take the plunge i have tried to help her but i dare say i did it clumsily and scared her off from it she has spoken about my old family and our reputation in the county and our pride in our unsullied honour and i always felt it was leading to the point but somehow it turned off before we got there
740712 a good deal mr holmes i have several fresh dancing men pictures for you to examine and what is more important i have seen the fellow
740713 yes i saw him at his work but i will tell you everything in order when i got back after my visit to you the very first thing i saw next morning was a fresh crop of dancing men they had been drawn in chalk upon the black wooden door of the tool house which stands beside the lawn in full view of the front windows i took an exact copy and here it is
740714 when i had taken the copy i rubbed out the marks but two mornings later a fresh inscription had appeared i have a copy of it here
740715 three days later a message was left scrawled upon paper
740716 if it really annoys you hilton we might go and travel
740717 what be driven out of our own house by a practical
740718 well come to bed said she and we can discuss it in
740719 suddenly as she spoke i saw her white face grow whiter yet in the moonlight and her hand tightened upon my shoulder something was moving in the shadow of the tool house i saw a dark creeping figure which crawled round the corner and squatted in front of the door seizing my pistol i was rushing out when my wife threw her arms round me and held me with convulsive strength i tried to throw her off but she clung to me most desperately at last i got clear but by the time i had opened the door and reached the house the creature was gone he had left a trace of his presence however for there on the door was the very same arrangement of dancing men which had already twice appeared and which i have copied on that paper there was no other sign of the fellow anywhere though i ran all over the grounds and yet the amazing thing is that he must have been there all the time for when i examined the door again in the morning he had scrawled some more of his pictures under the line which i had already seen
740720 yes it is very short but i made a copy of it and here it is
740721 was this a mere addition to the first or did it appear to be entirely separate
740722 excellent this is far the most important of all for our purpose it fills me with hopes now mr hilton cubitt please continue your most interesting statement
740723 i have nothing more to say mr holmes except that i was angry with my wife that night for having held me back when i might have caught the skulking rascal she said that she feared that i might come to harm for an instant it had crossed my mind that perhaps what she really feared was that he might come to harm for i could not doubt that she knew who this man was and what he meant by these strange signals but there is a tone in my wifes voice mr holmes and a look in her eyes which forbid doubt and i am sure that it was indeed my own safety that was in her mind theres the whole case and now i want your advice as to what i ought to do my own inclination is to put half a dozen of my farm lads in the shrubbery and when this fellow comes again to give him such a hiding that he will leave us in peace for the future
740724 i fear it is too deep a case for such simple remedies
740725 i must go back to day i would not leave my wife alone all night for anything she is very nervous and begged me to come back
740726 i dare say you are right but if you could have stopped i might possibly have been able to return with you in a day or two meanwhile you will leave me these papers and i think that it is very likely that i shall be able to pay you a visit shortly and to throw some light upon your case
740727 if my answer to this is as i hope you will have a very pretty case to add to your collection watson
740728 i expect that we shall be able to go down to norfolk to morrow and to take our friend some very definite news as to the secret of his annoyance
740729 then we shall breakfast early and take the very first in the morning
740730 our presence is most urgently needed ah here is our expected cablegram one moment mrs hudson there may be an answer no that is quite as i expected this message makes it even more essential that we should not lose an hour in letting hilton cubitt know how matters stand for it is a singular and a dangerous web in which our simple norfolk squire is entangled
740731 because inspector martin from norwich has just passed through but maybe you are the surgeons shes not dead or wasnt by last accounts you may be in time to save her yet though it be for the gallows
740732 but we have heard nothing of what has passed there
740733 they are shot both mr hilton cubitt and his wife she shot him and then herself so the servants say hes dead and her life is despaired of dear dear one of the oldest families in the county of norfolk and one of the most honoured
740734 why mr holmes the crime was only committed at three this morning how could you hear of it in london and get to the spot as soon as i
740735 i anticipated it i came in the hope of preventing it
740736 then you must have important evidence of which we are ignorant for they were said to be a most united couple
740737 i will explain the matter to you later meanwhile since it is too late to prevent this tragedy i am very anxious that i should use the knowledge which i possess in order to ensure that justice be done will you associate me in your investigation or will you prefer that i should act independently
740738 i should be proud to feel that we were acting together mr holmes
740739 in that case i should be glad to hear the evidence and to examine the premises without an instant of unnecessary delay
740740 we have moved nothing except the lady we could not leave her lying wounded upon the floor
740741 you have acted with great discretion who sent for you
740742 then i think we had better hear their story at once
740743 and now i think that we are in a position to undertake a thorough examination of the room
740744 the absence of the latter means nothing though its presence may mean everything
740745 unless the powder from a badly fitting cartridge happens to spurt backwards one may fire many shots without leaving a sign i would suggest that mr cubitts body may now be removed i suppose doctor you have not recovered the bullet which wounded the lady
740746 a serious operation will be necessary before that can be done but there are still four cartridges in the revolver two have been fired and two wounds inflicted so that each bullet can be accounted for
740747 perhaps you can account also for the bullet which has so obviously struck the edge of the window
740748 you are certainly right sir then a third shot has been fired and therefore a third person must have been present but who could that have been and how could he have got away
740749 that is the problem which we are now about to solve
740750 you remember inspector martin when the servants said that on leaving their room they were at once conscious of a smell of powder i remarked that the point was an extremely important one
740751 yes sir but i confess i did not quite follow you
740752 it suggested that at the time of the firing the window as well as the door of the room had been open otherwise the fumes of powder could not have been blown so rapidly through the house a draught in the room was necessary for that both door and window were only open for a very short time however
740753 feeling sure that the window had been open at the time of the tragedy i conceived that there might have been a third person in the affair who stood outside this opening and fired through it any shot directed at this person might hit the sash i looked and there sure enough was the bullet mark
740754 but how came the window to be shut and fastened
740755 the womans first instinct would be to shut and fasten the window but halloa what is this
740756 this must be preserved for it will figure in the trial
740757 it is now necessary that we should try to throw some light upon this third bullet which has clearly from the splintering of the wood been fired from inside the room i should like to see mrs king the cook again you said mrs king that you were awakened by a loud explosion when you said that did you mean that it seemed to you to be louder than the second one
740758 well sir it wakened me from my sleep and so it is hard to judge but it did seem very loud
740759 you dont think that it might have been two shots fired almost at the same instant
740760 i believe that it was undoubtedly so i rather think inspector martin that we have now exhausted all that this room can teach us if you will kindly step round with me we shall see what fresh evidence the garden has to offer
740761 the revolver had an ejector and here is the third cartridge i really think inspector martin that our case is almost complete
740762 ill go into that later there are several points in this problem which i have not been able to explain to you yet now that i have got so far i had best proceed on my own lines and then clear the whole matter up once and for all
740763 just as you wish mr holmes so long as we get our man
740764 i have no desire to make mysteries but it is impossible at the moment of action to enter into long and complex explanations i have the threads of this affair all in my hand even if this lady should never recover consciousness we can still reconstruct the events of last night and ensure that justice be done first of all i wish to know whether there is any inn in this neighbourhood known as elriges
740765 perhaps they have not heard yet of all that happened here during the night
740766 i shall wish you to take a note to elriges farm
740767 that you would do well to telegraph for an escort as if my calculations prove to be correct you may have a particularly dangerous prisoner to convey to the county gaol the boy who takes this note could no doubt forward your telegram if there is an afternoon train to town watson i think we should do well to take it as i have a chemical analysis of some interest to finish and this investigation draws rapidly to a close
740768 i think that i can help you to pass an hour in an interesting and profitable manner
740769 as to you friend watson i owe you every atonement for having allowed your natural curiosity to remain so long unsatisfied to you inspector the whole incident may appeal as a remarkable professional study i must tell you first of all the interesting circumstances connected with the previous consultations which mr hilton cubitt has had with me in baker street
740770 but now came the real difficulty of the inquiry the
740771 even now i was in considerable difficulty but a happy
740772 now the first letter can only be a which is a most useful discovery since it occurs no fewer than three times in this short sentence and the h is also apparent in the second word now it becomes am here a e slane or filling in the obvious vacancies in the name am here abe slaney i had so many letters now that i could proceed with considerable confidence to the second message which worked out in this fashion a elri es here i could only make sense by putting t and g for the missing letters and supposing that the name was that of some house or inn at which the writer was staying
740773 i had every reason to suppose that this abe slaney was an american since abe is an american contraction and since a letter from america had been the starting point of all the trouble i had also every cause to think that there was some criminal secret in the matter the ladys allusions to her past and her refusal to take her husband into her confidence both pointed in that direction i therefore cabled to my friend wilson hargreave of the new york police bureau who has more than once made use of my knowledge of london crime i asked him whether the name of abe slaney was known to him here is his reply the most dangerous crook in chicago on the very evening upon which i had his answer hilton cubitt sent me the last message from slaney working with known letters it took this form elsie re are to meet thy go the addition of a p and a d completed a message which showed me that the rascal was proceeding from persuasion to threats and my knowledge of the crooks of chicago prepared me to find that he might very rapidly put his words into action i at once came to norfolk with my friend and colleague dr watson but unhappily only in time to find that the worst had already occurred
740774 it is a privilege to be associated with you in the handling of a case
740775 you will excuse me however if i speak frankly to you you are only answerable to yourself but i have to answer to my superiors if this abe slaney living at elriges is indeed the murderer and if he has made his escape while i am seated here i should certainly get into serious trouble
740776 you need not be uneasy he will not try to escape
740777 but this is incredible mr holmes why should he come because you have asked him would not such a request rather rouse his suspicions and cause him to fly
740778 i think i have known how to frame the letter
740779 in fact if i am not very much mistaken here is the gentleman himself coming up the drive
740780 that we had best take up our position behind the door every precaution is necessary when dealing with such a fellow you will need your handcuffs inspector you can leave the talking to me
740781 well gentlemen you have the drop on me this time i seem to have knocked up against something hard but i came here in answer to a letter from mrs hilton cubitt dont tell me that she is in this dont tell me that she helped to set a trap for me
740782 mrs hilton cubitt was seriously injured and is at deaths door
740783 it was he that was hurt not she who would have hurt little elsie i may have threatened her god forgive me but i would not have touched a hair of her pretty head take it back you say that she is not hurt
740784 she was found badly wounded by the side of her dead husband
740785 if i shot the man he had his shot at me and theres no murder in that but if you think i could have hurt that woman then you dont know either me or her i tell you there was never a man in this world loved a woman more than i loved her i had a right to her she was pledged to me years ago who was this englishman that he should come between us i tell you that i had the first right to her and that i was only claiming my own
740786 she broke away from your influence when she found the man that you are
740787 she fled from america to avoid you and she married an honourable gentleman in england you dogged her and followed her and made her life a misery to her in order to induce her to abandon the husband whom she loved and respected in order to fly with you whom she feared and hated you have ended by bringing about the death of a noble man and driving his wife to suicide that is your record in this business mr abe slaney and you will answer for it to the law
740788 if elsie dies i care nothing what becomes of me
740789 youre not trying to scare me over this are you if the lady is hurt as bad as you say who was it that wrote this note
740790 you wrote it there was no one on earth outside the joint who knew the secret of the dancing men how came you to write it
740791 there is a cab coming to convey you to norwich mr slaney but meanwhile you have time to make some small reparation for the injury you have wrought are you aware that mrs hilton cubitt has herself lain under grave suspicion of the murder of her husband and that it was only my presence here and the knowledge which i happened to possess which has saved her from the accusation the least that you owe her is to make it clear to the whole world that she was in no way directly or indirectly responsible for his tragic end
740792 i guess the very best case i can make for myself is the absolute naked truth
740793 it is my duty to warn you that it will be used against you
740794 well i have been here a month now i lived in that farm where i had a room down below and could get in and out every night and no one the wiser i tried all i could to coax elsie away i knew that she read the messages for once she wrote an answer under one of them then my temper got the better of me and i began to threaten her she sent me a letter then imploring me to go away and saying that it would break her heart if any scandal should come upon her husband she said that she would come down when her husband was asleep at three in the morning and speak with me through the end window if i would go away afterwards and leave her in peace she came down and brought money with her trying to bribe me to go this made me mad and i caught her arm and tried to pull her through the window at that moment in rushed the husband with his revolver in his hand elsie had sunk down upon the floor and we were face to face i was heeled also and i held up my gun to scare him off and let me get away he fired and missed me i pulled off almost at the same instant and down he dropped i made away across the garden and as i went i heard the window shut behind me thats gods truth gentlemen every word of it and i heard no more about it until that lad came riding up with a note which made me walk in here like a jay and give myself into your hands
740795 no she is not conscious mr sherlock holmes i only hope that if ever again i have an important case i shall have the good fortune to have you by my side
740796 you will find that it simply means come here at once i
740797 yes i bicycle a good deal mr holmes and that has something to do with my visit to you to day
740798 you will excuse me i am sure it is my business
740799 i nearly fell into the error of supposing that you were typewriting of course it is obvious that it is music you observe the spatulate finger end watson which is common to both professions there is a spirituality about the face however
740800 which the typewriter does not generate this lady is a musician
740801 a beautiful neighbourhood and full of the most interesting associations you remember watson that it was near there that we took archie stamford the forger now miss violet what has happened to you near farnham on the borders of surrey
740802 my father is dead mr holmes he was james smith who conducted the orchestra at the old imperial theatre my mother and i were left without a relation in the world except one uncle ralph smith who went to africa twenty five years ago and we have never had a word from him since when father died we were left very poor but one day we were told that there was an advertisement in the times inquiring for our whereabouts you can imagine how excited we were for we thought that someone had left us a fortune we went at once to the lawyer whose name was given in the paper there we met two gentlemen mr carruthers and mr woodley who were home on a visit from south africa they said that my uncle was a friend of theirs that he died some months before in great poverty in johannesburg and that he had asked them with his last breath to hunt up his relations and see that they were in no want it seemed strange to us that uncle ralph who took no notice of us when he was alive should be so careful to look after us when he was dead but mr carruthers explained that the reason was that my uncle had just heard of the death of his brother and so felt responsible for our fate
740803 mr woodley seemed to me to be a most odious person he was for ever making eyes at me a coarse puffy faced red moustached young man with his hair plastered down on each side of his forehead i thought that he was perfectly hateful and i was sure that cyril would not wish me to know such a person
740804 the first flaw in my happiness was the arrival of the
740805 and now mr holmes i come at last to the special thing
740806 the horse and trap were to have come this week but for some reason they were not delivered and again i had to cycle to the station that was this morning you can think that i looked out when i came to charlington heath and there sure enough was the man exactly as he had been the two weeks before he always kept so far from me that i could not clearly see his face but it was certainly someone whom i did not know he was dressed in a dark suit with a cloth cap the only thing about his face that i could clearly see was his dark beard to day i was not alarmed but i was filled with curiosity and i determined to find out who he was and what he wanted i slowed down my machine but he slowed down his then i stopped altogether but he stopped also then i laid a trap for him there is a sharp turning of the road and i pedalled very quickly round this and then i stopped and waited i expected him to shoot round and pass me before he could stop but he never appeared then i went back and looked round the corner i could see a mile of road but he was not on it to make it the more extraordinary there was no side road at this point down which he could have gone
740807 how much time elapsed between your turning the corner and your discovery that the road was clear
740808 then he could not have retreated down the road and you say that there are no side roads
740809 then he certainly took a footpath on one side or the other
740810 it could not have been on the side of the heath or i should have seen him
740811 so by the process of exclusion we arrive at the fact that he made his way towards charlington hall which as i understand is situated in its own grounds on one side of the road anything else
740812 nothing mr holmes save that i was so perplexed that i felt i should not be happy until i had seen you and had your advice
740813 oh mr holmes as if i should not know him
740814 there was this dreadful man woodley if you can call him an admirer
740815 oh it may be a mere fancy of mine but it has seemed to me sometimes that my employer mr carruthers takes a great deal of interest in me we are thrown rather together i play his accompaniments in the evening he has never said anything he is a perfect gentleman but a girl always knows
740816 well at least he is fairly well to do but he goes into the city two or three times a week he is deeply interested in south african gold shares
740817 you will let me know any fresh development miss smith i am very busy just now but i will find time to make some inquiries into your case in the meantime take no step without letting me know good bye and i trust that we shall have nothing but good news from you
740818 it is part of the settled order of nature that such a girl should have followers
740819 but for choice not on bicycles in lonely country roads some secretive lover beyond all doubt but there are curious and suggestive details about the case watson
740820 exactly our first effort must be to find who are the tenants of charlington hall then again how about the connection between carruthers and woodley since they appear to be men of such a different type how came they both to be so keen upon looking up ralph smiths relations one more point what sort of a menage 1 is it which pays double the market price for a governess but does not keep a horse although six miles from the station odd watson very odd
740821 no my dear fellow you will go down this may be some trifling intrigue and i cannot break my other important research for the sake of it on monday you will arrive early at farnham you will conceal yourself near charlington heath you will observe these facts for yourself and act as your own judgment advises then having inquired as to the occupants of the hall you will come back to me and report and now watson not another word of the matter until we have a few solid stepping stones on which we may hope to get across to our solution
740822 your hiding place my dear watson was very faulty you should have been behind the hedge then you would have had a close view of this interesting person as it is you were some hundreds of yards away and can tell me even less than miss smith she thinks she does not know the man i am convinced she does why otherwise should he be so desperately anxious that she should not get so near him as to see his features you describe him as bending over the handle bar concealment again you see you really have done remarkably badly he returns to the house and you want to find out who he is you come to a london house agent
740823 gone to the nearest public house that is the centre of country gossip they would have told you every name from the master to the scullery maid williamson it conveys nothing to my mind if he is an elderly man he is not this active cyclist who sprints away from that athletic young ladys pursuit what have we gained by your expedition the knowledge that the girls story is true i never doubted it that there is a connection between the cyclist and the hall i never doubted that either that the hall is tenanted by williamson whos the better for that well well my dear sir dont look so depressed we can do little more until next saturday and in the meantime i may make one or two inquiries myself
740824 i am sure that you will respect my confidence mr holmes when i tell you that my place here has become difficult owing to the fact that my employer has proposed marriage to me i am convinced that his feelings are most deep and most honourable at the same time my promise is of course given he took my refusal very seriously but also very gently you can understand however that the situation is a little strained
740825 our young friend seems to be getting into deep waters
740826 the case certainly presents more features of interest and more possibility of development than i had originally thought i should be none the worse for a quiet peaceful day in the country and i am inclined to run down this afternoon and test one or two theories which i have formed
740827 i get so little active exercise that it is always a treat
740828 you are aware that i have some proficiency in the good old british sport of boxing occasionally it is of service to day for example i should have come to very ignominious grief without it
740829 i found that country pub which i had already recommended to your notice and there i made my discreet inquiries i was in the bar and a garrulous landlord was giving me all that i wanted williamson is a white bearded man and he lives alone with a small staff of servants at the hall there is some rumour that he is or has been a clergyman but one or two incidents of his short residence at the hall struck me as peculiarly unecclesiastical i have already made some inquiries at a clerical agency and they tell me that there was a man of that name in orders whose career has been a singularly dark one the landlord further informed me that there are usually week end visitors a warm lot sir at the hall and especially one gentleman with a red moustache mr woodley by name who was always there we had got as far as this when who should walk in but the gentleman himself who had been drinking his beer in the tap room and had heard the whole conversation who was i what did i want what did i mean by asking questions he had a fine flow of language and his adjectives were very vigorous he ended a string of abuse by a vicious back hander which i failed to entirely avoid the next few minutes were delicious it was a straight left against a slogging ruffian i emerged as you see me mr woodley went home in a cart so ended my country trip and it must be confessed that however enjoyable my day on the surrey border has not been much more profitable than your own
740830 as to the special cause of my leaving it is not merely the strained situation with mr carruthers but it is the reappearance of that odious man mr woodley he was always hideous but he looks more awful than ever now for he appears to have had an accident and he is much disfigured i saw him out of the window but i am glad to say i did not meet him he had a long talk with mr carruthers who seemed much excited afterwards woodley must be staying in the neighbourhood for he did not sleep here and yet i caught a glimpse of him again this morning slinking about in the shrubbery i would sooner have a savage wild animal loose about the place i loathe and fear him more than i can say how can mr carruthers endure such a creature for a moment however all my troubles will be over on saturday
740831 there is some deep intrigue going on round that little woman and it is our duty to see that no one molests her upon that last journey i think watson that we must spare time to run down together on saturday morning and make sure that this curious and inconclusive investigation has no untoward ending
740832 if that is her trap she must be making for the earlier train i fear watson that she will be past charlington before we can possibly meet her
740833 fool that i was not to allow for that earlier train its abduction watson abduction murder heaven knows what block the road stop the horse thats right now jump in and let us see if i can repair the consequences of my own blunder
740834 where did you get that dog cart pull up man
740835 pull up i say or by george ill put a bullet into your horse
740836 youre the man we want to see where is miss violet smith
740837 thats what i am asking you youre in her dog cart you ought to know where she is
740838 we met the dog cart on the road there was no one in it we drove back to help the young lady
740839 theyve got her that hellhound woodley and the blackguard parson come man come if you really are her friend stand by me and well save her if i have to leave my carcass in charlington wood
740840 he drove her the beasts have pulled him off and clubbed him let him lie we cant do him any good but we may save her from the worst fate that can befall a woman
740841 they didnt go to the house here are their marks on the left here beside the laurel bushes ah i said so
740842 this way this way they are in the bowling alley
740843 ah the cowardly dogs follow me gentlemen too late too late by the living jingo
740844 i know you right enough well you and your pals have just come in time for me to be able to introduce you to mrs woodley
740845 i am bob carruthers and ill see this woman righted if i have to swing for it i told you what id do if you molested her and by the lord ill be as good as my word
740846 drop that pistol watson pick it up hold it to his head thank you you carruthers give me that revolver well have no more violence come hand it over
740847 you have heard of me i see i will represent the official police until their arrival here you
740848 come here take this note as hard as you can ride to farnham
740849 give it to the superintendent at the police station until he comes i must detain you all under my personal custody
740850 ill go upstairs and finish him first do you tell me that that girl that angel is to be tied to roaring jack woodley for life
740851 there are two very good reasons why she should under no circumstances be his wife in the first place we are very safe in questioning mr williamsons right to solemnize a marriage
740852 we had a license for the marriage i have it here in my pocket
740853 then you got it by a trick but in any case a forced marriage is no marriage but it is a very serious felony as you will discover before you have finished youll have time to think the point out during the next ten years or so unless i am mistaken as to you carruthers you would have done better to keep your pistol in your pocket
740854 i begin to think so mr holmes but when i thought of all the precaution i had taken to shield this girl for i loved her mr holmes and it is the only time that ever i knew what love was it fairly drove me mad to think that she was in the power of the greatest brute and bully in south africa a man whose name is a holy terror from kimberley to johannesburg why mr holmes youll hardly believe it but ever since that girl has been in my employment i never once let her go past this house where i knew these rascals were lurking without following her on my bicycle just to see that she came to no harm i kept my distance from her and i wore a beard so that she should not recognise me for she is a good and high spirited girl and she wouldnt have stayed in my employment long if she had thought that i was following her about the country roads
740855 because then again she would have left me and i couldnt bear to face that even if she couldnt love me it was a great deal to me just to see her dainty form about the house and to hear the sound of her voice
740856 you call that love mr carruthers but i should call it selfishness
740857 maybe the two things go together anyhow i couldnt let her go besides with this crowd about it was well that she should have someone near to look after her then when the cable came i knew they were bound to make a move
740858 i think i see how things worked and i can understand how this message would as you say bring them to a head but while we wait you might tell me what you can
740859 if you squeal on us bob carruthers ill serve you as you served jack woodley you can bleat about the girl to your hearts content for thats your own affair but if you round on your pals to this plain clothes copper it will be the worst days work that ever you did
740860 the case is clear enough against you and all i ask is a few details for my private curiosity however if theres any difficulty in your telling me ill do the talking and then you will see how far you have a chance of holding back your secrets in the first place three of you came from south africa on this game you williamson you carruthers and woodley
740861 i never saw either of them until two months ago and i have never been in africa in my life so you can put that in your pipe and smoke it mr busybody holmes
740862 well well two of you came over his reverence is our own home made article you had known ralph smith in south africa you had reason to believe he would not live long you found out that his niece would inherit his fortune hows that eh
740863 she was next of kin no doubt and you were aware that the old fellow would make no will
740864 so you came over the two of you and hunted up the girl the idea was that one of you was to marry her and the other have a share of the plunder for some reason woodley was chosen as the husband why was that
740865 we played cards for her on the voyage he won
740866 i see you got the young lady into your service and there woodley was to do the courting she recognised the drunken brute that he was and would have nothing to do with him meanwhile your arrangement was rather upset by the fact that you had yourself fallen in love with the lady you could no longer bear the idea of this ruffian owning her
740867 there was a quarrel between you he left you in a rage and began to make his own plans independently of you
740868 it strikes me williamson there isnt very much that we can tell this gentleman
740869 yes we quarreled and he knocked me down i am level with him on that anyhow then i lost sight of him that was when he picked up with this cast padre here i found that they had set up house keeping together at this place on the line that she had to pass for the station i kept my eye on her after that for i knew there was some devilry in the wind i saw them from time to time for i was anxious to know what they were after two days ago woodley came up to my house with this cable which showed that ralph smith was dead he asked me if i would stand by the bargain i said i would not he asked me if i would marry the girl myself and give him a share i said i would willingly do so but that she would not have me he said let us get her married first and after a week or two she may see things a bit different i said i would have nothing to do with violence so he went off cursing like the foul mouthed blackguard that he was and swearing that he would have her yet she was leaving me this week end and i had got a trap to take her to the station but i was so uneasy in my mind that i followed her on my bicycle she had got a start however and before i could catch her the mischief was done the first thing i knew about it was when i saw you two gentlemen driving back in her dog cart
740870 when in your report you said that you had seen the cyclist as you thought arrange his necktie in the shrubbery that alone should have told me all however we may congratulate ourselves upon a curious and in some respects a unique case i perceive three of the county constabulary in the drive and i am glad to see that the little ostler is able to keep pace with them so it is likely that neither he nor the interesting bridegroom will be permanently damaged by their mornings adventures i think watson that in your medical capacity you might wait upon miss smith and tell her that if she is sufficiently recovered we shall be happy to escort her to her mothers home if she is not quite convalescent you will find that a hint that we were about to telegraph to a young electrician in the midlands would probably complete the cure as to you mr carruthers i think that you have done what you could to make amends for your share in an evil plot there is my card sir and if my evidence can be of help to you in your trial it shall be at your disposal
740871 it is not twelve oclock yet he has certainly been an early starter
740872 forgive this weakness mr holmes i have been a little overwrought thank you if i might have a glass of milk and a biscuit i have no doubt that i should be better i came personally mr holmes in order to ensure that you would return with me i feared that no telegram would convince you of the absolute urgency of the case
740873 i am quite well again i cannot imagine how i came to be so weak i wish you mr holmes to come to mackleton with me by the next train
740874 my colleague dr watson could tell you that we are very busy at present i am retained in this case of the ferrers documents and the abergavenny murder is coming up for trial only a very important issue could call me from london at present
740875 have you heard nothing of the abduction of the only son of the duke of holdernesse
740876 exactly we had tried to keep it out of the papers but there was some rumour in the globe last night i thought it might have reached your ears
740877 holdernesse 6th duke k g p c half the alphabet baron beverley earl of carston dear me what a list lord lieutenant of hallamshire since 1900 married edith daughter of sir charles appledore 1888 heir and only child lord saltire owns about two hundred and fifty thousand acres minerals in lancashire and wales address carlton house terrace holdernesse hall hallamshire carston castle bangor wales lord of the admiralty 1872 chief secretary of state for well well this man is certainly one of the greatest subjects of the crown
740878 the greatest and perhaps the wealthiest i am aware mr holmes that you take a very high line in professional matters and that you are prepared to work for the works sake i may tell you however that his grace has already intimated that a cheque for five thousand pounds will be handed over to the person who can tell him where his son is and another thousand to him who can name the man or men who have taken him
740879 watson i think that we shall accompany dr huxtable back to the north of england and now dr huxtable when you have consumed that milk you will kindly tell me what has happened when it happened how it happened and finally what dr thorneycroft huxtable of the priory school near mackleton has to do with the matter and why he comes three days after an event the state of your chin gives the date to ask for my humble services
740880 i must inform you gentlemen that the priory is a
740881 on may 1st the boy arrived that being the beginning of
740882 he was last seen on the night of may 13th that is the
740883 he had been with me for two years and came with the best references but he was a silent morose man not very popular either with masters or boys no trace could be found of the fugitives and now on thursday morning we are as ignorant as we were on tuesday inquiry was of course made at once at holdernesse hall it is only a few miles away and we imagined that in some sudden attack of home sickness he had gone back to his father but nothing had been heard of him the duke is greatly agitated and as to me you have seen yourselves the state of nervous prostration to which the suspense and the responsibility have reduced me mr holmes if ever you put forward your full powers i implore you to do so now for never in your life could you have a case which is more worthy of them
740884 you have been very remiss in not coming to me sooner
740885 you start me on my investigation with a very serious handicap it is inconceivable for example that this ivy and this lawn would have yielded nothing to an expert observer
740886 i am not to blame mr holmes his grace was extremely desirous to avoid all public scandal he was afraid of his family unhappiness being dragged before the world he has a deep horror of anything of the kind
740887 yes sir and it has proved most disappointing an apparent clue was at once obtained since a boy and a young man were reported to have been seen leaving a neighbouring station by an early train only last night we had news that the couple had been hunted down in liverpool and they prove to have no connection whatever with the matter in hand then it was that in my despair and disappointment after a sleepless night i came straight to you by the early train
740888 i suppose the local investigation was relaxed while this false clue was being followed up
740889 so that three days have been wasted the affair has been most deplorably handled
740890 and yet the problem should be capable of ultimate solution i shall be very happy to look into it have you been able to trace any connection between the missing boy and this german master
740891 no he never exchanged a word with him so far as i know
740892 that is certainly very singular had the boy a bicycle
740893 well now you do not mean to seriously suggest that this german rode off upon a bicycle in the dead of the night bearing the boy in his arms
740894 the bicycle may have been a blind it may have been hidden somewhere and the pair gone off on foot
740895 quite so but it seems rather an absurd blind does it not were there other bicycles in this shed
740896 would he not have hidden a couple had he desired to give the idea that they had gone off upon them
740897 of course he would the blind theory wont do but the incident is an admirable starting point for an investigation after all a bicycle is not an easy thing to conceal or to destroy one other question did anyone call to see the boy on the day before he disappeared
740898 the coat of arms was on the envelope and it was addressed in the dukes peculiar stiff hand besides the duke remembers having written
740899 you see the point of my questions of course either the boy was carried off by force or he went of his own free will in the latter case you would expect that some prompting from outside would be needed to make so young a lad do such a thing if he has had no visitors that prompting must have come in letters hence i try to find out who were his correspondents
740900 i fear i cannot help you much his only correspondent so far as i know was his own father
740901 who wrote to him on the very day of his disappearance were the relations between father and son very friendly
740902 his grace is never very friendly with anyone he is completely immersed in large public questions and is rather inaccessible to all ordinary emotions but he was always kind to the boy in his own way
740903 but the sympathies of the latter were with the mother
740904 i have had some confidential talks with mr james wilder his graces secretary it was he who gave me the information about lord saltires feelings
740905 i see by the way that last letter of the dukes was it found in the boys room after he was gone
740906 no he had taken it with him i think mr holmes it is time that we were leaving for euston
740907 i will order a four wheeler in a quarter of an hour we shall be at your service if you are telegraphing home mr huxtable it would be well to allow the people in your neighbourhood to imagine that the inquiry is still going on in liverpool or wherever else that red herring led your pack in the meantime i will do a little quiet work at your own doors and perhaps the scent is not so cold but that two old hounds like watson and myself may get a sniff of it
740908 the duke and mr wilder are in the study come gentlemen and i will introduce you
740909 i called this morning dr huxtable too late to prevent you from starting for london i learned that your object was to invite mr sherlock holmes to undertake the conduct of this case his grace is surprised dr huxtable that you should have taken such a step without consulting him
740910 his grace is by no means convinced that the police have failed
740911 you are well aware dr huxtable that his grace is particularly anxious to avoid all public scandal he prefers to take as few people as possible into his confidence
740912 mr sherlock holmes can return to london by the morning train
740913 this northern air is invigorating and pleasant so i propose to spend a few days upon your moors and to occupy my mind as best i may whether i have the shelter of your roof or of the village inn is of course for you to decide
740914 i agree with mr wilder dr huxtable that you would have done wisely to consult me but since mr holmes has already been taken into your confidence it would indeed be absurd that we should not avail ourselves of his services far from going to the inn mr holmes i should be pleased if you would come and stay with me at holdernesse hall
740915 i thank your grace for the purposes of my investigation i think that it would be wiser for me to remain at the scene of the mystery
740916 just as you like mr holmes any information which mr wilder or i can give you is of course at your disposal
740917 it will probably be necessary for me to see you at the hall
740918 i would only ask you now sir whether you have formed any explanation in your own mind as to the mysterious disappearance of your son
740919 excuse me if i allude to that which is painful to you but i have no alternative do you think that the duchess had anything to do with the matter
740920 the other most obvious explanation is that the child has been kidnapped for the purpose of levying ransom you have not had any demand of the sort
740921 one more question your grace i understand that you wrote to your son upon the day when this incident occurred
740922 was there anything in your letter which might have unbalanced him or induced him to take such a step
740923 his grace is not in the habit of posting letters himself
740924 this letter was laid with others upon the study table and i myself put them in the post bag
740925 twenty or thirty i have a large correspondence but surely this is somewhat irrelevant
740926 i have advised the police to turn their attention to the south of france i have already said that i do not believe that the duchess would encourage so monstrous an action but the lad had the most wrong headed opinions and it is possible that he may have fled to her aided and abetted by this german i think dr huxtable that we will now return to the hall
740927 look at this map this dark square is the priory school ill put a pin in it now this line is the main road you see that it runs east and west past the school and you see also that there is no side road for a mile either way if these two folk passed away by road it was this road
740928 by a singular and happy chance we are able to some extent to check what passed along this road during the night in question at this point where my pipe is now resting a country constable was on duty from twelve to six it is as you perceive the first cross road on the east side this man declares that he was not absent from his post for an instant and he is positive that neither boy nor man could have gone that way unseen i have spoken with this policeman to night and he appears to me to be a perfectly reliable person that blocks this end we have now to deal with the other there is an inn here the red bull the landlady of which was ill she had sent to mackleton for a doctor but he did not arrive until morning being absent at another case the people at the inn were alert all night awaiting his coming and one or other of them seems to have continually had an eye upon the road they declare that no one passed if their evidence is good then we are fortunate enough to be able to block the west and also to be able to say that the fugitives did not use the road at all
740929 quite so we will come to the bicycle presently to continue our reasoning if these people did not go by the road they must have traversed the country to the north of the house or to the south of the house that is certain let us weigh the one against the other on the south of the house is as you perceive a large district of arable land cut up into small fields with stone walls between them there i admit that a bicycle is impossible we can dismiss the idea we turn to the country on the north here there lies a grove of trees marked as the ragged shaw and on the farther side stretches a great rolling moor lower gill moor extending for ten miles and sloping gradually upwards here at one side of this wilderness is holdernesse hall ten miles by road but only six across the moor it is a peculiarly desolate plain a few moor farmers have small holdings where they rear sheep and cattle except these the plover and the curlew are the only inhabitants until you come to the chesterfield high road there is a church there you see a few cottages and an inn beyond that the hills become precipitous surely it is here to the north that our quest must lie
740930 a good cyclist does not need a high road the moor is intersected with paths and the moon was at the full halloa what is this
740931 thank heaven at last we are on the dear boys track it is his cap
740932 in the van of the gipsies who camped on the moor they left on tuesday to day the police traced them down and examined their caravan this was found
740933 they shuffled and lied said that they found it on the moor on tuesday morning they know where he is the rascals thank goodness they are all safe under lock and key either the fear of the law or the dukes purse will certainly get out of them all that they know
740934 it at least bears out the theory that it is on the side of the lower gill moor that we must hope for results the police have really done nothing locally save the arrest of these gipsies look here watson there is a watercourse across the moor you see it marked here in the map in some parts it widens into a morass this is particularly so in the region between holdernesse hall and the school it is vain to look elsewhere for tracks in this dry weather but at that point there is certainly a chance of some record being left i will call you early to morrow morning and you and i will try if we can throw some little light upon the mystery
740935 i have also had a ramble through the ragged shaw now watson there is cocoa ready in the next room i must beg you to hurry for we have a great day before us
740936 there is another morass down yonder and a narrow neck between halloa halloa halloa what have we here
740937 i am familiar with forty two different impressions left by tyres this as you perceive is a dunlop with a patch upon the outer cover heideggers tyres were palmers leaving longitudinal stripes aveling the mathematical master was sure upon the point therefore it is not heideggers track
740938 possibly if we could prove a bicycle to have been in his possession but this we have utterly failed to do this track as you perceive was made by a rider who was going from the direction of the school
740939 no no my dear watson the more deeply sunk impression is of course the hind wheel upon which the weight rests you perceive several places where it has passed across and obliterated the more shallow mark of the front one it was undoubtedly heading away from the school it may or may not be connected with our inquiry but we will follow it backwards before we go any farther
740940 it is of course possible that a cunning man might change the tyre of his bicycle in order to leave unfamiliar tracks a criminal who was capable of such a thought is a man whom i should be proud to do business with we will leave this question undecided and hark back to our morass again for we have left a good deal unexplored
740941 but we have a long way still to go kindly walk clear of the path now let us follow the trail i fear that it will not lead very far
740942 that the rider is now undoubtedly forcing the pace there can be no doubt of it look at this impression where you get both tyres clear the one is as deep as the other that can only mean that the rider is throwing his weight on to the handle bar as a man does when he is sprinting by jove he has had a fall
740943 bad stand clear watson not an unnecessary footstep what do i read here he fell wounded he stood up he remounted he proceeded but there is no other track cattle on this side path he was surely not gored by a bull impossible but i see no traces of anyone else we must push on watson surely with stains as well as the track to guide us he cannot escape us now
740944 it is a little difficult to know what to do watson
740945 my own inclinations are to push this inquiry on for we have already lost so much time that we cannot afford to waste another hour on the other hand we are bound to inform the police of the discovery and to see that this poor fellows body is looked after
740946 but i need your company and assistance wait a bit there is a fellow cutting peat up yonder bring him over here and he will guide the police
740947 we have picked up two clues this morning one is the bicycle with the palmer tyre and we see what that has led to the other is the bicycle with the patched dunlop before we start to investigate that let us try to realize what we do know so as to make the most of it and to separate the essential from the accidental
740948 first of all i wish to impress upon you that the boy certainly left of his own free will he got down from his window and he went off either alone or with someone that is sure
740949 well now let us turn to this unfortunate german master the boy was fully dressed when he fled therefore he foresaw what he would do but the german went without his socks he certainly acted on very short notice
740950 why did he go because from his bedroom window he saw the flight of the boy because he wished to overtake him and bring him back he seized his bicycle pursued the lad and in pursuing him met his death
740951 now i come to the critical part of my argument the natural action of a man in pursuing a little boy would be to run after him he would know that he could overtake him but the german does not do so he turns to his bicycle i am told that he was an excellent cyclist he would not do this if he did not see that the boy had some swift means of escape
740952 let us continue our reconstruction he meets his death five miles from the school not by a bullet mark you which even a lad might conceivably discharge but by a savage blow dealt by a vigorous arm the lad then had a companion in his flight and the flight was a swift one since it took five miles before an expert cyclist could overtake them yet we survey the ground round the scene of the tragedy what do we find a few cattle tracks nothing more i took a wide sweep round and there is no path within fifty yards another cyclist could have had nothing to do with the actual murder nor were there any human footmarks
740953 a most illuminating remark it is impossible as i state it and therefore i must in some respect have stated it wrong yet you saw for yourself can you suggest any fallacy
740954 he could not have fractured his skull in a fall
740955 tut tut we have solved some worse problems at least we have plenty of material if we can only use it come then and having exhausted the palmer let us see what the dunlop with the patched cover has to offer us
740956 who are you and how do you get my name so pat
740957 well its printed on the board above your head its easy to see a man who is master of his own house i suppose you havent such a thing as a carriage in your stables
740958 this is really rather an awkward fix for me i dont mind how i get on
740959 the matter is very important i would offer you a sovereign for the use of a bicycle
740960 he has been heard of in liverpool they expect to get him every hour
740961 ive less reason to wish the dook well than most men
740962 for i was his head coachman once and cruel bad he treated me it was him that sacked me without a character on the word of a lying corn chandler but im glad to hear that the young lord was heard of in liverpool and ill help you to take the news to the hall
740963 well have some food first then you can bring round the bicycle
740964 i tell you man that i havent got one ill let you have two horses as far as the hall
740965 well talk about it when weve had something to eat
740966 yes yes it must be so watson do you remember seeing any cow tracks to day
740967 well everywhere they were at the morass and again on the path and again near where poor heidegger met his death
740968 exactly well now watson how many cows did you see on the moor
740969 strange watson that we should see tracks all along our line but never a cow on the whole moor very strange watson eh
740970 now watson make an effort throw your mind back can you see those tracks upon the path
740971 can you recall that the tracks were sometimes like that watson
740972 but i can i could swear to it however we will go back at our leisure and verify it what a blind beetle i have been not to draw my conclusion
740973 only that it is a remarkable cow which walks canters and gallops by george watson it was no brain of a country publican that thought out such a blind as that the coast seems to be clear save for that lad in the smithy let us slip out and see what we can see
740974 old shoes but newly shod old shoes but new nails this case deserves to be a classic let us go across to the smithy
740975 one might think that you were afraid of our finding something out
740976 youre welcome to all you can find out in my smithy
740977 but look here mister i dont care for folk poking about my place without my leave so the sooner you pay your score and get out of this the better i shall be pleased
740978 we have been having a look at your horses but i think ill walk after all its not far i believe
740979 not more than two miles to the hall gates thats the road to the left
740980 we were warm as the children say at that inn
740981 i seem to grow colder every step that i take away from it no no i cant possibly leave it
740982 that this reuben hayes knows all about it a more self evident villain i never saw
740983 oh he impressed you in that way did he there are the horses there is the smithy yes it is an interesting place this fighting cock i think we shall have another look at it in an unobtrusive way
740984 a single man in a dog cart so far as i could see well it certainly was not mr james wilder for there he is at the door
740985 it seems to be a curious class of custom that is done by the fighting cock
740986 quite so these are what one may call the private guests now what in the world is mr james wilder doing in that den at this hour of night and who is the companion who comes to meet him there come watson we must really take a risk and try to investigate this a little more closely
740987 i must have a peep through that watson if you bend your back and support yourself upon the wall i think that i can manage
740988 our days work has been quite long enough i think that we have gathered all that we can its a long walk to the school and the sooner we get started the better
740989 i promise that before to morrow evening we shall have reached the solution of the mystery
740990 you have come to see his grace i am sorry but the fact is that the duke is far from well he has been very much upset by the tragic news we received a telegram from dr huxtable yesterday afternoon which told us of your discovery
740991 very good mr holmes i will tell him that you are here
740992 i think your grace that i could speak more freely in mr wilders absence
740993 yes yes you had better go now mr holmes what have you to say
740994 that my colleague dr watson and myself had an assurance from dr huxtable that a reward had been offered in this case i should like to have this confirmed from your own lips
740995 it amounted if i am correctly informed to five thousand pounds to anyone who will tell you where your son is
740996 and another thousand to the man who will name the person or persons who keep him in custody
740997 under the latter heading is included no doubt not only those who may have taken him away but also those who conspire to keep him in his present position
740998 if you do your work well mr sherlock holmes you will have no reason to complain of niggardly treatment
740999 i fancy that i see your graces cheque book upon the table
741000 i should be glad if you would make me out a cheque for six thousand pounds it would be as well perhaps for you to cross it the capital and counties bank oxford street branch are my agents
741001 is this a joke mr holmes it is hardly a subject for pleasantry
741002 not at all your grace i was never more earnest in my life
741003 i mean that i have earned the reward i know where your son is and i know some at least of those who are holding him
741004 he is or was last night at the fighting cock inn about two miles from your park gate
741005 and now your grace ill trouble you for that cheque
741006 i shall be as good as my word mr holmes i am about to write your cheque however unwelcome the information which you have gained may be to me when the offer was first made i little thought the turn which events might take but you and your friend are men of discretion mr holmes
741007 i must put it plainly mr holmes if only you two know of this incident there is no reason why it should go any farther i think twelve thousand pounds is the sum that i owe you is it not
741008 i fear your grace that matters can hardly be arranged so easily there is the death of this schoolmaster to be accounted for
741009 but james knew nothing of that you cannot hold him responsible for that it was the work of this brutal ruffian whom he had the misfortune to employ
741010 i must take the view your grace that when a man embarks upon a crime he is morally guilty of any other crime which may spring from it
741011 morally mr holmes no doubt you are right but surely not in the eyes of the law a man cannot be condemned for a murder at which he was not present and which he loathes and abhors as much as you do the instant that he heard of it he made a complete confession to me so filled was he with horror and remorse he lost not an hour in breaking entirely with the murderer oh mr holmes you must save him you must save him i tell you that you must save him
741012 i appreciate your conduct in coming here before you spoke to anyone else
741013 at least we may take counsel how far we can minimize this hideous scandal
741014 i think your grace that this can only be done by absolute and complete frankness between us i am disposed to help your grace to the best of my ability but in order to do so i must understand to the last detail how the matter stands i realize that your words applied to mr james wilder and that he is not the murderer
741015 your grace can hardly have heard of any small reputation which i possess or you would not imagine that it is so easy to escape me mr reuben hayes was arrested at chesterfield on my information at eleven oclock last night i had a telegram from the head of the local police before i left the school this morning
741016 so reuben hayes is taken i am right glad to hear it if it will not react upon the fate of james
741017 i confess that this is entirely new to me your grace i must beg you to be more explicit
741018 i will conceal nothing from you i agree with you that
741019 james came into contact with this fellow hayes because the
741020 well mr holmes that was the state of affairs when i
741021 what brought all his wicked scheme to wreck was your discovery of this man heideggers dead body james was seized with horror at the news it came to us yesterday as we sat together in this study dr huxtable had sent a telegram james was so overwhelmed with grief and agitation that my suspicions which had never been entirely absent rose instantly to a certainty and i taxed him with the deed he made a complete voluntary confession then he implored me to keep his secret for three days longer so as to give his wretched accomplice a chance of saving his guilty life i yielded as i have always yielded to his prayers and instantly james hurried off to the fighting cock to warn hayes and give him the means of flight i could not go there by daylight without provoking comment but as soon as night fell i hurried off to see my dear arthur i found him safe and well but horrified beyond expression by the dreadful deed he had witnessed in deference to my promise and much against my will i consented to leave him there for three days under the charge of mrs hayes since it was evident that it was impossible to inform the police where he was without telling them also who was the murderer and i could not see how that murderer could be punished without ruin to my unfortunate james you asked for frankness mr holmes and i have taken you at your word for i have now told you everything without an attempt at circumlocution or concealment do you in your turn be as frank with me
741022 in the first place your grace i am bound to tell you that you have placed yourself in a most serious position in the eyes of the law you have condoned a felony and you have aided the escape of a murderer for i cannot doubt that any money which was taken by james wilder to aid his accomplice in his flight came from your graces purse
741023 this is indeed a most serious matter even more culpable in my opinion your grace is your attitude towards your younger son you leave him in this den for three days
741024 what are promises to such people as these you have no guarantee that he will not be spirited away again to humour your guilty elder son you have exposed your innocent younger son to imminent and unnecessary danger it was a most unjustifiable action
741025 i will help you but on one condition only it is that you ring for the footman and let me give such orders as i like
741026 having secured the future we can afford to be more lenient with the past i am not in an official position and there is no reason so long as the ends of justice are served why i should disclose all that i know as to hayes i say nothing the gallows awaits him and i would do nothing to save him from it what he will divulge i cannot tell but i have no doubt that your grace could make him understand that it is to his interest to be silent from the police point of view he will have kidnapped the boy for the purpose of ransom if they do not themselves find it out i see no reason why i should prompt them to take a broader point of view i would warn your grace however that the continued presence of mr james wilder in your household can only lead to misfortune
741027 i understand that mr holmes and it is already settled that he shall leave me for ever and go to seek his fortune in australia
741028 in that case your grace since you have yourself stated that any unhappiness in your married life was caused by his presence i would suggest that you make such amends as you can to the duchess and that you try to resume those relations which have been so unhappily interrupted
741029 that also i have arranged mr holmes i wrote to the duchess this morning
741030 i think that my friend and i can congratulate ourselves upon several most happy results from our little visit to the north there is one other small point upon which i desire some light this fellow hayes had shod his horses with shoes which counterfeited the tracks of cows was it from mr wilder that he learned so extraordinary a device
741031 were dug up in the moat of holdernesse hall they are for the use of horses but they are shaped below with a cloven foot of iron so as to throw pursuers off the track they are supposed to have belonged to some of the marauding barons of holdernesse in the middle ages
741032 it is the second most interesting object that i have seen in the north
741033 you dont mean to say that you have been walking about london with that thing
741034 and i return with an excellent appetite there can be no question my dear watson of the value of exercise before breakfast but i am prepared to bet that you will not guess the form that my exercise has taken
741035 if you could have looked into allardyces back shop you would have seen a dead pig swung from a hook in the ceiling and a gentleman in his shirt sleeves furiously stabbing at it with this weapon i was that energetic person and i have satisfied myself that by no exertion of my strength can i transfix the pig with a single blow perhaps you would care to try
741036 because it seemed to me to have an indirect bearing upon the mystery of woodmans lee ah hopkins i got your wire last night and i have been expecting you come and join us
741037 no thank you sir i breakfasted before i came round i spent the night in town for i came up yesterday to report
741038 dear me i must have a look at the matter
741039 i wish to heavens that you would mr holmes its my first big chance and i am at my wits end for goodness sake come down and lend me a hand
741040 well well it just happens that i have already read all the available evidence including the report of the inquest with some care by the way what do you make of that tobacco pouch found on the scene of the crime is there no clue there
741041 it was the mans own pouch sir his initials were inside it and it was of seal skin and he an old sealer
741042 no sir we could find no pipe indeed he smoked very little and yet he might have kept some tobacco for his friends
741043 no doubt i only mention it because if i had been handling the case i should have been inclined to make that the starting point of my investigation however my friend dr watson knows nothing of this matter and i should be none the worse for hearing the sequence of events once more just give us some short sketch of the essentials
741044 i have a few dates here which will give you the career of
741045 he was summoned once for a savage assault upon the old vicar
741046 you must have read in the account of the inquest about the
741047 on the tuesday peter carey was in one of his blackest
741048 well i have fairly steady nerves as you know mr
741049 i know your methods sir and i applied them before i permitted anything to be moved i examined most carefully the ground outside and also the floor of the room there were no footmarks
741050 my good hopkins i have investigated many crimes but i have never yet seen one which was committed by a flying creature as long as the criminal remains upon two legs so long must there be some indentation some abrasion some trifling displacement which can be detected by the scientific searcher it is incredible that this blood bespattered room contained no trace which could have aided us i understand however from the inquest that there were some objects which you failed to overlook
741051 i was a fool not to call you in at the time mr holmes however thats past praying for now yes there were several objects in the room which called for special attention one was the harpoon with which the deed was committed it had been snatched down from a rack on the wall two others remained there and there was a vacant place for the third on the stock was engraved ss sea unicorn dundee this seemed to establish that the crime had been done in a moment of fury and that the murderer had seized the first weapon which came in his way the fact that the crime was committed at two in the morning and yet peter carey was fully dressed suggested that he had an appointment with the murderer which is borne out by the fact that a bottle of rum and two dirty glasses stood upon the table
741052 i think that both inferences are permissible was there any other spirit but rum in the room
741053 yes there was a tantalus containing brandy and whisky on the sea chest it is of no importance to us however since the decanters were full and it had therefore not been used
741054 however let us hear some more about the objects which do seem to you to bear upon the case
741055 it lay in the middle it was of coarse seal skin the straight haired skin with a leather thong to bind it inside was p c on the flap there was half an ounce of strong ships tobacco in it
741056 they appear to be lists of stock exchange securities i thought that j h n were the initials of a broker and that c p r may have been his client
741057 of course it is as you say then j h n are the only initials we have to solve i have already examined the old stock exchange lists and i can find no one in 1883 either in the house or among the outside brokers whose initials correspond with these yet i feel that the clue is the most important one that i hold you will admit mr holmes that there is a possibility that these initials are those of the second person who was present in other words of the murderer i would also urge that the introduction into the case of a document relating to large masses of valuable securities gives us for the first time some indication of a motive for the crime
741058 i confess that this note book which did not appear at the inquest modifies any views which i may have formed i had come to a theory of the crime in which i can find no place for this have you endeavoured to trace any of the securities here mentioned
741059 inquiries are now being made at the offices but i fear that the complete register of the stockholders of these south american concerns is in south america and that some weeks must elapse before we can trace the shares
741060 yes sir it is a blood stain i told you that i picked the book off the floor
741061 which proves of course that the book was dropped after the crime was committed
741062 exactly mr holmes i appreciated that point and i conjectured that it was dropped by the murderer in his hurried flight it lay near the door
741063 i suppose that none of these securities have been found among the property of the dead man
741064 dear me it is certainly a very interesting case then there was a knife was there not
741065 a sheath knife still in its sheath it lay at the feet of the dead man mrs carey has identified it as being her husbands property
741066 i suppose i shall have to come out and have a look at it
741067 thank you sir that will indeed be a weight off my mind
741068 it would have been an easier task a week ago
741069 but even now my visit may not be entirely fruitless watson if you can spare the time i should be very glad of your company if you will call a four wheeler hopkins we shall be ready to start for forest row in a quarter of an hour
741070 someone has tried to force this also whoever it was has failed to make his way in he must have been a very poor burglar
741071 i could swear that these marks were not here yesterday evening
741072 very unlikely few of them would dare to set foot in the grounds far less try to force their way into the cabin what do you think of it mr holmes
741073 it is very probable he came expecting to find the door open he tried to get in with the blade of a very small penknife he could not manage it what would he do
741074 so i should say it will be our fault if we are not there to receive him meanwhile let me see the inside of the cabin
741075 something has been taken there is less dust in this corner of the shelf than elsewhere it may have been a book lying on its side it may have been a box well well i can do nothing more let us walk in these beautiful woods watson and give a few hours to the birds and the flowers we shall meet you here later hopkins and see if we can come to closer quarters with the gentleman who has paid this visit in the night
741076 you imagine i am connected with the death of captain peter carey i assure you that i am innocent
741077 if you have no answer it may go badly with you at the trial
741078 why should i not and yet i hate to think of this old scandal gaining a new lease of life did you ever hear of dawson and neligan
741079 they failed for a million ruined half the county families of cornwall and neligan disappeared
741080 it was my father who was really concerned dawson had
741081 naturally i made some inquiries about the man i found
741082 i came down to sussex with the intention of seeing the captain but it was at this moment that his terrible death occurred i read at the inquest a description of his cabin in which it stated that the old log books of his vessel were preserved in it it struck me that if i could see what occurred in the month of august 1883 on board the sea unicorn i might settle the mystery of my fathers fate i tried last night to get at these log books but was unable to open the door to night i tried again and succeeded but i find that the pages which deal with that month have been torn from the book it was at that moment i found myself a prisoner in your hands
741083 i did not know i thought i had lost it at the hotel
741084 whatever else you have to say you must say in court you will walk down with me now to the police station well mr holmes i am very much obliged to you and to your friend for coming down to help me as it turns out your presence was unnecessary and i would have brought the case to this successful issue without you but none the less i am very grateful rooms have been reserved for you at the brambletye hotel so we can all walk down to the village together
741085 oh yes my dear watson i am perfectly satisfied at the same time stanley hopkinss methods do not commend themselves to me i am disappointed in stanley hopkins i had hoped for better things from him one should always look for a possible alternative and provide against it it is the first rule of criminal investigation
741086 the line of investigation which i have myself been pursuing it may give us nothing i cannot tell but at least i shall follow it to the end
741087 excellent watson the alternative develops have you telegraph forms just write a couple of messages for me sumner shipping agent ratcliff highway send three men on to arrive ten to morrow morning basil thats my name in those parts the other is inspector stanley hopkins 46 lord street brixton come breakfast to morrow at nine thirty important wire if unable to come sherlock holmes there watson this infernal case has haunted me for ten days i hereby banish it completely from my presence to morrow i trust that we shall hear the last of it for ever
741088 you astonish me mr holmes what more could one ask for
741089 undoubtedly i find that young neligan arrived at the brambletye hotel on the very day of the crime he came on the pretence of playing golf his room was on the ground floor and he could get out when he liked that very night he went down to woodmans lee saw peter carey at the hut quarrelled with him and killed him with the harpoon then horrified by what he had done he fled out of the hut dropping the note book which he had brought with him in order to question peter carey about these different securities you may have observed that some of them were marked with ticks and the others the great majority were not those which are ticked have been traced on the london market but the others presumably were still in the possession of carey and young neligan according to his own account was anxious to recover them in order to do the right thing by his fathers creditors after his flight he did not dare to approach the hut again for some time but at last he forced himself to do so in order to obtain the information which he needed surely that is all simple and obvious
741090 it seems to me to have only one drawback hopkins and that is that it is intrinsically impossible have you tried to drive a harpoon through a body no tut tut my dear sir you must really pay attention to these details my friend watson could tell you that i spent a whole morning in that exercise it is no easy matter and requires a strong and practised arm but this blow was delivered with such violence that the head of the weapon sank deep into the wall do you imagine that this anaemic 1 youth was capable of so frightful an assault is he the man who hobnobbed in rum and water with black peter in the dead of the night was it his profile that was seen on the blind two nights before no no hopkins it is another and a more formidable person for whom we must seek
741091 you cant deny that neligan was present that night mr holmes the book will prove that i fancy that i have evidence enough to satisfy a jury even if you are able to pick a hole in it besides mr holmes i have laid my hand upon my man as to this terrible person of yours where is he
741092 i think watson that you would do well to put that revolver where you can reach it
741093 i am sorry lancaster but the berth is full here is half a sovereign for your trouble just step into this room and wait there for a few minutes
741094 heres the agreement on the side table if you sign it the whole matter will be settled
741095 i fear that the scrambled eggs are cold however you will enjoy the rest of your breakfast all the better will you not for the thought that you have brought your case to a triumphant conclusion
741096 it seems to me that i have been making a fool of myself from the beginning i understand now what i should never have forgotten that i am the pupil and you are the master even now i see what you have done but i dont know how you did it or what it signifies
741097 we all learn by experience and your lesson this time is that you should never lose sight of the alternative you were so absorbed in young neligan that you could not spare a thought to patrick cairns the true murderer of peter carey
741098 i make no complaint of being man handled in this fashion but i would have you call things by their right names you say i murdered peter carey i say i killed peter carey and theres all the difference maybe you dont believe what i say maybe you think i am just slinging you a yarn
741099 its soon told and by the lord every word of it is truth i knew black peter and when he pulled out his knife i whipped a harpoon through him sharp for i knew that it was him or me thats how he died you can call it murder anyhow id as soon die with a rope round my neck as with black peters knife in my heart
741100 ill tell it you from the beginning just sit me up a
741101 well i kept my knowledge to myself and waited to see what
741102 i found out where he was through a sailor man that had met
741103 now ill tell you the queerest part of the whole story
741104 well when i came to examine the box i found there was no money in it and nothing but papers that i would not dare to sell i had lost my hold on black peter and was stranded in london without a shilling there was only my trade left i saw these advertisements about harpooners and high wages so i went to the shipping agents and they sent me here thats all i know and i say again that if i killed black peter the law should give me thanks for i saved them the price of a hempen rope
741105 i think hopkins that you should lose no time in conveying your prisoner to a place of safety this room is not well adapted for a cell and mr patrick cairns occupies too large a proportion of our carpet
741106 i do not know how to express my gratitude even now i do not understand how you attained this result
741107 simply by having the good fortune to get the right clue from the beginning it is very possible that if i had known about this note book it might have led away my thoughts as it did yours but all i heard pointed in the one direction the amazing strength the skill in the use of the harpoon the rum and water the seal skin tobacco pouch with the coarse tobacco all these pointed to a seaman and one who had been a whaler i was convinced that the initials p c upon the pouch were a coincidence and not those of peter carey since he seldom smoked and no pipe was found in his cabin you remember that i asked whether whisky and brandy were in the cabin you said they were how many landsmen are there who would drink rum when they could get these other spirits yes i was certain it was a seaman
741108 my dear sir the problem had become a very simple one if it were a seaman it could only be a seaman who had been with him on the sea unicorn so far as i could learn he had sailed in no other ship i spent three days in wiring to dundee and at the end of that time i had ascertained the names of the crew of the sea unicorn in 1883 when i found patrick cairns among the harpooners my research was nearing its end i argued that the man was probably in london and that he would desire to leave the country for a time i therefore spent some days in the east end devised an arctic expedition put forward tempting terms for harpooners who would serve under captain basil and behold the result
741109 you must obtain the release of young neligan as soon as possible
741110 i confess that i think you owe him some apology the tin box must be returned to him but of course the securities which peter carey has sold are lost for ever theres the cab hopkins and you can remove your man if you want me for the trial my address and that of watson will be somewhere in norway ill send particulars later
741111 hum hes about due do you feel a creeping shrinking sensation watson when you stand before the serpents in the zoo and see the slithery gliding venomous creatures with their deadly eyes and wicked flattened faces well thats how milverton impresses me ive had to do with fifty murderers in my career but the worst of them never gave me the repulsion which i have for this fellow and yet i cant get out of doing business with him indeed he is here at my invitation
741112 ill tell you watson he is the king of all the blackmailers heaven help the man and still more the woman whose secret and reputation come into the power of milverton with a smiling face and a heart of marble he will squeeze and squeeze until he has drained them dry the fellow is a genius in his way and would have made his mark in some more savoury trade his method is as follows he allows it to be known that he is prepared to pay very high sums for letters which compromise people of wealth or position he receives these wares not only from treacherous valets or maids but frequently from genteel ruffians who have gained the confidence and affection of trusting women he deals with no niggard hand i happen to know that he paid seven hundred pounds to a footman for a note two lines in length and that the ruin of a noble family was the result everything which is in the market goes to milverton and there are hundreds in this great city who turn white at his name no one knows where his grip may fall for he is far too rich and far too cunning to work from hand to mouth he will hold a card back for years in order to play it at the moment when the stake is best worth winning i have said that he is the worst man in london and i would ask you how could one compare the ruffian who in hot blood bludgeons his mate with this man who methodically and at his leisure tortures the soul and wrings the nerves in order to add to his already swollen money bags
741113 the fellow must be within the grasp of the law
741114 technically no doubt but practically not what would it profit a woman for example to get him a few months imprisonment if her own ruin must immediately follow his victims dare not hit back if ever he blackmailed an innocent person then indeed we should have him but he is as cunning as the evil one no no we must find other ways to fight him
741115 because an illustrious client has placed her piteous case in my hands it is the lady eva brackwell the most beautiful debutante 1 of last season she is to be married in a fortnight to the earl of dovercourt this fiend has several imprudent letters imprudent watson nothing worse which were written to an impecunious young squire in the country they would suffice to break off the match milverton will send the letters to the earl unless a large sum of money is paid him i have been commissioned to meet him and to make the best terms i can
741116 very good mr holmes it is only in your clients interests
741117 then we can proceed to business you say that you are acting for lady eva has she empowered you to accept my terms
741118 my dear sir it is painful for me to discuss it but if the money is not paid on the 14th there certainly will be no marriage on the 18th
741119 to be taking matters too much for granted i am of course familiar with the contents of these letters my client will certainly do what i may advise i shall counsel her to tell her future husband the whole story and to trust to his generosity
741120 the lady was a charming correspondent but i can assure you that the earl of dovercourt would fail to appreciate them however since you think otherwise we will let it rest at that it is purely a matter of business if you think that it is in the best interests of your client that these letters should be placed in the hands of the earl then you would indeed be foolish to pay so large a sum of money to regain them
741121 you go too fast we would certainly make every effort to avoid scandal in so delicate a matter
741122 i was sure that you would see it in that light
741123 lady eva is not a wealthy woman i assure you that two thousand pounds would be a drain upon her resources and that the sum you name is utterly beyond her power i beg therefore that you will moderate your demands and that you will return the letters at the price i indicate which is i assure you the highest that you can get
741124 i am aware that what you say is true about the ladys resources
741125 at the same time you must admit that the occasion of a ladys marriage is a very suitable time for her friends and relatives to make some little effort upon her behalf they may hesitate as to an acceptable wedding present let me assure them that this little bundle of letters would give more joy than all the candelabra and butter dishes in london
741126 i cannot help thinking that ladies are ill advised in not making an effort look at this
741127 that belongs to well perhaps it is hardly fair to tell the name until to morrow morning but at that time it will be in the hands of the ladys husband and all because she will not find a beggarly sum which she could get in an hour by turning her diamonds into paste it is such a pity now you remember the sudden end of the engagement between the honourable miss miles and colonel dorking only two days before the wedding there was a paragraph in the morning post to say that it was all off and why it is almost incredible but the absurd sum of twelve hundred pounds would have settled the whole question is it not pitiful and here i find you a man of sense boggling about terms when your clients future and honour are at stake you surprise me mr holmes
741128 the money cannot be found surely it is better for you to take the substantial sum which i offer than to ruin this womans career which can profit you in no way
741129 there you make a mistake mr holmes an exposure would profit me indirectly to a considerable extent i have eight or ten similar cases maturing if it was circulated among them that i had made a severe example of the lady eva i should find all of them much more open to reason you see my point
741130 get behind him watson dont let him out now sir let us see the contents of that note book
741131 i have been expecting you to do something original this has been done so often and what good has ever come from it i assure you that i am armed to the teeth and i am perfectly prepared to use my weapons knowing that the law will support me besides your supposition that i would bring the letters here in a note book is entirely mistaken i would do nothing so foolish and now gentlemen i have one or two little interviews this evening and it is a long drive to hampstead
741132 it was a most necessary step i am a plumber with a rising business escott by name i have walked out with her each evening and i have talked with her good heavens those talks however i have got all i wanted i know milvertons house as i know the palm of my hand
741133 you cant help it my dear watson you must play your cards as best you can when such a stake is on the table however i rejoice to say that i have a hated rival who will certainly cut me out the instant that my back is turned what a splendid night it is
741134 it suits my purpose watson i mean to burgle milvertons house to night
741135 my dear fellow i have given it every consideration i am never precipitate in my actions nor would i adopt so energetic and indeed so dangerous a course if any other were possible let us look at the matter clearly and fairly i suppose that you will admit that the action is morally justifiable though technically criminal to burgle his house is no more than to forcibly take his pocket book an action in which you were prepared to aid me
741136 it is morally justifiable so long as our object is to take no articles save those which are used for an illegal purpose
741137 exactly since it is morally justifiable i have only to consider the question of personal risk surely a gentleman should not lay much stress upon this when a lady is in most desperate need of his help
741138 well that is part of the risk there is no other possible way of regaining these letters the unfortunate lady has not the money and there are none of her people in whom she could confide to morrow is the last day of grace and unless we can get the letters to night this villain will be as good as his word and will bring about her ruin i must therefore abandon my client to her fate or i must play this last card between ourselves watson its a sporting duel between this fellow milverton and me he had as you saw the best of the first exchanges but my self respect and my reputation are concerned to fight it to a finish
741139 well i dont like it but i suppose it must be
741140 i give you my word of honour and i never broke it in my life that i will take a cab straight to the police station and give you away unless you let me share this adventure with you
741141 how do you know that you cant tell what may happen anyway my resolution is taken other people beside you have self respect and even reputations
741142 well well my dear fellow be it so we have shared the same room for some years and it would be amusing if we ended by sharing the same cell you know watson i dont mind confessing to you that i have always had an idea that i would have made a highly efficient criminal this is the chance of my lifetime in that direction see here
741143 this is a first class up to date burgling kit with nickel plated jemmy diamond tipped glass cutter adaptable keys and every modern improvement which the march of civilization demands here too is my dark lantern everything is in order have you a pair of silent shoes
741144 i can see that you have a strong natural turn for this sort of thing very good do you make the masks we shall have some cold supper before we start it is now nine thirty at eleven we shall drive as far as church row it is a quarter of an hours walk from there to appledore towers we shall be at work before midnight milverton is a heavy sleeper and retires punctually at ten thirty with any luck we should be back here by two with the lady evas letters in my pocket
741145 these documents are contained in a safe in the fellows study and the study is the ante room of his bed chamber on the other hand like all these stout little men who do themselves well he is a plethoric sleeper agatha thats my fiancee says 2 it is a joke in the servants hall that its impossible to wake the master he has a secretary who is devoted to his interests and never budges from the study all day thats why we are going at night then he has a beast of a dog which roams the garden i met agatha late the last two evenings and she locks the brute up so as to give me a clear run this is the house this big one in its own grounds through the gate now to the right among the laurels we might put on our masks here i think you see there is not a glimmer of light in any of the windows and everything is working splendidly
741146 this door opens straight into the study it would suit us best but it is bolted as well as locked and we should make too much noise getting in come round here theres a greenhouse which opens into the drawing room
741147 i cant quite make it out anyhow we have no time to lose
741148 yes stand by the door if you hear anyone come bolt it on the inside and we can get away as we came if they come the other way we can get through the door if our job is done or hide behind these window curtains if it is not do you understand
741149 youve made me lose a good nights rest my dear i hope youll prove worth it you couldnt come any other time eh
741150 well if you couldnt you couldnt if the countess is a hard mistress you have your chance to get level with her now bless the girl what are you shivering about thats right pull yourself together now let us get down to business
741151 you say that you have five letters which compromise the countess dalbert you want to sell them i want to buy them so far so good it only remains to fix a price i should want to inspect the letters of course if they are really good specimens great heavens is it you
741152 why did you drive me to such extremities i assure you i wouldnt hurt a fly of my own accord but every man has his business and what was i to do i put the price well within your means you would not pay
741153 so you sent the letters to my husband and he the noblest gentleman that ever lived a man whose boots i was never worthy to lace he broke his gallant heart and died you remember that last night when i came through that door i begged and prayed you for mercy and you laughed in my face as you are trying to laugh now only your coward heart cannot keep your lips from twitching yes you never thought to see me here again but it was that night which taught me how i could meet you face to face and alone well charles milverton what have you to say
741154 i have only to raise my voice and i could call my servants and have you arrested but i will make allowance for your natural anger leave the room at once as you came and i will say no more
741155 you will ruin no more lives as you ruined mine you will wring no more hearts as you wrung mine i will free the world of a poisonous thing take that you hound and that and that and that
741156 good morning may i ask if you are very busy just now
741157 i thought that perhaps if you had nothing particular on hand you might care to assist us in a most remarkable case which occurred only last night at hampstead
741158 a murder a most dramatic and remarkable murder i know how keen you are upon these things and i would take it as a great favour if you would step down to appledore towers and give us the benefit of your advice it is no ordinary crime we have had our eyes upon this mr milverton for some time and between ourselves he was a bit of a villain he is known to have held papers which he used for blackmailing purposes these papers have all been burned by the murderers no article of value was taken as it is probable that the criminals were men of good position whose sole object was to prevent social exposure
741159 yes there were two of them they were as nearly as possible captured red handed we have their foot marks we have their description its ten to one that we trace them the first fellow was a bit too active but the second was caught by the under gardener and only got away after a struggle he was a middle sized strongly built man square jaw thick neck moustache a mask over his eyes
741160 the fact is that i knew this fellow milverton that i considered him one of the most dangerous men in london and that i think there are certain crimes which the law cannot touch and which therefore to some extent justify private revenge no its no use arguing i have made up my mind my sympathies are with the criminals rather than with the victim and i will not handle this case
741161 well mr holmes there is no use denying that there is something on my mind and yet it is such an absurd business that i hesitated to bother you about it on the other hand although it is trivial it is undoubtedly queer and i know that you have a taste for all that is out of the common but in my opinion it comes more in dr watsons line than ours
741162 madness anyhow and a queer madness too you wouldnt think there was anyone living at this time of day who had such a hatred of napoleon the first that he would break any image of him that he could see
741163 exactly thats what i said but then when the man commits burglary in order to break images which are not his own that brings it away from the doctor and on to the policeman
741164 burglary this is more interesting let me hear the details
741165 it was at the shop of morse hudson who has a place for
741166 the second case however was more serious and also more
741167 in kennington road and within a few hundred yards of morse hudsons shop there lives a well known medical practitioner named dr barnicot who has one of the largest practices upon the south side of the thames his residence and principal consulting room is at kennington road but he has a branch surgery and dispensary at lower brixton road two miles away this dr barnicot is an enthusiastic admirer of napoleon and his house is full of books pictures and relics of the french emperor some little time ago he purchased from morse hudson two duplicate plaster casts of the famous head of napoleon by the french sculptor devine one of these he placed in his hall in the house at kennington road and the other on the mantelpiece of the surgery at lower brixton well when dr barnicot came down this morning he was astonished to find that his house had been burgled during the night but that nothing had been taken save the plaster head from the hall it had been carried out and had been dashed savagely against the garden wall under which its splintered fragments were discovered
741168 i thought it would please you but i have not got to the end yet dr barnicot was due at his surgery at twelve oclock and you can imagine his amazement when on arriving there he found that the window had been opened in the night and that the broken pieces of his second bust were strewn all over the room it had been smashed to atoms where it stood in neither case were there any signs which could give us a clue as to the criminal or lunatic who had done the mischief now mr holmes you have got the facts
741169 may i ask whether the two busts smashed in dr barnicots rooms were the exact duplicates of the one which was destroyed in morse hudsons shop
741170 such a fact must tell against the theory that the man who breaks them is influenced by any general hatred of napoleon considering how many hundreds of statues of the great emperor must exist in london it is too much to suppose such a coincidence as that a promiscuous iconoclast should chance to begin upon three specimens of the same bust
741171 on the other hand this morse hudson is the purveyor of busts in that part of london and these three were the only ones which had been in his shop for years so although as you say there are many hundreds of statues in london it is very probable that these three were the only ones in that district therefore a local fanatic would begin with them what do you think dr watson
741172 there is the condition which the modern french psychologists have called the idee fixe 1 which may be trifling in character and accompanied by complete sanity in every other way a man who had read deeply about napoleon or who had possibly received some hereditary family injury through the great war might conceivably form such an idee fixe and under its influence be capable of any fantastic outrage
741173 for no amount of idee fixe would enable your interesting monomaniac to find out where these busts were situated
741174 i dont attempt to do so i would only observe that there is a certain method in the gentlemans eccentric proceedings for example in dr barnicots hall where a sound might arouse the family the bust was taken outside before being broken whereas in the surgery where there was less danger of an alarm it was smashed where it stood the affair seems absurdly trifling and yet i dare call nothing trivial when i reflect that some of my most classic cases have had the least promising commencement you will remember watson how the dreadful business of the abernetty family was first brought to my notice by the depth which the parsley had sunk into the butter upon a hot day i cant afford therefore to smile at your three broken busts lestrade and i shall be very much obliged to you if you will let me hear of any fresh developments of so singular a chain of events
741175 dont know may be anything but i suspect it is the sequel of the story of the statues in that case our friend the image breaker has begun operations in another quarter of london theres coffee on the table watson and i have a cab at the door
741176 by george its attempted murder at the least nothing less will hold the london message boy theres a deed of violence indicated in that fellows round shoulders and outstretched neck whats this watson the top steps swilled down and the other ones dry footsteps enough anyhow well well theres lestrade at the front window and we shall soon know all about it
741177 you seemed interested last night mr holmes so i thought perhaps you would be glad to be present now that the affair has taken a very much graver turn
741178 to murder mr harker will you tell these gentlemen exactly what has occurred
741179 that all my life i have been collecting other peoples news and now that a real piece of news has come my own way i am so confused and bothered that i cant put two words together if i had come in here as a journalist i should have interviewed myself and had two columns in every evening paper as it is i am giving away valuable copy by telling my story over and over to a string of different people and i can make no use of it myself however ive heard your name mr sherlock holmes and if youll only explain this queer business i shall be paid for my trouble in telling you the story
741180 it all seems to centre round that bust of napoleon which i
741181 you can see for yourself that anyone going out through that open window could reach the front doorstep by taking a long stride this was clearly what the burglar had done so i went round and opened the door stepping out into the dark i nearly fell over a dead man who was lying there i ran back for a light and there was the poor fellow a great gash in his throat and the whole place swimming in blood he lay on his back his knees drawn up and his mouth horribly open i shall see him in my dreams i had just time to blow on my police whistle and then i must have fainted for i knew nothing more until i found the policeman standing over me in the hall
741182 you shall see the body at the mortuary but we have made nothing of it up to now he is a tall man sunburned very powerful not more than thirty he is poorly dressed and yet does not appear to be a labourer a horn handled clasp knife was lying in a pool of blood beside him whether it was the weapon which did the deed or whether it belonged to the dead man i do not know there was no name on his clothing and nothing in his pockets save an apple some string a shilling map of london and a photograph here it is
741183 we had news of it just before you came it has been found in the front garden of an empty house in campden house road it was broken into fragments i am going round now to see it will you come
741184 the fellow had either very long legs or was a most active man
741185 with an area beneath it was no mean feat to reach that window ledge and open that window getting back was comparatively simple are you coming with us to see the remains of your bust mr harker
741186 though i have no doubt that the first editions of the evening papers are out already with full details its like my luck you remember when the stand fell at doncaster well i was the only journalist in the stand and my journal the only one that had no account of it for i was too shaken to write it and now ill be too late with a murder done on my own doorstep
741187 and yet and yet well we have some suggestive facts to act upon the possession of this trifling bust was worth more in the eyes of this strange criminal than a human life that is one point then there is the singular fact that he did not break it in the house or immediately outside the house if to break it was his sole object
741188 he was rattled and bustled by meeting this other fellow he hardly knew what he was doing
741189 well thats likely enough but i wish to call your attention very particularly to the position of this house in the garden of which the bust was destroyed
741190 it was an empty house and so he knew that he would not be disturbed in the garden
741191 yes but there is another empty house farther up the street which he must have passed before he came to this one why did he not break it there since it is evident that every yard that he carried it increased the risk of someone meeting him
741192 he could see what he was doing here and he could not there that was his reason
741193 now that i come to think of it dr barnicots bust was broken not far from his red lamp well mr holmes what are we to do with that fact
741194 to remember it to docket it we may come on something later which will bear upon it what steps do you propose to take now lestrade
741195 the most practical way of getting at it in my opinion is to identify the dead man there should be no difficulty about that when we have found who he is and who his associates are we should have a good start in learning what he was doing in pitt street last night and who it was who met him and killed him on the doorstep of mr horace harker dont you think so
741196 no doubt and yet it is not quite the way in which i should approach the case
741197 oh you must not let me influence you in any way i suggest that you go on your line and i on mine we can compare notes afterwards and each will supplement the other
741198 if you are going back to pitt street you might see mr horace harker tell him from me that i have quite made up my mind and that it is certain that a dangerous homicidal lunatic with napoleonic delusions was in his house last night it will be useful for his article
741199 dont i well perhaps i dont but i am sure that it will interest mr horace harker and the subscribers of the central press syndicate now watson i think that we shall find that we have a long and rather complex days work before us i should be glad lestrade if you could make it convenient to meet us at baker street at six oclock this evening until then i should like to keep this photograph found in the dead mans pocket it is possible that i may have to ask your company and assistance upon a small expedition which will have to be undertaken to night if my chain of reasoning should prove to be correct until then good bye and good luck
741200 well well we cant expect to have it all our own way watson
741201 we must come back in the afternoon if mr harding will not be here until then i am as you have no doubt surmised endeavouring to trace these busts to their source in order to find if there is not something peculiar which may account for their remarkable fate let us make for mr morse hudson of the kennington road and see if he can throw any light upon the problem
741202 what we pay rates and taxes for i dont know when any ruffian can come in and break ones goods yes sir it was i who sold dr barnicot his two statues disgraceful sir a nihilist plot thats what i make it no one but an anarchist would go about breaking statues red republicans thats what i call em who did i get the statues from i dont see what that has to do with it well if you really want to know i got them from gelder and co in church street stepney they are a well known house in the trade and have been this twenty years how many had i three two and one are three two of dr barnicots and one smashed in broad daylight on my own counter do i know that photograph no i dont yes i do though why its beppo he was a kind of italian piece work man who made himself useful in the shop he could carve a bit and gild and frame and do odd jobs the fellow left me last week and ive heard nothing of him since no i dont know where he came from nor where he went to i have nothing against him while he was here he was gone two days before the bust was smashed
741203 well thats all we could reasonably expect to get from morse hudson
741204 we have this beppo as a common factor both in kennington and in kensington so that is worth a ten mile drive now watson let us make for gelder and co of stepney the source and origin of busts i shall be surprised if we dont get some help down there
741205 yes indeed i know him very well this has always been a respectable establishment and the only time that we have ever had the police in it was over this very fellow it was more than a year ago now he knifed another italian in the street and then he came to the works with the police on his heels and he was taken here beppo was his name his second name i never knew serve me right for engaging a man with such a face but he was a good workman one of the best
741206 the man lived and he got off with a year i have no doubt he is out now but he has not dared to show his nose here we have a cousin of his here and i dare say he could tell you where he is
741207 not a word to the cousin not a word i beg you the matter is very important and the farther i go with it the more important it seems to grow when you referred in your ledger to the sale of those casts i observed that the date was june 3rd of last year could you give me the date when beppo was arrested
741208 i dont think that i need intrude upon your time and patience any more
741209 listen to this it is satisfactory to know that there can be no difference of opinion upon this case since mr lestrade one of the most experienced members of the official force and mr sherlock holmes the well known consulting expert have each come to the conclusion that the grotesque series of incidents which have ended in so tragic a fashion arise from lunacy rather than from deliberate crime no explanation save mental aberration can cover the facts the press watson is a most valuable institution if you only know how to use it and now if you have quite finished we will hark back to kensington and see what the manager of harding brothers has to say to the matter
741210 yes sir i have already read the account in the evening papers mr horace harker is a customer of ours we supplied him with the bust some months ago we ordered three busts of that sort from gelder and co of stepney they are all sold now to whom oh i dare say by consulting our sales book we could very easily tell you yes we have the entries here one to mr harker you see and one to mr josiah brown of laburnum lodge laburnum vale chiswick and one to mr sandeford of lower grove road reading no i have never seen this face which you show me in the photograph you would hardly forget it would you sir for ive seldom seen an uglier have we any italians on the staff yes sir we have several among our workpeople and cleaners i dare say they might get a peep at that sales book if they wanted to there is no particular reason for keeping a watch upon that book well well its a very strange business and i hope that youll let me know if anything comes of your inquiries
741211 we have had a very busy day and not entirely a wasted one
741212 we have seen both the retailers and also the wholesale manufacturers i can trace each of the busts now from the beginning
741213 well well you have your own methods mr sherlock holmes and it is not for me to say a word against them but i think i have done a better days work than you i have identified the dead man
741214 we have an inspector who makes a specialty of saffron hill and the italian quarter well this dead man had some catholic emblem round his neck and that along with his colour made me think he was from the south inspector hill knew him the moment he caught sight of him his name is pietro venucci from naples and he is one of the greatest cut throats in london he is connected with the mafia which as you know is a secret political society enforcing its decrees by murder now you see how the affair begins to clear up the other fellow is probably an italian also and a member of the mafia he has broken the rules in some fashion pietro is set upon his track probably the photograph we found in his pocket is the man himself so that he may not knife the wrong person he dogs the fellow he sees him enter a house he waits outside for him and in the scuffle he receives his own death wound how is that mr sherlock holmes
741215 but i didnt quite follow your explanation of the destruction of the busts
741216 the busts you never can get those busts out of your head after all that is nothing petty larceny six months at the most it is the murder that we are really investigating and i tell you that i am gathering all the threads into my hands
741217 is a very simple one i shall go down with hill to the italian quarter find the man whose photograph we have got and arrest him on the charge of murder will you come with us
741218 i think not i fancy we can attain our end in a simpler way i cant say for certain because it all depends well it all depends upon a factor which is completely outside our control but i have great hopes in fact the betting is exactly two to one that if you will come with us to night i shall be able to help you to lay him by the heels
741219 no i fancy chiswick is an address which is more likely to find him if you will come with me to chiswick to night lestrade ill promise to go to the italian quarter with you to morrow and no harm will be done by the delay and now i think that a few hours sleep would do us all good for i do not propose to leave before eleven oclock and it is unlikely that we shall be back before morning youll dine with us lestrade and then you are welcome to the sofa until it is time for us to start in the meantime watson i should be glad if you would ring for an express messenger for i have a letter to send and it is important that it should go at once
741220 we may thank our stars that it is not raining i dont think we can even venture to smoke to pass the time however its a two to one chance that we get something to pay us for our trouble
741221 let us get to the open window we will nab him as he climbs out
741222 yes sir and you no doubt are mr sherlock holmes i had the note which you sent by the express messenger and i did exactly what you told me we locked every door on the inside and awaited developments well im very glad to see that you have got the rascal i hope gentlemen that you will come in and have some refreshment
741223 hill knows all these gentry and he will give a name to him youll find that my theory of the mafia will work out all right but im sure i am exceedingly obliged to you mr holmes for the workmanlike way in which you laid hands upon him i dont quite understand it all yet
741224 i fear it is rather too late an hour for explanations
741225 besides there are one or two details which are not finished off and it is one of those cases which are worth working out to the very end if you will come round once more to my rooms at six oclock to morrow i think i shall be able to show you that even now you have not grasped the entire meaning of this business which presents some features which make it absolutely original in the history of crime if ever i permit you to chronicle any more of my little problems watson i foresee that you will enliven your pages by an account of the singular adventure of the napoleonic busts
741226 yes sir i fear that i am a little late but the trains were awkward you wrote to me about a bust that is in my possession
741227 i have your letter here you said i desire to possess a copy of devines napoleon and am prepared to pay you ten pounds for the one which is in your possession is that right
741228 i was very much surprised at your letter for i could not imagine how you knew that i owned such a thing
741229 of course you must have been surprised but the explanation is very simple mr harding of harding brothers said that they had sold you their last copy and he gave me your address
741230 oh that was it was it did he tell you what i paid for it
741231 well i am an honest man though not a very rich one i only gave fifteen shillings for the bust and i think you ought to know that before i take ten pounds from you
741232 i am sure the scruple does you honour mr sandeford but i have named that price so i intend to stick to it
741233 well it is very handsome of you mr holmes i brought the bust up with me as you asked me to do here it is
741234 you will kindly sign that paper mr sandeford in the presence of these witnesses it is simply to say that you transfer every possible right that you ever had in the bust to me i am a methodical man you see and you never know what turn events might take afterwards thank you mr sandeford here is your money and i wish you a very good evening
741235 let me introduce you to the famous black pearl of the borgias
741236 the main fact is that he had the pearl and at that moment when it was on his person he was pursued by the police he made for the factory in which he worked and he knew that he had only a few minutes in which to conceal this enormously valuable prize which would otherwise be found on him when he was searched six plaster casts of napoleon were drying in the passage one of them was still soft in an instant beppo a skilful workman made a small hole in the wet plaster dropped in the pearl and with a few touches covered over the aperture once more it was an admirable hiding place no one could possibly find it but beppo was condemned to a years imprisonment and in the meanwhile his six busts were scattered over london he could not tell which contained his treasure only by breaking them could he see even shaking would tell him nothing for as the plaster was wet it was probable that the pearl would adhere to it as in fact it has done beppo did not despair and he conducted his search with considerable ingenuity and perseverance through a cousin who works with gelder he found out the retail firms who had bought the busts he managed to find employment with morse hudson and in that way tracked down three of them the pearl was not there then with the help of some italian employe 2 he succeeded in finding out where the other three busts had gone the first was at harkers there he was dogged by his confederate who held beppo responsible for the loss of the pearl and he stabbed him in the scuffle which followed
741237 if he was his confederate why should he carry his photograph
741238 as a means of tracing him if he wished to inquire about him from any third person that was the obvious reason well after the murder i calculated that beppo would probably hurry rather than delay his movements he would fear that the police would read his secret and so he hastened on before they should get ahead of him of course i could not say that he had not found the pearl in harkers bust i had not even concluded for certain that it was the pearl but it was evident to me that he was looking for something since he carried the bust past the other houses in order to break it in the garden which had a lamp overlooking it since harkers bust was one in three the chances were exactly as i told you two to one against the pearl being inside it there remained two busts and it was obvious that he would go for the london one first i warned the inmates of the house so as to avoid a second tragedy and we went down with the happiest results by that time of course i knew for certain that it was the borgia pearl that we were after the name of the murdered man linked the one event with the other there only remained a single bust the reading one and the pearl must be there i bought it in your presence from the owner and there it lies
741239 ive seen you handle a good many cases mr holmes but i dont know that i ever knew a more workmanlike one than that were not jealous of you at scotland yard no sir we are very proud of you and if you come down to morrow theres not a man from the oldest inspector to the youngest constable who wouldnt be glad to shake you by the hand
741240 and get out the papers of the conk singleton forgery case good bye lestrade if any little problem comes your way i shall be happy if i can to give you a hint or two as to its solution
741241 i trust mr holmes that you can spare me a few hours of your valuable time we have had a very painful incident at st lukes and really but for the happy chance of your being in the town i should have been at a loss what to do
741242 i am very busy just now and i desire no distractions
741243 i should much prefer that you called in the aid of the police
741244 no no my dear sir such a course is utterly impossible when once the law is evoked it cannot be stayed again and this is just one of those cases where for the credit of the college it is most essential to avoid scandal your discretion is as well known as your powers and you are the one man in the world who can help me i beg you mr holmes to do what you can
741245 i must explain to you mr holmes that to morrow is the
741246 to day about three oclock the proofs of this paper
741247 you are aware mr holmes that our college doors are
741248 the moment i looked at my table i was aware that someone had rummaged among my papers the proof was in three long slips i had left them all together now i found that one of them was lying on the floor one was on the side table near the window and the third was where i had left it
741249 the first page on the floor the second in the window the third where you left it
741250 exactly mr holmes you amaze me how could you possibly know that
741251 for an instant i imagined that bannister had taken the
741252 bannister was very much upset by the incident he had nearly fainted when we found that the papers had undoubtedly been tampered with i gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed in a chair while i made a most careful examination of the room i soon saw that the intruder had left other traces of his presence besides the rumpled papers on the table in the window were several shreds from a pencil which had been sharpened a broken tip of lead was lying there also evidently the rascal had copied the paper in a great hurry had broken his pencil and had been compelled to put a fresh point to it
741253 this was not all i have a new writing table with a fine surface of red leather i am prepared to swear and so is bannister that it was smooth and unstained now i found a clean cut in it about three inches long not a mere scratch but a positive cut not only this but on the table i found a small ball of black dough or clay with specks of something which looks like sawdust in it i am convinced that these marks were left by the man who rifled the papers there were no footmarks and no other evidence as to his identity i was at my wits ends when suddenly the happy thought occurred to me that you were in the town and i came straight round to put the matter into your hands do help me mr holmes you see my dilemma either i must find the man or else the examination must be postponed until fresh papers are prepared and since this cannot be done without explanation there will ensue a hideous scandal which will throw a cloud not only on the college but on the university above all things i desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly
741254 i shall be happy to look into it and to give you such advice as i can
741255 the case is not entirely devoid of interest had anyone visited you in your room after the papers came to you
741256 yes young daulat ras an indian student who lives on the same stair came in to ask me some particulars about the examination
741257 to the best of my belief they were rolled up
741258 he was very ill poor fellow i left him collapsed in the chair i was in such a hurry to come to you
741259 then it amounts to this mr soames that unless the indian student recognised the roll as being proofs the man who tampered with them came upon them accidentally without knowing that they were there
741260 let us go round not one of your cases watson mental not physical all right come if you want to now mr soames at your disposal
741261 he must have entered through the door there is no opening except the one pane
741262 well if there is nothing to be learned here we had best go inside
741263 one could hardly hope for any upon so dry a day your servant seems to have quite recovered you left him in a chair you say which chair
741264 i see near this little table you can come in now i have finished with the carpet let us take the little table first of course what has happened is very clear the man entered and took the papers sheet by sheet from the central table he carried them over to the window table because from there he could see if you came across the courtyard and so could effect an escape
741265 ah thats good well anyhow that was in his mind let me see the three strips no finger impressions no well he carried over this one first and he copied it how long would it take him to do that using every possible contraction a quarter of an hour not less then he tossed it down and seized the next he was in the midst of that when your return caused him to make a very hurried retreat very hurried since he had not time to replace the papers which would tell you that he had been there you were not aware of any hurrying feet on the stair as you entered the outer door
741266 well he wrote so furiously that he broke his pencil and had as you observe to sharpen it again this is of interest watson the pencil was not an ordinary one it was above the usual size with a soft lead the outer colour was dark blue the makers name was printed in silver lettering and the piece remaining is only about an inch and a half long look for such a pencil mr soames and you have got your man when i add that he possesses a large and very blunt knife you have an additional aid
741267 watson i have always done you an injustice there are others what could this nn be it is at the end of a word you are aware that johann faber is the most common makers name is it not clear that there is just as much of the pencil left as usually follows the johann
741268 i was hoping that if the paper on which he wrote was thin some trace of it might come through upon this polished surface no i see nothing i dont think there is anything more to be learned here now for the central table this small pellet is i presume the black doughy mass you spoke of roughly pyramidal in shape and hollowed out i perceive as you say there appear to be grains of sawdust in it dear me this is very interesting and the cut a positive tear i see it began with a thin scratch and ended in a jagged hole i am much indebted to you for directing my attention to this case mr soames where does that door lead to
741269 i should like to have a glance round what a charming old fashioned room perhaps you will kindly wait a minute until i have examined the floor no i see nothing what about this curtain you hang your clothes behind it if anyone were forced to conceal himself in this room he must do it there since the bed is too low and the wardrobe too shallow no one there i suppose
741270 your visitor seems to have left traces in your bedroom as well as in your sitting room mr soames
741271 i think it is clear enough you came back by an unexpected way and so he had no warning until you were at the very door what could he do he caught up everything which would betray him and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself
741272 good gracious mr holmes do you mean to tell me that all the time i was talking to bannister in this room we had the man prisoner if we had only known it
741273 surely there is another alternative mr holmes i dont know whether you observed my bedroom window
741274 lattice paned lead framework three separate windows one swinging on hinge and large enough to admit a man
741275 exactly and it looks out on an angle of the courtyard so as to be partly invisible the man might have effected his entrance there left traces as he passed through the bedroom and finally finding the door open have escaped that way
741276 i understand you to say that there are three students who use this stair and are in the habit of passing your door
741277 have you any reason to suspect any one of them more than the others
741278 one hardly likes to throw suspicion where there are no proofs
741279 let us hear the suspicions i will look after the proofs
741280 i will tell you then in a few words the character of the
741281 the second floor is inhabited by daulat ras the indian
741282 the top floor belongs to miles mclaren he is a brilliant fellow when he chooses to work one of the brightest intellects of the university but he is wayward dissipated and unprincipled he was nearly expelled over a card scandal in his first year he has been idling all this term and he must look forward with dread to the examination
741283 i dare not go so far as that but of the three he is perhaps the least unlikely
741284 exactly now mr soames let us have a look at your servant bannister
741285 was it not very extraordinary that you should do this on the very day when there were these papers inside
741286 it was most unfortunate sir but i have occasionally done the same thing at other times
741287 it was about half past four that is mr soamess tea time
741288 when i saw that he was absent i withdrew at once
741289 how came you to leave the key in the door
741290 i had the tea tray in my hand i thought i would come back for the key then i forgot
741291 when mr soames returned and called for you you were very much disturbed
741292 yes sir such a thing has never happened during the many years that i have been here i nearly fainted sir
741293 so i understand where were you when you began to feel bad
741294 that is singular because you sat down in that chair over yonder near the corner why did you pass these other chairs
741295 i dont know sir it didnt matter to me where i sat
741296 i really dont think he knew much about it mr holmes he was looking very bad quite ghastly
741297 only for a minute or so then i locked the door and went to my room
741298 oh i would not venture to say sir i dont believe there is any gentleman in this university who is capable of profiting by such an action no sir ill not believe it
741299 oh one more word you have not mentioned to any of the three gentlemen whom you attend that anything is amiss
741300 very good now mr soames we will take a walk in the quadrangle if you please
741301 i should like to have a peep at each of them
741302 this set of rooms is quite the oldest in the college and it is not unusual for visitors to go over them come along and i will personally conduct you
741303 i dont care who you are you can go to blazes
741304 of course he did not realize that it was i who was knocking but none the less his conduct was very uncourteous and indeed under the circumstances rather suspicious
741305 really mr holmes i cannot undertake to say he is taller than the indian not so tall as gilchrist i suppose five foot six would be about it
741306 good gracious mr holmes you are surely not going to leave me in this abrupt fashion you dont seem to realize the position to morrow is the examination i must take some definite action to night i cannot allow the examination to be held if one of the papers has been tampered with the situation must be faced
741307 you must leave it as it is i shall drop round early to morrow morning and chat the matter over it is possible that i may be in a position then to indicate some course of action meanwhile you change nothing nothing at all
741308 you can be perfectly easy in your mind we shall certainly find some way out of your difficulties i will take the black clay with me also the pencil cuttings good bye
741309 quite a little parlour game sort of three card trick is it not there are your three men it must be one of them you take your choice which is yours
741310 the foul mouthed fellow at the top he is the one with the worst record and yet that indian was a sly fellow also why should he be pacing his room all the time
741311 there is nothing in that many men do it when they are trying to learn anything by heart
741312 so would you if a flock of strangers came in on you when you were preparing for an examination next day and every moment was of value no i see nothing in that pencils too and knives all was satisfactory but that fellow does puzzle me
741313 why bannister the servant whats his game in the matter
741314 so he did me thats the puzzling part why should a perfectly honest man well well heres a large stationers we shall begin our researches here
741315 no good my dear watson this the best and only final clue has run to nothing but indeed i have little doubt that we can build up a sufficient case without it by jove my dear fellow it is nearly nine and the landlady babbled of green peas at seven thirty what with your eternal tobacco watson and your irregularity at meals i expect that you will get notice to quit and that i shall share your downfall not however before we have solved the problem of the nervous tutor the careless servant and the three enterprising students
741316 it is time we went down to st lukes can you do without breakfast
741317 soames will be in a dreadful fidget until we are able to tell him something positive
741318 aha it is not for nothing that i have turned myself out of bed at the untimely hour of six i have put in two hours hard work and covered at least five miles with something to show for it look at that
741319 and one more this morning it is a fair argument that wherever no 3 came from is also the source of nos 1 and 2 eh watson well come along and put friend soames out of his pain
741320 thank heaven that you have come i feared that you had given it up in despair what am i to do shall the examination proceed
741321 i think so if this matter is not to become public we must give ourselves certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small private court martial you there if you please soames watson you here ill take the arm chair in the middle i think that we are now sufficiently imposing to strike terror into a guilty breast kindly ring the bell
741322 now bannister will you please tell us the truth about yesterdays incident
741323 well then i must make some suggestions to you when you sat down on that chair yesterday did you do so in order to conceal some object which would have shown who had been in the room
741324 i frankly admit that i am unable to prove it but it seems probable enough since the moment that mr soamess back was turned you released the man who was hiding in that bedroom
741325 ah thats a pity bannister up to now you may have spoken the truth but now i know that you have lied
741326 in that case you can give us no further information would you please remain in the room stand over there near the bedroom door now soames i am going to ask you to have the great kindness to go up to the room of young gilchrist and to ask him to step down into yours
741327 now mr gilchrist we are all quite alone here and no one need ever know one word of what passes between us we can be perfectly frank with each other we want to know mr gilchrist how you an honourable man ever came to commit such an action as that of yesterday
741328 no no mr gilchrist sir i never said a word never one word
741329 now sir you must see that after bannisters words your position is hopeless and that your only chance lies in a frank confession
741330 from the moment mr soames that you said to me that no
741331 i entered and i took you into my confidence as to the
741332 well when he saw that they were indeed the proofs it was then that he yielded to temptation he put his shoes on the table what was it you put on that chair near the window
741333 he put his gloves on the chair and he took the proofs sheet by sheet to copy them he thought the tutor must return by the main gate and that he would see him as we know he came back by the side gate suddenly he heard him at the very door there was no possible escape he forgot his gloves but he caught up his shoes and darted into the bedroom you observe that the scratch on that table is slight at one side but deepens in the direction of the bedroom door that in itself is enough to show us that the shoe had been drawn in that direction and that the culprit had taken refuge there the earth round the spike had been left on the table and a second sample was loosened and fell in the bedroom i may add that i walked out to the athletic grounds this morning saw that tenacious black clay is used in the jumping pit and carried away a specimen of it together with some of the fine tan or sawdust which is strewn over it to prevent the athlete from slipping have i told the truth mr gilchrist
741334 yes sir i have but the shock of this disgraceful
741335 i am indeed pleased to hear that you did not intend to profit by your unfair advantage
741336 there is the man who set me in the right path
741337 it will be clear to you from what i have said that only you could have let this young man out since you were left in the room and must have locked the door when you went out as to his escaping by that window it was incredible can you not clear up the last point in this mystery and tell us the reasons for your action
741338 it was simple enough sir if you only had known but with all your cleverness it was impossible that you could know time was sir when i was butler to old sir jabez gilchrist this young gentlemans father when he was ruined i came to the college as servant but i never forgot my old employer because he was down in the world i watched his son all i could for the sake of the old days well sir when i came into this room yesterday when the alarm was given the very first thing i saw was mr gilchrists tan gloves a lying in that chair i knew those gloves well and i understood their message if mr soames saw them the game was up i flopped down into that chair and nothing would budge me until mr soames he went for you then out came my poor young master whom i had dandled on my knee and confessed it all to me wasnt it natural sir that i should save him and wasnt it natural also that i should try to speak to him as his dead father would have done and make him understand that he could not profit by such a deed could you blame me sir
741339 well soames i think we have cleared your little problem up and our breakfast awaits us at home come watson as to you sir i trust that a bright future awaits you in rhodesia for once you have fallen low let us see in the future how high you can rise
741340 well watson its as well we have not to turn out to night
741341 ive done enough for one sitting it is trying work for the eyes so far as i can make out it is nothing more exciting than an abbeys accounts dating from the second half of the fifteenth century halloa halloa halloa whats this
741342 want he wants us and we my poor watson want overcoats and cravats and goloshes and every aid that man ever invented to fight the weather wait a bit though theres the cab off again theres hope yet hed have kept it if he had wanted us to come run down my dear fellow and open the door for all virtuous folk have been long in bed
741343 i hope you have no designs upon us on such a night as this
741344 now my dear hopkins draw up and warm your toes
741345 heres a cigar and the doctor has a prescription containing hot water and a lemon which is good medicine on a night like this it must be something important which has brought you out in such a gale
741346 it is indeed mr holmes ive had a bustling afternoon i promise you did you see anything of the yoxley case in the latest editions
741347 ive seen nothing later than the fifteenth century to day
741348 well it was only a paragraph and all wrong at that so you have not missed anything i havent let the grass grow under my feet its down in kent seven miles from chatham and three from the railway line i was wired for at three fifteen reached yoxley old place at five conducted my investigation was back at charing cross by the last train and straight to you by cab
741349 which means i suppose that you are not quite clear about your case
741350 it means that i can make neither head nor tail of it so far as i can see it is just as tangled a business as ever i handled and yet at first it seemed so simple that one couldnt go wrong theres no motive mr holmes thats what bothers me i cant put my hand on a motive heres a man dead theres no denying that but so far as i can see no reason on earth why anyone should wish him harm
741351 all i want now is to know what they all mean the story so far as i can make it out is like this some years ago this country house yoxley old place was taken by an elderly man who gave the name of professor coram he was an invalid keeping his bed half the time and the other half hobbling round the house with a stick or being pushed about the grounds by the gardener in a bath chair he was well liked by the few neighbours who called upon him and he has the reputation down there of being a very learned man his household used to consist of an elderly housekeeper mrs marker and of a maid susan tarlton these have both been with him since his arrival and they seem to be women of excellent character the professor is writing a learned book and he found it necessary about a year ago to engage a secretary the first two that he tried were not successes but the third mr willoughby smith a very young man straight from the university seems to have been just what his employer wanted his work consisted in writing all the morning to the professors dictation and he usually spent the evening in hunting up references and passages which bore upon the next days work this willoughby smith has nothing against him either as a boy at uppingham or as a young man at cambridge i have seen his testimonials and from the first he was a decent quiet hardworking fellow with no weak spot in him at all and yet this is the lad who has met his death this morning in the professors study under circumstances which can point only to murder
741352 now i will give you the evidence of susan tarlton who is
741353 at first the maid thought that young smith was already
741354 in the meantime the housekeeper had also arrived upon the scene but she was just too late to catch the young mans dying words leaving susan with the body she hurried to the professors room he was sitting up in bed horribly agitated for he had heard enough to convince him that something terrible had occurred mrs marker is prepared to swear that the professor was still in his night clothes and indeed it was impossible for him to dress without the help of mortimer whose orders were to come at twelve oclock the professor declares that he heard the distant cry but that he knows nothing more he can give no explanation of the young mans last words the professor it was she but imagines that they were the outcome of delirium he believes that willoughby smith had not an enemy in the world and can give no reason for the crime his first action was to send mortimer the gardener for the local police a little later the chief constable sent for me nothing was moved before i got there and strict orders were given that no one should walk upon the paths leading to the house it was a splendid chance of putting your theories into practice mr sherlock holmes there was really nothing wanting
741355 well let us hear about it what sort of job did you make of it
741356 i must ask you first mr holmes to glance at this rough plan which will give you a general idea of the position of the professors study and the various points of the case it will help you in following my investigation
741357 it is very rough of course and it only deals with the
741358 my examination showed me that i was dealing with a cautious and expert criminal no footmarks were to be found on the path there could be no question however that someone had passed along the grass border which lines the path and that he had done so in order to avoid leaving a track i could not find anything in the nature of a distinct impression but the grass was trodden down and someone had undoubtedly passed it could only have been the murderer since neither the gardener nor anyone else had been there that morning and the rain had only begun during the night
741359 at the point where the path passes through the gate you could surely pick up the tracks
741360 tut tut well then these tracks upon the grass were they coming or going
741361 it was impossible to say there was never any outline
741362 it has been pouring rain and blowing a hurricane ever since
741363 it will be harder to read now than that palimpsest well well it cant be helped what did you do hopkins after you had made certain that you had made certain of nothing
741364 i think i made certain of a good deal mr holmes i knew
741365 i come now to the body of the young man it was found near the bureau and just to the left of it as marked upon that chart the stab was on the right side of the neck and from behind forwards so that it is almost impossible that it could have been self inflicted
741366 exactly the idea crossed my mind but we found the knife some feet away from the body so that seems impossible then of course there are the mans own dying words and finally there was this very important piece of evidence which was found clasped in the dead mans right hand
741367 there can be no question that this was snatched from the face or the person of the assassin
741368 wanted a woman of good address attired like a lady she has a remarkably thick nose with eyes which are set close upon either side of it she has a puckered forehead a peering expression and probably rounded shoulders there are indications that she has had recourse to an optician at least twice during the last few months as her glasses are of remarkable strength and as opticians are not very numerous there should be no difficulty in tracing her
741369 it would be difficult to name any articles which afford a finer field for inference than a pair of glasses especially so remarkable a pair as these that they belong to a woman i infer from their delicacy and also of course from the last words of the dying man as to her being a person of refinement and well dressed they are as you perceive handsomely mounted in solid gold and it is inconceivable that anyone who wore such glasses could be slatternly in other respects you will find that the clips are too wide for your nose showing that the ladys nose was very broad at the base this sort of nose is usually a short and coarse one but there are a sufficient number of exceptions to prevent me from being dogmatic or from insisting upon this point in my description my own face is a narrow one and yet i find that i cannot get my eyes into the centre or near the centre of these glasses therefore the ladys eyes are set very near to the sides of the nose you will perceive watson that the glasses are concave and of unusual strength a lady whose vision has been so extremely contracted all her life is sure to have the physical characteristics of such vision which are seen in the forehead the eyelids and the shoulders
741370 i can follow each of your arguments i confess however that i am unable to understand how you arrive at the double visit to the optician
741371 that the clips are lined with tiny bands of cork to soften the pressure upon the nose one of these is discoloured and worn to some slight extent but the other is new evidently one has fallen off and been replaced i should judge that the older of them has not been there more than a few months they exactly correspond so i gather that the lady went back to the same establishment for the second
741372 to think that i had all that evidence in my hand and never knew it i had intended however to go the round of the london opticians
741373 of course you would meanwhile have you anything more to tell us about the case
741374 nothing mr holmes i think that you know as much as i do now probably more we have had inquiries made as to any stranger seen on the country roads or at the railway station we have heard of none what beats me is the utter want of all object in the crime not a ghost of a motive can anyone suggest
741375 ah there i am not in a position to help you but i suppose you want us to come out to morrow
741376 if it is not asking too much mr holmes theres a train from charing cross to chatham at six in the morning and we should be at yoxley old place between eight and nine
741377 then we shall take it your case has certainly some features of great interest and i shall be delighted to look into it well its nearly one and we had best get a few hours sleep i dare say you can manage all right on the sofa in front of the fire ill light my spirit lamp and give you a cup of coffee before we start
741378 no sir down at the station they are certain that no stranger either came or went yesterday
741379 yes sir there is no one that we cannot account for
741380 well its only a reasonable walk to chatham anyone might stay there or take a train without being observed this is the garden path of which i spoke mr holmes ill pledge my word there was no mark on it yesterday
741381 this side sir this narrow margin of grass between the path and the flower bed i cant see the traces now but they were clear to me then
741382 our lady must have picked her steps carefully must she not since on the one side she would leave a track on the path and on the other an even clearer one on the soft bed
741383 you say that she must have come back this way
741384 hum it was a very remarkable performance very remarkable well i think we have exhausted the path let us go farther this garden door is usually kept open i suppose then this visitor had nothing to do but to walk in the idea of murder was not in her mind or she would have provided herself with some sort of weapon instead of having to pick this knife off the writing table she advanced along this corridor leaving no traces upon the cocoanut matting then she found herself in this study how long was she there we have no means of judging
741385 not more than a few minutes sir i forgot to tell you that mrs marker the housekeeper had been in there tidying not very long before about a quarter of an hour she says
741386 well that gives us a limit our lady enters this room and what does she do she goes over to the writing table what for not for anything in the drawers if there had been anything worth her taking it would surely have been locked up no it was for something in that wooden bureau halloa what is that scratch upon the face of it just hold a match watson why did you not tell me of this hopkins
741387 i noticed it mr holmes but youll always find scratches round a keyhole
741388 this is recent quite recent see how the brass shines where it is cut an old scratch would be the same colour as the surface look at it through my lens theres the varnish too like earth on each side of a furrow is mrs marker there
741389 i am sure you did not for a duster would have swept away these shreds of varnish who has the key of this bureau
741390 very good mrs marker you can go now we are making a little progress our lady enters the room advances to the bureau and either opens it or tries to do so while she is thus engaged young willoughby smith enters the room in her hurry to withdraw the key she makes this scratch upon the door he seizes her and she snatching up the nearest object which happens to be this knife strikes at him in order to make him let go his hold the blow is a fatal one he falls and she escapes either with or without the object for which she has come is susan the maid there could anyone have got away through that door after the time that you heard the cry susan
741391 no sir it is impossible before i got down the stair id have seen anyone in the passage besides the door never opened for i would have heard it
741392 that settles this exit then no doubt the lady went out the way she came i understand that this other passage leads only to the professors room there is no exit that way
741393 we shall go down it and make the acquaintance of the professor halloa hopkins this is very important very important indeed the professors corridor is also lined with cocoanut matting
741394 dont you see any bearing upon the case well well i dont insist upon it no doubt i am wrong and yet it seems to me to be suggestive come with me and introduce me
741395 pray take a cigarette and you sir i can recommend them for i have them especially prepared by ionides of alexandria he sends me a thousand at a time and i grieve to say that i have to arrange for a fresh supply every fortnight bad sir very bad but an old man has few pleasures tobacco and my work that is all that is left to me
741396 alas what a fatal interruption who could have foreseen such a terrible catastrophe so estimable a young man i assure you that after a few months training he was an admirable assistant what do you think of the matter mr holmes
741397 i shall indeed be indebted to you if you can throw a light where all is so dark to us to a poor bookworm and invalid like myself such a blow is paralyzing i seem to have lost the faculty of thought but you are a man of action you are a man of affairs it is part of the everyday routine of your life you can preserve your balance in every emergency we are fortunate indeed in having you at our side
741398 that is my magnum opus the pile of papers on the side table yonder it is my analysis of the documents found in the coptic monasteries of syria and egypt a work which will cut deep at the very foundations of revealed religion with my enfeebled health i do not know whether i shall ever be able to complete it now that my assistant has been taken from me dear me mr holmes why you are even a quicker smoker than i am myself
741399 i will not trouble you with any lengthy cross examination professor coram since i gather that you were in bed at the time of the crime and could know nothing about it i would only ask this what do you imagine that this poor fellow meant by his last words the professor it was she
741400 and you know the incredible stupidity of that class i fancy that the poor fellow murmured some incoherent delirious words and that she twisted them into this meaningless message
741401 i see you have no explanation yourself of the tragedy
741402 possibly an accident possibly i only breathe it among ourselves a suicide young men have their hidden troubles some affair of the heart perhaps which we have never known it is a more probable supposition than murder
741403 ah i am only a student a man of dreams i cannot explain the practical things of life but still we are aware my friend that love gages may take strange shapes by all means take another cigarette it is a pleasure to see anyone appreciate them so a fan a glove glasses who knows what article may be carried as a token or treasured when a man puts an end to his life this gentleman speaks of footsteps in the grass but after all it is easy to be mistaken on such a point as to the knife it might well be thrown far from the unfortunate man as he fell it is possible that i speak as a child but to me it seems that willoughby smith has met his fate by his own hand
741404 nothing that would help a thief family papers letters from my poor wife diplomas of universities which have done me honour here is the key you can look for yourself
741405 i should prefer to go quietly down to your garden and turn the whole matter over in my head there is something to be said for the theory of suicide which you have put forward we must apologize for having intruded upon you professor coram and i promise that we wont disturb you until after lunch at two oclock we will come again and report to you anything which may have happened in the interval
741406 it is possible that i am utterly mistaken the cigarettes will show me
741407 well well you may see for yourself if not theres no harm done of course we always have the optician clue to fall back upon but i take a short cut when i can get it ah here is the good mrs marker let us enjoy five minutes of instructive conversation with her
741408 yes mr holmes it is as you say sir he does smoke something terrible all day and sometimes all night sir ive seen that room of a morning well sir youd have thought it was a london fog poor young mr smith he was a smoker also but not as bad as the professor his health well i dont know that its better nor worse for the smoking
741409 ill wager he took no breakfast this morning and wont face his lunch after all the cigarettes i saw him consume
741410 well youre out there sir as it happens for he ate a remarkable big breakfast this morning i dont know when ive known him make a better one and hes ordered a good dish of cutlets for his lunch im surprised myself for since i came into that room yesterday and saw young mr smith lying there on the floor i couldnt bear to look at food well it takes all sorts to make a world and the professor hasnt let it take his appetite away
741411 we must go up and have it out with our friend the professor
741412 you are surely joking mr sherlock holmes you compel me to tell you that this is too serious a matter to be treated in such a fashion
741413 i have forged and tested every link of my chain professor
741414 a lady yesterday entered your study she came with the intention of possessing herself of certain documents which were in your bureau she had a key of her own i have had an opportunity of examining yours and i do not find that slight discoloration which the scratch made upon the varnish would have produced you were not an accessory therefore and she came so far as i can read the evidence without your knowledge to rob you
741415 have you no more to add surely having traced this lady so far you can also say what has become of her
741416 i will endeavour to do so in the first place she was seized by your secretary and stabbed him in order to escape this catastrophe i am inclined to regard as an unhappy accident for i am convinced that the lady had no intention of inflicting so grievous an injury an assassin does not come unarmed horrified by what she had done she rushed wildly away from the scene of the tragedy unfortunately for her she had lost her glasses in the scuffle and as she was extremely short sighted she was really helpless without them she ran down a corridor which she imagined to be that by which she had come both were lined with cocoanut matting and it was only when it was too late that she understood that she had taken the wrong passage and that her retreat was cut off behind her what was she to do she could not go back she could not remain where she was she must go on she went on she mounted a stair pushed open a door and found herself in your room
741417 but there is one little flaw in your splendid theory i was myself in my room and i never left it during the day
741418 and you mean to say that i could lie upon that bed and not be aware that a woman had entered my room
741419 i never said so you were aware of it you spoke with her you recognised her you aided her to escape
741420 you are talking insanely i helped her to escape where is she now
741421 from where i stood i could hear everything and i know that you have learned the truth i confess it all it was i who killed the young man but you are right you who say it was an accident i did not even know that it was a knife which i held in my hand for in my despair i snatched anything from the table and struck at him to make him let me go it is the truth that i tell
741422 i am sure that it is the truth i fear that you are far from well
741423 but i would have you to know the whole truth i am this mans wife he is not an englishman he is a russian his name i will not tell
741424 why should you cling so hard to that wretched life of yours sergius
741425 i have said gentlemen that i am this mans wife he was fifty and i a foolish girl of twenty when we married it was in a city of russia a university i will not name the place
741426 we were reformers revolutionists nihilists you understand he and i and many more then there came a time of trouble a police officer was killed many were arrested evidence was wanted and in order to save his own life and to earn a great reward my husband betrayed his own wife and his companions yes we were all arrested upon his confession some of us found our way to the gallows and some to siberia i was among these last but my term was not for life my husband came to england with his ill gotten gains and has lived in quiet ever since knowing well that if the brotherhood knew where he was not a week would pass before justice would be done
741427 i have not yet told you the height of his villainy
741428 among our comrades of the order there was one who was the friend of my heart he was noble unselfish loving all that my husband was not he hated violence we were all guilty if that is guilt but he was not he wrote for ever dissuading us from such a course these letters would have saved him so would my diary in which from day to day i had entered both my feelings towards him and the view which each of us had taken my husband found and kept both diary and letters he hid them and he tried hard to swear away the young mans life in this he failed but alexis was sent a convict to siberia where now at this moment he works in a salt mine think of that you villain you villain now now at this very moment alexis a man whose name you are not worthy to speak works and lives like a slave and yet i have your life in my hands and i let you go
741429 i had just taken the papers and was locking the cupboard when the young man seized me i had seen him already that morning he had met me in the road and i had asked him to tell me where professor coram lived not knowing that he was in his employ
741430 the secretary came back and told his employer of the woman he had met then in his last breath he tried to send a message that it was she the she whom he had just discussed with him
741431 when he had fallen i rushed from the room chose the wrong door and found myself in my husbands room he spoke of giving me up i showed him that if he did so his life was in my hands if he gave me to the law i could give him to the brotherhood it was not that i wished to live for my own sake but it was that i desired to accomplish my purpose he knew that i would do what i said that his own fate was involved in mine for that reason and for no other he shielded me he thrust me into that dark hiding place a relic of old days known only to himself he took his meals in his own room and so was able to give me part of his food it was agreed that when the police left the house i should slip away by night and come back no more but in some way you have read our plans
741432 too late i took the poison before i left my hiding place my head swims i am going i charge you sir to remember the packet
741433 a simple case and yet in some ways an instructive one
741434 it hinged from the outset upon the pince nez but for the fortunate chance of the dying man having seized these i am not sure that we could ever have reached our solution it was clear to me from the strength of the glasses that the wearer must have been very blind and helpless when deprived of them when you asked me to believe that she walked along a narrow strip of grass without once making a false step i remarked as you may remember that it was a noteworthy performance in my mind i set it down as an impossible performance save in the unlikely case that she had a second pair of glasses i was forced therefore to seriously consider the hypothesis that she had remained within the house on perceiving the similarity of the two corridors it became clear that she might very easily have made such a mistake and in that case it was evident that she must have entered the professors room i was keenly on the alert therefore for whatever would bear out this supposition and i examined the room narrowly for anything in the shape of a hiding place the carpet seemed continuous and firmly nailed so i dismissed the idea of a trap door there might well be a recess behind the books as you are aware such devices are common in old libraries i observed that books were piled on the floor at all other points but that one bookcase was left clear this then might be the door i could see no marks to guide me but the carpet was of a dun colour which lends itself very well to examination i therefore smoked a great number of those excellent cigarettes and i dropped the ash all over the space in front of the suspected bookcase it was a simple trick but exceedingly effective i then went downstairs and i ascertained in your presence watson without your quite perceiving the drift of my remarks that professor corams consumption of food had increased as one would expect when he is supplying a second person we then ascended to the room again when by upsetting the cigarette box i obtained a very excellent view of the floor and was able to see quite clearly from the traces upon the cigarette ash that the prisoner had in our absence come out from her retreat well hopkins here we are at charing cross and i congratulate you on having brought your case to a successful conclusion you are going to head quarters no doubt i think watson you and i will drive together to the russian embassy
741435 please await me terrible misfortune right wing three quarter missing indispensable to morrow overton
741436 mr overton was evidently considerably excited when he sent it and somewhat incoherent in consequence well well he will be here i dare say by the time i have looked through the times and then we shall know all about it even the most insignificant problem would be welcome in these stagnant days
741437 ive been down to scotland yard mr holmes i saw inspector stanley hopkins he advised me to come to you he said the case so far as he could see was more in your line than in that of the regular police
741438 pray sit down and tell me what is the matter
741439 its awful mr holmes simply awful i wonder my hair isnt grey godfrey staunton youve heard of him of course hes simply the hinge that the whole team turns on id rather spare two from the pack and have godfrey for my three quarter line whether its passing or tackling or dribbling theres no one to touch him and then hes got the head and can hold us all together what am i to do thats what i ask you mr holmes theres moorhouse first reserve but he is trained as a half and he always edges right in on to the scrum instead of keeping out on the touch line hes a fine place kick its true but then he has no judgment and he cant sprint for nuts why morton or johnson the oxford fliers could romp round him stevenson is fast enough but he couldnt drop from the twenty five line and a three quarter who cant either punt or drop isnt worth a place for pace alone no mr holmes we are done unless you can help me to find godfrey staunton
741440 and there was henry staunton whom i helped to hang but godfrey staunton is a new name to me
741441 i suppose then if you have never heard of godfrey staunton you dont know cyril overton either
741442 why i was first reserve for england against wales and ive skippered the varsity 1 all this year but thats nothing i didnt think there was a soul in england who didnt know godfrey staunton the crack three quarter cambridge blackheath and five internationals good lord mr holmes where have you lived
741443 you live in a different world to me mr overton a sweeter and healthier one my ramifications stretch out into many sections of society but never i am happy to say into amateur sport which is the best and soundest thing in england however your unexpected visit this morning shows me that even in that world of fresh air and fair play there may be work for me to do so now my good sir i beg you to sit down and to tell me slowly and quietly exactly what it is that has occurred and how you desire that i should help you
741444 its this way mr holmes as i have said i am the skipper of the rugger team of cambridge varsity and godfrey staunton is my best man to morrow we play oxford yesterday we all came up and we settled at bentleys private hotel at ten oclock i went round and saw that all the fellows had gone to roost for i believe in strict training and plenty of sleep to keep a team fit i had a word or two with godfrey before he turned in he seemed to me to be pale and bothered i asked him what was the matter he said he was all right just a touch of headache i bade him good night and left him half an hour later the porter tells me that a rough looking man with a beard called with a note for godfrey he had not gone to bed and the note was taken to his room godfrey read it and fell back in a chair as if he had been pole axed the porter was so scared that he was going to fetch me but godfrey stopped him had a drink of water and pulled himself together then he went downstairs said a few words to the man who was waiting in the hall and the two of them went off together the last that the porter saw of them they were almost running down the street in the direction of the strand this morning godfreys room was empty his bed had never been slept in and his things were all just as i had seen them the night before he had gone off at a moments notice with this stranger and no word has come from him since i dont believe he will ever come back he was a sportsman was godfrey down to his marrow and he wouldnt have stopped his training and let in his skipper if it were not for some cause that was too strong for him no i feel as if he were gone for good and we should never see him again
741445 i wired to cambridge to learn if anything had been heard of him there i have had an answer no one has seen him
741446 but so far as you can ascertain he did not take it
741447 godfrey is an orphan and lord mount james is his nearest relative his uncle i believe
741448 indeed this throws new light upon the matter lord mount james is one of the richest men in england
741449 yes he was his heir and the old boy is nearly eighty cram full of gout too they say he could chalk his billiard cue with his knuckles he never allowed godfrey a shilling in his life for he is an absolute miser but it will all come to him right enough
741450 what motive could your friend have in going to lord mount james
741451 well something was worrying him the night before and if it was to do with money it is possible that he would make for his nearest relative who had so much of it though from all i have heard he would not have much chance of getting it godfrey was not fond of the old man he would not go if he could help it
741452 well we can soon determine that if your friend was going to his relative lord mount james you have then to explain the visit of this rough looking fellow at so late an hour and the agitation that was caused by his coming
741453 well well i have a clear day and i shall be happy to look into the matter
741454 i should strongly recommend you to make your preparations for your match without reference to this young gentleman it must as you say have been an overpowering necessity which tore him away in such a fashion and the same necessity is likely to hold him away let us step round together to this hotel and see if the porter can throw any fresh light upon the matter
741455 no sir one theatre party came in late no one else
741456 yes sir i waited to see if there was an answer
741457 yes sir i was standing by the door and he with
741458 was the telegraphic form one of these on the table
741459 it is a pity he did not write in pencil
741460 as you have no doubt frequently observed watson the impression usually goes through a fact which has dissolved many a happy marriage however i can find no trace here i rejoice however to perceive that he wrote with a broad pointed quill pen and i can hardly doubt that we will find some impression upon this blotting pad ah yes surely this is the very thing
741461 the paper is thin and the reverse will give the message here it is
741462 so that is the tail end of the telegram which godfrey staunton dispatched within a few hours of his disappearance there are at least six words of the message which have escaped us but what remains stand by us for gods sake proves that this young man saw a formidable danger which approached him and from which someone else could protect him us mark you another person was involved who should it be but the pale faced bearded man who seemed himself in so nervous a state what then is the connection between godfrey staunton and the bearded man and what is the third source from which each of them sought for help against pressing danger our inquiry has already narrowed down to that
741463 we have only to find to whom that telegram is addressed
741464 exactly my dear watson your reflection though profound had already crossed my mind but i dare say it may have come to your notice that if you walk into a post office and demand to see the counterfoil of another mans message there may be some disinclination on the part of the officials to oblige you there is so much red tape in these matters however i have no doubt that with a little delicacy and finesse the end may be attained meanwhile i should like in your presence mr overton to go through these papers which have been left upon the table
741465 by the way i suppose your friend was a healthy young fellow nothing amiss with him
741466 not a day he has been laid up with a hack and once he slipped his knee cap but that was nothing
741467 perhaps he was not so strong as you suppose i should think he may have had some secret trouble with your assent i will put one or two of these papers in my pocket in case they should bear upon our future inquiry
741468 who are you sir and by what right do you touch this gentlemans papers
741469 i am a private detective and i am endeavouring to explain his disappearance
741470 oh you are are you and who instructed you eh
741471 this gentleman mr stauntons friend was referred to me by scotland yard
741472 then it is you who sent me a telegram my name is lord mount james i came round as quickly as the bayswater bus would bring me so you have instructed a detective
741473 i have no doubt sir that my friend godfrey when we find him will be prepared to do that
741474 but if he is never found eh answer me that
741475 dont look to me for a penny not a penny you understand that mr detective i am all the family that this young man has got and i tell you that i am not responsible if he has any expectations it is due to the fact that i have never wasted money and i do not propose to begin to do so now as to those papers with which you are making so free i may tell you that in case there should be anything of any value among them you will be held strictly to account for what you do with them
741476 may i ask in the meanwhile whether you have yourself any theory to account for this young mans disappearance
741477 no sir i have not he is big enough and old enough to look after himself and if he is so foolish as to lose himself i entirely refuse to accept the responsibility of hunting for him
741478 perhaps you dont quite understand mine godfrey staunton appears to have been a poor man if he has been kidnapped it could not have been for anything which he himself possesses the fame of your wealth has gone abroad lord mount james and it is entirely possible that a gang of thieves have secured your nephew in order to gain from him some information as to your house your habits and your treasure
741479 heavens sir what an idea i never thought of such villainy what inhuman rogues there are in the world but godfrey is a fine lad a staunch lad nothing would induce him to give his old uncle away ill have the plate moved over to the bank this evening in the meantime spare no pains mr detective i beg you to leave no stone unturned to bring him safely back as to money well so far as a fiver or even a tenner goes you can always look to me
741480 of course with a warrant we could demand to see the counterfoils but we have not reached that stage yet i dont suppose they remember faces in so busy a place let us venture it
741481 there is some small mistake about a telegram i sent yesterday i have had no answer and i very much fear that i must have omitted to put my name at the end could you tell me if this was so
741482 then that of course accounts for my getting no answer
741483 dear me how very stupid of me to be sure good morning miss and many thanks for having relieved my mind
741484 we progress my dear watson we progress i had seven different schemes for getting a glimpse of that telegram but i could hardly hope to succeed the very first time
741485 yes i think we must run down to cambridge together all the indications seem to me to point in that direction
741486 have you any suspicion yet as to the cause of the disappearance i dont think that among all our cases i have known one where the motives are more obscure surely you dont really imagine that he may be kidnapped in order to give information against his wealthy uncle
741487 i confess my dear watson that that does not appeal to me as a very probable explanation it struck me however as being the one which was most likely to interest that exceedingly unpleasant old person
741488 i could mention several you must admit that it is curious and suggestive that this incident should occur on the eve of this important match and should involve the only man whose presence seems essential to the success of the side it may of course be coincidence but it is interesting amateur sport is free from betting but a good deal of outside betting goes on among the public and it is possible that it might be worth someones while to get at a player as the ruffians of the turf get at a race horse there is one explanation a second very obvious one is that this young man really is the heir of a great property however modest his means may at present be and it is not impossible that a plot to hold him for ransom might be concocted
741489 quite true watson the telegram still remains the only solid thing with which we have to deal and we must not permit our attention to wander away from it it is to gain light upon the purpose of this telegram that we are now upon our way to cambridge the path of our investigation is at present obscure but i shall be very much surprised if before evening we have not cleared it up or made a considerable advance along it
741490 i have heard your name mr sherlock holmes and i am aware of your profession one of which i by no means approve
741491 in that doctor you will find yourself in agreement with every criminal in the country
741492 so far as your efforts are directed towards the suppression of crime sir they must have the support of every reasonable member of the community though i cannot doubt that the official machinery is amply sufficient for the purpose where your calling is more open to criticism is when you pry into the secrets of private individuals when you rake up family matters which are better hidden and when you incidentally waste the time of men who are more busy than yourself at the present moment for example i should be writing a treatise instead of conversing with you
741493 no doubt doctor and yet the conversation may prove more important than the treatise incidentally i may tell you that we are doing the reverse of what you very justly blame and that we are endeavouring to prevent anything like public exposure of private matters which must necessarily follow when once the case is fairly in the hands of the official police you may look upon me simply as an irregular pioneer who goes in front of the regular forces of the country i have come to ask you about mr godfrey staunton
741494 he left his hotel last night he has not been heard of
741495 i have no sympathy with these childish games the young mans fate interests me deeply since i know him and like him the football match does not come within my horizon at all
741496 i claim your sympathy then in my investigation of mr stauntons fate do you know where he is
741497 then perhaps you will explain this receipted bill for thirteen guineas paid by mr godfrey staunton last month to dr leslie armstrong of cambridge i picked it out from among the papers upon his desk
741498 i do not feel that there is any reason why i should render an explanation to you mr holmes
741499 if you prefer a public explanation it must come sooner or later
741500 i have already told you that i can hush up that which others will be bound to publish and you would really be wiser to take me into your complete confidence
741501 a most urgent telegram was dispatched to you from london by godfrey staunton at six fifteen yesterday evening a telegram which is undoubtedly associated with his disappearance and yet you have not had it it is most culpable i shall certainly go down to the office here and register a complaint
741502 ill trouble you to walk out of my house sir
741503 you can tell your employer lord mount james that i do not wish to have anything to do either with him or with his agents no sir not another word
741504 dr leslie armstrong is certainly a man of energy and character
741505 i have not seen a man who if he turned his talents that way was more calculated to fill the gap left by the illustrious moriarty and now my poor watson here we are stranded and friendless in this inhospitable town which we cannot leave without abandoning our case this little inn just opposite armstrongs house is singularly adapted to our needs if you would engage a front room and purchase the necessaries for the night i may have time to make a few inquiries
741506 started at half past six and here it is back again that gives a radius of ten or twelve miles and he does it once or sometimes twice a day
741507 but armstrong is not really a doctor in practice he is a lecturer and a consultant but he does not care for general practice which distracts him from his literary work why then does he make these long journeys which must be exceedingly irksome to him and who is it that he visits
741508 my dear watson can you doubt that it was to him that i first applied i do not know whether it came from his own innate depravity or from the promptings of his master but he was rude enough to set a dog at me neither dog nor man liked the look of my stick however and the matter fell through relations were strained after that and further inquiries out of the question all that i have learned i got from a friendly native in the yard of our own inn it was he who told me of the doctors habits and of his daily journey at that instant to give point to his words the carriage came round to the door
741509 excellent watson you are scintillating this evening the idea did cross my mind there is as you may have observed a bicycle shop next to our inn into this i rushed engaged a bicycle and was able to get started before the carriage was quite out of sight i rapidly overtook it and then keeping at a discreet distance of a hundred yards or so i followed its lights until we were clear of the town we had got well out on the country road when a somewhat mortifying incident occurred the carriage stopped the doctor alighted walked swiftly back to where i had also halted and told me in an excellent sardonic fashion that he feared the road was narrow and that he hoped his carriage did not impede the passage of my bicycle nothing could have been more admirable than his way of putting it i at once rode past the carriage and keeping to the main road i went on for a few miles and then halted in a convenient place to see if the carriage passed there was no sign of it however and so it became evident that it had turned down one of several side roads which i had observed i rode back but again saw nothing of the carriage and now as you perceive it has returned after me of course i had at the outset no particular reason to connect these journeys with the disappearance of godfrey staunton and was only inclined to investigate them on the general grounds that everything which concerns dr armstrong is at present of interest to us but now that i find he keeps so keen a look out upon anyone who may follow him on these excursions the affair appears more important and i shall not be satisfied until i have made the matter clear
741510 can we it is not so easy as you seem to think you are not familiar with cambridgeshire scenery are you it does not lend itself to concealment all this country that i passed over to night is as flat and clean as the palm of your hand and the man we are following is no fool as he very clearly showed to night i have wired to overton to let us know any fresh london developments at this address and in the meantime we can only concentrate our attention upon dr armstrong whose name the obliging young lady at the office allowed me to read upon the counterfoil of stauntons urgent message he knows where the young man is to that ill swear and if he knows then it must be our own fault if we cannot manage to know also at present it must be admitted that the odd trick is in his possession and as you are aware watson it is not my habit to leave the game in that condition
741511 well well he excites my curiosity and i must really know more before i leave him
741512 there he is stepping into it i saw him glance up at our window as he did so suppose i try my luck upon the bicycle
741513 no no my dear watson with all respect for your natural acumen i do not think that you are quite a match for the worthy doctor i think that possibly i can attain our end by some independent explorations of my own i am afraid that i must leave you to your own devices as the appearance of two inquiring strangers upon a sleepy countryside might excite more gossip than i care for no doubt you will find some sights to amuse you in this venerable city and i hope to bring back a more favourable report to you before evening
741514 i have had a blank day watson having got the doctors general direction i spent the day in visiting all the villages upon that side of cambridge and comparing notes with publicans and other local news agencies i have covered some ground chesterton histon waterbeach and oakington have each been explored and have each proved disappointing the daily appearance of a brougham and pair could hardly have been overlooked in such sleepy hollows the doctor has scored once more is there a telegram for me
741515 yes i opened it here it is ask for pompey from jeremy dixon trinity college i dont understand it
741516 oh it is clear enough it is from our friend overton and is in answer to a question from me ill just send round a note to mr jeremy dixon and then i have no doubt that our luck will turn by the way is there any news of the match
741517 personally i am in agreement with dr armstrong and football does not come within my horizon early to bed to night watson for i foresee that to morrow may be an eventful day
741518 no no my dear fellow there is no cause for alarm it is not upon this occasion the instrument of evil but it will rather prove to be the key which will unlock our mystery on this syringe i base all my hopes i have just returned from a small scouting expedition and everything is favourable eat a good breakfast watson for i propose to get upon dr armstrongs trail to day and once on it i will not stop for rest or food until i run him to his burrow
741519 we had best carry our breakfast with us for he is making an early start his carriage is at the door
741520 never mind let him go he will be clever if he can drive where i cannot follow him when you have finished come downstairs with me and i will introduce you to a detective who is a very eminent specialist in the work that lies before us
741521 pompey is the pride of the local draghounds no very great flier as his build will show but a staunch hound on a scent well pompey you may not be fast but i expect you will be too fast for a couple of middle aged london gentlemen so i will take the liberty of fastening this leather leash to your collar now boy come along and show what you can do
741522 a threadbare and venerable device but useful upon occasion i walked into the doctors yard this morning and shot my syringe full of aniseed over the hind wheel a draghound will follow aniseed from here to john o groats and our friend armstrong would have to drive through the cam before he would shake pompey off his trail oh the cunning rascal this is how he gave me the slip the other night
741523 this detour 2 has been entirely for our benefit then
741524 no wonder that my inquiries among those villages led to nothing the doctor has certainly played the game for all it is worth and one would like to know the reason for such elaborate deception this should be the village of trumpington to the right of us and by jove here is the brougham coming round the corner quick watson quick or we are done
741525 i fear there is some dark ending to our quest
741526 it cannot be long before we know it come pompey ah it is the cottage in the field
741527 that settles it we are bound to see what it means before he comes
741528 yes yes i am but you are too late she is dead
741529 you have attained your end and have certainly chosen a particularly delicate moment for your intrusion i would not brawl in the presence of death but i can assure you that if i were a younger man your monstrous conduct would not pass with impunity
741530 excuse me dr armstrong i think we are a little at cross purposes
741531 if you could step downstairs with us we may each be able to give some light to the other upon this miserable affair
741532 i wish you to understand in the first place that i am not employed by lord mount james and that my sympathies in this matter are entirely against that nobleman when a man is lost it is my duty to ascertain his fate but having done so the matter ends so far as i am concerned and so long as there is nothing criminal i am much more anxious to hush up private scandals than to give them publicity if as i imagine there is no breach of the law in this matter you can absolutely depend upon my discretion and my co operation in keeping the facts out of the papers
741533 i had misjudged you i thank heaven that my compunction at leaving poor staunton all alone in this plight caused me to turn my carriage back and so to make your acquaintance knowing as much as you do the situation is very easily explained a year ago godfrey staunton lodged in london for a time and became passionately attached to his landladys daughter whom he married she was as good as she was beautiful and as intelligent as she was good no man need be ashamed of such a wife but godfrey was the heir to this crabbed old nobleman and it was quite certain that the news of his marriage would have been the end of his inheritance i knew the lad well and i loved him for his many excellent qualities i did all i could to help him to keep things straight we did our very best to keep the thing from everyone for when once such a whisper gets about it is not long before everyone has heard it thanks to this lonely cottage and his own discretion godfrey has up to now succeeded their secret was known to no one save to me and to one excellent servant who has at present gone for assistance to trumpington but at last there came a terrible blow in the shape of dangerous illness to his wife it was consumption of the most virulent kind the poor boy was half crazed with grief and yet he had to go to london to play this match for he could not get out of it without explanations which would expose his secret i tried to cheer him up by a wire and he sent me one in reply imploring me to do all i could this was the telegram which you appear in some inexplicable way to have seen i did not tell him how urgent the danger was for i knew that he could do no good here but i sent the truth to the girls father and he very injudiciously communicated it to godfrey the result was that he came straight away in a state bordering on frenzy and has remained in the same state kneeling at the end of her bed until this morning death put an end to her sufferings that is all mr holmes and i am sure that i can rely upon your discretion and that of your friend
741534 the game is afoot not a word into your clothes and come
741535 my dear mr holmes i should be very glad of your immediate
741536 hopkins has called me in seven times and on each occasion his summons has been entirely justified
741537 i fancy that every one of his cases has found its way into your collection and i must admit watson that you have some power of selection which atones for much which i deplore in your narratives your fatal habit of looking at everything from the point of view of a story instead of as a scientific exercise has ruined what might have been an instructive and even classical series of demonstrations you slur over work of the utmost finesse and delicacy in order to dwell upon sensational details which may excite but cannot possibly instruct the reader
741538 i will my dear watson i will at present i am as you know fairly busy but i propose to devote my declining years to the composition of a text book which shall focus the whole art of detection into one volume our present research appears to be a case of murder
741539 i should say so hopkinss writing shows considerable agitation and he is not an emotional man yes i gather there has been violence and that the body is left for our inspection a mere suicide would not have caused him to send for me as to the release of the lady it would appear that she has been locked in her room during the tragedy we are moving in high life watson crackling paper e b monogram coat of arms picturesque address i think that friend hopkins will live up to his reputation and that we shall have an interesting morning the crime was committed before twelve last night
741540 by an inspection of the trains and by reckoning the time the local police had to be called in they had to communicate with scotland yard hopkins had to go out and he in turn had to send for me all that makes a fair nights work well here we are at chislehurst station and we shall soon set our doubts at rest
741541 im very glad you have come mr holmes and you too dr watson but indeed if i had my time over again i should not have troubled you for since the lady has come to herself she has given so clear an account of the affair that there is not much left for us to do you remember that lewisham gang of burglars
741542 exactly the father and two sons its their work i have not a doubt of it they did a job at sydenham a fortnight ago and were seen and described rather cool to do another so soon and so near but it is they beyond all doubt its a hanging matter this time
741543 yes his head was knocked in with his own poker
741544 exactly one of the richest men in kent lady brackenstall is in the morning room poor lady she has had a most dreadful experience she seemed half dead when i saw her first i think you had best see her and hear her account of the facts then we will examine the dining room together
741545 could you not repeat it for me well if you think it necessary i will tell these gentlemen what occurred have they been in the dining room yet
741546 i thought they had better hear your ladyships story first
741547 i shall be glad when you can arrange matters it is horrible to me to think of him still lying there
741548 it is nothing it has no connection with the hideous business of
741549 i am the wife of sir eustace brackenstall i have been married about a year i suppose that it is no use my attempting to conceal that our marriage has not been a happy one i fear that all our neighbours would tell you that even if i were to attempt to deny it perhaps the fault may be partly mine i was brought up in the freer less conventional atmosphere of south australia and this english life with its proprieties and its primness is not congenial to me but the main reason lies in the one fact which is notorious to everyone and that is that sir eustace was a confirmed drunkard to be with such a man for an hour is unpleasant can you imagine what it means for a sensitive and high spirited woman to be tied to him for day and night it is a sacrilege a crime a villainy to hold that such a marriage is binding i say that these monstrous laws of yours will bring a curse upon the land heaven will not let such wickedness endure
741550 i will tell you about last night you are aware perhaps that
741551 sir eustace retired about half past ten the servants had already gone to their quarters only my maid was up and she had remained in her room at the top of the house until i needed her services i sat until after eleven in this room absorbed in a book then i walked round to see that all was right before i went upstairs it was my custom to do this myself for as i have explained sir eustace was not always to be trusted i went into the kitchen the butlers pantry the gun room the billiard room the drawing room and finally the dining room as i approached the window which is covered with thick curtains i suddenly felt the wind blow upon my face and realized that it was open i flung the curtain aside and found myself face to face with a broad shouldered elderly man who had just stepped into the room the window is a long french one which really forms a door leading to the lawn i held my bedroom candle lit in my hand and by its light behind the first man i saw two others who were in the act of entering i stepped back but the fellow was on me in an instant he caught me first by the wrist and then by the throat i opened my mouth to scream but he struck me a savage blow with his fist over the eye and felled me to the ground i must have been unconscious for a few minutes for when i came to myself i found that they had torn down the bell rope and had secured me tightly to the oaken chair which stands at the head of the dining room table i was so firmly bound that i could not move and a handkerchief round my mouth prevented me from uttering any sound it was at this instant that my unfortunate husband entered the room he had evidently heard some suspicious sounds and he came prepared for such a scene as he found he was dressed in his shirt and trousers with his favourite blackthorn cudgel in his hand he rushed at one of the burglars but another it was the elderly man stooped picked the poker out of the grate and struck him a horrible blow as he passed he fell without a groan and never moved again i fainted once more but again it could only have been a very few minutes during which i was insensible when i opened my eyes i found that they had collected the silver from the sideboard and they had drawn a bottle of wine which stood there each of them had a glass in his hand i have already told you have i not that one was elderly with a beard and the others young hairless lads they might have been a father with his two sons they talked together in whispers then they came over and made sure that i was still securely bound finally they withdrew closing the window after them it was quite a quarter of an hour before i got my mouth free when i did so my screams brought the maid to my assistance the other servants were soon alarmed and we sent for the local police who instantly communicated with london that is really all i can tell you gentlemen and i trust that it will not be necessary for me to go over so painful a story again
741552 i will not impose any further tax upon lady brackenstalls patience and time
741553 before i go into the dining room i should like to hear your experience
741554 i saw the men before ever they came into the house
741555 as i sat by my bedroom window i saw three men in the moonlight down by the lodge gate yonder but i thought nothing of it at the time it was more than an hour after that i heard my mistress scream and down i ran to find her poor lamb just as she says and him on the floor with his blood and brains over the room it was enough to drive a woman out of her wits tied there and her very dress spotted with him but she never wanted courage did miss mary fraser of adelaide and lady brackenstall of abbey grange hasnt learned new ways youve questioned her long enough you gentlemen and now she is coming to her own room just with her old theresa to get the rest that she badly needs
741556 nursed her as a baby and came with her to england when they first left australia eighteen months ago theresa wright is her name and the kind of maid you dont pick up nowadays this way mr holmes if you please
741557 i have some record of the fellow and he is a rough customer
741558 not the slightest we have been on the look out for him and there was some idea that he had got away to america now that we know the gang are here i dont see how they can escape we have the news at every seaport already and a reward will be offered before evening what beats me is how they could have done so mad a thing knowing that the lady could describe them and that we could not fail to recognise the description
741559 exactly one would have expected that they would have silenced lady brackenstall as well
741560 that is likely enough if she seemed to be senseless they would not take her life what about this poor fellow hopkins i seem to have heard some queer stories about him
741561 he was a good hearted man when he was sober but a perfect fiend when he was drunk or rather when he was half drunk for he seldom really went the whole way the devil seemed to be in him at such times and he was capable of anything from what i hear in spite of all his wealth and his title he very nearly came our way once or twice there was a scandal about his drenching a dog with petroleum and setting it on fire her ladyships dog to make the matter worse and that was only hushed up with difficulty then he threw a decanter at that maid theresa wright there was trouble about that on the whole and between ourselves it will be a brighter house without him what are you looking at now
741562 when this was pulled down the bell in the kitchen must have rung loudly
741563 no one could hear it the kitchen stands right at the back of the house
741564 how did the burglar know no one would hear it how dared he pull at a bell rope in that reckless fashion
741565 exactly mr holmes exactly you put the very question which i have asked myself again and again there can be no doubt that this fellow must have known the house and its habits he must have perfectly understood that the servants would all be in bed at that comparatively early hour and that no one could possibly hear a bell ring in the kitchen therefore he must have been in close league with one of the servants surely that is evident but there are eight servants and all of good character
741566 one would suspect the one at whose head the master threw a decanter and yet that would involve treachery towards the mistress to whom this woman seems devoted well well the point is a minor one and when you have randall you will probably find no difficulty in securing his accomplice the ladys story certainly seems to be corroborated if it needed corroboration by every detail which we see before us
741567 there are no signs here but the ground is iron hard and one would not expect them i see that these candles on the mantelpiece have been lighted
741568 yes it was by their light and that of the ladys bedroom candle that the burglars saw their way about
741569 well they did not take much only half a dozen articles of plate off the sideboard lady brackenstall thinks that they were themselves so disturbed by the death of sir eustace that they did not ransack the house as they would otherwise have done
741570 no doubt that is true and yet they drank some wine i understand
741571 exactly these three glasses upon the sideboard have been untouched i suppose
741572 let us look at it halloa halloa what is this
741573 no you remember that she was senseless at the moment when the bottle was opened
741574 quite so as a matter of fact that screw was not used this bottle was opened by a pocket screw probably contained in a knife and not more than an inch and a half long if you examine the top of the cork you will observe that the screw was driven in three times before the cork was extracted it has never been transfixed this long screw would have transfixed it and drawn it with a single pull when you catch this fellow you will find that he has one of these multiplex knives in his possession
741575 but these glasses do puzzle me i confess lady brackenstall actually saw the three men drinking did she not
741576 then there is an end of it what more is to be said and yet you must admit that the three glasses are very remarkable hopkins what you see nothing remarkable well well let it pass perhaps when a man has special knowledge and special powers like my own it rather encourages him to seek a complex explanation when a simpler one is at hand of course it must be a mere chance about the glasses well good morning hopkins i dont see that i can be of any use to you and you appear to have your case very clear you will let me know when randall is arrested and any further developments which may occur i trust that i shall soon have to congratulate you upon a successful conclusion come watson i fancy that we may employ ourselves more profitably at home
741577 surely there are details in her story which if we looked at it in cold blood would excite our suspicion these burglars made a considerable haul at sydenham a fortnight ago some account of them and of their appearance was in the papers and would naturally occur to anyone who wished to invent a story in which imaginary robbers should play a part as a matter of fact burglars who have done a good stroke of business are as a rule only too glad to enjoy the proceeds in peace and quiet without embarking on another perilous undertaking again it is unusual for burglars to operate at so early an hour it is unusual for burglars to strike a lady to prevent her screaming since one would imagine that was the sure way to make her scream it is unusual for them to commit murder when their numbers are sufficient to overpower one man it is unusual for them to be content with a limited plunder when there is much more within their reach and finally i should say that it was very unusual for such men to leave a bottle half empty how do all these unusuals strike you watson
741578 their cumulative effect is certainly considerable and yet each of them is quite possible in itself the most unusual thing of all as it seems to me is that the lady should be tied to the chair
741579 well i am not so clear about that watson for it is evident that they must either kill her or else secure her in such a way that she could not give immediate notice of their escape but at any rate i have shown have i not that there is a certain element of improbability about the ladys story and now on the top of this comes the incident of the wine glasses
741580 we are told that three men drank from them does that strike you as likely
741581 exactly but there was bees wing only in one glass you must have noticed that fact what does that suggest to your mind
741582 the last glass filled would be most likely to contain bees wing
741583 not at all the bottle was full of it and it is inconceivable that the first two glasses were clear and the third heavily charged with it there are two possible explanations and only two one is that after the second glass was filled the bottle was violently agitated and so the third glass received the bees wing that does not appear probable no no i am sure that i am right
741584 that only two glasses were used and that the dregs of both were poured into a third glass so as to give the false impression that three people had been here in that way all the bees wing would be in the last glass would it not yes i am convinced that this is so but if i have hit upon the true explanation of this one small phenomenon then in an instant the case rises from the commonplace to the exceedingly remarkable for it can only mean that lady brackenstall and her maid have deliberately lied to us that not one word of their story is to be believed that they have some very strong reason for covering the real criminal and that we must construct our case for ourselves without any help from them that is the mission which now lies before us and here watson is the chislehurst train
741585 we have got our case one of the most remarkable in our collection but dear me how slow witted i have been and how nearly i have committed the blunder of my lifetime now i think that with a few missing links my chain is almost complete
741586 man watson man only one but a very formidable person strong as a lion witness the blow which bent that poker six foot three in height active as a squirrel dexterous with his fingers finally remarkably quick witted for this whole ingenious story is of his concoction yes watson we have come upon the handiwork of a very remarkable individual and yet in that bell rope he has given us a clue which should not have left us a doubt
741587 well if you were to pull down a bell rope watson where would you expect it to break surely at the spot where it is attached to the wire why should it break three inches from the top as this one has done
741588 exactly this end which we can examine is frayed he was cunning enough to do that with his knife but the other end is not frayed you could not observe that from here but if you were on the mantelpiece you would see that it is cut clean off without any mark of fraying whatever you can reconstruct what occurred the man needed the rope he would not tear it down for fear of giving the alarm by ringing the bell what did he do he sprang up on the mantelpiece could not quite reach it put his knee on the bracket you will see the impression in the dust and so got his knife to bear upon the cord i could not reach the place by at least three inches from which i infer that he is at least three inches a bigger man than i look at that mark upon the seat of the oaken chair what is it
741589 undoubtedly it is blood this alone puts the ladys story out of court if she were seated on the chair when the crime was done how comes that mark no no she was placed in the chair after the death of her husband ill wager that the black dress shows a corresponding mark to this we have not yet met our waterloo watson but this is our marengo for it begins in defeat and ends in victory i should like now to have a few words with the nurse theresa we must be wary for awhile if we are to get the information which we want
741590 yes sir it is true that he threw the decanter at me i heard him call my mistress a name and i told him that he would not dare to speak so if her brother had been there then it was that he threw it at me he might have thrown a dozen if he had but left my bonny bird alone he was for ever illtreating her and she too proud to complain she will not even tell me all that he has done to her she never told me of those marks on her arm that you saw this morning but i know very well that they come from a stab with a hat pin the sly fiend heaven forgive me that i should speak of him so now that he is dead but a fiend he was if ever one walked the earth he was all honey when first we met him only eighteen months ago and we both feel as if it were eighteen years she had only just arrived in london yes it was her first voyage she had never been from home before he won her with his title and his money and his false london ways if she made a mistake she has paid for it if ever a woman did what month did we meet him well i tell you it was just after we arrived we arrived in june and it was july they were married in january of last year yes she is down in the morning room again and i have no doubt she will see you but you must not ask too much of her for she has gone through all that flesh and blood will stand
741591 that you have not come to cross examine me again
741592 i will not cause you any unnecessary trouble lady brackenstall and my whole desire is to make things easy for you for i am convinced that you are a much tried woman if you will treat me as a friend and trust me you may find that i will justify your trust
741593 no no lady brackenstall it is no use you may have heard of any little reputation which i possess i will stake it all on the fact that your story is an absolute fabrication
741594 do you mean to say that my mistress has told a lie
741595 think once more lady brackenstall would it not be better to be frank
741596 it may be a hit or it may be a miss but we are bound to do something for friend hopkins just to justify this second visit
741597 i will not quite take him into my confidence yet i think our next scene of operations must be the shipping office of the adelaide southampton line which stands at the end of pall mall if i remember right there is a second line of steamers which connect south australia with england but we will draw the larger cover first
741598 once that warrant was made out nothing on earth would save him once or twice in my career i feel that i have done more real harm by my discovery of the criminal than ever he had done by his crime i have learned caution now and i had rather play tricks with the law of england than with my own conscience let us know a little more before we act
741599 i believe that you are a wizard mr holmes i really do sometimes think that you have powers that are not human now how on earth could you know that the stolen silver was at the bottom of that pond
741600 but you havent helped me you have made the affair far more difficult what sort of burglars are they who steal silver and then throw it into the nearest pond
741601 it was certainly rather eccentric behaviour i was merely going on the idea that if the silver had been taken by persons who did not want it who merely took it for a blind as it were then they would naturally be anxious to get rid of it
741602 well i thought it was possible when they came out through the french window there was the pond with one tempting little hole in the ice right in front of their noses could there be a better hiding place
741603 yes yes i see it all now it was early there were folk upon the roads they were afraid of being seen with the silver so they sank it in the pond intending to return for it when the coast was clear excellent mr holmes that is better than your idea of a blind
741604 quite so you have got an admirable theory i have no doubt that my own ideas were quite wild but you must admit that they have ended in discovering the silver
741605 yes sir yes it was all your doing but i have had a bad set back
741606 yes mr holmes the randall gang were arrested in new york this morning
741607 dear me hopkins that is certainly rather against your theory that they committed a murder in kent last night
741608 it is fatal mr holmes absolutely fatal still there are other gangs of three besides the randalls or it may be some new gang of which the police have never heard
741609 quite so it is perfectly possible what are you off
741610 ah thats the question of course but i commend the idea to your mind you might possibly find that there was something in it you wont stop for dinner well good bye and let us know how you get on
741611 now within a few minutes i dare say you thought i acted rather badly to stanley hopkins just now
741612 a very sensible reply watson you must look at it this way what i know is unofficial what he knows is official i have the right to private judgment but he has none he must disclose all or he is a traitor to his service in a doubtful case i would not put him in so painful a position and so i reserve my information until my own mind is clear upon the matter
741613 the time has come you will now be present at the last scene of a remarkable little drama
741614 i got your telegram and i came at the hour you said i heard that you had been down to the office there was no getting away from you lets hear the worst what are you going to do with me arrest me speak out man you cant sit there and play with me like a cat with a mouse
741615 bite on that captain croker and dont let your nerves run away with you i should not sit here smoking with you if i thought that you were a common criminal you may be sure of that be frank with me and we may do some good play tricks with me and ill crush you
741616 to give me a true account of all that happened at the abbey grange last night a true account mind you with nothing added and nothing taken off i know so much already that if you go one inch off the straight ill blow this police whistle from my window and the affair goes out of my hands for ever
741617 i must go back a bit you seem to know everything so i expect
741618 next time i came back from sea i heard of her marriage well
741619 well i never thought to see her again but last voyage i was promoted and the new boat was not yet launched so i had to wait for a couple of months with my people at sydenham one day out in a country lane i met theresa wright her old maid she told me about her about him about everything i tell you gentlemen it nearly drove me mad this drunken hound that he should dare to raise his hand to her whose boots he was not worthy to lick i met theresa again then i met mary herself and met her again then she would meet me no more but the other day i had a notice that i was to start on my voyage within a week and i determined that i would see her once before i left theresa was always my friend for she loved mary and hated this villain almost as much as i did from her i learned the ways of the house mary used to sit up reading in her own little room downstairs i crept round there last night and scratched at the window at first she would not open to me but in her heart i know that now she loves me and she could not leave me in the frosty night she whispered to me to come round to the big front window and i found it open before me so as to let me into the dining room again i heard from her own lips things that made my blood boil and again i cursed this brute who mishandled the woman that i loved well gentlemen i was standing with her just inside the window in all innocence as heaven is my judge when he rushed like a madman into the room called her the vilest name that a man could use to a woman and welted her across the face with the stick he had in his hand i had sprung for the poker and it was a fair fight between us see here on my arm where his first blow fell then it was my turn and i went through him as if he had been a rotten pumpkin do you think i was sorry not i it was his life or mine but far more than that it was his life or hers for how could i leave her in the power of this madman that was how i killed him was i wrong well then what would either of you gentlemen have done if you had been in my position
741620 she had screamed when he struck her and that brought old theresa down from the room above there was a bottle of wine on the sideboard and i opened it and poured a little between marys lips for she was half dead with the shock then i took a drop myself theresa was as cool as ice and it was her plot as much as mine we must make it appear that burglars had done the thing theresa kept on repeating our story to her mistress while i swarmed up and cut the rope of the bell then i lashed her in her chair and frayed out the end of the rope to make it look natural else they would wonder how in the world a burglar could have got up there to cut it then i gathered up a few plates and pots of silver to carry out the idea of a robbery and there i left them with orders to give the alarm when i had a quarter of an hours start i dropped the silver into the pond and made off for sydenham feeling that for once in my life i had done a real good nights work and thats the truth and the whole truth mr holmes if it costs me my neck
741621 i know that every word is true for you have hardly said a word which i did not know no one but an acrobat or a sailor could have got up to that bell rope from the bracket and no one but a sailor could have made the knots with which the cord was fastened to the chair only once had this lady been brought into contact with sailors and that was on her voyage and it was someone of her own class of life since she was trying hard to shield him and so showing that she loved him you see how easy it was for me to lay my hands upon you when once i had started upon the right trail
741622 i thought the police never could have seen through our dodge
741623 and the police havent nor will they to the best of my belief now look here captain croker this is a very serious matter though i am willing to admit that you acted under the most extreme provocation to which any man could be subjected i am not sure that in defence of your own life your action will not be pronounced legitimate however that is for a british jury to decide meanwhile i have so much sympathy for you that if you choose to disappear in the next twenty four hours i will promise you that no one will hinder you
741624 what sort of proposal is that to make to a man i know enough of law to understand that mary would be had as accomplice do you think i would leave her alone to face the music while i slunk away no sir let them do their worst upon me but for heavens sake mr holmes find some way of keeping my poor mary out of the courts
741625 i was only testing you and you ring true every time well it is a great responsibility that i take upon myself but i have given hopkins an excellent hint and if he cant avail himself of it i can do no more see here captain croker well do this in due form of law you are the prisoner watson you are a british jury and i never met a man who was more eminently fitted to represent one i am the judge now gentleman of the jury you have heard the evidence do you find the prisoner guilty or not guilty
741626 vox populi vox dei you are acquitted captain croker so long as the law does not find some other victim you are safe from me come back to this lady in a year and may her future and yours justify us in the judgment which we have pronounced this night
741627 when i discovered my loss mr holmes which was at eight oclock this morning i at once informed the prime minister it was at his suggestion that we have both come to you
741628 we have not done so nor is it possible that we should do so to inform the police must in the long run mean to inform the public this is what we particularly desire to avoid
741629 because the document in question is of such immense importance that its publication might very easily i might almost say probably lead to european complications of the utmost moment it is not too much to say that peace or war may hang upon the issue unless its recovery can be attended with the utmost secrecy then it may as well not be recovered at all for all that is aimed at by those who have taken it is that its contents should be generally known
741630 i understand now mr trelawney hope i should be much obliged if you would tell me exactly the circumstances under which this document disappeared
741631 that can be done in a very few words mr holmes the letter for it was a letter from a foreign potentate was received six days ago it was of such importance that i have never left it in my safe but i have taken it across each evening to my house in whitehall terrace and kept it in my bedroom in a locked despatch box it was there last night of that i am certain i actually opened the box while i was dressing for dinner and saw the document inside this morning it was gone the despatch box had stood beside the glass upon my dressing table all night i am a light sleeper and so is my wife we are both prepared to swear that no one could have entered the room during the night and yet i repeat that the paper is gone
741632 my wife had gone to the theatre i waited up for her it was half past eleven before we went to our room
741633 then for four hours the despatch box had lain unguarded
741634 no one is ever permitted to enter that room save the housemaid in the morning and my valet or my wifes maid during the rest of the day they are both trusty servants who have been with us for some time besides neither of them could possibly have known that there was anything more valuable than the ordinary departmental papers in my despatch box
741635 no sir i had said nothing to my wife until i missed the paper this morning
741636 i have long known sir how high is your sense of public duty
741637 i am convinced that in the case of a secret of this importance it would rise superior to the most intimate domestic ties
741638 you do me no more than justice sir until this morning i have never breathed one word to my wife upon this matter
741639 no mr holmes she could not have guessed nor could anyone have guessed
741640 who is there in england who did know of the existence of this letter
741641 each member of the cabinet was informed of it yesterday but the pledge of secrecy which attends every cabinet meeting was increased by the solemn warning which was given by the prime minister good heavens to think that within a few hours i should myself have lost it
741642 besides the members of the cabinet there are two or possibly three departmental officials who know of the letter no one else in england mr holmes i assure you
741643 i believe that no one abroad has seen it save the man who wrote it i am well convinced that his ministers that the usual official channels have not been employed
741644 now sir i must ask you more particularly what this document is and why its disappearance should have such momentous consequences
741645 mr holmes the envelope is a long thin one of pale blue colour
741646 that interesting and indeed essential as these details are my inquiries must go more to the root of things what was the letter
741647 that is a state secret of the utmost importance and i fear that i cannot tell you nor do i see that it is necessary if by the aid of the powers which you are said to possess you can find such an envelope as i describe with its enclosure you will have deserved well of your country and earned any reward which it lies in our power to bestow
741648 you are two of the most busy men in the country
741649 and in my own small way i have also a good many calls upon me i regret exceedingly that i cannot help you in this matter and any continuation of this interview would be a waste of time
741650 we must accept your terms mr holmes no doubt you are right and it is unreasonable for us to expect you to act unless we give you our entire confidence
741651 then i will tell you relying entirely upon your honour and that of your colleague dr watson i may appeal to your patriotism also for i could not imagine a greater misfortune for the country than that this affair should come out
741652 the letter then is from a certain foreign potentate who has been ruffled by some recent colonial developments of this country it has been written hurriedly and upon his own responsibility entirely inquiries have shown that his ministers know nothing of the matter at the same time it is couched in so unfortunate a manner and certain phrases in it are of so provocative a character that its publication would undoubtedly lead to a most dangerous state of feeling in this country there would be such a ferment sir that i do not hesitate to say that within a week of the publication of that letter this country would be involved in a great war
741653 exactly it was he and it is this letter this letter which may well mean the expenditure of a thousand millions and the lives of a hundred thousand men which has become lost in this unaccountable fashion
741654 no sir we have strong reason to believe that he already understands that he has acted in an indiscreet and hot headed manner it would be a greater blow to him and to his country than to us if this letter were to come out
741655 if this is so whose interest is it that the letter should come out why should anyone desire to steal it or to publish it
741656 there mr holmes you take me into regions of high international politics but if you consider the european situation you will have no difficulty in perceiving the motive the whole of europe is an armed camp there is a double league which makes a fair balance of military power great britain holds the scales if britain were driven into war with one confederacy it would assure the supremacy of the other confederacy whether they joined in the war or not do you follow
741657 very clearly it is then the interest of the enemies of this potentate to secure and publish this letter so as to make a breach between his country and ours
741658 and to whom would this document be sent if it fell into the hands of an enemy
741659 to any of the great chancelleries of europe it is probably speeding on its way thither at the present instant as fast as steam can take it
741660 it is your misfortune my dear fellow no one can blame you there is no precaution which you have neglected now mr holmes you are in full possession of the facts what course do you recommend
741661 you think sir that unless this document is recovered there will be war
741662 consider the facts sir it is inconceivable that it was taken after eleven thirty at night since i understand that mr hope and his wife were both in the room from that hour until the loss was found out it was taken then yesterday evening between seven thirty and eleven thirty probably near the earlier hour since whoever took it evidently knew that it was there and would naturally secure it as early as possible now sir if a document of this importance were taken at that hour where can it be now no one has any reason to retain it it has been passed rapidly on to those who need it what chance have we now to overtake or even to trace it it is beyond our reach
741663 what you say is perfectly logical mr holmes i feel that the matter is indeed out of our hands
741664 let us presume for arguments sake that the document was taken
741665 i understand you to say that your room is on the second floor that there is no entrance from without and that from within no one could go up unobserved it must then be somebody in the house who has taken it to whom would the thief take it to one of several international spies and secret agents whose names are tolerably familiar to me there are three who may be said to be the heads of their profession i will begin my research by going round and finding if each of them is at his post if one is missing especially if he has disappeared since last night we will have some indication as to where the document has gone
741666 he would take the letter to an embassy in london as likely as not
741667 i fancy not these agents work independently and their relations with the embassies are often strained
741668 i believe you are right mr holmes he would take so valuable a prize to head quarters with his own hands i think that your course of action is an excellent one meanwhile hope we cannot neglect all our other duties on account of this one misfortune should there be any fresh developments during the day we shall communicate with you and you will no doubt let us know the results of your own inquiries
741669 there is no better way of approaching it the situation is desperate but not hopeless even now if we could be sure which of them has taken it it is just possible that it has not yet passed out of his hands after all it is a question of money with these fellows and i have the british treasury behind me if its on the market ill buy it if it means another penny on the income tax it is conceivable that the fellow might hold it back to see what bids come from this side before he tries his luck on the other there are only those three capable of playing so bold a game there are oberstein la rothiere and eduardo lucas i will see each of them
741670 a crime of mysterious character was committed last night at 16 godolphin street one of the old fashioned and secluded rows of eighteenth century houses which lie between the river and the abbey almost in the shadow of the great tower of the houses of parliament this small but select mansion has been inhabited for some years by mr eduardo lucas well known in society circles both on account of his charming personality and because he has the well deserved reputation of being one of the best amateur tenors in the country mr lucas is an unmarried man thirty four years of age and his establishment consists of mrs pringle an elderly housekeeper and of mitton his valet the former retires early and sleeps at the top of the house the valet was out for the evening visiting a friend at hammersmith from ten oclock onwards mr lucas had the house to himself what occurred during that time has not yet transpired but at a quarter to twelve police constable barrett passing along godolphin street observed that the door of no 16 was ajar he knocked but received no answer perceiving a light in the front room he advanced into the passage and again knocked but without reply he then pushed open the door and entered the room was in a state of wild disorder the furniture being all swept to one side and one chair lying on its back in the centre beside this chair and still grasping one of its legs lay the unfortunate tenant of the house he had been stabbed to the heart and must have died instantly the knife with which the crime had been committed was a curved indian dagger plucked down from a trophy of oriental arms which adorned one of the walls robbery does not appear to have been the motive of the crime for there had been no attempt to remove the valuable contents of the room mr eduardo lucas was so well known and popular that his violent and mysterious fate will arouse painful interest and intense sympathy in a wide spread circle of friends
741671 a coincidence here is one of the three men whom we had named as possible actors in this drama and he meets a violent death during the very hours when we know that that drama was being enacted the odds are enormous against its being coincidence no figures could express them no my dear watson the two events are connected must be connected it is for us to find the connection
741672 not at all they know all they see at godolphin street they know and shall know nothing of whitehall terrace only we know of both events and can trace the relation between them there is one obvious point which would in any case have turned my suspicions against lucas godolphin street westminster is only a few minutes walk from whitehall terrace the other secret agents whom i have named live in the extreme west end it was easier therefore for lucas than for the others to establish a connection or receive a message from the european secretarys household a small thing and yet where events are compressed into a few hours it may prove essential halloa what have we here
741673 ask lady hilda trelawney hope if she will be kind enough to step up
741674 mr holmes i implore you not to tell him that i came here
741675 your ladyship places me in a very delicate position i beg that you will sit down and tell me what you desire but i fear that i cannot make any unconditional promise
741676 i will speak frankly to you in the hope that it may induce you to speak frankly in return there is complete confidence between my husband and me on all matters save one that one is politics on this his lips are sealed he tells me nothing now i am aware that there was a most deplorable occurrence in our house last night i know that a paper has disappeared but because the matter is political my husband refuses to take me into his complete confidence now it is essential essential i say that i should thoroughly understand it you are the only other person save only these politicians who knows the true facts i beg you then mr holmes to tell me exactly what has happened and what it will lead to tell me all mr holmes let no regard for your clients interests keep you silent for i assure you that his interests if he would only see it would be best served by taking me into his complete confidence what was this paper which was stolen
741677 you must see that this is so madam if your husband thinks fit to keep you in the dark over this matter is it for me who has only learned the true facts under the pledge of professional secrecy to tell what he has withheld it is not fair to ask it it is him whom you must ask
741678 i have asked him i come to you as a last resource but without your telling me anything definite mr holmes you may do a great service if you would enlighten me on one point
741679 is my husbands political career likely to suffer through this incident
741680 well madam unless it is set right it may certainly have a very unfortunate effect
741681 one more question mr holmes from an expression which my husband dropped in the first shock of this disaster i understood that terrible public consequences might arise from the loss of this document
741682 nay madam there again you ask me more than i can possibly answer
741683 then i will take up no more of your time i cannot blame you mr holmes for having refused to speak more freely and you on your side will not i am sure think the worse of me because i desire even against his will to share my husbands anxieties once more i beg that you will say nothing of my visit
741684 what was the fair ladys game what did she really want
741685 surely her own statement is clear and her anxiety very natural
741686 hum think of her appearance watson her manner her suppressed excitement her restlessness her tenacity in asking questions remember that she comes of a caste who do not lightly show emotion
741687 remember also the curious earnestness with which she assured us that it was best for her husband that she should know all what did she mean by that and you must have observed watson how she manoeuvred 1 to have the light at her back she did not wish us to read her expression
741688 and yet the motives of women are so inscrutable you remember the woman at margate whom i suspected for the same reason no powder on her nose that proved to be the correct solution how can you build on such a quicksand their most trivial action may mean volumes or their most extraordinary conduct may depend upon a hairpin or a curling tongs good morning watson
741689 yes i will wile away the morning at godolphin street with our friends of the regular establishment with eduardo lucas lies the solution of our problem though i must admit that i have not an inkling as to what form it may take it is a capital mistake to theorize in advance of the facts do you stay on guard my good watson and receive any fresh visitors ill join you at lunch if i am able
741690 a discovery has just been made by the parisian police
741691 which raises the veil which hung round the tragic fate of mr eduardo lucas who met his death by violence last monday night at godolphin street westminster our readers will remember that the deceased gentleman was found stabbed in his room and that some suspicion attached to his valet but that the case broke down on an alibi yesterday a lady who has been known as mme henri fournaye occupying a small villa in the rue austerlitz was reported to the authorities by her servants as being insane an examination showed that she had indeed developed mania of a dangerous and permanent form on inquiry the police have discovered that mme henri fournaye only returned from a journey to london on tuesday last and there is evidence to connect her with the crime at westminster a comparison of photographs has proved conclusively that m henri fournaye and eduardo lucas were really one and the same person and that the deceased had for some reason lived a double life in london and paris mme fournaye who is of creole origin is of an extremely excitable nature and has suffered in the past from attacks of jealousy which have amounted to frenzy it is conjectured that it was in one of these that she committed the terrible crime which has caused such a sensation in london her movements upon the monday night have not yet been traced but it is undoubted that a woman answering to her description attracted much attention at charing cross station on tuesday morning by the wildness of her appearance and the violence of her gestures it is probable therefore that the crime was either committed when insane or that its immediate effect was to drive the unhappy woman out of her mind at present she is unable to give any coherent account of the past and the doctors hold out no hopes of the re establishment of her reason there is evidence that a woman who might have been mme fournaye was seen for some hours on monday night watching the house in godolphin street
741692 you are most long suffering but if i have told you nothing in the last three days it is because there is nothing to tell even now this report from paris does not help us much
741693 the mans death is a mere incident a trivial episode in comparison with our real task which is to trace this document and save a european catastrophe only one important thing has happened in the last three days and that is that nothing has happened i get reports almost hourly from the government and it is certain that nowhere in europe is there any sign of trouble now if this letter were loose no it cant be loose but if it isnt loose where can it be who has it why is it held back thats the question that beats in my brain like a hammer was it indeed a coincidence that lucas should meet his death on the night when the letter disappeared did the letter ever reach him if so why is it not among his papers did this mad wife of his carry it off with her if so is it in her house in paris how could i search for it without the french police having their suspicions aroused it is a case my dear watson where the law is as dangerous to us as the criminals are every mans hand is against us and yet the interests at stake are colossal should i bring it to a successful conclusion it will certainly represent the crowning glory of my career ah here is my latest from the front
741694 halloa lestrade seems to have observed something of interest put on your hat watson and we will stroll down together to westminster
741695 our french friends seem to have touched the spot this time no doubt its just as they say she knocked at the door surprise visit i guess for he kept his life in water tight compartments he let her in couldnt keep her in the street she told him how she had traced him reproached him one thing led to another and then with that dagger so handy the end soon came it wasnt all done in an instant though for these chairs were all swept over yonder and he had one in his hand as if he had tried to hold her off with it weve got it all clear as if we had seen it
741696 ah yes thats another matter a mere trifle but the sort of thing you take an interest in queer you know and what you might call freakish it has nothing to do with the main fact cant have on the face of it
741697 well you know after a crime of this sort we are very careful to
741698 well im sure you would never guess in a hundred years what we did find you see that stain on the carpet well a great deal must have soaked through must it not
741699 well you will be surprised to hear that there is no stain on the white woodwork to correspond
741700 yes so you would say but the fact remains that there isnt
741701 but the underside is as stained as the upper it must have left a mark
741702 now ill show you the explanation there is a second stain but it does not correspond with the other see for yourself
741703 why it is simple enough the two stains did correspond but the carpet has been turned round as it was square and unfastened it was easily done
741704 has that constable in the passage been in charge of the place all the time
741705 well take my advice examine him carefully dont do it before us well wait here you take him into the back room youll be more likely to get a confession out of him alone ask him how he dared to admit people and leave them alone in this room dont ask him if he has done it take it for granted tell him you know someone has been here press him tell him that a full confession is his only chance of forgiveness do exactly what i tell you
741706 by george if he knows ill have it out of him
741707 sorry to keep you waiting mr holmes i can see that you are bored to death with the whole affair well he has confessed all right come in here macpherson let these gentlemen hear of your most inexcusable conduct
741708 i meant no harm sir im sure the young woman came to the door last evening mistook the house she did and then we got talking its lonesome when youre on duty here all day
741709 she wanted to see where the crime was done had read about it in the papers she said she was a very respectable well spoken young woman sir and i saw no harm in letting her have a peep when she saw that mark on the carpet down she dropped on the floor and lay as if she were dead i ran to the back and got some water but i could not bring her to then i went round the corner to the ivy plant for some brandy and by the time i had brought it back the young woman had recovered and was off ashamed of herself i dare say and dared not face me
741710 well sir it was a bit rumpled certainly when i came back you see she fell on it and it lies on a polished floor with nothing to keep it in place i straightened it out afterwards
741711 its a lesson to you that you cant deceive me constable macpherson
741712 no doubt you thought that your breach of duty could never be discovered and yet a mere glance at that drugget was enough to convince me that someone had been admitted to the room its lucky for you my man that nothing is missing or you would find yourself in queer street im sorry to have called you down over such a petty business mr holmes but i thought the point of the second stain not corresponding with the first would interest you
741713 certainly it was most interesting has this woman only been here once constable
741714 dont know the name sir was answering an advertisement about type writing and came to the wrong number very pleasant genteel young woman sir
741715 yes sir she was a well grown young woman i suppose you might say she was handsome perhaps some would say she was very handsome oh officer do let me have a peep says she she had pretty coaxing ways as you might say and i thought there was no harm in letting her just put her head through the door
741716 it was just growing dusk at the time they were lighting the lamps as i came back with the brandy
741717 come watson i think that we have more important work elsewhere
741718 come friend watson the curtain rings up for the last act you will be relieved to hear that there will be no war that the right honourable trelawney hope will suffer no set back in his brilliant career that the indiscreet sovereign will receive no punishment for his indiscretion that the prime minister will have no european complication to deal with and that with a little tact and management upon our part nobody will be a penny the worse for what might have been a very ugly incident
741719 hardly that watson there are some points which are as dark as ever but we have so much that it will be our own fault if we cannot get the rest we will go straight to whitehall terrace and bring the matter to a head
741720 this is surely most unfair and ungenerous upon your part i desired as i have explained to keep my visit to you a secret lest my husband should think that i was intruding into his affairs and yet you compromise me by coming here and so showing that there are business relations between us
741721 unfortunately madam i had no possible alternative i have been commissioned to recover this immensely important paper i must therefore ask you madam to be kind enough to place it in my hands
741722 come come madam it is useless give up the letter
741723 do not ring lady hilda if you do then all my earnest efforts to avoid a scandal will be frustrated give up the letter and all will be set right if you will work with me i can arrange everything if you work against me i must expose you
741724 you are trying to frighten me it is not a very manly thing mr holmes to come here and browbeat a woman you say that you know something what is it that you know
741725 pray sit down madam you will hurt yourself there if you fall i will not speak until you sit down thank you
741726 one is enough lady hilda i know of your visit to eduardo lucas of your giving him this document of your ingenious return to the room last night and of the manner in which you took the letter from the hiding place under the carpet
741727 i have carried this because i thought it might be useful
741728 come lady hilda you have the letter the matter may still be adjusted i have no desire to bring trouble to you my duty ends when i have returned the lost letter to your husband take my advice and be frank with me it is your only chance
741729 i tell you again mr holmes that you are under some absurd illusion
741730 i am sorry for you lady hilda i have done my best for you i can see that it is all in vain
741731 he will be home sir at a quarter to one
741732 for heavens sake dont tell him i love him so i would not bring one shadow on his life and this i know would break his noble heart
741733 i am thankful madam that you have come to your senses even at this last moment there is not an instant to lose where is the letter
741734 here it is mr holmes would to heaven i had never seen it
741735 quick quick we must think of some way where is the despatch box
741736 what a stroke of luck quick madam bring it here
741737 how did you open it before you have a duplicate key yes of course you have open it
741738 we have still ten minutes i am going far to screen you lady hilda in return you will spend the time in telling me frankly the real meaning of this extraordinary affair
741739 oh mr holmes i would cut off my right hand before i gave him a moment of sorrow there is no woman in all london who loves her husband as i do and yet if he knew how i have acted how i have been compelled to act he would never forgive me for his own honour stands so high that he could not forget or pardon a lapse in another help me mr holmes my happiness his happiness our very lives are at stake
741740 it was a letter of mine mr holmes an indiscreet letter written before my marriage a foolish letter a letter of an impulsive loving girl i meant no harm and yet he would have thought it criminal had he read that letter his confidence would have been for ever destroyed it is years since i wrote it i had thought that the whole matter was forgotten then at last i heard from this man lucas that it had passed into his hands and that he would lay it before my husband i implored his mercy he said that he would return my letter if i would bring him a certain document which he described in my husbands despatch box he had some spy in the office who had told him of its existence he assured me that no harm could come to my husband put yourself in my position mr holmes what was i to do
741741 i could not mr holmes i could not on the one side seemed certain ruin on the other terrible as it seemed to take my husbands paper still in a matter of politics i could not understand the consequences while in a matter of love and trust they were only too clear to me i did it mr holmes i took an impression of his key this man lucas furnished a duplicate i opened his despatch box took the paper and conveyed it to godolphin street
741742 i tapped at the door as agreed lucas opened it i followed him
741743 what happened after that is like some fearful dream i have a
741744 it was next morning that i realized that i had only exchanged one trouble for another my husbands anguish at the loss of his paper went to my heart i could hardly prevent myself from there and then kneeling down at his feet and telling him what i had done but that again would mean a confession of the past i came to you that morning in order to understand the full enormity of my offence from the instant that i grasped it my whole mind was turned to the one thought of getting back my husbands paper it must still be where lucas had placed it for it was concealed before this dreadful woman entered the room if it had not been for her coming i should not have known where his hiding place was how was i to get into the room for two days i watched the place but the door was never left open last night i made a last attempt what i did and how i succeeded you have already learned i brought the paper back with me and thought of destroying it since i could see no way of returning it without confessing my guilt to my husband heavens i hear his step upon the stair
741745 the prime minister is lunching with me may he share your hopes he has nerves of steel and yet i know that he has hardly slept since this terrible event jacobs will you ask the prime minister to come up as to you dear i fear that this is a matter of politics we will join you in a few minutes in the dining room
741746 i understand that you have something to report mr holmes
741747 i have inquired at every point where it might be and i am sure that there is no danger to be apprehended
741748 but that is not enough mr holmes we cannot live for ever on such a volcano we must have something definite
741749 i am in hopes of getting it that is why i am here the more i think of the matter the more convinced i am that the letter has never left this house
741750 if it had it would certainly have been public by now
741751 but why should anyone take it in order to keep it in this house
741752 i am not convinced that it ever did leave the despatch box
741753 mr holmes this joking is very ill timed you have my assurance that it left the box
741754 but i am not convinced of it i have known such things to happen i presume there are other papers there well it may have got mixed with them
741755 jacobs bring down my despatch box this is a farcical waste of time but still if nothing else will satisfy you it shall be done thank you jacobs put it here i have always had the key on my watch chain here are the papers you see letter from lord merrow report from sir charles hardy memorandum from belgrade note on the russo german grain taxes letter from madrid note from lord flowers good heavens what is this lord bellinger lord bellinger
741756 yes it is it and the letter is intact hope i congratulate you
741757 thank you thank you what a weight from my heart but this is inconceivable impossible mr holmes you are a wizard a sorcerer how did you know it was there
741758 where is my wife i must tell her that all is well hilda hilda
741759 there is more in this than meets the eye how came the letter back in the box

741815 stabilization wedges each wedge being equal to 1 gigaton of carbon emitted per year then we should look at the annual capture capability of the plant which would be about 600 000 tons of carbon meaning youd need nearly 2000 such plants to make up a
741816 carbon dioxide is captured in an naoh solution sprayed through the air in a cooling tower like structure where it absorbs co2 from air and forms a solution of sodium carbonate na2co3 the na2co3 is regenerated to naoh by addition of lime cao forming calcium carbonate caco3 the caco3 in turn is regenerated to cao by addition of heat in a process called calcining
741817 air capture differs from conventional mitigation in three key aspects first it removes emissions from any part of the economy with equal ease or difficulty consequently its price caps the cost of mitigation with a scope unmatched by any other kind of abatement technology second because air capture allows the removal of co2 after emission it permits reduction in concentrations more quickly than can be achieved by the natural carbon cycle third because it is weakly coupled to the energy system air capture may offer stronger returns to scale and lower adjustment costs than conventional mitigation options

741819 i find it amazing that considering the size of it and how accessible it is that there havent been reports of people trying to climb over the barrier and sit on it and such the sheer proximity of it to the walkways would mean that over here in the uk there would be a load of health amp safety nuts putting up fences and such

741821 viruses can provide answers to questions we have never even asked
741822 if you think about this for five minutes it is wild stuff
741823 i understand that the idea of bringing something dead back to life is fundamentally frightening
741824 its a power that science has come to possess and it makes us queasy and it should but there are many viruses that are more dangerous than these more infectious far riskier to work with and less potentially useful
741825 the reason we did it was to prove that it can be done eckard wimmer who led the team said at the time
741826 progress in biomedical research has its benefits and it has its downside
741827 this is something not to fear but to celebrate heidmann told me one day as we sat in his office at the institute which is dedicated to the treatment and eradication of cancer
741828 what is remarkable here and unique is the fact that endogenous retroviruses are two things at once genes and viruses and those viruses helped make us who we are today just as surely as other genes did i am not certain that we would have survived as a species without them
741829 the phoenix virus sheds light on how h i v operates but more than that on how
741830 it is quite possible that without them human beings would still be laying eggs
741831 when i first submitted my results on a novel endogenous envelope suggesting the existence of an integrated retrovirus in normal embryo cells the manuscript was roundly rejected weiss wrote last year in the journal
741832 one reviewer pronounced that my interpretation was impossible weiss who is responsible for much of the basic knowledge about how the
741833 if charles darwin reappeared today he might be surprised to learn that humans are descended from viruses as well as from apes
741834 we can have a fossil record only of the viruses that made it into the germ line paul bieniasz told me
741835 with flu virus you can watch it change in real time he said
741836 you can watch the antibodies develop and see when and how it dies out but with these others you are looking back tens of millions of years so it is hard to know how a virus functioned
741837 if you have a person with a lethal defect in the heart bieniasz explained
741838 in the past you got sick and you keeled over and died he said
741839 or you survived nobody could make much sense of it but almost ten per cent of our dna consists of old retroviruses and that says to me that its pretty clear they played a major role in our evolution we evolved remarkably sophisticated defenses against them and we would have done that only if their impact on human populations had been quite severe its very likely that we have been under threat from retroviruses many times throughout human history it is eminently possible that this is not the first time we have been colonized by a virus very much like h i v
741840 single biggest threat to mans continued dominance on this planet is the virus
741841 we have been in an evolutionary arms race with viruses for at least one hundred million years he told me recently when i visited his laboratory
741842 there is genetic conflict everywhere you see it in processes that you would never suspect in cell division for instance and in the production of proteins involved in the very essence of maintaining life
741843 one party is winning and the other losing all the time
741844 thats evolution its the worlds definitive game of cat and mouse viruses evolve the host adapts proteins change viruses evade them it never ends
741845 to even think about the many million year processes that caused that sort of evolution
741846 it was fair to say i had little interest in chemical engineering and i happened to tell that to my faculty adviser he recalled
741847 which asserts that a gene will operate in its own interest even if that means destroying an organism that it inhabits or helped create
741848 this guy ended up teaching me by himself sitting across the table
741849 he looked at my schedule and said i see that you are doing genetics
741850 together we are trying to understand what constellation of viruses we are susceptible to and why emerman told me
741851 we know at least that it is all a consequence of infections our ancestors had so from there we want to try and derive a modern repertoire of antiviral genes
741852 but there was never any trace of its infecting humans
741853 we thought we must have a defense against this thing that they dont have malik told me picking up the story the following day
741854 where but in evolutionary history can you see a story like this with
741855 our version of this gene is highly effective against pt erv which is why we dont get infected he said
741856 when michael and i started to get into this business people had never thought much about the evolutionary meaning of that gene but we wondered is trim 5a just an anti h i v factor or is there something else going on here
741857 in every case the protein blocked either or h i v
741858 if we can develop a drug that acts the same way the monkey version of this protein acts so that it recognizes h
741859 first we have to establish what part of trim 5a is actually responsible for protecting monkeys against h i v
741860 then we would have to try and make it as a drug
741861 the challenge is to find out how little you can change the human version and still make it effective against h i v that is really what drives this whole story of re creating that extinct virus and doing these experiments nobody is doing this as a gimmick this virus could open doors that have been closed to us for millions of years and if we can learn how to do that we have a chance to find a very effective response to one of the worlds most incredibly effective viruses
741862 discovery and analysis of the first endogenous lentivirus published last spring in
741863 at first i just assumed it was a mistake katzourakis told me over lunch in the buildings cafeteria darwins caf
741864 its the most promising way to explore the evolution and the impact of h i v
741865 recent research has shown that it is possible to reconstruct infectious progenitors of such viruses
741866 the most obvious implication is that we can no longer say that h
741867 it opens the field to a whole new level of examination
741868 events like this have obviously occurred in human evolution paul bieniasz told me even with viruses like h
741869 we might be able to see how the koala infection settles into the genome and whether it plays a role in helping its host fend off other viruses
741870 whatever we learn will be useful because we could never have learned it in any other way
741871 the knowledge you gain from resurrecting something that has not been alive for a million years has to be immensely valuable harmit malik told me in seattle
741872 we didnt take it lightly and i dont think any of our colleagues did either
741873 if you cant apply the knowledge you shouldnt do the experiment
741874 viruses are accumulating and becoming more decrepit with every passing million years
741875 for a vaccine against an infectious agent this is a completely new strategy douglas nixon the immunologist who led the team said its one that could not have emerged without the recent knowledge gained through experiments with endogenous retroviruses
741876 this question will seem preposterous to most his essay begins
741877 viruses are molecular genetic parasites and are mostly recognized for their ability to induce disease
741878 a major creative force in our evolution driving each infected cell to acquire new and increasingly complex molecular identities
741879 clearly we have been observing evolution only for a very short time yet we can witness what current viruses
741880 we can also expect at least a few humans to survive he wrote
741881 these survivors would thus be left to repopulate the continent however the resulting human population would be distinct

741894 throughout his writings strauss remained deeply skeptical of whether political theory had any substantive advice or direction to offer statesmen the idea that political or military action can be used to eradicate evil from the human landscape is closer to the utopian and idealistic visions of marxism and the radical enlightenment than anything found in the writings of strauss
741895 the route to a renaissance of the american fine arts lies through religion
741896 is to enable man to be once more himself restored to his right mind and his right place as a creature under god the christian life is the life of man male and female made in the image of god and after his likeness to deny this humanity and attempt to reach beyond to a spirituality which somehow contradicts it is to fall prey once more to the tempter in his shining specious livery who as an angel of light beckons us to reach beyond the confines of our human existence to a place where in fact we deny it and fall from its dignity
741897 it was during the six and a half years of studying in japan that fujimura began to assimilate the combinations of abstract expressionism explored in the us with the traditional japanese art of nihonga upon his return to the us he began to exhibit his paintings in new york city while continuing to show in tokyo and was honored in 1992 as the youngest artist ever to have had a piece acquired by museum of contemporary art tokyo
741898 i t is not so much to further individual success or to produce new knowledge or even to preserve the monuments of the past rather it is to give form to this creative impulse in human culture
741899 courtship provided rituals of growing up for making clear the meaning of ones own human sexual nature and for entering into the ceremonial and customary world of ritual and sanctification courtship disciplined sexual desire and romantic attraction provided opportunities for mutual learning about one anothers character fostered salutary illusions that inspired admiration and devotion and by locating wooer and wooed in their familial settings taught the inter generational meaning of erotic activity it pointed the way to the answers to lifes biggest questions where are you going who is going with you how in what manner are you both going to go

741913 were not special we just happened to file a lawsuit that affects every same sex married couple in new york state
741914 i can sit here and tell you about all the practical reasons why marriage is important and all of those reasons were important to us but for me at least to be legally married is the ultimate commitment you can make to somebody
741915 along with marriage comes a host of rights and responsibilities
741916 i have to say i think there are a lot of married couples out there that have no ideas those rights exist for them
741917 when you talk to people out there theyre saying the gays dont want equal rights they want special rights

741973 gov arnold schwarzeneggers bombshell plan to slash the pay of state workers and lay off thousands of other employees to ease a looming cash shortage brought on by the states budget impasse faces the same obstacle that arose five years ago during a state fiscal crisis a state controller unwilling to cooperate

741975 but the republican administration maintained that schwarzenegger has the legal right to invoke such a controversial plan under which the pay of about 200 000 state workers would be reduced to the federal minimum wage of 6
741976 it may have been what the governor wanted all along even if they shouted his name in disgust
741977 the governors draft executive order to withhold a portion of state workers pay obtained wednesday by the bee has generated public attention for the states budget situation in a way that months of schwarzenegger town halls never could

741982 backers of a november initiative to ban same sex marriage in california plan to tell voters in the state ballot pamphlet that the constitutional amendment would protect children as young as kindergarten age from being taught in school about the virtues of gay and lesbian matrimony
741983 if the gay marriage ruling is not overturned teachers will be required to teach young children there is no difference between gay marriage and traditional marriage supporters of proposition 8 said in ballot arguments that went on public display this week at the secretary of states office
741984 its all nonsense and scare tactics opponents of the measure said thursday
741985 the argument represents an attempt by opponents of same sex marriage to open a new front in the prop 8 campaign although the interplay between gay rights and educational standards in california has surfaced before religious conservatives have sued in federal court to overturn a state law that took effect this year prohibiting public schools from discriminating because of sexual orientation or identity

741998 i wrote about the different kinds of cheating and why its wrong
741999 we applaud willie and his family who opted to have this operation done in the private sector rather than risking death waiting for the same surgery in a public hospital
742000 it is of course rather ironic that willie was once an mp for the far left alliance party which championed a second rate chain of under maintained hospitals that rationed out health care causing needless deaths for which no bureaucrat or politician was ever made accountable whatever would comrades laila harre phyllida bunkle and chris trotter think of willie now
742001 the reason many kiwis cant afford to do this is because half their income is taken from them in tax they cant afford to pay for surgery or even purchase private health insurance
742002 a libertarianz government would immediately let new zealanders keep the first 50 000 of their income and gst would be gone by lunchtime so that health insurance would be affordable for everyone
742003 within five years the whole rotten thieving inland revenue department would be completely dismantled
742004 if elected we would set up medical savings accounts for all new zealanders which would allow people to choose what level of health insurance they wanted removing the element of compulsion after five years so that people could manage these accounts themselves
742005 willie jackson has chosen well socialized medicine kills and willie wasnt ready to die just yet he chose to live every new zealander should have that choice its enough to make you vote libertarianz

742263 i predict that my projections for methane atmospheric concentrations industrial carbon dioxide co2 emissions and atmospheric concentrations and resultant lower tropospheric temperatures will be more accurate than those found in the intergovernmental panel on climate changes ipccs third assessment report tar the following are my mb projections and the ipcc tar projections for methane atmospheric concentrations in ppb worth 1 point industrial co2 emissions in gigatons as carbon worth 1 point co2 atmospheric concentrations in ppm worth 1 point and lower tropospheric temperature increases in degrees celsius relative to 1990 worth 3 points the projections are for the years 2030 2070 and 2100 2030 mb 1790 8 8 425 0 36 2030 ipcc 2060 13 2 438 0 80 2070 mb 1825 7 0 527 0 82 2070 ipcc 2300 16 4 610 2 17 2100 mb 1840 4 0 558 1 20 2100 ipcc 2450 16 4 720 3 06 lower tropospheric temperatures are as measured by satellite in a 3 year average around the year in question e g 2030 would be 2029 2030 20310 this bet is only open to members of the ipcc
742264 the ipcc do not make predictions for any of these values the five yearly assessment reviews include a variety of models showing various predictions for the response of various climate variables surface temperature sea level and so on to various emission scenarios this bet is therefore invalid

742273 science fiction author michael crichton has predicted the world will warm by 0 81 degrees celsius by the year 2100
742274 science fiction author michael crichton has predicted the world will warm by 0
742275 but why the heck would anyone invoke michael crichton in this kind of debate
742276 hes a popular author hes certainly no expert on science
742277 but raising him as an apparent authority on climate change is just bizarre
742278 and unnecessary since theres no need for an appeal to authority when youre challenging a fuzzy 100 year weather forecast
742279 in a prediction of world climate we can go with the worlds leading climatologists or with a science fiction writer hmmmm
742280 a machine capable of passing the turing test will be made in 2075 using only hardware that was available in 2005

742288 us accounting and banking regulations will not require that loan portfolios held in the

742292 as of august 2005 a democrat is president of the us
742293 as of august 2005 a democrat is president of the us
742294 what would be interesting would be to increase the duration of the bet if only for the purpose of discussion well beyond the election that would allow for these outside factors to a greater extent or even for the 2008 dare i say 2012 election which would require some quite interesting and fairly concentrated conjecture
742295 in november 2008 a democrat will be elected to a second term as president of the us
742296 if you are the type of person who likes assault weapons there is a place for you the united states army we have them
742297 anyone may challenge a prediction and must offer their own argument for why they think they will be proved right but the challenge does not become a bet until the original predictor has accepted the challenger and they have agreed upon the stakes
742298 i think the rather flagrant and not terribley covert ways in which the bush administration has used to stay in power have actually managed to offend republicans too
742299 i never knew the sixties and seventies but i feel their paranoia and i see phillip k dick walk among us and eric blair and they are right there will be no democrats elected in 2004 or 2008 there will be trouble there will be fear there will perhaps be open war of the ancient but modern kind on our own soil
742300 eno said i didnt understand what non coastal america thinks and i underestimate the rights political savvy along came the 2002 elections he was right i was wrong
742301 if this were a dictatorship itd be a heck of a lot easier just so long as im the dictator
742302 1 it was heavily edited and contains things i teed rockwell never said 2 the facts stated in it are no longer true because the cuyahoga election site has now changed their figures to continue to have this information attributed to me makes me look uninformed and incompetent i wasnt going to quibble about these details initially because i was glad that you were helping to get the word out but i am still receiving emails from people some quite abusive because they think i am not aware of these changes if you wish to have my current views on this subject you could put up the page which is available at my site at http www california com mcmf cuyahoga htm
742303 o h i o suppressed democracy has got to go
742304 one vote denied democracy in trouble 100s of 1000s of votes surprised democracy failed
742305 bin laden won he tried against all odds to set in motion a religious war and he succeeded the us majority wants a religious war of good against evil
742306 irrationality rules here and as a result a very cynical republican party rules presidency senate house judiciary governorships and state legislatures
742307 they own america and are running it at a profit
742308 the unreported divide educated americans voted strongly for kerry the uneducated for bush
742309 kerry and the democrats did everything as right as could be
742310 nor worked harder individually to get out the huge vote
742311 bushs war in iraq went as badly as it possibly could yet he was not held accountable
742312 now i can only hope for your scenario to play out bush has to suffer the consequences of his own incompetence
742313 the turmoil will be good for the arts perhaps we may see a revival of the religious left
742314 economic wars can end ideological wars can end religious wars go on and on long term i can imagine a new enlightenment coming out of all this and i will work for that
742315 although i agree that its unlikely that the situation will reverse i think its an unseemly premature decision to call this bet closed

742329 so return on influence becomes as i see it a fluid concept on one side its how much you as a company a collection of individuals can influence your customers perception of your brand by sharing and listening on the flip side its how much you can get out of enabling and allowing your customers to influence you whether its an idea for a new product or service cf dells ideastorm or a new strategic direction
742330 our goal in supporting the x prize was to launch a new space industry through the introduction of commercial suborbital spaceflights we partnered with space adventures because they have proved that there is a market for space tourism by having been the first company to fly a private citizen to space and remain today the only company to have actually taken tourists to space
742331 over the next ten years we will make measurable global progress in all five areas of the human condition food access to clean water health education and the price of energy
742332 specifically i am betting that 10 years into the future the five indices of global human welfare given below will show improvement you may pick any metric from each of the five indices and you will win the bet if any of the five indicators shows a global negative trend over the 10 year life of the bet
742333 our research provides the strongest link to date between long term changes in lake warming in the tropics recorded by instruments and declining productivity of the lakes ecosystem as seen in sediment cores
742334 this work provides a clear indication of the regional effects of global climate change and especially global warming on tropical lake ecosystems
742335 to date most studies have found significant effects of climate change in the northern hemisphere
742336 while our study indicates that substantial warming is also occurring in the tropics and that it is having a negative impact on some ecosystems
742337 the same pattern we saw in bangladesh is being repeated
742338 there we began with the discovery of three villages now thousands are known to be affected and more are being discovered all the time our early warnings were ignored then now we are warning about bihar we feel that this is just the tip of the iceberg
742339 they are hot spots for the evolution of new species
742340 name the economic system that has a proven superiority over capitalism take your time this isnt really on topic here i doubt that future generations will want to look back on endless political arguments although i could be wrong maybe theyll be thought incredibly amusing
742341 for the first time in a hundred years life expectancy will actually go down
742342 what that told me is that no matter what i tried to do the plumes of chemicals that we are passing in and out of everyday give us exposure
742343 this will allow women to better make informed decision about their health
742344 and the information will help researchers and public health officials
742345 we are clearly concerned about what effects the stories of biomonitoring will have
742346 everyones exposed to substances and theres no evidence that the low levels people are exposed to are harming anybody
742347 junk science judo self defense against health scares and scams
742348 its a waste of time and money that only serves to scare people
742349 since we dont have a whole lot of control over most of the environment we can take charge with the food we eat
742350 there are few places where you can exercise such power than controlling what we digest
742351 the modern era of dramatic increases in life expectancy is about to come to an end in the developed world including the united states as well as in the underdeveloped world
742352 many people share the view that life expectancy will not increase much more and a few people think that life expectancy will decrease
742353 most demographers and other experts think it is likely that life expectancy will continue to tend to increase in most countries
742354 biology can play out quite differently in different countries at different times
742355 however majority positions in science sometimes turn out to be wrong and so minority positions should certainly be entertained
742356 there is a small chance less than one in 100 that olshanskys prediction of declining life expectancy might possibly prove correct
742357 if dr olshansky is correct he wont have to share the accolades with a large group of like minded contemporaries
742358 there is sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that human life expectancy will decline in the 21st century
742359 we have created a tinderbox for the re emergence of infectious diseases
742360 no one has a perfect crystal ball to tell what is going to happen in the 21st century
742361 the number of hungry people remains intolerably high progress in reaching them unconscionably slow and the costs in ruined lives and wasted resources incalculably large
742362 business as usual will carry a high price in terms of lost lives and lost human potential for africa
742363 hunger and related diseases still claim more lives than aids malaria and tuberculosis combined
742364 the number of chronically hungry people is on the rise again after decades of progress were losing ground
742365 the cost of inaction is clear and unacceptable it is vital that countries review and implement the health actions we know will reduce premature death from chronic diseases
742366 when you put money in the hands of farmers that money is spent on creating employment and reducing poverty elsewhere
742367 we have found in our research that for every dollar you invest in agricultural research you generate about 6 of additional income among the farmers and about 15 of additional economic growth in the society as a whole much of that will help poor people in those countries
742368 in the early 21st century prospects for human development are threatened by a deepening global water crisis
742369 beyond the household competition for water as a productive resource is intensifying symptoms of that competition include the collapse of water based ecological systems declining river flows and large scale groundwater depletion conflicts over water are intensifying within countries
742370 once population growth gains a certain speed it is hard to slow
742371 as a result of rapid population growth a generation ago china has a growing number of young married women of childbearing age
742372 in africa the diversion of attention from population and the stalled fertility decline has occurred just as population momentum was beginning to slow with extremely serious long term implications
742373 continued rapid population growth in todays poorest countries presents a serious barrier to meeting the millennium target of poverty reduction
742374 this is not the developed world telling the undeveloped countries what they ought to be doing none of the poorest 50 countries think that their populations are too small and 80 per cent think they are too high
742375 rapid pace of population growth means we are not even succeeding in keeping the numbers living in extreme poverty stable
742376 the number of school age children can double every 20 years an extra two million school teachers per year are required just to stand still
742377 the ability of women to control their own fertility is absolutely fundamental to womens empowerment and equality
742378 some progress but population growth has a negative impact on gaining control over spread of hiv aid through increased urbanisation
742379 evidence reveals at least two important causes of child mortality are directly linked to population growth high fertility and reduced access to safe drinking water
742380 high fertility strongly increases a womans lifetime risk of dying from pregnancy related causes
742381 reversing the loss of environmental resources cannot be achieved in the context of rapid or even moderate population growth without addressing the demographic factor
742382 as population grows the un estimates two thirds of the worlds population will face moderate to high water shortages by 2025
742383 we will have a significant gap if commodity prices remain this high and we will need an extra half billion dollars just to meet existing assessed needs
742384 there is food on shelves but people are priced out of the market there is vulnerability in urban areas we have not seen before there are food riots in countries where we have not seen them before
742385 for us the main concern is for the poorest countries and the net food buyers
742386 for the poorest populations 50 80 of income goes on food purchases we are concerned now about an immediate increase in malnutrition in these countries and the landless the farmworkers there all those who are living on the edge
742387 i estimate this is half the story the biofuels is another 30 then there are weather induced erratic changes which caused irritation in world food markets these things have eaten into world levels of grain storage
742388 the lower the reserves the more nervous the markets become and the increased volatility is particularly detrimental to the poor who have small assets
742389 the climate change factor is so far small but it is bound to get bigger
742390 that is the long term worry and the markets are trying to internalise it
742391 cutting the food rations or even the number or people reached
742392 our ability to reach people is going down just as the needs go up
742393 we are seeing a new face of hunger in which people are being priced out of the food market
742394 that shows the geographical distribution of leading web 2 0 companies no they are not all located in the valley but a majority of them are
742395 if you arent doing anything wrong you dont have anything to worry about
742396 the name of the exhibition plays off the names of the three artists and our subject bees boni for bonick and broom for broom
742397 man has had a relationship with bees since palaeolithic times
742398 ive made numerous images of bees and their hives fascinated by their beauty processes honeycombs and intricate society and how they seem uniquely intertwined with the lives of humans
742399 i cover all of my drawings with beeswax sealing binding protecting beautifying referring back to my own history
742400 bees and their societies can teach us so much about ourselves
742401 they remind us that were all entwined and bound by our human relationships as well as aspects of a greater natural universe
742402 im also fascinated by the way at the very deepest level all life is built around vibrations
742403 in the world of bees this is especially apparent the bees vibratory effect is vital within its own world through sound and motion but throughout our world as well we are seeing this plainly with the agricultural bee crisis we currently face
742404 its just a scam so they can steal your credit card number just save up and buy a psp if you want it so much

742406 how do i sell my executive team on doing this stuff dont just do it they dont know what youre doing anyway
742407 never be afraid to do something yourself remember amateur built the ark professionals built the titanic
742408 they believed that the structure of the universe could be worked out by sheer thought and so they decided there were five elements earth water air fire and ether and that the universe was constructed of spheres made of these elements any element moved away from its sphere tried to get back to its sphere thus stones earth fall smoke fire rises etc it all made sense it was all wrong
742409 sure we dont apply the waterfall everyone knows it doesnt work weve adopted this profound misunderstanding still superimposing waterfall inspired big up front analysis and planning predictable manufacturing values onto iterative methods is one of the most common mistakes that new iterative and agile method adopters make

742429 am ende bleibt die gewissheit dass portugal besser spielt als deutschland im vergleich zu den vorigen spielen gab es nur einen neuen umstand die mannschaft wusste was sie tun musste aber war nicht dazu imstande es zu tun die europameisterschaft ist aus technischer sicht rmer geworden sie beh lt eine muskul se mannschaft die weiterhin darauf hoffen wird dass die anderen fehler begehen um diese dann in eigenen ruhm umzuwandeln
742430 portugal wird vom schiedsrichter aus der euro gedr ngt portugal begann schlecht einige nervosit ten einige unsicherheiten und die wappen elf die ihren status als favorit nie best tigte schaffte es nicht einmal in den gegnerischen strafraum paulo ferreira hatte schwierigkeiten schweinsteiger zu folgen f r portugal bleibt fu ball ein spiel elf gegen elf und am ende gewinnt deutschland
742431 die deutsche effizienz macht portugal den garaus es l sst sich alles auf eine frage der effizienz oder zuverl ssigkeit zur ckf hren deutschland ist eine solche maschine sie versagt nie portugal versagt
742432 die tore von nuno gomes und h lder postiga machten uns glauben dass ein anderes resultat m glich w re aber die realit t ist dass im starken wettbewerb die fehler teuer zu stehen kommen und das spiel von gestern zeugt von dieser wahrheit cristiano ronaldo verabschiedete sich glanzlos von dieser pr fung beim ersten mal in dem er das gewicht des spielf hrers der wappen elf tragen musste
742433 portugal war auf der anzeigetafel immer im nachteil k mpfte bis zum ende war die mannschaft mit dem meisten ballbesitz den meisten torsch ssen aber war am ende opfer ihrer ineffizienz
742434 schwere verteidigungsfehler und ein fehlen an effizienz beim abschluss diktierten einen traurigen abschied f r scolari der auch die verantwortung daf r bernahm
742435 unwise behavior typical of overenthusiastic and blind advocacy of the youth see discussing uncomfortable questions
742436 one thing i have learned in a long life that all our science measured against reality is primitive and childlike and yet it is the most precious thing we have
742437 want me to adopt your solution lets clarify first which are the new problems it brings on
742438 better to define our task as a process of discovery and dialogue more than as an act of diagnosis and prescription

742446 that by 2020 a wearable device will be available that will use voice recognition capability and high volume storage to monitor and index conversations you have or conversations which occur in your vicinity for later searching as supplemental memory
742447 from the wording of the bet its not just recording conversations its saving them in a way that is meaningful to the machine that way the machine can search the conversations for particular text in the same way they can currently search text documents this does not exist
742448 the device would be incredibly useful and raise privacy issues but i dont think it will come about
742449 by the end of 2012 more than 50 of the root servers on the internet will be located outside the united states
742450 the bet by 2050 we will receive intelligent signals from outside our solar system
742451 by the year 2050 someone will have rolled snake eyes with an honest pair of dice 100 times in succession
742452 think out of the box before someone accidentally shuts the lid
742453 some might say we have already received i am not one of them various governments must be taking up the task of seti but how does one really know anything
742454 dr jill tarter long time director of seti has announced a reversal of decades of official policy she has now stated clearly that finding evidence of et activity in our solar system should not be considered unthinkable
742455 the formation shows an image of almost photographic quality accompanied with what might be follow up coded information to enhance the original seti message the circular pattern may also have a correlation with the dresde codex mayan calendar the crop circle itself is surrounded by radio masts and is over the hill from one of the worlds most magnificent cathedrals in winchester one has to marvel at the complexities in this new circle

742458 those mystical truths that are beyond the reach of human intervention
742459 in the long term the possibilities become wider and wider and if we want to plan for future generations our thinking has to become wider and wider
742460 the struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a mans heart
742461 can someone explain me in which way this bet is of
742462 hope and believe the sox can win at some point
742463 by the year 2040 ai will appear on computer viruses that will communicate with each other using a universal internet language and will be programmed to fuse together and mutate into computer organs that will later be controlled by powerful search engines systems diffused through out the internet
742464 there will be successful computer virii with ai by 2040
742465 what is being pointed out in this bet is not only the apparition of ai but also the organization of virii and how it will happen
742466 internet containing plain data as opposed to downloads of software is easily in principle made benign
742467 do you believe that in 30 40 years internet will look like it does today
742468 do you think bill gates and windows with all the little bugs will be still around
742469 do you think there will be one standard pc operating system or that there will be pcs at all
742470 are you suggesting that they would have a life of their own independent of the programmers

742476 new music cds compatible with current 2002 cd players will still be sold regularly in 2015
742477 at least five wal marts will have at least two of the top ten entries in the billboard 200 chart for july 2015 available for purchase in a cd format compatible with 2002 players
742478 you will be able to buy them at wal mart
742479 major online internet useage research firms will record that over 3 billion people in 2025 managed their incoming and outgoing digital information using a graphical user interface based on quadrant theory as described in marshall mcluhans
742480 microsoft will be have the largest market capitalization of any publicly traded company in the world by 2015
742481 its pretty obvious to me that msft will be the most powerful company in the world in the very near future
742482 msft web agents will prowl the net to make everyones life simpler
742483 msft applications will empower workers to do their jobs efficiently
742484 by 2025 at least 25 of the 30 stocks currently in the dow jones industrial average will be dropped from the index and replaced with other companies
742485 id be interested in knowing based on prior creative destruction rates how many of the dji wed expect to still be around in 2025 perhaps something like 1 2 to 2 3 and of those that disappeared id expect 1 2 to be mergers or fire sales not outright liquidations
742486 barring an unexpected decline in human numbers from current levels biodiversity will not reverse its downward trend air and water pollution will not reverse their increasing trends all according to world resources institute data and the who will not report a decrease in the percentage of humans with persistent illnesses
742487 unless earthly human population growth reverses biodiversity will not reverse its downward trend air and water pollution will not reverse their increasing trends and the who will not report a decrease in the percentage of humans with persistent illnesses
742488 by the year 2020 the tickets to space travel at the least to moon will be available over the counter
742489 fwiw my company now offers trips to the moons surface and return to earth to anyone who wants them i have a sketch of the vehicle available to anyone who asks for it ill send you a jpeg by email to reserve a lunar trip starting in fall 2007 merely desposit 60 million into an escrow account i have established for that purpose seats are assigned on a first come first served basis
742490 one would be able to go out and buy a ticket on a space cruise the way you buy air tickets to san francisco today
742491 tickets to the moon will be available over the counter
742492 thing is there is nothing on the moon that can be dug up and brought back to make a profit
742493 there is nothing on the moon that can be dug up and brought back to make a profit so sustainable travel to the moon just wont happen
742494 i am certainly a believer that cheap spaceflight will be here before 2020
742495 there is a cheap experimental smart 1 module by eu which is to be launched next year and which is going to examine moons south pole among other things where there is suspected frozen water and also a mountain which is 90 of the time on the sunny side and makes an ideal place for a colony
742496 extrapolating the progress of the last five decades im positive that the know how will be with us to enable any one willing to travel to the moon with minimum resources one would be able to go out and buy a ticket on a space cruise the way you buy air tickets to san francisco today
742497 russell e clarke said in part how long did it take for computers to go from something astronomically expensive that only governments and big corporations could afford to something that anyone with a bit of disposable income can buy over the counter
742498 its a film that is just rewriting the record books every day and redefining our notions of what a blockbuster can be
742499 the movie has grown in terms of its base audience from primarily what was conceived as a young male movie to a movie for everybody from 8 to 80
742500 theyre going to see it because of the reviews theyre going to see it because of the word of mouth theyre going just to see what its all about and they all like it
742501 it looked like we could do somewhere between 45 and 50 million but no one could have foreseen the juggernaut the dark knight has become
742502 i believe party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories
742503 i want the michigan delegation and the florida delegation to be seated and however the democratic national committee determines we can get that done im happy to abide by those rules
742504 as a candidate for the nomination i supported the dncs efforts to establish and enforce a schedule for primaries and caucuses that would broaden the opportunity for democrats from all regions of the country and all backgrounds and walks of life to have a meaningful voice
742505 as we prepare to come together in denver however we must be and will be united in our determination to change the course of our nation to that end democrats in florida and michigan must know that they are full partners and colleagues in our historic mission to reshape washington and lead our country in a new direction
742506 during the campaign i strongly advocated for the democratic party to seat the florida and michigan delegation with their full votes the democratic party has always stood up for the principle of counting every persons vote today sen obama has requested that the credentials committee give florida and michigan delegates their full votes this is the right position for the democratic party and for the country and i urge the credentials committee to restore full votes to florida and michigan delegates
742507 this matter will be the top priority for the credentials committee when we meet on august 24 as always our goal is to ensure a fair process and a unified democratic party so that we can win in november
742508 but it comes in a lull in the campaign june and july you know the primary is over it tends to get a little dull usually the negative ads havent appeared yet and so its sort of a perfect time to begin the guessing game
742509 if theres anything is some guys closet some local reporter who has covered this person for eight or 12 or 16 years might know about and might it get out before the candidate has committed to an embarrassing choice
742510 we dont even know if the candidates have really decided some of the names floated now are the candidates being nice to people who have no chance but floating their names helps them with their local constituents
742511 i cant comment on the process that were going through i apologize for being so obtuse
742512 when we start commenting you really get on a slippery slope and sometimes thats unfair to the people that are under consideration
742513 i think particularly someone like barack obama who is such a controlling politician and works so hard to make sure that everything is leak proof i imagine he probably has led us completely astray and might have a really explosive surprise in store because thats the way he wants to be
742514 there is an investigation taking place now to find how exactly it happened
742515 the incidents around nilin are there because we put this fence and we deployed the idf israel defense forces in the palestinian cities following a wave of terror after camp david failed that caused the loss of life of thousands of israelis
742516 and its only once we deployed this fence and the forces that we stopped seeing our people citizens indiscriminately exploding in their homes buses pizza shops or passover ceremonies
742517 by 2025 the scientific evidence of a hither to unknown large bi pedal great ape will be sufficient to convince at least 50 of primatologists that a yeti bigfoot like creature exists
742518 by 2020 a completely propellantless no material particles expelled for propulsion or
742519 proving that the us government isnt developing or trying to develop a reactionless drive or any other technology in a
742520 it should be theoretically possible to identify a the total amount of money going into the us government b sufficiently accurate estimates of what is going into all other black programmes hence showing c that there is insufficent left for major technology development programme
742521 of course that is exactly the sort of thing you are not supposed to be able to find out about black programmes so unless you happen to be a professional spy organisation youre pretty much right
742522 looks like theres a logical problem with step b the budgets for all black programs are by definition classified information so you never get to step c
742523 you d nm well shouldnt be able to know that
742524 downtown american cities in two hundred years will look pretty much as they do now
742525 the real question is whether our cities will still smell like urine in 200 years
742526 by 2020 bioterror or bioerror will lead to one million casualties in a single event
742527 1 effectiveness nuclear weapons remain the most destructive weapons known to man a bioweapon is never going to do all this
742528 could someone from long bets please confirm the rules on joint betting
742529 i would like to add my arguments for why it wont happen 2 terror i believe that the general public is more afraid of nuclear than biological weapons this is largely based on popular culture nuclear terrorism figures far more prominently than bio terror in films for examps this means that a terrorist will provoke more fear with a nuclear threat than a bio threat similarly nuclear weapons have more deterrent value in government arsenals
742530 3 safety to users with a nuclear weapon premature detonation is extremely unlikely the likely dose from a far more likely leak is small and therfore a manageable risk with a high end biological weapon a leak will kill everyone in the area
742531 4 cost and feaability nuclear weapons are a mature technology and most of the necessary knowledge has leaked into the public domain
742532 there is also a thriving black market in uranium bioweapons are still an area where substantial research is needed to build a working weapon on top of this there is not much biological material available for a terrorist without their own lab
742533 5 treaty systems biological weapons are banned by international treaty
742534 everyone not just the us would ostracise a country that built them
742535 would a nanotechologically created artificial pathogen built with intelligence be considered bioterror
742536 fortunately sars is less deadly than measles but what about the next virus or the one after that
742537 it aint whatcha dont know that kills ya its whatcha do know that aint so
742538 as mr smart explains the fact that sars spread so well and the fact that it is not that lethal are related look how quickly a notsolethal sic disease lost its effect when people were informed about it if the disease was any more lethal there would be a larger response and less spread i think sars is a very clear example of what mr smart talks about in terms of global communication being preventative to disease
742539 on a somewhat unrelated note i think youre really stretching the definition of
742540 i believe that the general public is more afraid of nuclear than biological weapons
742541 with a nuclear weapon premature detonation is extremely unlikely the likely dose from a far more likely leak is small and therfore a manageable risk
742542 with a high end biological weapon a leak will kill everyone in the area
742543 nuclear weapons are a mature technology and most of the necessary knowledge has leaked into the public domain and would certainly be accessible to an enterprising terrorist
742544 bioweapons are still an area where substantial research is needed to build a working weapon
742545 on top of this there is not much biological material available for a terrorist without their own lab
742546 biological weapons are banned by international treaty everyone not just the us would ostracise a country that built the nuclear weapons are not notice that india and pakistan were able to publicly admit to having them without becoming rogue states
742547 i think the most likely next major but probably not bet winning event is likely to be by an american who works in an u s lab
742548 prior to 9 11 the most serious terrorist attack on the us itself was a biological attack the salmonella poisonings in the northwest in the 80s by the followers of bhagwan shree rajneesh
742549 as of march 7th 2005 osama bin laden is dead
742550 i have believed for more than a year that osama bin laden is dead and yesterdays pathetic home movie from al jazeera via al qaeda or do i mean the other way around has reinforced this conviction it would be easy enough for his fellow gangsters to prove me wrong all they need to do next time they point a video at their heroic guru is to put in his hands a recent edition of an arabic or pakistani or afghan newspaper the date neednt be visible the headline would do or if they dont have any cameramen who can also read they could induce the great one to say a few words about recent developments in say iraq until two years ago you could hardly shut osama bin laden up he had a great fondness for the sermon the proclamation the taped fatwah and all of these like the captured video from kabul showing his gloating over the world trade center were extremely easy to authenticate indeed they were too genuine for my taste how likely is it that such a loquacious character would manage to sit out the whole iraq war without feeling any need to orate
742551 one hundred years from now the worlds governments will formally and legally recognize the basic human right of mobility a person may live anywhere on earth if they agree to obey local laws
742552 the annual average cost between 2003 and dec 31 2005 of the total retail price commercial and residential per kilowatthour of electricity in the united states will rise as calculated by the u s departmentof energy in chained inflation adjusted u s dollars
742553 average electricity prices are projected to decline from 7 3 cents per kilowatthour in 2001 to a low of 6 3 cents 2001 dollars by 2007 as a result of cost reductions in an increasingly competitive market where excess generating capacity has resulted from the recent boom in construction and the continued decline in coal prices electricity industry restructuring contributes to declining projected prices through reductions in operating and maintenance costs administrative costs and other miscellaneous costs
742554 the annual average cost between 2003 and dec 31 2005 of the total retail price commercial and residential per kilowatthour of electricity in the united will rise as calculated by the u s departmentof energy in chained inflation adjusted u s dollars
742555 makes me wonder why bnfl is losing money hand over fist then
742556 by the year 2020 solar electricity will be as cheap or cheaper than that produced by fossil fuels
742557 while fossil fuels are privilidged with huge natural underground storage solar energy needs expensive bateries to be built
742558 isnt more energy used during the day than during the night if so then until solar energy generation makes up more than this difference storage will not be a significant concern
742559 what makes you think the sun can be a viable energy source it has not been proven with anything on a grand scale
742560 mid ocean hydrothermal vent life is non solar so is nuclear power short list
742561 power extracted from action of sunlight directly on some artificial apparatus
742562 payback period for household installation of solar power panels tiles is currently what well over 50 years
742563 i would think the potential output from one dyson sphere would provide for the needs of even the most proflicate single inhabited world
742564 sti just announce the other day that they had a cheap easily produced new photoelectric technology that was robust and would cost one twentieth what current photoelectrics cost
742565 china will be considered a christian nation with at least 33 of its residents identifying themselves as christians by the year 2085
742566 all religions are fingers on one hand but buddhism is the palm
742567 china has a better chance of becoming an islamic state by 2085 because islam is spreading faster than christianity also northern and western part of china are almost islamic influenced from central asia and this influence can easily spread to the south and east slowly but gradually unless the communist government puts a clamp but if the communist government intervenes im sure it will also intervene from christainity taking hold there also
742568 by 2030 commercial passengers will routinely fly in pilotless planes
742569 commercial air carriage will be pilotless in the u s by 2030
742570 by 2050 at least two pan regional currencies modeled on the euro will be used in the world
742571 it took two world wars before the european union was set up and its taken so long after then for even just a few of the eu nations to embrace the euro
742572 there could be a secondary bet that stipulates that by 2150 there will be one currency per continent
742573 there will be the same or less currencies than there are continents
742574 english people arent worried that they will lose their englishness if they adopt the euro
742575 at least two countries of significant importance and with no history of recent separation
742576 im not particularly enthusiastic about the euro but the anti euro side has some particularly unsavoury bed fellows im not worried about the keep the pound because its english mob but theres a graduation something like
742577 id bet two pan regional currencies will be located in central america and in a region around south of africa and by 2030
742578 moores law which has defined a doubling of price performance value produced by semi conductors every 12 to 18 months since 1966 will continue to deliver its exponential benefits for at least another five decades without stopping or slowing
742579 id disagree with the post that says there is no use for more speed in computing quantity has a quality all its own and new things become possible or practical
742580 a computer thats a billion times faster than anything that exists today destroying the need to build anything faster for decades if we made such a jump but didnt improve upon it for 50 years would that satisfy the conditions of the bet
742581 is your sim universe sluggish need to fine tune your back up personality matrix but youre just a googleplex short of memory you need new improved ultimate quantum computer plus
742582 will continue to deliver its exponential benefits for at least another five decades without stopping or slowing
742583 i think moores law that the cost of computing power falls steadily over time is irrelevant i dont think its applicable anymore whats applicable is metcalfs law which says the utility of a device increases exponentially with the number of other devices connected to it
742584 moores law has been an important benchmark for developments in microelectronics and information processing for over three decades during this time its applications and interpretations have proliferated and expanded often far beyond the validity of the original assumptions made by moore technical considerations of optimal chip manufacturing costs have been expanded to processor performance economics of computing and social development it is therefore useful to review the various interpretations of moores law and empirical evidence that could support them such an analysis reveals that semiconductor technology has evolved during the last four decades under very special economic conditions in particular the rapid development of microelectronics implies that economic and social demand has played a limited role in this industry contrary to popular claims it appears that the common versions of moores law have not been valid during the last decades as semiconductors are becoming important in economy and society moores law is now becoming an increasingly misleading predictor of future developments
742585 here is the source code to another world make it work in windows
742586 by the year 2150 over 50 of schools in the usa or western europe will require classes in defending against robot attacks
742587 since robots are deterred only weakly by instinctive fear or the threat of shame fines imprisonment exile or execution their attacks should be far more frequent than their organic counterparts ursine and homonid
742588 bring your troops up on the east lieutenant b bring yours forward to the tree line sergeant c take the d d hill however you see fit
742589 of course a human would have to be a motivator of some sort set it in motion its not like a robot is ever going to make itself start a jihad and bloistering everything in its path
742590 guns dont kill people robots kill people so go out and finish your gun safety workshops before we get to lesson two
742591 sneak around the back and press the button labeled off
742592 i live in the united states home of the colt revolver the m 16 et al and through twelve years of public education not a word was mentioned about how to protect myself against gun violence
742593 the very notion of ro bots wandering about on two legs weilding ray guns is a laughable relic of early 20th century misunderstanding of machine computer artificial intelligence what m
742594 a computer with peripherals sensors and programming which enable it to perform tasks without constant human supervision
742595 the first discovery of extraterrestrial life will be someplace other than on a planet or on a satellite of a planet
742596 if we point our telescopes directly away from the sun we might see life as bright reflecting points
742597 the first discovery of extraterrestrial life will be someplace other than on a planet or on a satellite of a planet
742598 all i did was sleep at a holiday inn last night and take the tour at canaveral
742599 i hope you all find what you are looking for
742600 freeman dysons general view is that extraterrestrial life is likely to more pervasive and far stranger than current search ideas acknowledge
742601 would the receiving of electromagnetic signals inadvertantly emitted be a proof of extraterrestrial life simply these signals have much more speed that any spaceship we can imagine
742602 by 2070 at least six countries will have officially implemented a 4 day working week
742603 the main way that the 5 day working week has been
742604 incidentally on this basis i would call the bet no because social pressures are moving towards a service being available 24 7 with different people taking their rest days on different days of the week
742605 nobody not even the government would shut up shop on friday
742606 instead different people would take different days off and most services would be open 5 or 7 days
742607 within 100 years the citizens and companies of a large and prosperous country in excess of 100 million people will no longer pay taxes of any kind
742608 the governments will create the money they need out of thin air based on a careful monitoring and controls of the money flow the objective will be to do no economic harm we can all agree that if the u s government today printed exactly one extra dollar bill to use for itself this virgin birth of spending money for the government would have absolutely no economic impact
742609 as japan among other nations has shown the government can be a very effective silent partner in industry
742610 by 2012 scientists will not have developed an explanation for how images on the shroud of turin came to be on the cloth an explanation that satisfies all of the physical and chemical properties of the images and does not violate basic laws of physics
742611 all of the physical and chemical properties of the images
742612 beams influences emanating from human body that the source of influence having produced the image on the fabric was in fact pulsatile
742613 i do not think that golikov cited by you has developed any complete hypothesis
742614 with what we are learning we are going to have to rewrite the laws of physics
742615 just when i have all the answers they change the questions
742616 establish that there is in fact a visible image on the cloth
742617 with what we are learning we are going to have to rewrite the laws of physics
742618 set the criteria and challenge the scientists to invalidate it with counter evidence exclusive of theoretical laws of physics the start of the criteria could be a simple as establish that there is in fact a visible image on the cloth
742619 in all my life i have met only one person who claims to have seen a ghost and the interesting thing about the story is that that person disbelieved in the immortal soul before she saw the ghost and still disbelieves after seeing it she says that what she saw must have been an illusion or a trick of the nerves and obviously she may be right seeing is not believing
742620 if anything extraordinary seems to have happened we can always say that we have been the victims of an illusion if we hold a philosophy which excludes the supernatural this is what we always shall say
742621 but the dimensionally encoded image seems more than an illusion and it is very extraordinary it is there no other known image of a human form exists that is a dimensionally encoded dataset there is no trickery this 3d quality can be proven
742622 jackson placed an image of the shroud of turin onto the light table of the system
742623 i had never heard of the shroud of turin before that moment i had no idea what i was looking at however the results were unlike anything i have processed through the vp 8 analyzer before or since only the shroud of turin has produced these results from a vp 8 image analyzer isometric projection study
742624 symmetrical with uniform lighting of the features hence produce a symmetrical undistorted image after processing
742625 aside from die hard religious fanatics does anyone dispute this
742626 by 2012 scientists will develop an explanation for how images on the shroud of turin came to be on the cloth an explanation that satisfies all of the physical and chemical properties of the images
742627 aside from die hard religious fanatics does anyone dispute this
742628 i wonder whether it was done from a crucified dead body or from a crucified living body that is the rather horrible question once you accept it as a forgery
742629 no known painting or other work of art nor a photograph of the human form will produce such results
742630 short of an answer for as long as it may be that there is no answer people will be able to speculate about the possibility of a miracle a miracle being the plausible alternative to a naturalistic or artistic method
742631 by 2100 racism will no longer be a significant phenomenon in most countries of the world
742632 they have already done it all that others need to do is follow their example
742633 during the decade ending december 31 02100 no more than five cases total involving racial discrimination will be brought before the highest courts of the governments of the twenty most populous countries
742634 does race skin colour really make no significant difference in this society
742635 lets take the example of the u s and assume that over night it becomes perfectly free of prejudice based on racial background appearances it however remains as capitalist and flawed in other ways as it presently is
742636 all lack of prejudice can achieve is the removal of some barriers and so allowing a gradual improvement
742637 during the decade ending december 31 02100 no more than five cases total involving racial discrimination will be brought before the lowest courts of the governments of the twenty most populous countries and none of these countries will define race by statute
742638 all lack of prejudice can achieve is the removal of some barriers and so allowing a gradual improvement it wont of itself actively encourage a fair distribution of wealth
742639 all lack of prejudice can achieve is the removal of some barriers and so allowing a gradual improvement it wont of itself actively encourage a fair distribution of wealth
742640 im not trying to be difficult here but i would also hate to have to decide whether the bet had been won or lost
742641 b racism i think a useful definition of racism is that it is a form of oppression characterized by the systematic mistreatment of members of a particular group of people based on their racial characteristics
742642 c most most to me at least means only a few are not included perhaps i should have written almost all for which most is often substituted
742643 by 2010 more than 50 percent of books sold worldwide will be printed on demand at the point of sale in the form of library quality paperbacks
742644 im confident that print on demand is the future of the book business used at the point of sale new pod technology like a prototype developed by march technologies will have fully integrated components and a cost of about 100 000 per unit
742645 nothing is as inexpensive easy to carry around and indestructible as a physical book and readers dont want to have texts augmented with sound and pictures and all sorts of the other things youre supposed to imagine all that when you read thats what the writers there for plus habits dont change that quickly if youre in business you have to approach the market as it is rather than as it might be or should be or will be someday
742646 do you want to listen to this similar group while you wait
742647 ill have to agree with carl here it is unlikely that technophobes will relinquish the paperback regardless of other adequate solutions
742648 new pod technology like a prototype developed by march technologies will have fully integrated components and a cost of about 100 000 per unit
742649 i love to read books not necessarily collect them why not make it easier cheaper more environmentally friendly
742650 i love to read books not necessarily collect them why gt gt not make it easier cheaper more environmentally gt gt friendly
742651 if so we may well see serious inroads made against paper communication theres something nice and tangible about owning a cd but look at all the folks whove flocked to mp3 players
742652 meanwhile paper costs continue to rise profit margins continue to shrink and competition is fiercer than ever if there was ever an industry ready for a paradigm shift its book publishing
742653 moreover pod books present almost no difference to the consumer
742654 the advantages of pod go far beyond cost considerations and i dont think cost will be what will make it catch on
742655 of course a computer which develops human level intelligence may notice these problems and deftly correct them by playing down to its competition
742656 is the output of the human mind a computable output
742657 are we able to understand our own mind well enough to duplicate it
742658 have we created a copy of our own mind so close to reality that we cannot make any practical distinctions
742659 this person must have a complete understanding of all types of humans and human intelligence
742660 the implicit assumption made by the turing test is that there is a sharp distinction between what a human is and what a machine is
742661 this distinction is pretty clear today but developments in genetic engineering and nano tech are going to blur the line
742662 but also the emotions brought on by the different seasons it would also require a sense of aesthetics capable of recognizing whether a line of poetry flowed well
742663 to develop a human like mind in a machine or even one that could pass for a human like mind would require a machine that was raised with human like experiences
742664 in comparison to a typical internet chat room turners exchange had both parties being more than human as ive mentioned before a lot depends on the specifics of test implementation
742665 suppose some conspirators try to convince the ai that human babies come from storks for example
742666 interesting but i cant believe that is state of the art
742667 since a l i c e is apparently the most convincing program to come out of this competition i think it stands as a good indication of where the technology lies today
742668 i think it may more be an indication of the contempt with which that competition in particular and the turing test in general is held by the pure ai community
742669 we are conscious beings capable of reflection and self awareness
742670 but does ray really appreciate the extraordinary depth of human intellect and emotion
742671 the loebner prize contest is unrestricted and has been since 1995
742672 do you think anthony hopkins was a good pick to play titus andronicus
742673 i fear that participants will now focus less on programs capable of maintaining an intelligent conversation and more on programs that are gifted in the art of changing the subject or producing inane banter
742674 it was an in depth intelligent and illuminating conversation obviously a machine
742675 every single one of its jokes were new to me and made me laugh obviously not a human
742676 but dont forget that this conversation would not be possible without intelligent humans directly responding to and critiquing each others comments
742677 the situation for judge turing candidate is more like two people who happen to be going to the same place and end up stuck in the same taxi in such a case you could expect fair amounts of awkward silence and fumbling towards subjects of common interest
742678 opinion on the war on terrorism a favorite musician a precious memory of his or her childhood
742679 i remember being really bored at the first day of school
742680 in this scenario i think its important to note that the interviewer is not the one with the responsibility to prove their humanity
742681 hey that guy doesnt even know me how can he possibly conclude that im an idiot
742682 he was a good neighbor kind of a loner i cant believe he did those things
742683 since thats my profession i wrote a book about it
742684 so how could there be deep implications to the occurrence of a particular human not being able to tell that a machine isnt human in the context of a particular test
742685 a machine will be able to pass the turing test but not by truly replicating human intelligence but by a sophisticate and thorough analysis of im correspondence
742686 i do not think that the amount of information to be stored is
742687 computer works based on its ability of logical calculations however our human being have other more important abilities in addition to our logical reasoning abilities
742688 we make judgement not just based on the facts or data but also on how we feel about it that feeling portion and the intuition portion does not come from logical
742689 our conscious can tap into the universal information field or god to absorb directly about unlimited information a mechanically built computer with no spirit is hard to achieve the human intelligence at this level
742690 by 2029 a computer will have passed the turing test
742691 in 2022 the us economy will no longer be held to be the world leader in global environmental degradation
742692 held to be the world leader in global environmental degradation
742693 china accounts for about 13 of world carbon emissions ranking second behind the united states per capita emissions however are significantly lower than in the united states 0 7 metric tons person compared with 5 42 metric tons person in the united states chinas rapidly growing carbon emissions are expected to account for 19 of the world total by 2015
742694 ah i cant wait to see the julian simon advocates empty the pockets of the doom and gloomers again
742695 what effect has america on extinction rates of species elsewhere
742696 2 can the environment be degraded isnt the concept of degredation a value judgement
742697 5 while us may be the worst polluters either in total and or per capita or per gnp interesting metric
742698 will america still provide the worst value degradation in 2022
742699 the biggest lion in pack will always lead them but he will take the biggest shits get into the nastiest fights he will always be the one to find the zebras
742700 be held to be the world leader in global environmental degradation
742701 by 2100 a world government will be in place and in control of business law environmental law and weapons of mass destruction
742702 business interests are very powerful and are frustrated in many areas by different governmental regulations and law
742703 world police will come and arrest the relevant members of the country in question the alternative is what going to war over water rights
742704 the united states must threaten to wage war on any state which seeks to produce such weapons this is exactly what we are talking about doing vs iraq after we do this two or three times the alternative putting them in the hands of the u n will seem a lot better
742705 and in any case it seems to me that its the nature of language to differentiate in any case into local varieties to meet local needs so that even if everybody decided to speak urdu tomorrow within 100 200 years the common tongue would break up into shards the same way that the vulgar latin of the roman empire fragmented into the various romance languages modern communications notwithstanding
742706 and when in history has a powerful nation dealt with potential enemies by aiding their economy
742707 now the whole earth had one language and few words
742708 come let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens and let us make a name for ourselves lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth
742709 behold they are one people and they have all one language and this is only the beginning of what they will do and nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them come let us go down and there confuse their language that they may not understand one anothers speech
742710 certain things dont mix religion language habits beliefs mixing people with these beliefs cause discussion 1 and later war
742711 may the same fate that struck down the league of nations soon befall the united nations
742712 so far north korea is the only nation interested in selling nuclear technology which is not now bound by the nnpt
742713 by 2020 no one will have won a nobel prize for work on superstring theory membrane theory or some other unified theory describing all the forces of nature
742714 its the planck scale theories which lie beyond any reasonable hope of verification that are the focus of my doubts
742715 the elegant universe superstrings hidden dimensions and the quest for the ultimate theory
742716 no one on the planet is smart enough to solve the theory
742717 gosh electromagnetism the weak and strong nuclear forces are all quantized so gravity must be quantized too
742718 moreover although im certainly not an expert i was also under the impression that a lot of experts are currently playing with the notion that spatial dimensions are themselves quantized that is discontinuous on a very small scale planck length if so it seems inescapable at least to me that gravity is also quantized in some fashion or another
742719 there are nagging hints that most of what lies ahead involves filling in the blanks of todays big scientific concepts not uncovering totally new ones
742720 science will never again yield revelations as monumental as evolution or quantum mechanics
742721 rod s room a new earth and a new universe
742722 rod s room a new earth and a new universe
742723 the dark ages of the universe is the 200 million year period more or less after the last flash of light from the big bang faded and the first blush of sun like stars began to appear what happened during the dark ages set the stage for the cosmos we see today with its billions of magnificent galaxies and everything that they contain
742724 physicists predict that the singularity at the heart of a black hole has zero volume
742725 rod s room a new earth and a new universe
742726 well its not the end of the universe but you can see it from there
742727 human consciousness shapes not only the present but the past as well
742728 there will be complete consensus in the scientific community that the universe will stop expanding
742729 the universe will continue to expand for at least 10 x years
742730 well to be more precise we cant really be sure of this and there may be exceptions to that

742741 technet webcast prepare yourself for windows server 2008 part 7 of 8 windows powershell and manageability improvements
742742 the last line of defense in support of freedom and the constitution consists of the people themselves if the people want to be free if they want to lift themselves out from underneath a state apparatus that threatens their liberties squanders their resources on needless wars destroys the value of their dollar and spews forth endless propaganda about how indispensable it is and how lost we would all be without it there is no force that can stop them

742754 my time with dylan is up and we stand in preparation for my leaving the room as a last aside i ask for his take on the us political situation in the run up to novembers presidential election
742755 well you know right now america is in a state of upheaval
742756 poverty is demoralising you cant expect people to have the virtue of purity when they are poor but weve got this guy out there now who is redefining the nature of politics from the ground up barack obama hes redefining what a politician is so well have to see how things play out am i hopeful yes im hopeful that things might change some things are going to have to
742757 you should always take the best from the past leave the worst back there and go forward into the future

742763 it is hard to find strong voices willing to step out and call out fox for what it is fake news that is harmful to public discourse and to black america
742764 nas is doing what few are willing to do its risky for any musician entertainer or other artist to take on a corporate entity because ultimately it can cost them dollars or opportunities nas obviously sees the value in speaking the truth and using the stage he has to do it its a model for others to follow
742765 it is truly unfortunate that the individuals who have been hurt most by the gses are the low income individuals that they were chartered to assist

742775 dont cut their throats and leave them dead in the streets
742776 the key question is do you have the right to force your kids to pursue that goal
742777 what is the optimal role for business to play in reducing these impediments
742778 capitalism can be the solution but only when practiced ethically
742779 when i learn something new and it happens every day i feel a little more at home in this universe a little more comfortable in the nest
742780 there are millions soon to be billions of consumers voters and other actors most obviously
742781 at the same time the corporate form is changing very fast
742782 finally though less obviously there is a palpable thirst among people around the world for leadership that is not for sale for individuals and organizations that are not solely defined by the transactional rhythms and white hot speed of the marketplace
742783 all of these forces are gaining strength now and helping lay the pavement along which global capitalism will travel
742784 the incentives for corporations to eschew social gains in the interests of social gains are limited
742785 this doesnt mean that the probability of firm survival is maximized by maximizing profits
742786 there is a reason you probably couldnt name one company seeking investment that advertises
742787 betting that you can spot opportunities that others cant is a risky business some people have a reasonablly sic good track record at it in some sectors
742788 the companys potential reputation must be worth more than the expense of doing the right thing

742793 the appropriate normative goal for a board of directors is to build and protect wealth creating potential of the entire corporate team
742794 i hope corporations will consider dedicating a percentage of your top innovators time to issues that could help people left out of the global economy
742795 the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits
742796 inherent in the multiple objectives urged for creative capitalists is a loss of accountability with respect to performance
742797 it is not from the benevolence of the butcher the brewer or the baker that we expect our dinner but from their regard to their own interest
742798 creating a world without poverty social business and the future of capitalism
742799 it is not from the benevolence of the butcher the brewer or the baker that we expect our dinner but from their regard to their own self interest we address ourselves not to their humanity but to their self love and never talk to them of our own neccessities but of their advantages
742800 creating a world without poverty social business and the future of capitalism
742801 too bad there were no economists to advise them on this experiment
742802 is globalization good or bad for the poor or the rich
742803 the solution to poverty rests with the poor if you organize them mobilize them motivate them they can solve their own problems
742804 we have to learn to learn from the poor they have more common sense than we think they do
742805 there is a lot of reason for humility for a professor its difficult to put intellect last just above luck
742806 thus how does modern finance account for huge risky opportunities that may take many years to harvest if they happen at all
742807 all men who detain a lot of power may abuse it
742808 arguing that increasing taxation of the wealthy would not destroy incentives and thereby be inefficient
742809 that such high after tax incomes are necessary in order to elicit the talents of those like alison
742810 their main strategy has been to influence public opinion through reader friendly books articles websites and media interviews
742811 educate the public about the importance of government and redistribution of income
742812 in this short article i will not attempt to justify my view that the highly unequal distribution of wealth and income in american capitalism constitutes an injustice many have argued that elsewhere rather i would like to argue that increasing taxation of the wealthy would not destroy incentives and thereby be inefficient
742813 if archer daniel midland wants to get creative id like to see them abolish their lobbying arm and let the sugar quota expire

742815 the challenges and uncertainties associated with operating in developing and high growth markets such as china russia and india which may entail a relatively higher risk of political instability economic volatility crime corruption and social and ethnic unrest all of which are exacerbated in many cases by a lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainties in how local law is applied and enforced including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment
742816 the managers of corporations have a fiduciary duty to maximize corporate profits
742817 i know that half of my advertising budget is a waste of money i just dont know which half
742818 i share adam smiths scepticism about the benefits that can be expected from
742819 are seeking to attain by undemocratic procedures what they cannot attain by democratic procedures
742820 corporations and capitalism do not exist in a vacuum they thrive where the right rules of the game are in place
742821 if they have a difference with me on policy they should debate me not her
742822 why dont you and your boyfriend move to denmark or some other socialist country
742823 hey girlyboy do you have any idea how pitiful you look to normal folks when you open your sissy moth beging the government to help
742824 look were nice people we dont have time to be getting hookers
742825 corporate social responsibility is a response in substantial part to a widely held misconception about the profit motive
742826 okay children if you want to be creative one of you has to pay for it
742827 what bugs me about landsburgs post is that he is making the assumption there will be a cost involved and that is not a valid assumption
742828 at the textbook firm all revenue goes to workers and investors at the cc firm some revenue goes to something else where does that revenue come from the laws of arithmetic admit only four possibilities a it comes from the workers b it comes from the investors c it comes from the consumers d it comes from nobody because the cc firm can use labor and capital more efficiently than the textbook firm
742829 first the poor do not envy or resent the rich because they believe in the myth in the u s the american dream that they too can get rich
742830 my children can move up a notch from where i have been
742831 the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits
742832 in a free enterprise private property sys tem a corporate executive is an employee of the owners of the business he has direct re sponsibility to his employers that responsi bility is to conduct the business in accordance with their desires which generally will be to make as much money as possible while con forming to the basic rules of the society both those embodied in law and those embodied in ethical custom of course in some cases his employers may have a different objective a group of persons might establish a corporation for an eleemosynary purpose for exam ple a hospital or a school the manager of such a corporation will not have money profit as his objective but the rendering of certain services in either case the key point is that in his capacity as a corporate executive the manager is the agent of the individuals who own the corporation or establish the eleemosynary institution and his primary responsibility is to them
742833 it is hard in this world to do well it is hard to do good when i hear a claim that an institution is going to do both i reach for my wallet you should too
742834 where does this responsibility come from why isnt it best if corporations concentrate on maximizing profits allowing capitalism to perform its alchemy of turning profit maximizations into social good and allowing government and voluntary private charities to fill in the gaps
742835 corporate executives are not authorized by anyone least of all by their customers or investors to balance profits against the public good
742836 each corporation has a stake in the health and welfare of the society in which it operates its directors cannot afford to ignore that social environment
742837 would amount to a huge opportunity cost in lost profits for every year that the next billion and the bottom billion stay poor
742838 our outer world is a reflection of our inner world take care of your inner world and plant the seeds of goodness amp love all other things will fall into place
742839 as we understand that the outer world is merely a reflection of our inner world we realize that people and events do not happen to us they happen for us we drew them to us for our higher good for our understanding for the evolution of our consciousness
742840 nobody can go back and start a new beginning but anyone can start today and make a new ending
742841 the doors we open and close each day decide the lives we live
742842 what you leave behind is not what is engraved in monuments but what is woven into the lives of others
742843 carpe diem rejoice while you are alive enjoy the day live life to the fullest make the most of what you have it is later than you think
742844 this life is yours take the power to choose what you want to do and do it well take the power to love what you want in life and love it honestly take the power to walk in the forest and be a part of nature take the power to control your own life no one else can do it for you take the power to make your life happy
742845 i think of life itself now as a wonderful play that ive written for myself and so my purpose is to have the utmost fun playing my part
742846 uncertainty is the only certainty there is and knowing how to live with insecurity is the only security
742847 just follow the money trail then youll know both why and what has and will happen
742848 a mother with child ren who has an absent father
742849 whatever relationships you have attracted in your life at this moment are precisely the ones you need in your life at this moment there is a hidden meaning behind all events and this hidden meaning is serving your own evolution
742850 your joy is divine and so is your suffering theres so much to be learned from both
742851 i may not have gone where i intended to go but i think i have ended up where i intended to be
742852 life has to be lived forwards but it only makes sense backwards
742853 your sorrow accomplished nothing for your son be prepared for you will suffer many other deaths in your time and some day your own
742854 when a person thinks about the things people and experiences that theyre grateful for their awareness of the good in their life increases and they start to feel good what you focus on increases so the more you feel good about all there is to be grateful for the more will show up
742855 develop an attitude of gratitude and give thanks for everything that happens to you knowing that every step forward is a step toward achieving something bigger and better than your current situation
742856 count your blessings once you realize how valuable you are and how much you have going for you the smiles will return the sun will break out the music will play
742857 when it comes to the future there are three kinds of people those who let it happen those who make it happen and those who wonder what happened
742858 as for the future your task is not to foresee it but to enable it
742859 the secret to living the life of your dreams is to start living it at once to any degree that you possibly can
742860 a new generation of professionals well educated well trained and just the right amount of pissed off have taken up the mantle through advocacy to dissemble corrupt government at its core along with assuming the responsibility to educate train and mentor individuals to claim assert their unalienable rights whether in family courts in states courts in federal courts in states legislatures in federal legislature or most importantly at the ballot box
742861 set your sights high the higher the better expect the most wonderful things to happen not in the future but right now realize that nothing is too good allow absolutely nothing to hamper you or hold you up in any way
742862 high achievement always takes place in the framework of high expectation
742863 nobody succeeds beyond his or her wildest expectations unless he or she begins with some wild expectations
742864 hey their dogs name is brian and my sons name is brian watch my show
742865 37signals backpack journal is a great illustration of the twitter principle as applied to business
742866 the easiest and prettiest way to participate in that collaboration
742867 after i signed up the welcome event told me exactly what to do next
742868 why how favre got his way didnt he hell win his job back
742869 we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction
742870 thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
742871 when you hit times like this and reflect back you realize the nfl is bigger than everybody this situation is bigger than everybody its about the national football league then its about the green bay packers and finally its about the individuals i think thats very important and when that gets out of balance problems occur
742872 have not received any tickets despite numerous phone calls and e mails
742873 today on msnbc tvs morning joe i chose my words poorly in describing the relationship between clint eastwood and spike lee i take my responsibilities as a journalist seriously and know that words can have a strong impact i sincerely apologize to spike lee and to the viewers for my comments
742874 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
742875 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
742876 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
742877 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
742878 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
742879 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
742880 you cannot persuade me there are not more disturbed or disgruntled persons with a political agenda in such a large group
742881 one of the complaints by people who work in safety and security is they cant get the time of day from people running the labs
742882 are viewed as deeply offensive by a lot of scientists as if their patriotism is being questioned
742883 for us its all about making sports easier to understand
742884 but the best technical innovations are the ones that take the viewer on a magic carpet ride they transport the television viewer out of their easy chair at home and give them a sense of what its like to be on the field of play
742885 i remember as a kid watching and saying wow how do they do that the olympics were always the showcases for all of the newest technology roone set the gold standard
742886 we were trying to figure out how you can capture the madness of someone getting on a 10 meter platform and actually thinking that its a good idea to dive off that thing three stories up and go into the water
742887 garretts sort of like the doc brown character in the back to the future movies
742888 you see these unusual botticelli like images of the swimmers
742889 these systems allow the viewer to see sights that have not been seen before that are just ravishing
742890 its like youre in your own little airplane flying along with these guys giving you a sense of their power and speed
742891 instead of describing the course verbally well use this mapping technology something which today is instantly recognizable by consumers to give a clear picture
742892 with lead athletes the difference between clearing the bar and just brushing it can be a question of millimeters having that lipstick camera there can mean the difference between getting a medal and maybe not
742893 our mantra here is storytelling we not only want to demystify a sport for the american audience but we want to engage our audience in these sports
742894 we can use the technology to make the sport easily understood if were really at the top of our craft well engage viewers and get them to care about the athletes
742895 the band rush is here either that or a drum factory exploded in my studio
742896 in all these races if i didnt campaign at all and this had just been a referendum on name recognition sen
742897 its pretty hard to make an argument that somehow you winning what is essentially a name recognition contest in florida was a good measure of electoral strength there
742898 party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories obama wrote in a letter to credentials committee chairs alexis herman james roosevelt jr
742899 accordingly i ask that the credentials committee when it meets on august 24 to approve the delegates for the national convention pass a resolution that would entitle each delegate from florida and michigan to cast a full vote
742900 21st century networking time to throw away your medieval gateways
742901 it does not depend on how remote hosts have obtained their own ipv6 connectivity native ipv6 tunnel broker rfc3053 softwires rfc4925 teredo rfc4380 6rd thisdraft
742902 the common thinking for the last 10 years has been that the transition to ipv6 will be based on the dual stack model and that most things would be converted this way before we ran out of ipv4 it has not happened
742903 gt worst case it doesnt get used and we have this nice utopian nat free ipv6 network no thats the best case the worst case is that it encourages vendors to implement it and corporate it folk to deploy it
742904 gt can you say the same for the worst case situation for not standardizing v6 nat thats a very hard question to answer because it depends very much on how cpe and firewall vendors react in their product plans since they all know that nat isnt needed for ipv6 and product managers are not known for funding unnecessary work in the best case it doesnt get implemented in the worst case it gets implemented randomly
742905 but you have free internet in your hotel we checked this aspect when weve made the reservation
742906 so after all for now anywhere find any connection that will work
742907 ill take any connection i can get and make my ipv6 direct connection on top of it
742908 it is a nasty worm that has a great deal of intelligence
742909 of malware in the wild or even in the lab per os
742910 well 3 4 of corporate customers give full admin rights to their users anyway so this doesnt represent a threat at all
742911 there are many disciplines that a software architect must master in order to do the job requirements definition use cases modeling layering object orientation service orientation methodologies and so on in addition as we are typically project leaders we are usually tasked with mentoring others on the team in the understanding adoption and application of these disciplines this panel discussion focuses on the use of blogs social networking and other online tools and content repositories that can be used to enhance and deliver mentoring to architects developers and project teams
742912 the smart client approach enables a saas distribution model you cant replicate with a browser only product because with a browser based product there is nothing to ship

743119 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
743120 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
743121 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
743122 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
743123 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
743124 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
743125 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
743126 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country
743127 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
743128 very glad to hear it was only the poor toyota that was damaged mind you i rather imagined you would driving an alpha romeo or a masda mx5 perhaps
743129 glad to hear you didnt become one of the 12 000 people killed or seriously injured on the roads every year ah the price of lovely individualism
743130 but how is it possible that a tesco lorry swerves 2 lanes in front of that van and you did not see it
743131 why was a tesco lorry moving into the outside lane of a motorway anyway hgvs arent allowed in the outside lane
743132 dk glad to hear you didnt become one of the 12 000 people killed or seriously injured on the roads every year ah the price of lovely individualism in comparison only 48 people were killed traveling by train last year still individual liberties require that we take massive extra risk of death in our stride eh
743133 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
743134 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
743135 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
743136 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
743137 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
743138 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
743139 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
743140 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
743141 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
743142 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
743143 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
743144 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
743145 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
743146 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
743147 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
743148 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
743149 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
743150 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
743151 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
743152 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
743153 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
743154 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why

743164 as affordable coverage is made available individuals should purchase health insurance while there are differing approaches within the party about how best to achieve the commitment of universal coverage we stand united to achieve this fundamental objective through the legislative process
743165 we believe that as you make health care more affordable people will be able to buy that health a basic principal how we get there is a matter of legislative process
743166 if you look at everybody here people got along very well youll see that whatever it is the final document here on the platform is one that we are all going to fight for in full force as we get to the convention and i think we are all pleased with the result and we are one big happy family and now we just want to grow we want to reach out to the independents we want to bring some republicans that have been left out so they can also join our effort to elect senator obama as the next president
743167 in recent years weve seen an administration put forward a false choice between the liberties we cherish and the security we demand
743168 we will restore our constitutional traditions and recover our nations founding commitment to liberty under law we reject illegal wire tapping of american citizens we reject torture we reject sweeping claims of inherent presidential power we will revisit the patriot act and overturn unconstitutional executive decisions issued during the past eight years

743186 i was kind of sweating it but im glad it went in
743187 as it is horrible to lose a race in this way it was tough for me because when you spend a long time behind a slower car it becomes frustrating and boring when i was finally able to push the car was behaving very well but by then it was too late
743188 i came up behind glock but in the end i had to slow as i had a mechanical problem with the rear end and the team told me to be very careful to ensure i brought the car home
743189 its true that im the one who has won the most points out of the top three in the classification which shows this championship is really unpredictable with ups and downs for everyone it was a disappointing weekend for me but at least i managed to come away with a decent result

743192 its possible to monitor the charge in a battery any kind of battery with considerable accuracy theres a certain amount of guessing involved because the fullness of different battery chemistries doesnt necessarily map well to terminal voltage even if the batterys powering an unchanging load but modern smart batteries with little chips on them that keep track of how long theyve been lasting lately really do work pretty well
743193 reason one a battery that stays apparently full for a long time makes a phone look good even if it doesnt actually deserve to
743194 reason two when your phone still apparently has lots of charge left youre more likely to use it people who think their phones going flat will make fewer and shorter calls and that makes phone companies sad

743210 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
743211 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
743212 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
743213 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

743231 online journals promise to serve more information to more dispersed audiences and are more efficiently searched and recalled but because they are used differently than print scientists and scholars tend to search electronically and follow hyperlinks rather than browse or peruse electronically available journals may portend an ironic change for science i show that as more journal issues came online the articles referenced tended to be more recent fewer journals and articles were cited and more of those citations were to fewer journals and articles searching online is more efficient and following hyperlinks quickly puts researchers in touch with prevailing opinion but this may accelerate consensus and narrow the range of findings and ideas built upon
743232 people view others choices as relevant information a signal of quality and factor them into their own reading and citation selections findings and ideas that do not become consensus quickly will be forgotten quickly this research ironically intimates that one of the chief values of print library research is poor indexing
743233 that online access whatever its source reshapes knowledge discovery and use in the same way
743234 what we are losing in this country and presumably around the world is the sustained focused linear attention developed by reading i would believe people who tell me that the internet develops reading if i did not see such a universal decline in reading ability and reading comprehension on virtually all tests

743237 last fall the national endowment for the arts issued a sobering report linking flat or declining national reading test scores among teenagers with the slump in the proportion of adolescents who said they read for fun the simplest argument for why children should read in their leisure time is that it makes them better readers according to federal statistics students who say they read for fun once a day score significantly higher on reading tests than those who say they never do

743239 standardized tests in the u s indicate that girls now score just as well as boys in math
743240 1970s and 1980s several crucial cultural shifts have occurred that merit a new analysis of gender and math performance in previous decades girls took fewer advanced math and science courses in high school than boys did which explained superior male performance on standardized tests by 2000 high school girls were taking calculus at the same rate as boys today women earn 48 of the undergraduate degrees in mathematics
743241 of these effect sizes 21 were positive indicating better performance by males 36 were negative indicating better performance by females and 9 were exactly 0 in contrast to earlier findings these very current data provide no evidence of a gender difference favoring males emerging in the high school years
743242 gender and variance another explanation for the underrepresentation of women at the highest levels in stem careers has focused not on averages but on variance the extent to which scores of one gender or the other vary from the mean score
743243 the variance ratio vr the ratio of the male variance to the female variance assesses these differences greater male variance is indicated by vr gt 1 0 all vrs by state and grade are gt 1 0 range 1 11 to 1 21 see top table on p 494
743244 for whites the ratios of boys girls scoring above the 95th percentile and 99th percentile are 1 45 and 2 06 respectively and are similar to predictions from theoretical models
743245 there is evidence of slightly greater male variability in scores although the causes remain unexplained gender differences in math performance even among high scorers are insufficient to explain lopsided gender patterns in participation in some stem fields
743246 summers comments about the far right tail of math ability remains supported by the evidence
743247 an incomplete understanding of the full body of evidence can lead to an incorrect conclusion and consequently bad managerial decisions
743248 underrepresentation of women at the highest levels in stem careers
743249 others speculate that stem careers simply dont appeal as much to women
743250 which begs the question did the author of this blog post actually read the science article or just the press coverage i ask not to take a shot at the author but because this raises a major concern i have with eb management an incomplete understanding of the full body of evidence can lead to an incorrect conclusion and consequently bad managerial decisions
743251 brings together a group of experienced hci researchers and practitioners to explore a long standing research problem the meaningfulness of measurable constructs and the measurability of nonmeasurable ones the sixteen interesting submissions in this volume touch upon the basic issue of the formal empirical dichotomy many arguments can be boiled down to the fundamental problem that our understanding of how people think and feel is still rather limited which is essentially inferred from peoples behaviours nonetheless we are convinced about the value meaningfulness and usefulness of this research endeavour
743252 there are two types of ux usability measures those that measure the result of using the whole system usability in use and measures of the quality of the user interface interface usability
743253 discussion of ux and selection of appropriate ux measures would be simplified if the different perspectives on ux were identified and distinguished the current interpretations of ux are even more diverse than those of usability
743254 proposes a common framework for classifying usability and ux measures showing how they relate to broader issues of effectiveness efficiency satisfaction accessibility and safety it is anticipated that the framework could to be elaborated to incorporate new conceptual distinctions as they emerge understanding how different aspects of user experience relate to usability accessibility and broader conceptions of quality in use will help in the selection of appropriate measures
743255 conducted an empirical study on user experience ux measurement needs at different units and levels of nokia product development and asked which kinds of ux measurements would be useful in different parts of the organization
743256 found that the needs for ux measures were not only about design details but mostly about how the different touch points between user and company are experienced along the product experience lifecycle

743260 the flight was very long but im excited to be here
743261 im very motivated and happy to finally be in perth
743262 i felt at home with the team in indonesia and i wish id been able to come straight to australia
743263 i think perth glory has a good team and a lot of potential to play well this season and strive for the championship i have come here to help them achieve that goal
743264 i am fit and have been training in brazil twice a day
743265 im ready to play and i feel i can contribute to the team straight away
743266 im here to do a job and thats to play football but i am looking forward to seeing this country also i have done some research on the internet and perth is a beautiful city it has lots of nice beaches and my first impression has been very nice
743267 we changed a lot of players i think it was in the beginning not really a spectacle
743268 the second half there were much more opportunities for both sides i think we were definitely more lucky than sunderland thats the reason why we won
743269 its true that the english premiership and all the clubs have a lot of money
743270 i think thats why they are strong they have a lot of good players a lot of attention from television etc
743271 for us in holland and smaller countries its difficult to be as strong as they are but we give it a try
743272 towards the end i didnt think we controlled the game any more
743273 im the opposite of mourinho i dont need to win to be sure of what im doing
743274 its okay even if we take several blows last year we had some and we reacted well
743275 i dont look for victory to be sure of myself i look to change the squad to put them in difficulty sometimes so they know how to react because they have to know how to be good in the bad times too
743276 whats important now is this mentality we have you work you look you progress step by step
743277 its not hard to accept such a heavy defeat because when you go abroad and face well organised teams when youre not well prepared yet you can suffer as we suffered
743278 they played much better than us anyone with their eyes open can see that hamburg played really well
743279 so it was obvious we were going to suffer especially having seen how hamburg put real madrid in difficulty yesterday
743280 but i wanted to give everyone 90 minutes as a run out and to see how they could do
743281 as of close of business on friday a deal was not done and i have had no confirmation since from barcelona
743282 barcelona were thinking of a loan but the player is keen on a transfer and is waiting to fly to glasgow

743288 hank ive got it ive got the symbol the theme for the seventh bond tour its the flag raising picture people love it fdr understood deeply why the photo was so popular with americans it represented victory and the end of war his genius is that he was able to tap into this powerful yearning and connect it with the war fund raising effort a company i recently worked with told me that their campaign message was
743289 what we do in war the cruelty is almost incomprehensible
743290 but somehow we need to make sense of it the right picture can win or lose a war i took a lot of other pictures that day but none of them made a difference looking at it the picture you could believe the sacrifice was not a waste
743291 i still think theres one more deal left for the yanks
743292 you guys miss lackey and saunders though as luck would have it
743293 are open minded on both fronts the boston florida one as well as tampa and there is no deal tentative or otherwise in either direction
743294 if hes not traded by 4 p m today theres a 1 percent chance that he finishes the year with the red sox this has gotten so ugly
743295 might be willing to kick in some of his salary
743296 im pretty all the reports have always had the sox paying all or most his salary i dont see whats telling about that though
743297 no offense bill but you guys have way too many
743298 10 33pm the palm beach post says a tentative agreement has been reached despite gammons comments heres the deal marlins get manny ramirez cash prospect from red sox red sox get jason bay john grabow pirates get ryan tucker jeremy hermida one prospect from red sox 10 22pm more from gammons the deal is definitely not done the bucs arent yet satisfied with the players theyd get from boston for bay nothing has been done in regards to mannys no trade or paperwork to the commissioners office gammons expects this to go right down to the wire
743299 during my years here ive seen how they the red sox have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them
743300 the red sox did the same with guys like nomar garciaparra and pedro martinez and now they do the same with me their goal is to paint me as the bad guy
743301 i love boston fans but the red sox dont deserve me im not talking about money mental peace has no price and i dont have peace here
743302 otherwise especially all the simpering fans you deserve what youre going to not get
743303 theyve bent over backwards to appease you theyve put up with your manny being manny crapfest theyve we have cheered heartily when you decided to come back from bogus days off when they needed you teammates have stood up for you when they should not have theyve looked the other way when you flopped around in the outfied on a lazy fly ball or when you played balls on the hop that my sister could have gotten to
743304 it doesnt surprise me hey nobody thought jeffrey would get pudge rodriguez years ago and sure enough he did
743305 is it possible that something was done or said by someone in the fo that sent manny off the deep end
743306 so to that end the front office does hold some responsibilty

743316 in later life it is men who come closer to fulfilling their aspirations are more satisfied with their family lives and financial situations and are the happier of the two
743317 im assuming its the changes that take place in our lives that affect our level of happiness i gave birth to my three children in my thirties and loved that whole decade for me that was the best my life is quite different now and requires effort on my part to stay positive i read recently that our seventies are supposed to be particularly happy i have a hard time buying that although maybe ill be pleasantly surprised
743318 when i was very young i was happier because i didnt have the worries i do now and when i was first married it was happier not as many responsibilities or burdens we were blissful young lovers i guess i was very naive and innocent i didnt really understand the world and how cruel it can be sometimes i am less happy now then i was then because i know more
743319 i dont know if i was happier but when i was younger but i was more hopeful for the future i could dream big and there seemed to be plenty of time to make those dreams come true and the possibilities were limitless
743320 i get happier each year i learn from my mistakes and learn how to connect better with other people and myself i have become more at peace with myself
743321 i am happy and i dont think ill not be happy as i age i think we control our own happiness so if im not happy it will be my own fault if im not married it doesnt mean i cant still be happy final answer i disagree with the article i think we create our own happiness thats my story and im sticking to it
743322 i think it is because their kids get married and they move out so women who have made taking care of their kids their career dont know what to do with themselves because they spent at least 18 21 yrs helping their kids
743323 well its really none of my business what they name their kid
743324 i wonder what the folks on our boards have to say about this
743325 i think this is a case of the government way overstepping boundaries
743326 im not saying that parents should purposefully give their kids awful names but i dont think its the governments place to take custody of the child and rename it
743327 while i agree that prudence and horace are pretty awful names id hardly call it abusive to give someone such a name they are after all names talula does the hula from hawaii sounds more like a bad porn movie
743328 i may be in the minority here but i dont think the government has at any point or any time the right to tell us what to name our children
743329 although i feel awful for the poor kids that get stuck with hideous names i dont think its the governments place to step in and change it id much rather see that effort go towards kids who are being neglected or abused
743330 this child was involved in a custody battle at the age of 9 she was probably interviewed regarding the custody situation and then also asked about her name she was said to be terribly embarrassed should she have lived with the embarrassment until she was 18 so that she could legally change her name herself then i dont think so the judge made the right call in this case imo
743331 im definitely noticing the pinch when stocking up on groceries and hope to find more ways in addition to gardening to economize
743332 there was more of this activity in the 1970s i expect since were going back to a similar monetary situation more people will go back to gardening again too
743333 my best friend just this year dedicated a small part of his yard to growing food he cited the rising cost of food as the primary reason
743334 i went to the social security office to add dhs name to mine yesterday
743335 finally someone who understands i planned for 2 years as well it was my life and the day after the wedding was over i was so bummed so i totally understand i should have been so excited i just got married going on our honeymoon but i was a lil depressed nothing to plan for
743336 i know how you feel its nice being the center of attention and it can leave you a bit empty when its all over with what helped us yes hubby had it also was to throw ourselves into other big projects to help pass the time
743337 all advice is pretty much the same throw yourself into other projects for me it was finding a hobby i discovered scrapbooking and ive also gotten back into my figure skating and planning vacations you can spend almost as much time planning a wedding as you do researching vacations its crazy also decorating my house took a lot of time picking paint colors fabrics decor etc
743338 ive never met a pixar film that didnt fascinate me but this is the best one yet at 103 minutes its a little long for a kid but that said its a wonderful film for anyone who is dismayed at the mountain of trash our planet is on its way to becoming this is not a polemic i hasten to add but an eye opener nonetheless
743339 the movie was eerie sad beautiful cute funny and then some it was truly amazing and i dont think ill like any movie that comes out this year better
743340 i like the premise of it it could be such a great teaching mechanism to kids about trash and exercise and just lifestyles in general
743341 i was surprised that fat people are not protesting it in the lazy spaceship everyone is so fat they can barely walk and they are constantly entertained or eating
743342 i walked away almost feeling lectured in a good way i will not lie throughout much of the movie i felt some pretty profound sadness as far as where we are taking our earth where we are heading with it makes me want to go out and recycle and never shop at wal mart again
743343 in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
743344 they dont have a father around to tell them dont act like a moron youll get nowhere in life stop acting like a putz straighten up
743345 i have to agree that the man that made such a judgmental statement about the autistic children should be fired i think that part of the problem in this world today is that people especially public figures voice their opinions and forget how it can affect others we should all be more careful on what we say and how we say things
743346 no one is saying bad parenting has caused autism its suggested though that many people are blaming autism for bad parenting
743347 i have a seven year old son who has autism and i find michael savages comments appalling my son does have behavior problems and is on medication to help when we are in public and he has a meltdown people look at us like why cant you control your kid or he just needs his tail tore up our kids have a hard enough time being accepted in our society today without ignorant people like michael savage telling the nation that autism is a fraud if don imus was fired for making racial comments why isnt this man fired for making these comments about autistic kids what michael savage has said is just as bad if not worse than imus
743348 i think this was a slimey thing to say and in no way do i agree with it it does a disservice to all autistic children their parents and their caregivers
743349 i feel everyone has the right to an opinion but that means the other side also has the chance to answer that opinion in the public forum as well and lets face it this man is simply repeating what many uninformed people truly believe about autism as sad and disturbing as that may be
743350 i am not saying i agree or disagree with him or any of you but i just want to say savage is not saying autistic children are brats he is saying children with behavioral problems are being misdiagnosed with autism
743351 i disagree with how he said things but at the same time autism is becoming the new catch all since theyve defined it as a spectrum disorder now i think by broadening the definition theyve done a huge disservice to kids with the more severe forms of autism
743352 the ultimate responsibility lands with those who take out those mortgages or use the credit cards however i stick with my vulture analogy they dont necessarily kill the animal but once it is down they pick at it mercilessly
743353 i called my neuro he wants to see me tomorrow at 8am i am sure he will want to up my topamax from 300 to 400 which i cant afford to buy
743354 sadly i think its a lot more complicated than just either or hopefully people would make cuts where they can before resorting to giving up on pets but one can only cut so much
743355 i think were going to talk to all of our out of town guests and see if we cant plan some sort of carpool for the trip even if we only get four to a car thats still saving quite a bit of money for those who might have to fly or want to fly we plan on monitoring the airlines for seat sales so we can let them know when a deal comes up it seems like the least we can do for our family and friends who want to be here
743356 and received a lot of interesting replies while most havent found the need to take any drastic measures just yet people consistently are cutting back on their entertainment minimizing their driving time and retooling their grocery lists we obviously have seen
743357 my question of the day is how can 195 in groceries only take 4 trips from car to kitchen
743358 as for groceries i have almost completely stopped shopping at the health food stores and i have really cut back on what i buy at the regular store
743359 i live in the city so already walk most places im telling everyone that im afraid the price of shoe leather is going up so im stocking up on shoes every time i go to marshalls i buy another pair
743360 my objection to abstinence only health education is that and be able to make knowledgeable choices
743361 while i think teaching abstinence is so important we also need to help protect those that dont choose abstinence im not sure how i feel about schools handing out condoms but i do think its important for parents and sex ed programs to not only teach abstinence as a form of protection but also how to use condoms correctly
743362 i favor abstinence only because it is the only thing that is both safe and effective i believe that sex education that includes birth control teaching can only confuse some kids and lull them into believing that birth control equals safe sex equals infallible which its not its not 100 fool proof its not 100 safe either
743363 the fact is teenagers are making the decision to either have sex or to not have sex i know that any decision i make is best made with all the available information and this is such an important decision so i think that yes lets teach them about abstinence give them the tools they need to say no if that is what their choice is going to be but lets also give them the birth control and std information demystify it teach it and hopefully the kids will learn enough to make good decisions
743364 teaching only abstinence is at best negligent and at worst criminal as this generation appears to be sadly ignorant of how sexually transmitted diseases are transmitted of how vulnerable they are and of what to do when symptoms are noticed
743365 omg no its questionable whether or not adults are safe in the city alone
743366 no way in hell i would leave my daughter alone in a city to find her way home cl west1745 feels similarly and is happy to embrace her protective tendencies
743367 i feel it is my responsibility to teach my daughter how to be home alone but i would never put her outside in public like the boy in was until they are 12 or 13 kids dont have the reasoning skills to avoid harmful situations in public
743368 10 year old go two blocks to the high school to ride his bike by himself
743369 i am a journalist and newspapers have lost thousands and thousands of very talented people in the past year who have nowhere to go my lay off was not completely unexpected we knew it was a remote possibility but that did not make it any easier when i got the tap on my shoulder the day we returned from vacation our family is really struggling losing money every month but still hanging on we have a terrifying amount of debt which i am trying to tackle as i can i write from home now and have had some luck in freelancing but it is sporadic and nowhere near what i was making before the scary thing is my husband is also a journalist his job is secure for now but who knows
743370 in june i quit my job after returning to work from maternity leave and having to pay 600 every two weeks for 3 children i said no way my pay cheque was only 645 650 every 2 weeks that left me with 50 it made absolutely no sense
743371 if we have to let people go shes one of them
743372 one of the biggest things we did was to retire my girls from gymnastics because of the travel expenses the girls were getting burned out anyway however it was the thought of 12 travel trips across the country that helped us make the final decision
743373 i no longer do as many remote interviews as i used to my editor completely understands and i try to get as much work done while i am at the office so i do not have to make as many trips
743374 i dont know how many of you are feeling the pinch with the economy but i certainly am i certainly understand that pt is a luxury and i dont blame my clients for having to cut corners where they can but its disappointing i actually raised my prices recently to account for cost of living a raise and that was before the gas prices skyrocketed
743375 my husband works 50 miles away and now stays one night a week in the town he works in and sleeps on the couch in the lounge at his work its hard because its one night every week he doesnt get to see the boys but its saving us quite a bit of money each month
743376 were already paying several hundred dollars a month in co pays and now it might go into the thousands theres no way the average american taxpayer can afford to be ill
743377 this cant possibly be true can it my husband takes medication for asthma and if we had to pay more than the current co pay which is already 50 wed have to change our style of living some of his medications are very very expensive what the heck is wrong with this country that we cant provide for those who need care and why cant the drug companies eat some of this cost
743378 ive been diagnosed with severe allergies as well as skin cancer so ive had more office visits with specialists co pays for office visits to specialists have doubled as well as medications that we didnt expect to have to purchase it seems everyone has the same question asks member whats the point in having insurance and paying the ridiculously high premiums if were going to have to pay for the drugs we need anyway
743379 national healthcare you ultimately will pay one way or another
743380 my family will likely suffer much greater harm at the hands of the current healthcare system than any threat from any extreme terrorist group
743381 we just go to the doctor and we dont have to pay anything it gives us such peace of mind
743382 wow where are these girls parents the school and community are talking about making contraceptives available but where are the girls parents in all of this
743383 i agree these girls must not have much in the way of parental guidance or who knows maybe they do and this is just the new
743384 maybe i am a little biased because im a pregnant teen but its kind of dumb to ask where their mothers are i didnt ask my mom for permission to have sex and im sure you dont either
743385 the girls did it because it is the one thing they can control in their lives you have a baby you get an apartment and checks and foodstamps etc so it probably looked like a good deal to them
743386 i have a friend who volunteers at the crisis pregnancy center
743387 and you know whos going to end up paying for all of those babies not the father all of the taxpayers how stupid can you be to purposely get pregnant like that
743388 i guess what sticks out here to me is that they are blaming the movie
743389 wow i am seriously a little speechless no wait here it goes first of all i think it is ridiculous to say that movies like juno or knocked up made being pregnant look glamorous
743390 i could care less now take care of my baby for me
743391 if you are going to play you are going to pay
743392 because of the increase of wickedness the love of most will grow cold
743393 have sex before you get married cause its fun and everybodys doing it and nothing bad happens to them
743394 do these shorts make me look fat i feel fat
743395 oh thanks as a matter of fact i was just thinking how your nose isnt quite as big as i first imagined it to be you could still do with shaving a bit off the end though are you planning rhinoplasty
743396 look at you youre so skinny what do you mean you want to exercise
743397 oh she is so beautiful if only she would loose wegiht she would always tell them she is beautiful period thank you
743398 no never thought about it before sounds like a good idea
743399 her weight shows that she has self control issues and would be likely to steal from us
743400 you know what i really like not having cute clothing or dates and having folks all around me make fun of me behind my back and sometimes to my face
743401 you know what i really like not having cute clothing or dates and having folks all around me make fun of me behind my back and sometimes to my face
743402 poor souls ill take my superslow metabolism over their super slow brains any day at least there are ways to increase metabolic rates
743403 besides its the ones you think are the most attractive that usually end up being the ugliest person you ever met in your life
743404 poor souls ill take my superslow metabolism over their super slow brains any day at least there are ways to increase metabolic rates
743405 besides its the ones you think are the most attractive that usually end up being the ugliest person you ever met in your life
743406 watching this thing unfold im beginning to think that all men cheat but why why marry the woman pledge to her your faithfulness and then cheat
743407 i think he did the smart thing admit to what happened and get it done with he didnt abuse power he didnt break any laws he had a difficult marriage and they both went astray and found their way back
743408 i hope he is prosecuted for breaking the law and has to live with the consequences like any other john
743409 im sad for his family and disappointed by his own lack of responsibility towards me and all new yorkers
743410 i dont see how you could stand next to your husband while he apologizes for cheating on his family
743411 i just wonder why political wives go along with it so consistently to save her husbands career i suppose only i wonder why there arent more wives who decide that hubby and his career can go jump in the lake at that point
743412 its supposed to be sort of subliminal see he isnt so bad his spouse is still supporting him if she can forgive him why cant the voters i really dont know how the spouses stand up to the pressure
743413 actually i do when you first find out you have been betrayed you are enveloped in a numbing confusion my husband confessed to me on the morning of my sons graduation i had to sit next to the man i loved and hated more than anything else in the world and deal with friends and family and the appearance of a normal happy event you become numb you know you are in no state to make any decisions yet and you just live minute by minute its horrible
743414 ill tell her to make sure she is putting herself and her children first to think about what she wants out of life a partner and a marriage and then look at her husband to see if she believes he is willing and able to give that to he if she wants to remain married then she should be looking to see if he is showing true remorse for the pain he has caused her if he is taking full and complete responsibility for his choice to cheat if he is showing through his actions that he will make changes in himself and his lifestyle and that he will put in a lot of effort into working on the marriage
743415 there was obviously something she was contributing and where was she when this was all going down
743416 i am sorry i cheated on my wife i brought disgrace and shame to my family and i will never do it again
743417 it just happened one time and will not happen again
743418 i cant kid myself it is just a pattern that will repeat given time because i allowed it to happen once and now it will happen again when i least expect it to happen
743419 it takes 2 to destroy a relationship there was obviously something she was contributing
743420 men in politics think that they are above the laws amp above the laws of marriage too
743421 acting in a certain way had they been in the protagonists shoes
743422 be up front and lives dont need to be totally distroyed

743453 castillo then threw a pitch close to brandon menchacas head prompting dayton manager donnie scott to leave the third base coaching box and complain to home plate umpire tyler wilson that prompted interim peoria manager carmelo martinez to join the conversation which quickly became heated and when martinez pushed scott the benches emptied

743640 de wet schrijft voor dat als een executeur testamentair niet wordt genoemd in het testament hij n procent van de totale som ontvangt als onkostenvergoeding in zijn geval zou dat komen op een bedrag van rond de 1500 euro maar hekman had zich al rijk gerekend en had zich 30 000 euro eigen gemaakt dit hebben wij ontdekt nadat wij de recherche hadden ge nformeerd samen met de recherche van de gemeente emmen zijn wij als familie opening van zaken gaan vragen bij de amro bank te emmen de bank liet ons onder dwang de rekening zien waarvan wij het bestaan niet af wisten en de waarde was ook niet vernoemd in het testament die destijds samen met hekman was opgesteld 75 000 euro direct na de begrafenis van tante waren wij door hekman in de woning van tante opgewacht hij opende het testament en las het aan ons voor mijn vrouw had mij indertijd verteld dat tante best vermogend was maar het resultaat bleek ver onder de maat waar was dat vermogen dan wel enige tijd later heeft ondergetekende dit ter sprake gebracht waarop hekman woedend naar mij uitviel dat er beslist niet meer was onze geloofsgenoot bleek dus door de eerste leugen niet gebarsten uiteindelijk is door bemiddeling van een notaris de erfenis onder de aanwezige familieleden verdeeld maar als familie hebben we nog wel een appeltje met hekman te schillen ik denk zeker dat wij niet de enigen zijn mocht hekman gepakt worden vroeg of laat reken maar dat er dan een beerput opengaat en deze zaak behoorlijk zal stinken dood is hij zeker niet ik huldig uw standpunt dat hij in de anonimiteit is verdwenen op een tropisch eiland ik denk niet in het oostblok aangezien steeds meer landen toetreden tot de eu en dat zou voor hem wel eens nadelig kunnen werken overigens vraag ik mij af of interpol is ingeschakeld

743691 als je ziet wat de dader met de twee jonge meisjes in luik heeft gedaan zowel de seksuele abberaties gebotvierd als de beide meisjes gewurgd en er is geen dna van hem achtergebleven dan is dat een prima bewijs van de stelling dat als er van iemand geen dna gevonden is hij toch de dader kan zijn

743697 dat is met schilderijen precies hetzelfde iedereen ziet iets anders in het schilderij dan wat de schilder zelf er mee heeft bedoeld dan gaat het nog maar om beelden die zijn concreet woorden zijn abstract m a w inderdaad kan men maar beter als men tegenover een agent of een ovj staat zwijgen en om te laten horen dat je niet doofstom bent liegen
743698 de generaal opperbaas der strijdkrachten heeft 170 000 per jaar
743699 opvallend is dat alle vijf de waarzeggers voorzien dat onze jongens de groepsfase zullen overleven voorwaar geen misselijke prestatie want het nederlands elftal is ingedeeld in de poule met itali frankrijk en roemeni de groep des doods zogezegd
743700 bewoners zetten dan meestal op dinsdagavond al de vuilniszakken buiten ik deed dat dus ook
743701 maurice de h ronald beetz heeft hiervoor een interessante analogie opgesteld stel dat hij een zakje tuingrond naar richard eikelenboom stuurt met de opmerking dat dit afkomstig is van de bodem van mars en eikelenboom doet vervolgens onderzoek en vindt resten van levende organismen in de aarde zou hij dan de conclusie trekken dat er leven is op mars
743702 sperma bestaat voor het grootste gedeelte uit vloeistof waarin zich de zaadcellen bevinden voor de inseminatie zijn alleen de zaadcellen nodig deze worden gescheiden van de vloeistof hierbij vermindert het aantal maar blijven de beste zaadcellen over deze bewerking duurt ongeveer twee uur iui is alleen zinvol als er na bewerking meer dan 1 miljoen beweeglijke zaadcellen zijn overgebleven
743703 calis je zou onderhand beter moeten weten en al helemaal als er eerst helemaal geen mannelijk dna was gevonden in dat nagelvuil later gevonden dna net zoals bij het controlemonster waar ook zijn hypothese op was gestoeld daar zou eikelenboom eens een verkaring voor moeten geven dat het om gevoeliger of betere technieken zou kunnen gaan zoals het om graag beweert daarvan zegt eikelenboom ook dat het onzin is de technieken die hij in 2004 gebruikte wijken niet zodanig af van die van de knijff dat dit verschil maakt in het helemaal geen en later wel dna vinden zeker niet omdat de knijff dezelfde dna extracten kreeg van het nfi alle resultaten hadden bevestigend moeten zijn zoals eikelenboom en de knijff in een artikel hadden verklaard
743704 in plaats daarvan blijft hij mdh zijn zinloze enqu tes de wereld insturen en vandaag heeft hij mdh verzonnen dat een meerderheid van de nederlandse bevolking wil dat marco van basten onmiddellijk opstapt als bondscoach
743705 telefoontje is er blijft een vaag verhaal en had zonder ta door de rechter zonder meer avn tafel geveegd moeten worden bovendien zegt een eventuele aanwezigheid in deventer op zich ook niks er waren die avond duizenden mensen in die stad dat durf ik zomaar zonder controle te beweren geplaatst door ruud harmsen donderdag 19 juni 2008 om 16 05
743706 hear hear spiegelend scherm voor je snufferd kan niet anders
743707 ik vind mdh niet aardig en dus heeft hij ongelijk
743708 zie je wel in punt 6 spreek je zelf punt 5 tegen klopt dus niks van
743709 verder denk dat alle vaste gasten hier en ook maurice zelf doordrenkt zijn met een diepgewortelde wens dat michael het wel echt gedaan heeft en alle feiten en waarnemingen daarop aanpassen en daarnaartoe buigen michael moet het gewoon gedaan hebben en er moet aangetoond worden dat hij een motief had hoe dan ook feiten tellen niet alleen het doel en het doel is barbertje moet hangen
743710 verder denk dat alle vaste gasten hier en ook maurice zelf doordrenkt zijn met een diepgewortelde wens dat michael het wel echt gedaan heeft en alle feiten en waarnemingen daarop aanpassen en daarnaartoe buigen michael moet het gewoon gedaan hebben en er moet aangetoond worden dat hij een motief had hoe dan ook feiten tellen niet alleen het doel en het doel is barbertje moet hangen
743711 the samples are being purified on columns standard or by magnetic bead technology ht
743712 as well the quality of the purified dna as the tracking of samples is controlled in detail throughout a project
743713 evengoed geloven velen liever ijdeltuit peter rudolf de vries als het gaat over de dmz dan maurice de hond die zich niet bedient van criminelen om bepaalde personen uit te horen
743714 ik zal mij er hier op deze site niet populair mee maken
743715 rancuneuze onzin dat stukje van fleur meer kan ik er niet van maken alsof eikelenboom een monopoliepositie had hij concurreerde ook met het nfi sinds hij een eigen bedrijf had waarom vraag je eigenlijk een reactie van mij hierop
743716 hier is toch wel iets heel geks aan de hand
743717 maar knoops heeft toch het rapport als hij het niet openbaar maakt zal het wel slecht zijn voor louwes
743718 ik zie het getal 10 het getal 10 zal de mensen laten zien wie jij werkelijk bent
743719 ik vernam ik weet niet of dit juist is dat sperma na 30 minuten degenereert of er dan nog een volledig dna profiel valt uit te halen
743720 denk ook maar aan gevriesdroogde sperma waarvan men na ontdooing het dna direct injecteerd d t kan de spermacel zelf niet meer want
743721 hoe is zijn zoon zo geworden die jongen was toen nog maar 18 jaar dat hij zich bij prdv als een heilig boontje opstelde alsof hij er volledig buiten stond en over zijn zoon sprak alsof het een vreemde was een liefdeloze vader die geen enkele verantwoordelijkheid voor zijn zoon neemt en uiteraard mede zoniet hoofd schuldig is een slappeling is
743722 hoe denk je dat mensen reageren die bij veel delen van deze website argeloos terechtkomen ik schaam me af en toe dat ik ernaar link naar enkele van de zeer zeldzame zinnige bijdragen dan geplaatst door ruud harmsen dinsdag 27 mei 2008 om 19 46
743723 en als je niet weet wat een encyclopie is dan zoek je dat maar op in de encyclopie
743724 fleur schreef undercover bedankt dit verbaast mij in het geheel niet vanho kwalificeerde ik direkt als troll
743725 hebben jullie enig idee hoe het met hanssworst gaat hij heeft hier al een week niets meer gepost terwijl ik hem wel af en toe aan de overkant zie posten geplaatst door peter v donderdag 29 mei 2008 om 20 31
743726 heb je enig idee hoeveel ik lees in een week hoeveel discussies ik volg en voer op hoeveel plaatsen even een korte reminder is gewoon een kwestie van beleefdheid als je daar te lui voor bent lastig voor je dan wordt discussi ren inderdaad moeilijk niet mijn probleem bovendien gaat het toch al meestal nergens over dat uit maakt het ook niks doei
743727 naam zegt me niks blijkt van vestdijk lees ik nooit ben grotendeel autodidact cultuurbarbaar
743728 dat u sporen van meneer louwes heeft gevonden moge duidelijk zijn ik maak bezwaar tegen het feit dat u die sporen direct koppelt aan de moord op mevrouw wittenberg zonder verdere uitleg waarom zijn dna per definitie het bewijs moet zijn dat hij de moord heeft gepleegd
743729 naam zegt me niks blijkt van vestdijk lees ik nooit ben grotendeel autodidact cultuurbarbaar
743730 ik zou ook niet weten waar hanssworst gebleven is maar het valt me wel op dat hij zich niet meer heeft laten zien vanaf het moment dat ik speciaal voor hem een link naar een bepaald bericht had geplaatst en hem daarmee waarschijnlijk op een gevoelig punt geraakt had geplaatst door peter v vrijdag 30 mei 2008 om 14 12
743731 dat hij zonder de inschrijving bij de kamer van koophandel toch een zakelijke derden rekening wilde openen
743732 ik vroeg de man of hij notaris danwel advokaat was danwel waarbinnen ik deze vraag moest plaatsen deze man deelde mij mede dat er een persoon overleden was en dat de gelden uit de erfenis op deze bankrekening gestort overgeboekt zouden worden
743733 ik vond dit wel vreemd omdat deze afdeling hem dan zelfstandig geholpen zou hebben
743734 ik deelde de man wederom mede dat het niet mogelijk was
743735 de man vertelde mij dat hij zelf niet de eigenaar van de gelden was doch dat hij deze gelden alleen in beheer had
743736 de kleine mickmekjes zijn de feiten ik kan er ook niet aan veranderen
743737 volgens onze dna deskundige amer was de blouse doordrenkt met het dna van e l wonderlijk dat er geen dna van de weduwe op zijn kleren noch in zijn auto noch in zijn woning werd aangetroffen
743738 hoe weet jij zo zeker dat louwes met zijn eigen auto naar deventer is gegaan geplaatst door amer zaterdag 31 mei 2008 om 19 35
743739 maar dat delict werd niet gepleegd door e l maar door diegene die het er op aangebracht heeft in opdracht van hogerop
743740 dat hij zonder de inschrijving bij de kamer van koophandel toch een zakelijke derden rekening wilde openen
743741 als het onderzoek gericht was op het zoeken van een andere dader kan je het ook later in alle rust doen
743742 ik vond dit wel vreemd omdat deze afdeling hem dan zelfstandig geholpen zou hebben
743743 ik vroeg de man of hij notaris danwel advokaat was danwel waarbinnen ik deze vraag moest plaatsen deze man deelde mij mede dat er een persoon overleden was en dat de gelden uit de erfenis op deze bankrekening gestort overgeboekt zouden worden

743746 echt een poepie die louis hagemann geplaatst door ada zondag 1 juni 2008 om 3 37
743747 hoe slordiger er met die blouse is omgesprongen hoe belastender dat is voor louwes
743748 dus nu je er toch bent waar komt het louwesbloed op de kraag achterzijde van het strangulatieslachtoffer vandaan
743749 je suggestie zou dan inhouden dat iemand met een miljoenenvermogen tientallen verschillende bankrekeningen zou moeten openen
743750 allen nog niet zolang geleden heb ik ada een steuntje in haar rug willen geven
743751 als de politie hem van de moord op de hoogte stelt is hij even geschokt maar denkt hij al snel aan de 15 toestanden die hem te wachten staan er moet van alles geregeld worden en hij heeft het al zo druk bovendien is dit de eerste keer dat hij zoiets doet niettemin gaat l voortvarend aan de slag met de afwikkeling van het testament hij schrijft brieven aan legatarissen laat het antiek waarderen en haalt geld en sieraden uit haar kluis voor de tegoeden die vrijkomen opent hij een bankrekening
743752 echt antiek bleek nep ik schrijf dit in kader van een nogal opvallende kwestie in de veronderstelling dat er sprake was van een aanzienlijke waarde aan antiek had ik contact gezocht met een expert van veilinghuis christies omdat de politie in een bankkluis o a sieraden had aangetroffen had ik met de expert een afspraak op het politiebureau te deventer gemaakt waarbij hem tevens de aangetroffen sieraden werden getoond vervolgens ging er een rechercheur mee naar de woning om deze voor ons te openen de expert hield het echter al spoedig voor gezien want alle veronderstelde antieke voorwerpen bleken namelijk nep te zijn zo waren er klokken met een weliswaar antieke kast maar het uurwerk bleek niet antiek omdat er nagenoeg geen stukken waren met een waarde per stuk van meer dan duizend gulden was de inboedel voor christies niet interessant alvorens de expert vertrok bracht hij mij in contact met een veilingmeester van een door het notariaat opgezette organisatie welke ongeacht de waarde ervoor zorgt dat boedels te gelde worden gemaakt
743753 echt antiek bleek nep ik schrijf dit in kader van een nogal opvallende kwestie in de veronderstelling dat er sprake was van een aanzienlijke waarde aan antiek had ik contact gezocht met een expert van veilinghuis christies correct quote omdat de politie in een bankkluis o a sieraden had aangetroffen dat is onjuist er zijn geen sieraden aangetroffen in een bankkluis slechts de 17 000 en een 3 delig zilveren theeserviesje afgezet met parels beide zaken heeft de politie in de kluis laten liggen de kluissleutel was al op 6 oktober 1999 in het bezit van louwes de sieraden en het geld uit de braadpan werden veiliggesteld quote had ik met de expert een afspraak op het politiebureau te deventer gemaakt waarbij hem tevens de aangetroffen sieraden werden getoond vervolgens ging er een rechercheur mee naar de woning om deze voor ons te openen de expert hield het echter al spoedig voor gezien want alle veronderstelde antieke voorwerpen bleken namelijk nep te zijn zo waren er klokken met een weliswaar antieke kast maar het uurwerk bleek niet antiek correct quote omdat er nagenoeg geen stukken waren met een waarde per stuk van meer dan duizend gulden was de inboedel voor christies niet interessant alvorens de expert vertrok bracht hij mij in contact met een veilingmeester van een door het notariaat opgezette organisatie welke ongeacht de waarde ervoor zorgt dat boedels te gelde worden gemaakt
743754 we adviseerden hem om de zaak bij wijze van therapie van zich af te schrijven wat hij al snel opvolgde steeds als een hoofdstuk uit zijn manuscript klaar was stuurde louwes dat naar ons op na zijn vrijlating moest het in boekvorm op de markt komen dat is echter nooit gebeurd wij bewaarden de tekst maar waren zo druk met zijn enorme dossier dat we dat hele dagboek vergeten zijn
743755 we besloten alle dossiers van zolder te halen en op te bergen pas toen dook dat dagboek weer op en hebben we het voor het eerst helemaal doorgenomen geschokt lazen we louwes beschrijving van de kleding van mevrouw wittenberg een check bij haar toenmalige boetiek wees uit dat het een nauwsluitend rood deux pi ces is geweest waar die witte bloes vol strookjes niet onder paste omwille van ons geweten en gevoel voor waarheidsvinding hebben wij voorzitter harm brouwer van het college van procureurs generaal onmiddellijk ingelicht
743756 ook de officier wist niet wat hij las en heeft een kopie van enkele paginas uit het dagboek voor onderzoek meegenomen
743757 daags nadat we het dagboek hadden gevonden hebben wij maurice gebeld maar hij wilde niet luisteren werd boos en verbrak de telefoonverbinding sindsdien hebben we hem nooit meer gesproken
743758 hij schrijft brieven aan legatarissen laat het antiek waarderen en haalt geld en sieraden uit haar kluis voor de tegoeden die vrijkomen opent hij een bankrekening
743759 omdat de politie in een bankkluis o a sieraden had aangetroffen
743760 ja en siem moet ik altijd maar op haar woord geloven ik dacht het even niet
743761 ada graag alle niet ter zake doende bijdragen op die blog schrappen
743762 ada graag alle niet ter zake doende bijdragen op dit blog schrappen
743763 ada graag alle niet ter zake doende bijdragen op die blog schrappen het zijn er nogal wat dit keer
743764 ik heb het dossier over de dmz niet gelezen en ben er ook niet in geinteresseerd maar vind toch dat het onderzoek niet klopt zo en nu ga ik weer eens lekker een stelletje mieren in hun bek neuken
743765 overigens i v m dat dromen van een vakantiehuisje louwes verdiende rond een ton guldens per jaar in die tijd een behoorlijk goed salaris via een lease constructie of time sharing destijds populair of gewoon hypotheek had hij makkelijk een vakantiehuisje kunnen kopen ivm verdacht duur huis hij had een huis van rond de 6 ton kunnen kopen in die tijd dus kocht hij relatief gezien een goedkoop huis we weten ook niets van spaargelden af de mogelijke verdachtmakingen waren kennelijk niet hard te maken toen niet en nog steeds niet
743766 velde je bent een leugenaar het klopt niet wat je daar schrijft lees de stukken nogmaals
743767 het zou al hel wat zijn als je zei in welke of wat voor stukken dat dan allemaal staat en hoe jij daar aan komt
743768 allemaal n groot misverstand jan ik dacht echt dat je er een mening over had maar je hebt je standpunt duidelijk gemaakt dus ik ga er vanuit dat verder posten niet zinvol meer is tot ziens
743769 als ooit zou blijken dat de hond het bij het verkeerde eind zou hebben vwb de daderschap van michael de jong hij rh de akties toch gerechtvaardigd zou vinden
743770 dat dacht ik toch niet mdh is daar heel nauwkeurig in
743771 als ooit zou blijken dat de hond het bij het verkeerde eind zou hebben vwb de daderschap van michael de jong hij rh de akties toch gerechtvaardigd zou vinden
743772 allemaal n groot misverstand jan ik dacht echt dat je er een mening over had maar je hebt je standpunt duidelijk gemaakt dus ik ga er vanuit dat verder posten niet zinvol meer is tot ziens
743773 louwes heeft het gedaan en ik zal hem blijven plagen zolang hij het ontkent geplaatst door ada donderdag 10 juli 2008 om 0 07
743774 pas als je god aan de kant durft te gooien zien we de echte hanss denk ik geplaatst door ada donderdag 10 juli 2008 om 1 10
743775 pas als je god aan de kant durft te gooien zien we de echte hanss denk ik
743776 eutopie en onnodig god heeft hanss allang definitief aan de kant gegooid vanwege zijn gods misbruikende gedragingen terug te vinden in o a posting hanss cq jochanan 2 04
743777 valse suggestieve posting hij was er helemaal niet bij betrokken zelfs het om heeft op schrift toegegeven dat mdh op dit punt niets te verwijten valt
743778 na een en ander over de zaak gelezen te hebben denk ik dat x het gedaan heeft
743779 en als je dan geld hebt weggesluist dan kunnen de erfgenamen je aanklagen wegens oplichting diefstal
743780 het is dan normaal om dan tijdelijk een rekening te openen op je eigen naam met daarachter een vermelding zoals
743781 de stichting is met terugwerkende kracht ingeschreven per 13 9 99 niet per overlijdensdatum alle handelingen ook die tussen 13 en 23 september 1999 door het slachtoffer zijn verricht vallen daardoor onder de verantwoordelijkheid van de stichting
743782 louwes heeft het gedaan en ik zal hem blijven plagen zolang hij het ontkent
743783 als er een god bestaat die mij na dit leven alsnog naar de hel bonjourt dan zal ik oprecht blij zijn hem nooit 100 gevolgd te hebben want dat spoort hij niet nog los van de zaak louwes hij mag zijn eigen crap uitleggen
743784 het uit huis plaatsen van een jongen die thuis niet meer te handhaven was en aan lager wal en aan de drank geraakte op latere leeftijd
743785 heel simpel omdat god niet bestaat maar een verzinsel is van stammen die la joegoslavi avant la lettre af en toe hun buurstammen beroofden en uitmoordden mannen vrouwen en kinderen behalve de maagden want daar kon je nog wat mee
743786 die louwes kan mooi kletsen in zijn eigen verhaal maar hij heeft het vast wel gedaan want hij zit niet voor niets achter slot en grendel
743787 uiteindelijk komt het er op neer dat je een geloofsstap moet maken en moet besluiten wie je gelooft ernest of micha l maurice of het o m

743789 zijn psychiatrische aandoening in combinatie met alcohol gebrek aan zelfbeheersing
743790 wie zegt dat die bloedvlek op de blouse een afdruk van een mes is
743791 gelet op het vorenstaande laat het hof bij de beoordeling van deze zaak dit mes buiten beschouwing daarom behoeven de wijze van veiligstelling van het mes p1 en de daarmee gehouden sorteerproef geen verdere bespreking
743792 ik hecht alleen waarde aan wetenschappelijk onderzoek en wetenschappelijk bewijs
743793 dan vraag ik wie mij kan uitleggen waarom dat initi le bloedspatje op de kraag van de weduwe het bewijs zou zijn van het feit dat e l de moord heeft gepleegd
743794 quote is dat dna spatje een soort foto die laat zien dat e l de weduwe aan het vermoorden is je bent niet alleen evil maar ook nog eens compleet emotioneel gestoord je houdt volstrekt geen rekening met het gegeven dat het hier gaat om een koelbloedige afslachting van een mens en dat de aangetroffen sporen op blouse en onder haar linker en rechternagels exclusief haar stem vertegenwoordigde zelfs een foto zou niet voldoende voor je zijn fraude gemanipuleerd je kan niet tippen aan de persoon michael de jong of aan zijn vrouw meike slechter dan slecht ben je totaal verrot
743795 oh hanss ik kan je wel zoenen wat een schat en een aanwinst je bent en wat een intelligente en weldoordachte analyses ik zit altijd te trillen van opwinding als ik je stukjes lees
743796 de aangetroffen sporen op blouse en onder haar linker en rechternagels exclusief haar stem vertegenwoordigde
743797 hanss 21 00 nou nee er zijn geen fotos uiteraard maar wel vingerafdruk ken sporen hoe anders kun je een bloedvlek je van iemand verklaren die op de blouse van een slo wordt aangetroffen anders als zijnde achtergelaten tijdens een geweldsdelict actie je gelooft toch niet echt dat louwes een bloedvlekje van hem aan de binnenkant van de kraag achterkant nek kan achterlaten tijdens een niesbui dat is fysiek onmogelijk het bewijst nog steeds niet dat louwes de moord heeft gepleegd maar wel dat hij tijdens een gewelddadig incident een bloedspoor heeft achtergelaten op kleding van slo samen met de andere bewijsmiddelen maakt het dan redelijk aanneembaar dat hij de moord gepleegd heeft
743798 het bewijst nog steeds niet dat louwes de moord heeft gepleegd maar wel dat hij tijdens een gewelddadig incident een bloedspoor heeft achtergelaten op kleding van slo
743799 samen met de andere bewijsmiddelen maakt het dan redelijk aanneembaar dat hij de moord gepleegd heeft
743800 geen alibi rare route naar huis vreemd aftekenen cursus terwijl zijn collega wel gewoon bleef afslagen mysterieus missen telefoon wordt naast huis slo genoteerd te kort gesprek om zakelijke info door te kunnen geven dna op verschillende geweldsdelict gerelateerde vindplaatsen vingerafdruk op deur kennelijk leugenachtige verklaringen bloed louwes op kleding van slo die niet op een andere manier dan bij fysieke overdracht kunnen plaatsvinden opvallende handelingen na de moord dna op vingernagels slo strafblad merkwaardig gedrag als et en voorzitter stichting het geheel daar gaat het om
743801 ik ben het met je eens dat dat vlekje niet direct door een niesbui daar kan zijn terechtgekomen als is het theoretisch indirect wel mogelijk maar daar gaat het niet om
743802 kom maar op met die civiele vordering waarvoor ik mijn newconomy geld voor opzij moest leggen
743803 kom maar op met die civiele vordering waarvoor ik mijn newconomy geld voor opzij moest leggen

743807 wel zes reacties wat fanatiek dan moeten ze wel ongelijk hebben
743808 als over een tijdje blijkt dat een verkeerde in de bak is gedraaid in de dmz
743809 het feit dat maurice deze hoogstaande mailwisseling heeft laten opnemen in de deventer bieb zegt alles over zijn verstoorde zelfbeeld zijn gebrek aan jc relativeringsvermogen en het niveau waarop zijn beweringen zich bevinden
743810 orang oetang is gewoon fout onzorgvuldig onwetend en dom en sinds wikipedia en breedbandinternet bestaan ook nog lui
743811 ik ben niet pro en ik ben niet tegen louwes
743812 dat is dan dom van ze op basis van wat bekend is kan niemand zeker weten hoe het echt zit
743813 dat is dan dom van ze op basis van wat bekend is kan niemand zeker weten hoe het echt zit
743814 de hr heeft in 2001 een beperkte uitzondering toegelaten voor conclusies van deskundigen het kan immers zo zijn dat het oordeel van een deskundige dat van wezenlijk belang is voor de eerdere veroordeling achteraf niet staande kan worden gehouden omdat nieuw ontwikkelde wetenschappelijke inzichten of methoden het ongelijk van de deskundige duidelijk aantonen of omdat achteraf blijkt dat de deskundige zijn oordeel heeft moeten baseren op een wezenlijk tekortschietend feitenoverzicht
743815 de mogelijkheden moeten worden verruimd door wetenschappelijke en technische ontwikkelingen kun je anders tegen een zaak aankijken in ernstige gevallen moet het mogelijk zijn want onjuiste veroordelingen zijn niet uit te sluiten zegt voorzitter erik van den emster van de raad voor de rechtspraak
743816 quote tevens zal hij en anderen die zowel hem steunen als willens strijden voor een fatsoenlijke rechtsstaat in nederland de strijd doorzetten totdat de waarheid boven tafel is gekomen en de blunders van de diverse professionals als het niet meer is allemaal boven water zijn gekomen
743817 ook begrijp ik echt niet waarom er geen onderzoek naar die broer van mevrouw louwes is gedaan hoewel ik het met je eens ben wat betreft bovenstaande citaat maar vind het wel raar voor iemand die zo overtuigd is van louwes zijn schuld aan de moord op de weduwe wittenberg of
743818 ik denk eerder dat mevrouw louwes zich niet kan voorstelen en niet wil weten dat haar man het gedaan heeft in zoverre is ze gewoon oprecht overtuigd van zijn onschuld
743819 leek schreef jeetje dependance van het ernest louwes weblog peace mensen back to the basic ernets louwes is onschuldig dat ziet toch iedere debiel niet 02 jul 08 13 47
743820 het is een ruim licht huis met houten vloer en pasteltinten op de muur anneke kan er alleen blijven wonen omdat ze vreselijk wordt geholpen met de hypotheek zolang emest vastzit daar is ze blij mee
743821 het is apaideusia om niet te weten waarvan je bewijs kunt verlangen en waarvan niet
743822 er is geen bewijs van fraude dus mag je die niet veronderstellen dus hoeft het ook niet onderzocht te worden
743823 domme zinloze beledigingen daar win je het niet mee je bent een trol
743824 een aantal mensen in de vs die ik de engelse vertaling van het programma van reporter van 1 november 2007 heb gestuurd begreep er niets van dat ik daarover in nederland bij een strafrechter veroordeeld ben dat zou in de vs direct in conflict zijn met de grondwet het artikel over de vrijheid van meningsuiting
743825 ivm de zomergast plasterk dat is n van de hele bubs politici die niet n kamervraag heeft gesteld ten aanzien van de aantoonbare leugens van de politie in de deventer moordzaak ook niet trouwens over het gruwelijke gefantaseerde dienderverhaal van de puttense moordzaak enz dus liegen wordt getolereerd in moord en strafzaken door deze regering en hoofdelijk per politicus
743826 het aantal personen dat in het onderzoek bij de dmz door het hks is
743827 ik vind het niet erg als mensen andere opvattingen hebben en ook niet als ze wat weglopen van de inhoud van het weblog als de actualiteit erom vraagt maar dan dient men zich wel aan wat randvoorwaarden te houden en ook ervoor te blijven zorgen dat wat men zegt aan de ene kant een bepaalde vorm van beschaafdheid in acht houdt en geen persoonlijke aanval op iemand is en aan de andere kant interessant en toegankelijk voor de andere lezers moet zijn als men zelf graag over een groot aantal onderwerpen aan het woord is kan men een eigen weblog elders beginnen
743828 eens in de zoveel maanden wil ik nog wel eens een kijkje nemen aan de overkant in de keuken van freeforum
743829 overigens pro of anti louwes doet er niet toe of men wel of niet mag posten
743830 de meeste arrondissementsparketten en ressortsparketten onderdelen hebben een groot aantal belangrijke primaire bedrijfsprocessen beschreven in vastgestelde en elektronisch gepubliceerde procesbeschrijvingen

743833 velde je bent een leugenaar het klopt niet wat je daar schrijft lees de stukken nogmaals
743834 is ernest louwes schuldig aan het misdrijf waarvoor hij al jaren vastzit of is er een andere dader
743835 en wat er dan in die stukken staat dat in tegenspraak zou zijn met de aangehaalde beweringen van velde dat ga je uiteraard niet vermelden want aan bronverwijzingen doet hier niemand
743836 het niet uitkomen van mijn voorspellingen bewijst helemaal niet dat mijn inzichten van toen niet klopten wel dat de doofpotten veel steviger dichtgelast zitten dan velen toen dachten
743837 kinderen hebben hier niets mee te maken zeker niet met september 1999 en daarna doet niets er meer toe toch
743838 1 op de blouse bevindt zich een gebied dat doordrenkt is met els dna hetgeen op zich niet verdacht is integendeel
743839 hoe slordiger er met die blouse is omgesprongen hoe belastender dat is voor louwes
743840 1 op de blouse bevindt zich een gebied dat doordrenkt is met els dna hetgeen op zich niet verdacht is integendeel
743841 opnieuw van bloedvlekje 10 is bekend dat dit een volledig louwesprofiel bevat met een percentage uitkomst van 1 op 1 miljard
743842 ik stelde eerder bijvoorbeeld dat er geen sprake is van lege bloedvlekken vlekjes de omschrijving in een dergelijk geval is niet dusdanig om er een betrouwbaar profiel uit te kunnen halen
743843 zo zijn bijvoorbeeld aangetroffen dna sporen afkomstig van louwes nog niet eens meegenomen in de diverse procedures omdat de ondergrens van de daarin aangetroffen overeenkomstige kenmerken te laag was
743844 opnieuw van bloedvlekje 10 is bekend dat dit een volledig louwesprofiel bevat met een percentage uitkomst van 1 op 1 miljard
743845 ik stelde eerder bijvoorbeeld dat er geen sprake is van lege bloedvlekken vlekjes de omschrijving in een dergelijk geval is niet dusdanig om er een betrouwbaar profiel uit te kunnen halen
743846 zo zijn bijvoorbeeld aangetroffen dna sporen afkomstig van louwes nog niet eens meegenomen in de diverse procedures omdat de ondergrens van de daarin aangetroffen overeenkomstige kenmerken te laag was
743847 en hij weet ook zeker dat wat hij zag greepsporen waren die op de blouse waren gekomen toen de ribben gebroken werden jammer echter dat er geen enkele dokter is die bevestigt dat het geloofwaardig is dat iemand als louwes met de kracht van zijn armen vrijwel alle ribben van de weduwe een vrouw van 60 brak
743848 de veronderstelde of vermeende slechte behandeling maakt het alleen nog maar opmerkelijker en betekenisvoller dat er wel sporen van louwes zijn bewaard gebleven dat er geen vervuiling is met weer ander sporenmateriaal e d
743849 hoe slordiger er met die blouse is omgesprongen hoe belastender dat is voor louwes
743850 is dat niet logisch naarmate er slordiger mee omgesprongen was valt immers aan te nemen dat er oorspronkelijk nog meer material van die verdachte op moet hebben gezeten en had er bovendien materiaal van derden bij kunnen komen wat ondanks die slordigheid niet gebeurd is zodat aan te nemen is dat er destijds heel wat gebeurd moet zijn om dat materiaal op die blouse te krijgen
743851 triest trouwens dat eikelenboom alleen maar zich laat ondervragen door zijn vriendje bas haan die zijn kritisch vermogen als journalist ook al had verloren toen hij michael de jong en zijn advocaat aan tafel had maar op mijn uitnodiging om al dan niet in het openbaar met elkaar inhoudelijk in discussie te gaan altijd heeft genegeerd
743852 stel ik heb een kledingstuk met op een plek een speekseldruppeltje
743853 het is goed aan te duiden met een ander voorbeeld
743854 hoe meer mensen met hun schoenen door de flat zijn gelopen hoe beter het bewijs
743855 stel ik heb een kledingstuk met op een plek een speekseldruppeltje
743856 lijkt me leuker een interview te lezen met onbenullen die menen een reeds veroordeelde nog dieper in de stront te moeten trappen middels het uiten van allerlei beweringen
743857 quote uitspraak van eikelenboom dat is heel belastend voor louwes maar dat niet alleen ik heb het y chromosomaal profiel van louwes vergeleken met dat van de klusjesman die twee mannen hebben stomtoevallig niet n overeenkomst in hun profiel het is dus een keiharde uitsluiting van de klusjesman ik vind het dan ook schandalig dat sommige mensen die man nog steeds als moordenaar aanwijzen als de klusjesman veroordeeld zou zijn dan zou ik persoonlijk de zaak bij de commissie posthumus aandragen dat zou namelijk met deze gegevens pas echt een dwaling zijn reactie demo dat komt omdat eikelenboom geen verschil weet te maken tussen verificatie en falsificatie quote hoezo dat dan weer het is me onduidelijk waar je op doelt en volgens mij bevat het citaat nou juist een voorbeeld van het tegendeel
743858 demo zegt met zoveel woorden dat eikelenboom het verschil niet ziet tussen echt dader dna en door fraude aangebracht dna uit wangslijm afgenomen en eventueel door bloed van louwes afgenomen
743859 het zal wel want jij zegt het het gaat niet om waarneembaarheid maar om werkelijkheid
743860 quote wel merk ik op dat via het y chromosomaal onderzoek de eventuele betrokkenheid van de helft van de nederlandse bevolking niet wordt onderzocht ach ach waar haal je die onzin nu weer vandaan het aangetroffen louwesmateriaal op onder de linker en rechternagels van de weduwe en wederom van niemand anders kan overeenkomen met 3 van de west europese mannelijke bevolking effe een pietsie anders dan de helft van nl
743861 lijkt me leuker een interview te lezen met onbenullen die menen een reeds veroordeelde nog dieper in de stront te moeten trappen middels het uiten van allerlei beweringen
743862 de afwezigheid van dna van persoon x veronderstelt niet de afwezigheid van de persoon x zelf dus heeft eikelenboom niets te bewijzen verifi ren over de afwezigheid van wie dan ook
743863 14 het mes dat blijkens de bewijsmiddelen als het moordwapen is aangemerkt bleek nog voor nader onderzoek beschikbaar te zijn de officier van justitie te zwolle heeft het mes desgevraagd ter beschikking van het nfi gesteld opdat kon worden nagegaan of het thans met bedoelde nieuwe technieken mogelijk is dna houdend materiaal op het mes zichtbaar te maken zulk onderzoek vergt enige tijd
743864 tegen die achtergrond roept het thans bekend geworden gegeven dat op het mes ook met de meest geavanceerde technieken zoals die thans beschikbaar zijn geen enkel lichaamsspoor is te vinden dat tot het slachtoffer valt te herleiden
743865 14 het mes dat blijkens de bewijsmiddelen als het moordwapen is aangemerkt bleek nog voor nader onderzoek beschikbaar te zijn de officier van justitie te zwolle heeft het mes desgevraagd ter beschikking van het nfi gesteld opdat kon worden nagegaan of het thans met bedoelde nieuwe technieken mogelijk is dna houdend materiaal op het mes zichtbaar te maken zulk onderzoek vergt enige tijd

743867 maarrr zoals in de dmz is er dus wel dna van louwes achtergebleven van niemand anders alleen van hem
743868 t z t zullen die op een originele wijze worden duidelijk gemaakt
743869 met sint juttemis als de kalveren op het ijs dansen
743870 siem je past ook wel bij het clubje prdvries eikeleboom bas haan en nog wat van die klootzakken
743871 t z t zullen die op een originele wijze worden duidelijk gemaakt
743872 wie het interview leest in koud bloed met die man eikelenboom die beseft dat het daderschap van ernest louwes heel wat minder onwaarschijnlijk is geworden
743873 maar wel een ruggegraat dat kun jij niet zeggen in je zwijm bij de winnaars te horen
743874 wie het interview leest in koud bloed met die man eikelenboom die beseft dat het daderschap van ernest louwes heel wat minder onwaarschijnlijk is geworden
743875 ik ben n van de belangrijkste discipelen op het log van maurice de hond
743876 als louwes met de neus om hoog gaat zijn de laatste woorden
743877 gewoon gore roddel waar een volbloed crimineel met bloed aan zijn handen gebruik van wil maken
743878 wie het interview leest in koud bloed met die man eikelenboom die beseft dat het daderschap van ernest louwes heel wat minder onwaarschijnlijk is geworden
743879 dan is die twijfel over ernest louwes denk ik een heel stuk minder geworden
743880 maar ik geef niet op en zal net zo lang doorgaan tot ik er bij doodval
743881 op propaganda van de staat der nederlanden zit geen auteursrecht
743882 perfecte precizering van onterechte projectie reden waarom jij de terechte veroordeling van louwes dan ook niet begrijpt bij gebrek aan intelligentie
743883 grote bek maar als je voor me staat 100 dat je schreeuwt om je moeder
743884 plus de de reactie van maurice zijn financier daarop the good old boys
743885 siem jan en anderen ik kan me voorstellen dat jullie het laten staan van crap niet begrijpen maar de discussievervuiling is al tijden aan de gang met name bij monde van onze gristen hanss een paul een wim een watson gotspe want de echte watson was slim en zo nog wat engbekjes de kunst die wij moeten kunnen aanleren is eroverheen lezen en zo de discussie zinvol te houden daarom laat ik ze nu staan kijk even terug en lees je eigen inbreng wb de trollen en leer je les voor morgen geen aandacht maakt ze nog gekker dan wel aandacht en als niemand meer reageert op crap dan is het makkelijker voor mij om het kaf van het koren te scheiden snappez vous geplaatst door ada donderdag 5 juni 2008 om 1 38

743887 t is wah ik heb nog niets gezegd vandaag maar eens met al het voorgaande
743888 t is wah de blouse lijkt wel gewassen in een badkuip met dna van louwes
743889 keej t is wah maar hebben jullie nog wat nieuws te melden en zie dat niet als kritiek hoor
743890 opvallend is dat zodra je je teksten niet vanaf het net kopieert het ontaardt in wartaal
743891 t is wah ik werd helemaal niet door hanns genoemd
743892 meine volksgenossen und andere idioten das offenbare ministerium hat immer recht
743893 zoveel dna bewijs als in de deventer moorzaak kom je zelden tegen
743894 ik wist toen nog niet bij wie dat dna profiel hoorde ik wist wel dat die persoon een groot probleem zou gaan krijgen met justitie
743895 dat was een verrassing voor mij want ik ging er vanuit dat louwes onschuldig was
743896 je zou je bijna gaan aansluiten bij het gewapend verzet
743897 heb heel wat te vertellen wat nog nimmer in een krant heeft gestaan
743898 als je wilt dan kan ik wel een plekje voor je regelen zodat je deskundige hulp krijgt die vind je namelijk niet op forums
743899 en als je echt iets wil leren over iemand die een relatie met een gedetineerde heeft dan mag je wel een poosje meedraaien met mij
743900 geloof dat een kleine groep oplettende toegewijde burgers de wereld kan veranderen het is altijd zo geweest
743901 het feit dat je ega een ex hellsangel is zegt alles uitgestoten want lidmaatschap is for life ook tijdens detentie uiteraard
743902 het feit dat jij een verkrachtingslachtoffer van je inmiddels ondertrouw ega publiekelijk uitmaakt voor hoer zegt nog meer ook over jezelf
743903 je weet niet eens waarom je een hoofd op je romp hebt of waarom je ledematen aan je lijf hebt

743912 helder schreef dhr eikelenboom voormalig medewerker van het nfi impliciet zijn echtgenote moet als een schoenmaker bij zijn leest blijven de man preekt voor eigen parochie hij profileeert zichzelf niet alleen op ing niveau als een praktische dna deskundige maar ook daar dient hij zich van te onthouden als een politie rechercheur

743918 meine volksgenossen und andere idioten das offenbare ministerium hat immer recht
743919 het dna op de blouse en onze lezing van het telefoonverhaal bewijzen dat hij er wel was om de weduwe te vermoorden
743920 niet zeuren hij was er en hij heeft het gedaan punt
743921 wat louis in het verleden allemaal heeft uitgespookt doet helemaal niet ter zake i v m de bolhaar zaak
743922 dat jij jouw kant van het verhaal zoals je het nu ziet wereldkundig wilt maken is jouw goed recht maar het is geen argument om de bekendheid van de naam ernest louwes te misbruiken om jouw weblog onder die naam voort te zetten ernest louwes heeft jou niets misdaan want hij vroeg nooit om jouw betrokkenheid suggestie een nieuw weblog is zo gemaakt en dat draai je tijdelijk simultaan met dit weblog totdat het iedereen duidelijk is dat hier niet meer kan worden gepost maar alleen op je nieuwe weblog met de suggestie url deventermurdershewrote web log nl is nog vrij gebruik dan dit weblog als archief omdat je wel degelijk dit log ooit startte met de overtuiging dat ernest onschuldig is en omdat velen hun mening hier hebben achtergelaten waaronder ik en opdat de mensen kunnen zien welke ontwikkeling je hebt meegemaakt gedurende de tijd ik zou het heel karaktervol van je vinden als je die stap durft te zetten en je kunt dan op deze slapende site een link plaatsen naar je nieuwe weblog dat je gewoon murder she wrote kunt noemen met dezelfde opmaak en hier en daar wat aanpassingen
743923 zoals ik al eerder aangegeven heb was en is het nooit mijn bedoeling geweest om een soort strijd aan te gaan met het om
743924 ik ben nog steeds in het rijke bezit van een veiliggestelde mail waarin maurice de h uitlegt dat hij middels de opoffering van michael de jong hoopte aandacht te genereren voor de onschuld van louwes gekoppeld aan de schiedammeruitkomst
743925 het kan allemaal hanss maar ik verdom het waarom omdat ik me genaaid voel genaaid omdat louwes al die tijd al weet wat hij gedaan heeft en desondanks door ruiten en riemen gaat om mensen zijn evangelie te laten verkondigen ik blijf waar ik ben onderschat mij niet misschien komt er ooit een moment dat ook jij zult zeggen ada had gelijk tot die tijd zal ik tegenwicht bieden aan louwes verhaal akte geplaatst door ada vrijdag 6 juni 2008 om 0 27
743926 jij bent veel te veel betrokken bij deze zaak alsof het deel uitmaakt van je persoonlijke leven en dat is niet gezond
743927 wat louis in het verleden allemaal heeft uitgespookt doet helemaal niet ter zake i v m de bolhaar zaak
743928 je zou nog eens met anneke moeten praten en haar moeten vragen waarom ze 100 overtuigd is van haar mans onschuld en waar ze dat op baseert als vrouwen onder elkaar
743929 wil jij beweren dan dat het voor jou anders is geplaatst door ada vrijdag 6 juni 2008 om 1 05
743930 ada dat is nu het verschil tussen jou en mij ik heb nooit verlangd om persoonlijk contact met e l te willen hebben
743931 jazeker want ook al volg ik het allemaal nog op de voet ik heb geen weblog en het beheer erover en ik kan me voorstellen dat dat wel ns moeilijk in te passen is in je persoonlijke gezins leven

743934 en hanss weet daar alles van elders postte hij eerder al zoiets als goede leiders zorgen eerst voor een crisis
743935 nee hanss niemand kan je overtuigen dat michael de jong onschuldig is en dat de veroordeelde el voor de moord op weduwe wittenberg schuldig is
743936 zoals wat ik weet over adas gezinsleven omdat ada dat zelf op het internet heeft gezet en ik zeg helemaal niets verkeerds over adas gezinsleven behalve dat ik me kan voorstellen dat je in combinatie daarmee moet kiezen wat belangrijker is je gezinsleven of constant hier opletten wat er gebeurt
743937 laat je niet door wie dan ook misleiden en onderzoek zelf de dingen
743938 ik zeg je dat ik volledig onafhankelijk van maurice opereer en er is geen overleg ik overleg ook niet met wim dankbaar en ben volledig onafhankelijk
743939 hanss ik vindt siem juist een eerlijke vrouw en ook ada

743944 wicher en hanss hebben wel iets van elkaar weg staan er allebei nagenoeg alleen voor ondanks hun support in de dmz dieptriest
743945 nadrukkelijk gun ik jou het laatste woord zoals je een pathologische leugenaar met veel tact en geduld moet behandelen totdat het inzicht doordringt hoe schadelijk het voortdurend beliegen en bedriegen van medemensen is of heb je mijn filmpje onder
743946 of heb je mijn filmpje onder nog niet gezien het slaat ook op jou
743947 ben ik strafbaar als ik mijn mening verkondig dat ik inderdaad mdj aanzie als degene die als laatste de weduwe in leven heeft gezien

743954 hoe is het met robert h rchner mochten jullie een kaartje voor hem overhebben over 4 maandjes zit hij al een jaar in polen
743955 ik weet nog goed dat de arrestatie van ernest louwes op de voorpagina van de telegraaf stond hokje in mijn geheugen toen zei ik al gods on mo ge lijk vraag het mn toenmalige partner zij zal het beamen en ik ben nooit gestopt dat te denken wat er ook verder ter berde is gebracht voor mij is ernest onschuldig ik blijf bij mijn eerste gedachte ooit back then in 1999
743956 die god moet een zeer vooruitziende blik gehad hebben toen hij de hel bedacht
743957 heb jij hanss een antwoord op de vraag die mij al de hele dag op de lippen brandt vandaag in de telegraaf een uitgebreid verhaal over de schande van putten en terecht daar is echt veel fout gegaan maar dat is al een tijdje bekend ook de advocaat van ernest louwes gj knoops was daarbij nadrukkelijk aan het woord niet n keer echter sprak hij over de dmz in een vergelijking met putten complot gekluns whatever niet n keer waarom is dat denk jij geplaatst door ada zaterdag 7 juni 2008 om 23 35

743966 jongens het is genoeg geweest met die poppenkast ik ben de dader sorry voor alle overlast
743967 wel vertelde een getuige een enge man te hebben gezien rond 21 40 op 23 09 1999 die aan de beschrijving voldeed van hoe mdj er ten tijde van de moord uitzag
743968 maar ik heb goed nieuws de komende tijd ben ik even weg dus dan zijn jullie van mij verlost
743969 betrokkene is een intellectueel begaafde vrouw bij wie sprake is van een complexe pathologische persoonlijkheidsstructuur in de zin van een persoonlijkheidsstoornis deze wordt gekenmerkt door rigide rationele controle en afweer waarmee de onderliggende diepgaande onzekerheid maar vooral extreme zelfhaat het resultaat van vroeggestoorde hechting verhuld blijft achter een fa ade van ogenschijnlijke normaliteit
743970 er zal nog heel veel gebeuren met een zekere afloop alleen weten we niet hoe lang het duurt
743971 tevens diverse verzekeringspolissen opvallend hierbij is dat er een paar vermogensgroeiplan polissen zijn afgesloten bij de waa waarvoor respectievelijk
743972 louwes verteld dat hij deze maand sept99 dan wel in juni juli van dit jaar van mw wittenburg een sleutel had gekregen van het woonhuis deze had hij gekregen voor het geval er iets met haar zou gebeuren
743973 amer donderdag 15 mei 2008 om 10 11 betekent dit dat financiele steun waar mevrouw louwes het over heeft in esta al voor de moord was begonnen niet waarschijnlijk want louwes had toen nog gewoon een goeie baan met een flink salaris
743974 nou zeg dat wel half nederland had dus rond 1997 een motief om rijke weduwen te vermoorden omdat ze allemaal en een aflossingsvrije hypotheek hadden en een levensverzekering op basis van beleggingen best eng hoor zijn er statistieken van dat er toen opeens veel meer rijke mensen zijn vermoord of afgeperst dan ervoor toen de gewone annu teitenhypotheek nog in de mode was
743975 heb ik niks mee te maken ze kunnen wel zo veel beweren
743976 hoe dan was dat niet een misverstandje waar in een eerdere discussie zelfs jan calis je over terechtwees je haalde twee datums door elkaar
743977 om dat te objectiveren en inzichtelijk te maken hebben we het werk van die technische recherche met betrekking tot het werk op de plaats delict afgezet tegen de voorschriften die er toen golden de forensisch technische normen uit 1997
743978 de blouse s12 is op de pd bemonsterd met micro sporen folie de blouse had van het lichaam verwijderd moeten worden op de pd en gedroogd aan de lucht naar het gerechtelijk lab verzonden moeten worden
743979 a directive is a legal instrument which is binding as to the result to be achieved upon each member state to whom it is addressed however the national authorities are left the choice of form and methods to achieve their objectives directives may be addressed to individual several or all member states
743980 a guideline is a community document which is either referred to in the legislative framework as intended to fulfil a legal obligation laid down in the community pharmaceutical legislation or considered to provide advice to applicants or marketing authorisation holders competent authorities and or other interested parties on the best or most appropriate way to fulfil an obligation laid down in the community pharmaceutical legislation in the case of scientific guidelines these may relate to specific scientific issues reflecting a harmonised eu approach and based on the most up to date scientific knowledge
743981 wel een beetje hoge lasten meneer louwes gaat dat wel goed denkt u gezien uw salaris
743982 o geen probleem ik heb een rijke weduwe in mijn klantenkring die ben ik al een beetje aan het rippen en ze heeft toch niks in de gaten
743983 ok dan geen probleem komt allemaal goed wij gaan akkoord
743984 1 de rekening werd 14 oktober geopend 2 pas op de 15de werd er tegen sluitingstijd gestort 3 de bankmedewerkster verklaarde lees zelf maar dat louwes er die morgen was de 14de dus
743985 amer 15 oktober was een zondag hoe weet jij trouwens hoe laat l geld stortte en ook nog wel hoe laat uiterst verdacht allemaal
743986 kwatta donderdag 15 mei 2008 om 22 39 house gezien sluit goed aan op het mdh logje over medische fouten wie of wat is house gaan we lekker vaag en incrowd doen zonder bronvermelding zonder enige achting voor de lezer je zit hier op een openbaar forum te schrijven wist je dat niet geplaatst door ruud harmsen vrijdag 16 mei 2008 om 9 51
743987 en sinds wanneer kan een minderjarige verzekeringneemster zijn m b t het afsluiten van dergelijke polissen anders dan zijnde begunstigde
743988 hij wisttoen nogniet wat wijnu allemaal wel weten dat ze vermoord zou worden
743989 dit is niet helemaal waar als je contant geld stort op een girorekening dan staat het er wel degelijk al direct op dat kun je zien door na het storten met de giromaat te kijken wat je saldo is of desnoods vervolgens thuis in te loggen op mijn postbank ik heb daar zelf inmiddels ook de nodige ervaring in het is wel zo dat de volgende dag als boekdatum op je afrekening staat
743990 weliswaar is vvaa niet hetzelfde als waa maar dan nog je weet net zo min als wij of en in hoeverre die verzekeringen bij louwes aan een hypotheek gekoppeld zitten zaten
743991 het vermogensgroeiplan is met name geschikt om te sparen voor de aflossing van uw deels aflossingsvrije hypotheek en biedt u veel vrijheid zo is er tijdens de looptijd ruimte om de einddatum of premiehoogte te veranderen daarnaast zijn er diverse mogelijkheden om risicobescherming bij overlijden of arbeidsongeschiktheid in te bouwen de adviseur van vvaa kan het vermogensgroeiplan afstemmen op uw persoonlijke situatie

744008 zij vertelde mij dat een derden rekening een zogenaamde zakelijke rekening was en dat daarvoor toch echt een uittreksel nodig was op mijn verzoek heeft zij nog navraag gedaan bij een andere bankmedewerker maar deze bevestigde haar standpunt het feit dat het niet mogelijk bleek om een bankrekening te openen irriteerde mij enigszins achteraf besefte ik ook wel dat dit mede met mijn eigen onkunde te maken had ik wist voordien namelijk niet dat voor een zakelijke rekening een uittreksel van het handelsregister vereist was ik had nog nooit met zon kwestie te maken gehad het ging om een bedrag van 20 000 gulden en ik had geen zin om zon bedrag mee naar huis te nemen de medewerkster adviseerde mij toen om een rekening op mijn eigen naam te openen maar ik vertelde haar dat ik dat wat vreemd vond omdat het andermans geld betrof uiteindelijk stelde zij toen voor om een zogenaamde beheerrekening te openen dit was weliswaar een rekening met mijn naam maar waar het woord beheerrekening op vermeld stond dit vond ik een goede oplossing want dit leek mij toch bijna zoiets als hetgeen ik had bedoeld zo is de rekening dan ook geopend met de duidelijk vermelding dat het een beheerrekening betrof het geld heb ik hier vervolgens op gestort
744009 goed dat je het kletsverhaal van louwes er nog eventjes bijplaatste toch grappig dat jij jullie al naar gelang het moment dat het uitkomt louwes dan weer als kundig of onkundig ziet de man was fiscaal jurist nota bene en bij zijn vorige werkgever betrokken bij bewindvoering en vermogensbeheer geplaatst door maandag 19 mei 2008 om 2 36

744032 gelukkig staan we als nederlanders niet helemaal alleen met onze door en door corrupte en incompetente ambtenaren
744033 de moeder en broer van christel ambrosius hebben al laten weten dat zij niet geloven dat dit de oplossing is zij blijven herman dubois en wilco viets zien als de echte daders en ze hadden altijd al gedacht dat er een derde man bij was geweest hier kan nataschja van der stelt zich mooi bij aansluiten heeft zij ook een probleem minder net als al die andere complotdenkers
744034 het is het thema van mijn boek moordenaars op zwarte kousen mensen die ergens van overtuigd zijn kun je niet met feiten van de wijs brengen die blijven geloven tegen beter weten in lennaert nijgh al die gelovigen hebben het leven van de families dubois en viets in de afgelopen veertien jaar tot een hel gemaakt
744035 de moeder en broer van christel ambrosius hebben al laten weten dat zij niet geloven dat dit de oplossing is zij blijven herman dubois en wilco viets zien als de echte daders en ze hadden altijd al gedacht dat er een derde man bij was geweest hier kan nataschja van der stelt zich mooi bij aansluiten heeft zij ook een probleem minder net als al die andere complotdenkers
744036 puur het bekend worden van de identiteit van de spermadonor kan geen verandering brengen in de verhoudingen
744037 we dachten altijd al dat er nog een derde persoon bij betrokken was
744038 viets en dubois hebben indertijd onafhankelijk van elkaar een volledige bekentenis afgelegd waarbij details werden vermeld die alleen de dader of daders konden weten
744039 herman dubois kent wel de vader van de verdachte deze heeft gisteren in een persoonlijk gesprek met dubois zijn excuses aangeboden voor wat zijn zoon hem en wilco viets heeft aangedaan de man was zeer van zijn stuk door het nieuws dat het dna van zijn zoon matcht met de gevonden sporen op het lichaam van christel ambrosius
744040 laat ik iets vertellen over de puttense moordzaak wat niet zo bekend is
744041 ambrosius is niet van plan de naderende rechtzaak op de voet te gaan volgen ik ben vorige keer ook maar n dag geweest toen had ik wel al snel door dat ze niet de juiste personen te pakken hadden
744042 als je wil frauderen moet je dat als het enigszins mogelijk is in je eentje doen
744043 hela wat doet deed dat geld op een rekening op jouw naam
744044 hij zal het wel gedaan hebben want kijk eens hoe hij de nalatenschap van de weduwe beheerde
744045 je hebt mij toch ook niet horen zeggen dat oa de rechercheurs destijds misschien een verkeerde insteek hadden
744046 je hebt mij toch ook niet horen zeggen dat oa de rechercheurs destijds geen verkeerde insteek hadden
744047 ik ben niet negatief als ik zeg dat geen enkele ziekte genezen kan worden door de reguliere medici negatief vind ik dat omdat ziekte taboe is en artsen heilig bijna niemand deze deplorabele staat van de medische wqetenschap wil herkennen ik praat uit ervaring en ben beroepsoefenaar van de medische kunst maar dan de kunst van het genezen niet van manupileren van levende wezens let op marc is een goed voorbeeld van wat ik bedoel tumoren kunnen worden verwijderd met homeotherapie wat dat betreft is het vertrouwen van de meeste mensen in artsen een onderdeel van hun syndroom van verering van autoriteiten ook maurice wist niets van materia medica anders had hij zoon niet het risico laten lopen nog steeds zou marc trouwens baat kunnen heb ben bij een klassiek homeopatische behandeling hoewel hoe langer hij wacht des te moeilijker het wordt om resultaten te krijgen maar marc is daar absoluut niet in geinteresseerd
744048 godzijdank heeft de zoon van maurice common sense way to go mark types als antonius goor ius zetten de homeopathie compleet te kakken gestoord als zij zijn ik zal nooit zeggen dat homeopathie keloel is maar am is een ziek gestoord engbekje waarvan akte
744049 het scenario dat de werkelijke plaats delict christels ouderlijk huis was is voor mij wel minder plausibel geworden maar niet geheel van de baan het dna greepspoor op haar spijkerbroek en zijn melktandje alsmede de leugenachtige verklaringen van bas daarover ondersteunen dat scenario ook het feit dat omas huisje afgesloten was er geen sporen van braak of inbraak waren en de reservesleutel keurig op het haakje aan de schuur hing wijzen ook in die richting wat te denken van het netjes achtergelaten lijk laarsjes ernaast jasje eroverheen is dat logischer voor ron p of wellicht bas die oma de schok van de nare aanblik wil besparen bas en zijn moeder kunnen als geen ander hebben geweten dat oma van 4 tot 6 afwezig was en waarom rijdt christel naar oma als zij niet thuis is had ze niet eerst even kunnen bellen en waarom willen bas en moeder zo graag dat viets en dubois de daders zijn vinden zij zichzelf betere speurneuzen dan peter r en waarom gaat bas willebrord frequin met een hakbijl te lijf als die hem gewoon wat vragen wil stellen nu ja dan hoef je die in elk geval niet te beantwoorden vraag is dan wel hoe bas aan het sperma van ron p is gekomen toegegeven ook het nu bekende gedrag van ron p is verdacht vlak na de moord uit putten verdwijnen en dna afgifte weigeren kende bas en hij elkaar de eerste berichten zijn dat hij christel niet kende ook bij nataschja was dan wel een belltje gaan rinkelen zij kent hem ook niet terwijl ze alle vriendejes met elkaar bespraken ron p kan het als insluiper goed gedaan hebben maar hoe heeft hij het huis weer afgesloten had hij een tip waar de sleutel hing of heeft hij eerst de schuur onderzocht is christel overvallen tijdens het naar binnengaan of heeft zij hem gestoord bij de inbraak of was zij al binnengegaan zonder de deur weer af te sluiten besloot hij toen om de inbraak te staken en haar in plaats daarvan te verkrachten en te vermoorden maar niet klaargekomen in christel dat is dan weer typisch ik hoop maar dat ronnie gaat bekennen dan krijgen we antwoord op deze vragen

744055 dat is veel geld voor iemand die tevens een tophypotheek heeft is dit het motief heeft de weduwe dit ontdekt

744060 net zo goed kan ik zeggen dat wat ene mia bijdraagt die niet eens mia heet maar die maar wat laf onder een schuilnaam loopt te roepen onzin is
744061 anderzijds is het pas dwaas dat er mensen zijn die na een veroordeling van een persoon jaren doorgaan om die persoon verder aan de schandpaal te nagelen in hun doldrieste haat jegens mensen die het voor die veroordeelde opnemen en met name wegens de doorgedraaide afkeer jegens maurice de hond alleen al de naam maurice de hond doet bij hun al het schuim op de mond ontstaan en in hun redeloze afkeer van zijn persoon komen zij tot de meest wonderlijke verzinsels waar de honden geen brood van lusten
744062 eind 1996 overlijdt de financiele ruggengraat van het echtpaar het brein het inzicht de onafhankelijke denker zij die overblijft is intens verdrietig en weet zich feitelijk geen raad met alle centjes die er blijken te zijn
744063 volgens broeders is de schiedammer parkmoord niet de enige rechtszaak waarin het openbaar ministerie onzorgvuldig omsprong met dna bewijs
744064 het zeer ongebruikelijk is dat een medewerker van het nederlands forensisch instituut onderdeel van het ministerie van justitie zich in de pers kritisch uitlaat over de magistratuur
744065 dat is het lastige als je bij het nfi werkt dan ben je ambtenaar in dienst van een grote organisatie en tegelijkertijd wetenschapper nee je moet niet voor de rechter uit spreken maar ik vind wel dat je moet kunnen zeggen wat je wilt
744066 dat het nfi nu publiekelijk op het herzieningsverzoek reageert is hiervan het zoveelste bewijs
744067 het advies van de advocaat generaal aan de hoge raad over deze zaak hij geeft zijn mening over het herzieningsverzoek maar ook over mijn uitlatingen in nrc deze man heeft er alle begrip voor dat ik de gelegenheid heb genomen het een en ander in te brengen tegen het herhaalde verwijt van partijdigheid en vooringenomenheid waarop knoops zijn herzieningsverzoek deels baseerde
744068 beide instellingen hebben een gemeenschappelijk doel en dat is de waarheid boven tafel halen het beginsel van hoor en wederhoor uit de rechtspraak en journalistiek zou ook voor ons moeten gelden als expertise en contra expertise aan dat laatste is bovendien steeds meer behoefte
744069 en indd zoals peter de vries al zei zelf een gefilmde ernest die de weduwe vermoord zal worden gezien als een truuk van het openbaar ministerie niet tegenop te lullen zulke aanhangers
744070 en inderdaad zoals ik al zei zelfs een gefilmde micha l die de weduwe vermoord zal worden gezien als een truuk van geert jan knoops niet tegenop te kletsen zulke aanhangers

744091 zo zie je maar weer rationeel denken en waarnemen is niet voor iedereen weggelegd
744092 ok jij je zin louwes is onschuldig en heeft de moord niet gepleegd dat deed iemand anders misschien michael wel wie weet jij zegt het misschien heeft het om wel gesjoemeld wie weet jij en een aantal andere posters zeggen het nu nog even bewijzen als je jullie het bewijs laat zien geloof ik het zonder bewijs is een aanklacht niet geldig namelijk geplaatst door dhr maandag 5 mei 2008 om 16 37
744093 bij een moordzaak en trouwens bij elk misdrijf willen we graag weten wat het motief is geweest maar het is geen vereiste voor een veroordeling voor moord dat het motief bekend is een dader zou dan gemakkelijk kunnen bereiken dat hij niet voor moord veroordeeld kan worden door nl te ontkennen of althans geen motief kenbaar te maken een mooi voorbeeld is de moord op maja braderic de daders hebben een nagenoeg volledige bekentenis afgelegd en er is geen enkele twijfel maar ze hebben niet kunnen uitleggen waarom maja dood moest het motief is volstrekt onduidelijk het lijkt bijna of er helemaal geen motief was verder als de rechter geen motief kan vaststellen wil dat niet zeggen dat er geen motief was ook een financieel motief kan er dan best wel geweest zijn geplaatst door jan calis maandag 5 mei 2008 om 17 36

744097 hanss christen deze plukte ik zojuist van je van de website van m de h je goeroe deel quote het is vandaag bevrijdingsdag laten we denken aan alle ten onrechte veroordeelden in dit land 05 mei 08 17 44 waar haal je het gestoorde lef vandaan
744098 in principe heer louwes bent u onschuldig tot het tegendeel is bewezen maar aan u is te bewijzen of onze conclusie dat uw dna op de blouse van de vermoorde weduwe wittenberg willemen delict gerelateerd is niet juist is
744099 ik wil dat jullie mij laten zien hoe en wat
744100 je legaatgeefster werd vermoord door e c c j louwes volgens delictgeralteerd dna geen alibi telefoonlocatie vingerafdruk om het over de rest van de toevalligheden het nog maar niet te hebben geplaatst door siem maandag 5 mei 2008 om 23 02
744101 maar wie is siem siem is een pseudoniem en is dus helemaal niemand niemand zegt dus dat mevrouw wittenberg willemen werd vermoord door e c c j louwes laat maar kletsen die siem
744102 maar wat ik niet kan laten rusten is dat een bekende nederlander een intensieve mediacampagne is gestart waarin hij niet alleen onnodige of zelfs onterechte maatschappelijke onrust kweekt door een uitgemaakte zaak voor een dwaling uit te maken maar het bovendien nog presteert om in de naam van rechtvaardigheid en nog zulk moois meer een onschuldige publiekelijk voor de echte dader uit te maken en zo aan de schandpaal te nagelen maurice pleegt het onrecht dat hij vermeent te bestrijden en daar keer ik mij tegen ik wil dat niet onweersproken laten
744103 voor de rechter geldt dat misschien maar jij deed alsof het niet kunnen vaststellen van een motief betekende dat er was vastgesteld dat er geen motief was zodat ik en ieder ander die denkt dat louwes de weduwe om haar geld vermoord heeft daarmee op dit punt tegen de uitspraak van de rechter in gaat ik snap eerlijk gezegd niet zo goed waarom hof den bosch dit stukje redengeving van arnhem heeft laten vallen mij lijkt het niet zo twijfelachtig dat er een financi el motief aan de daad ten grondslag heeft gelegen overigens is jouw verhaal over een mogelijk motief van michael de jong pure speculatie het zijn verzinsels van maurice

744118 hoe zit het met de aannemelijkheid van fraude 1 van vroeg tot laat 2 en van hoog tot laag 3 waar letterlijk tig mensen bij betrokken zouden moeten zijn 4 om de onschuld van n man overeind te kunnen houden misschien dat hanss nog iets weet te vertellen over de wonderbaarlijke goddelijke heilseconomie geplaatst door jan calis donderdag 8 mei 2008 om 3 19
744119 ik hoef er zelf niet beter van te worden maar als de ander er maar beter van wordt dit leven voor de ander geeft op een bijzondere manier vrede en geluk
744120 siem bij mijn weten had het mes niets met de moord te maken en toch werd een hond gevonden die het mes aan louwes toebedeelde dat noem ik klooien in de officiele stukken zal het wel geen klooien genoemd worden en ik denk dat wel degelijk de complete blouse op sporen onderzocht is in 1999 waarschijnlijk zat het vlekje er toen nog niet op want louwes moest immers nog wangslijm afstaan en als pas inderdaad in 2003 de vlek gevonden werd dan worden we wel veroordeeld door een stelletje amateurs wat trouwens sowieso het geval is hadden ze in 1999 nog stront in de ogen mevrouw was gewurgd en dan niet een kraag onderzoeken siem zoals zo vaak lul je weer een heel eind uit je nek geplaatst door wim woensdag 7 mei 2008 om 19 45

744122 er was een kaartenbak deze liet louwes ruimen en er waren wel degelijk patientendossiers de laatste werden in overleg met ter velde vernietigd

744221 waarom het zeker is dat het pv van officier van justitie van der meijden vervalst is
744222 het gaat hier om politieambtenaren die niet werkzaam zijn bij het regiokorps ijsselland dat indertijd het onderzoek in de zogenaamde deventer moordzaak uitvoerde
744223 op elk van de papieren waarop telkens de schrijfproef was uitgevoerd werd een stempel geplaatst om een link te leggen met de verbalisant die de desbetreffende schrijfproef afnam
744224 het enkele feit dat de hiervoor bedoelde politieambtenaren door u niet inmiddels begrijp ik niet alle in levende lijve zijn
744225 de schrijfproeven zijn inderdaad afgenomen door de in uw brieven genoemde politieambtenaren
744226 de betrokken politieambtenaren zijn ook in de priv sfeer door derden personen dus van buiten de zakelijk betrokken kring van politie en justitie over deze schrijfproeven benaderd
744227 amer met het voorstel van justitie tussen aanhalingstekens zijn de briefschrijvers het juist niet eens lees de betreffende passage nog maar eens goed door je moet je vragen en kritiek hierover aan de minister van justitie richten
744228 nog daargelaten dat beetz ze ziet vliegen en niet met een weerlegging van mijn betoog kwam
744229 bovendien blijkt uit jouw commentaar dat je de brief aan de knaw slecht gelezen hebt c q niet begrijpt welke stompzinnege wetenschappers uit de dmz bedoel je eikelenboom die een hbo opleiding heeft als laborant of bedoel je gepromoveerde doctors in de kring rond maurice trouwens af en toe kun je ook bijdragen van professor richard gill zien op de site van maurice
744230 blijkbaar volg je weinig discussies om tot dit soort uitspraken te komen
744231 de afwezigheid van vreemd celmateriaal in de controlemonsters dit ondersteunt
744232 bij belangrijke rechtzaken moet men te rade gaan bij de echte deskundigen niet bij iemand die er iets van weet
744233 via google kom je al een heel eind start b v eens met bijgesloten link maar het kan natuurlijk ook zijn dat je dit soort informatie niet tot je wil nemen omdat de conclusie die je uit een en ander kan trekken je niet aanstaat
744234 het is toch tegenwoordig gemakkelijker geworden om herzieningen heropeningen aan te vragen
744235 om wat voor reden dan ook kunnen sommigen zich daarbij niet neerleggen
744236 het lijkt er sterk dat je belang hebt bij dat financiele motief zeker gezien in combinatie met het in het verleden steeds aanhalen van de

744243 bekend was al dat dit de rekening van de heer en mevrouw louwes betrof
744244 de hele dmz kon wel eens heel erg anders in elkaar zitten dan iedereen van welk ingegraven kamp dan ook denkt
744245 dat heb ik al vaak gedacht en ook uitgesproken amer secunda mickmek en hoe ze zich nog meer allemaal noemt is niet meike maar de dochter van ter velde te bewijzen is het niet maar lijkt wel heel waarschijnlijk
744246 nou die louwes die was wel heel gewiekst bezig erg verdacht allemaal
744247 het wordt immers als bron genoemd in een accountantsrapport dus die accountant zal het dan wel gezien hebben mag ik toch hopen
744248 dat heb ik al vaak gedacht en ook uitgesproken amer secunda mickmek en hoe ze zich nog meer allemaal noemt is niet meike maar de dochter van ter velde te bewijzen is het niet maar lijkt wel heel waarschijnlijk
744249 nu jouw antwoord nog op mijn vraag want dat antwoord ontweek je door een wedervraag
744250 amer met het voorstel van justitie tussen aanhalingstekens zijn de briefschrijvers het juist niet eens lees de betreffende passage nog maar eens goed door je moet je vragen en kritiek hierover aan de minister van justitie richten
744251 ze want amer is vrouw werkzaam in de gezondheidszorg naar eigen zeggen en met een partner met deze of gene psychiatriese aandoening
744252 juist omdat ernest inmiddels niet meer in een cel zit is snelheid minder belangrijk dan de kwaliteit
744253 tja dat heb je in een rechtstaat mensen mogen zich verdedigen tegen beschuldigen erg h
744254 wil je hiermee beweren dat niet de weduwe zelf haar testament heeft gewijzigd en ondertekend bij de notaris in het bijzijn van getuigen maar dat e l dat stiekem heeft gedaan waarom is de notaris dan niet aangeklaagd
744255 waaruit valt af te leiden dat ik dat zou weten jij weet dat blijkbaar geef dan a u b eens even waarop dat weten is gestoeld
744256 ik zie het alweer wensdenken om een manische obsessie te rechtvaardigen alleen maar veronderstellingen waarvan je hoopt dat ze waar zijn maar feiten ho maar op gebied van testamenten en executeurs testamentair ben je blijkbaar even slecht op de hoogte als op juridisch gebied zoals je in de discussies gisteren weer aantoonde
744257 bij de discussies over het veronderstelde financi le motief wordt vaak opgemerkt dat l het geld van de weduwe ook na haar dood nog steeds niet voor het grijpen had in zijn hoedanigheid van executeur testamentair had l immers uiteindelijk toch rekening en verantwoording moeten afleggen en binnen een stichting zijn er weliswaar ruime mogelijkheden tot aftappen maar daar had voorzitter l dan wel te maken gekregen met zijn medebestuurders die had hij in het complot moeten betrekken of op n of andere wijze onwetend moeten houden ik meen dat er enige aanwijzingen zijn dat l aanstuurde op het eerste hoe dat alles ook zij voor een substantieel bedrag golden deze obstakels niet te weten de dfl 400 000 van de levensverzekering dit bedrag namelijk maakte geen deel uit van de nalatenschap van de weduwe het was simpelweg een vordering van de begunstigde de stichting op de verzekeringsmaatschappij ontstaan door het overlijden van de weduwe als executeur testamentair zou l over dit bedrag nooit verantwoording hebben hoeven afleggen als l het vervolgens buiten de boeken van de stichting had gehouden had er vermoedelijk nooit meer een haan naar gekraaid was l bezig met de uitvoering van dit scenario daar heeft het wel alle schijn van had l met betrekking tot de contanten nog enige niet overtuigende argumenten voor het stallen op een priv rekening voor zijn verzoek aan de verzekeraar om met die dfl 400 000 hetzelfde te doen ontbreken die totaal er was geen haast het geld was veilig bij de verzekeringsmaatschappij en de begunstigde was een rechtspersoon ontstaan bij het overlijden van de weduwe waarvoor hij al lang en breed een bankrekening had kunnen regelen dit gedrag van een jurist nota bene kun je niet langer scharen onder extreme klunzigheid maar te goeder trouw dit deugt gewoon niet
744258 de begunstiging van de levensverzekering is al bij leven van de weduwe gewijzigd
744259 louwes heeft dus zelf geprobeerd de begunstiging buiten de weduwe om te wijzigen wat leek te lukken maar toen hij dit geld probeerde op zijn priverekening te laten storten viel hij door de mand
744260 het geld van die verzekering stond op naam van de oogappel als daarin een wijziging had moeten plaatsvinden had de weduwe dit moeten aangeven in haar testament dit heeft ze niet gedaan quote hiermee haal je jezelf onderuit gisteren nl beweerde je nog terecht dat de levensverzekering geen deel uitmaakte van de nalatenschap dat klopt helemaal en je haalt later vanmiddag een passage aan waarin dat duidelijk wordt uitgelegd
744261 ik zei het al je haalt weer september en oktober door elkaar
744262 misschien moet je een tijd met jan calis heen en weer mailen dat hij het je uitlegt hij snapt het namelijk wel
744263 ik zei het al je haalt weer september en oktober door elkaar
744264 daarom ook hebben ze het financi le motief kunnen laten vallen en uiteraard is het mesgedoe van tafel
744265 liever niet je hebt al 10tallen malen laten blijken dat je toch nergens naar luistert je negeert alle weerleggingen en een paar weken of maanden later kom je gewoon toch weer met dezelfde onzin aanzetten elke discussie is bij voorbaat zinloos
744266 het gaat niet om meningen maar om de basale feiten pas daarna zou je eventueel een mening kunnen vormen daar kom jij niet aan toe omdat je consequent weigert je verwrongen idee n over de feiten te laten corrigeren dan is het verder zinloos
744267 ik draai nergens omheen ik heb daar nog helemaal nooit iets over gezegd omdat ik het gewoon niet weet dat kan toch ook niet iedereen hoeft overal een mening over te hebben
744268 ik sa nog steeds achter die uitspraak het gaat niet om personen maar om de rechtstaat
744269 als je zelf geen principes hebt is zon uitspraak misschien moeilijk in te voelen dat kan ik wel begrijpen
744270 nee maar jij misschien wel gezien je warrigheid en totale afsluiting van enig argument feit of uitleg
744271 je bedoelt dagje nsb ada op de website van die partij waren destijds dezelfde soort reakties te lezen als dat ik hier vaak lees
744272 het gaat mij erom dat de constate desinformatie en misleiding die hier gespuid wordt niet onweersproken blijft ten behoeve van lezers die niet schrijven maar die anders zouden kunnen gaan denken dat jullie gelijk hebben
744273 volgens jou zaten er bergen met dna van louwes op de blouse van de weduwe waarom wil je zo graag dat ernest louwes het heeft gedaan welk persoonlijk belang heb je erbij dat hij veroordeeld is als de moordenaar van mevrouw wittenberg willemen en dat ook anneke louwes volgens jou een crimineel is die haar man hielp en helpt in het afdekken van zijn misdaad wat is er op tegen om micha l de jong opnieuw aan de tand te voelen over zijn wetenschap van de moord v rdat het ontzielde lichaam van de weduwe werd aangetroffen wat is er op tegen dat eindelijk iedereen tevreden is over de rechtsgang in de deventer moordzaak hele simpele vragen met graag een simpel antwoord
744274 wat is er op tegen om micha l de jong opnieuw aan de tand te voelen over zijn wetenschap van de moord v rdat het ontzielde lichaam van de weduwe werd aangetroffen wat is er op tegen dat eindelijk iedereen tevreden is over de rechtsgang in de deventer moordzaak hele simpele vragen met graag een simpel antwoord
744275 wat is er op tegen dat eindelijk iedereen tevreden is over de rechtsgang in de deventer moordzaak
744276 hans ik wil niet graag dat hij het gedaan heeft maar louwes steunt maurice dus gaat hij indirekt door met het beschuldigen van michael het kan niet anders dan dat louwes met de weduwe gevochten heeft dat kan jij ook begrijpen we weten dat michael het niet gedaan heeft waarom moet hij zich verantwoorden voor iets waar hij niets mee te maken heeft omdat maurice en louwes dat willen zon rechtsstaat wil ik niet waar onschuldigen zich tegenover andere burgers moeten verantwoorden omdat ze op basis van niets het volgens hen gedaan hebben het is toch allemaal uitgezocht waarom mag michael niet gewoon verder met zijn leven en moet hij door toedoen van louwes en maurice als schuldige aangewezen blijven worden mag toch niet hier in nederland geplaatst door amer vrijdag 18 juli 2008 om 22 07
744277 er zijn zeer harde aanwijzingen dat de weduwe is aangevallen op een andere plek dan waar ze vermoord is aangetroffen deze aanvangsplek kan en zal waarschijnlijk zeer dichtbij de vindplaats van het lijk zijn geweest maar kan theoretisch ook in een ander vertrek van het huis zoals in de hal zijn geweest het eerste fysieke geweld betrof met grote waarschijnlijk een aanval met een slagwapen of anders eventueel een conflict in een kleine ruimte met veel horizontale en verticale obstakels waarschijnlijk is de weduwe gewurgd op de plaats waar ze in eerste instantie is aangevallen en was ze daarbij al versuft of bewusteloos door de harde klap in haar nek bewusteloosheid is niet alleen aannemelijk gezien de ernst van de klap op haar achterhoofd maar ook gezien het feit dat de weduwe zich aantoonbaar niet heeft verweerd tijdens de wurging

744291 jij mijn fenna komt niets te kort in ieder geval diepgang als ik de inhoud van jouw postings zie
744292 ik heb vaker gezegd dat ik micha l het beste gun en zou hij niets met de moord te maken hebben dan zou de politie hem niet in het begin hebben ondervraagd en hem de cautie hebben voorgehouden
744293 van meet af aan hield fenna van mij wegens mijn analytische vermogen wat zij in die mate niet heeft
744294 van meet af aan hield fenna van mij wegens mijn analytische vermogen wat zij in die mate niet heeft
744295 ondertussen zet ik me in voor ernest louwes die nog geen broeder van me is en ik verzeker je indien micha l zich tot mijn god bekeerd dan heb ik hem meer lief dan ernest en zal ik het voor hem opnemen en dat geldt ook voor meike
744296 uit het feit dat de politie mdj in het begin ondervraagd heeft en hem ook nog een keer de tweede bij mijn weten de cautie heeft gegeven niet voorgehouden volgt dat hij wel iets met de moord te maken moet hebben
744297 niet eens meer eenmaal gestolen altijd een dief maar eenmaal verdacht altijd verdacht
744298 waarom werd ineens de aandacht op micha l afgewend en werd de volle aandacht ineens op alleen nog maar ernest louwes gericht en welke logica zit hier in wie dit logisch vindt moet mij dat maar ns uitleggen geplaatst door hans s vrijdag 18 juli 2008 om 22 42
744299 maar je gunt hem niet dat hij van de haak is omdat er gewoon niets tegen hem is en je snapt niet hoe walgelijk dat is dus naar nederlands recht ga je vrij uit ik geef je te denken hoe het met hemels recht zou zitten
744300 re hans s vrijdag 18 juli 2008 om 22 58 fatsoenlijke mensen betrekken zulke dingen niet in een serieuze discussies toen ik nog elders medemoderator was heb ik zulke dingen wel rigoreus geschrapt dan maar geen gevoel voor humor zaterdag 19 juli 2008 om 9 16
744301 en ik ben blij dat aangetoond te hebben door op de bronnen te wijzen
744302 misschien is het een tip voor hanss om michael een gratis luxe uitvoering te geven je weet waar ze te koop zijn van een global messenset als binnenkomertje om zijn zieltje te winnen wie weet bekent ie dan w l en meike ook maar meteen beter meteen alles goed afwerken dus wat dacht je van een luxe pennenset tbv de schrijfproeven en anonieme tuinbriefjes denk wel aan de onvermijdelijke waterbestendigheid van de inkt geplaatst door dhr zaterdag 19 juli 2008 om 10 45
744303 twee mutaties in het tactisch journaal laten echter zien dat de rechercheurs ruiter en oldenhof onder ambtseed op 16 december 2003 een valse verklaring hebben afgegeven
744304 amertje en de politie was niet zo slim louwes te vragen hoe hij aan al die wetenschap kwam zoals gewoonlijk lul je weer een eind uit je nek ga buiten spelen luidt mijn advies
744305 het is alleen niet meer relevant paraplu en het klopt ook niet helaas voor jou
744306 dat hij niet om 20 00 uur gebeld had maar pas om 20 40 zal ook wel toen aan het licht zijn gekomen denk je niet
744307 natuurlijk zijn er dingen gebeurd die niet in de haak zijn in procedurele zin
744308 als je beter kon lezen hoefde je de vraag niet te stellen dus speciaal voor jou rechtspraak nl en meer gericht mijn eigen overzichtje van de vonnissen die aldaar aan te treffen zijn in verband met de deventer moordzaak
744309 louwes kon niet weten dat die paraplu uit het huis van de weduwe kwam wat duidt op daderkennis ja want voordat louwes haar opeens vermoordde was hij nog nooooit in haar huis geweest bovendien verstoppen mensen parapluies gewoonlijk dat is bekend want die zijn geheim
744310 louwes kon ook niet weten dat de weduwe het bedraf waarover louwes zou hebben gebeld op een memoblaadje had geschreven het had net zo goed een kladblok kunnen zijn geweest de weduwe heeft louwes niet verteld waar ze het bedrag op heeft geschreven daar was het gesprekje veel te kort voor dat duidt dus ook op daderkennis kul
744311 naar de letter heeft amer ongelijk dat er een financieel motief werd vastgesteld door het hof
744312 bij de strafoplegging door het gerechtshof te arnhem is in aanmerking genomen dat aan het bewezenverklaarde feit financi le motieven van de verdachte ten grondslag hebben gelegen nu naar het oordeel van het thans in herziening oordelende hof het motief van de verdachte niet is komen vast te staan wordt dit onderdeel van de redengeving niet overgenomen
744313 wat het financi le motief betreft jij zuigt maar wat uit je duim als je zegt dat daar niet meer over gesproken is heb je de pvs van de terechtzittingen
744314 in zijn eigen verhaal ja zeg zo hebben we straks allemaal daderkennis hij schreef dat verhaal in het gevang met het hele dossier bij de hand of in het hoofd
744315 dit verklaart wellicht de aantekeningen op de gevonden memo in het woonhuis zwolschestraat 157
744316 de politie had in het huis van het slachtoffer een aantekening gevonden en trok toen zelf de conclusie dat hetgeen louwes op 27 september 1999 vertelde waar kon zijn want tussen haakjes vermeldde men in het tactisch journaal
744317 correct is dat amer zich nogal eens anders onsamenhangend uitdrukt en of pertinente onjuistheden poneert
744318 er is na arnhem niet meer gesproken over financieel motief
744319 pikant is wel dat nu juist die kant niet als novum door de verdediging werd ingebracht
744320 wat het financi le motief betreft jij zuigt maar wat uit je duim als je zegt dat daar niet meer over gesproken is heb je de pvs van de terechtzittingen
744321 je kunt je vergissen zeg je ja dat kan maar dat is niet erg iedereen kan zich vergissen maar jij bent slordig en onzorgvuldig op een manier om wanhopig van te worden en je haalt van alles en nog wat door elkaar
744322 als belastingadviseur verzorgde hij voor dhr en mw wittenberg de aangiften inkomsten vermogensbelasting na het overlijden van dhr wittenburg heeft hij deze werkzaamheden voortgezet voor mw wittenburg hij heeft destijds tevens de aangifte succesierecht verzorgd op 13 09 1999 is er nieuw testament opgesteld door notaris s waarin dhr louwes staat vermeld als excecuteur testamentair in het oude testament wat is opgesteld begin 1997 was dhr ter velde deze ter velde heeft begin 1997 samen met mw wittenberg het testament opgesteld mw wittenburg verkeerde in een emotionele toestand i v het recentelijk overlijden van haar echtgenoot ter velde zou ge mis bruik hebben gemaakt van haar emotionele toestand en zou onder druk van hem ervoor hebben gekozen dat het grootste gedeelde van de erfenis zou gaan naar de enige dochter van ter velde omdat het echtpaar wittenburg kinderloos was nam de dochter ter velde een bijzondere plaats voor hen in de erfenis bestond in hoofdzaak uit legaten groot f600 000 en het resterende bedrag kwam toe aan de enige erfgename de dochter van ter velde ongeveer f 3 200 000 destijds had mw wittenburg aangegeven dat onder geen beding het grootste gedeelte van de erfenis zou gaan naar familieleden de enige persoon waar zij veelvuldig contact mee had was de fam ter velde op een gegeven moment datum jaar niet bekend mocht de dochter van ter velde een pony kopen van mw wittenburg ter waarde van ongeveer f 6 000 7 000 echter men vertelde later dat het een paard was geworden met een waarde van f 16 000 17 000 hierover was zij zeer onstemd na van de schrik bekomen te zijn werd zij geconfronteerd door ter velde met het verzoek om maar maandelijks een bedrag over te willen maken van f 500 i v m stalling van het paard ter velde zou dit niet kunnen opbrengen en onder het mom dat het voor zijn dochter niet leuk zou zijn om snel weer het paard te moeten verkopen heeft mw wittenberg hieraan voldaan bedragen zijn maandelijks teruggevonden op de bankafschriften louwes denkt dat gelet op voorgaande mw wittenburg in juni juli van dit jaar heeft besloten om haar testament te gaan wijzigen in de tijd dat haar echtgenoot nog leefde waren zij al voornemens dat een eventueel vermogen aan een stichting moest worden nagelaten welke tot doel zou moeten hebben opvang nazorg voor behandelde psychiatrisch patienten de heer s van de generale bank had ook al tegen mw wittenburg gezegd dat zij een stichting in het leven moest roepen voor genoemd doeleinde derhalve heeft zij louwes gevraagd voor zijn vakantie juni juli 99 om een nieuw testament voor te willen bereiden hierbij wilde zij dat louwes i p v ter velde executeur testamentair werd en dat het grootste gedeelde van het vermogen 3 200 000 zou worden nagelaten aan een nog op te richten stichting waarvan louwes in eerste instantie voorzitter zou worden louwes moest tevens direkt bestuursleden aanwijzen de stichting zou niet eerder perfect worden dan na overlijden van mw wittenberg tevens dient louwes zorg te dragen voor de uitvaart in de aangifte ib vb van mw wittenberg staat opgenomen een aftrekpost van f 20 700 dit betreft een betaalde lijfrente die t g v de dochter van ter velde was gesteld deze begunstiging was gewijzigd door ter velde hij zou hiervoor gemachtigd zijn door mw wittenberg ten tijde van het opstellen van het eerste testament tevens is ter velde tot op heden gemachtigde van de ing bankrekening de lijfrentepolis is eveneens onlangs gelijktijdig met het opstellen nieuw testament ten gunste gekomen aan de op te richten stichting in het nieuwe testament zijn als legaten opgenomen de dochter ter velde voor een bedrag van f 100 000 en diens echtgenote voor een bedrag van f 40 000 louwes heeft tot op heden nimmer contact gehad met ter velde mw wittenburg had louwes uitdrukkelijk verzocht nimmer aan ter velde mede te delen dat het testament was gewijzigd en dat hij niet meer was aangesteld als executeur testamentair louwes moest zelf de uitvaartverzekering opbellen om er zeker van te zijn dat zij niet toevallig ter velde in kennis zouden stellen dhr louwes is vorige week donderdagmorgen 23 09 1999 nog bij mw wittenberg in de woning geweest gelet op de geluiden van de bovenverdieping nam hij aan dat de werkster er was hij heeft toen op haar verzoek de grafrechten opgehaald bij de kerk en bij haar afgegeven zij legde hem toen de vraag voor tot welk bedrag zij giften kon doen aan de kerk hij zou dit uitzoeken en haar die avond terugbellen s avonds om 20 00 uur heeft louwes vanuit zijn auto onderweg van utrecht naar zijn woonplaats lelystad met zijn gsm gebeld met wittenberg en haar meedegedeeld dat m b t de giften er een belastingvrije voet bestaat van 1 over haar inkomen van ongeveer f 175 000 dus f 1 750 dit verklaart wellicht de aantekeningen op de gevonden memo in het woonhuis zwolschestraat 157 dhr louwes zou ongeveer 21 15 21 30 uut thuis zijn en de verdere avond en nacht thuis zijn gebleven louwes vertelt dat hij deze maand sept 99 dan wel juni juli van dit jaar van mw wittenberg een sleutel had gekregen van het woonhuis deze had hij gekregen voor het geval er iets met haar zou gebeuren louwes vertelde dat eveneens ter velde de buren fysiotherapeut en de werkster een sleutel van de woning hebben mw wittenberg wilde aanvankelijk de sleutel van ter velde terug hebben echter durfde de relatie tussen beiden hiermee niet op het spel te zetten zij vertelde louwes wel dat ter velde geen sleutel mocht krijgen indien zij een nieuwe woning zou betrekken aan het pothoofd te deventer
744323 ik heb op de snelweg gebeld omdat er na de afslag t harde tot aan huis nog slechts een tweebaansweg is overigens is door de politie in de woning een papiertje gevonden waarop mevrouw wittenberg het bedrag 1 750 had geschreven hierover later nog meer
744324 tenslotte vroeg de man mij naar het laatste contact waarop ik hem heb geantwoord dat ik haar de donderdag daarvoor in de loop van de avond had gebeld omtrent het tijdstip heb ik gezegd dat dit ergens om een uur of acht 20 00 uur moest zijn geweest er werd mij niet naar een exact tijdstip gevraagd dit had ik op dat moment ook niet geweten
744325 amer zaterdag 19 juli 2008 om 20 08 als je binnen gemeenschap van goederen bent getrouwd zijn alle rekeningen van beide personen onjuist heb ik al vaak uitgelegd ik ga het niet meer herhalen
744326 ik had begrepen dat machielse van de hoge raad opdracht had gekregen alle ingebrachte zaken van beide kanten aanklager en verdediging te bekijken hierbij is voor zover mij bekend het financieel motief niet aan de orde gekomen dus kan daardoor ook niet zijn overgenomen fout lees iets over het juridische begrip novum en probeer het te begrijpen wat je beschrijft is niet iets wat de hoge raad doet of mag doen
744327 we weten echter niet hoe het echtpaar louwes is getrouwd
744328 ada wordt het niet eens tijd die ellenlange kopie n van amer te wissen en haar op die grond ook te bannen dit loopt echt de spuigaten uit
744329 ik wil het hier verder maar bij laten en geef je dit advies probeer niet te strijd aan te gaan met mensen die je niet aankunt
744330 staat er in het vonnis van arnhem w l een vastgesteld financieel motief
744331 uitspraak parketnummer 21 000908 00 uitspraak dd 22 december 2000 tegenspraak gerechtshof te arnhem uit de bewijsmiddelen blijkt voorts dat het verdachte na het overlijden van het slachtoffer te doen was om op in ieder geval onregelmatige wijze gelden te onttrekken aan de nalatenschap
744332 het gerechtshof arnhem komt wel tot een schuldigverklaring en veroordeelt ernst l tot 12 jaar gevangenisstraf het hof ziet drie aanwijzingen dat de verdachte de moord gepleegd heeft ten eerste heeft de verdachte vanuit deventer een telefoongesprek met het slachtoffer gevoerd kort v r het tijdstip waarop zij vermoedelijk is overleden ten tweede is bij een geuridentificatieproef vastgesteld dat de lichaamsgeur van de verdachte overeenkwam met een geurspoor op het mes dat in de buurt van de woning van het slachtoffer is gevonden en waarmee de moord gepleegd zou kunnen zijn ten derde is er een financieel motief
744333 uit de bewijsmiddelen blijkt voorts dat het verdachte na het overlijden van het slachtoffer te doen was om op in ieder geval onregelmatige wijze gelden te onttrekken aan de nalatenschap
744334 feit blijft dat het niet overgenomen werd of althans niet in het vonnis den bosch staat dan telt het officieel niet mee
744335 er staat n l niet dat mogelijke onrechtmatige onttrekking van gelden uit de nalatenschap een motief voor de moord op de weduwe is geweest die conclusie komt geheel voor jouw rekening je moet je wel aan de feiten in casu het arrest houden
744336 het gerechtshof arnhem komt wel tot een schuldigverklaring en veroordeelt ernst l tot 12 jaar gevangenisstraf het hof ziet drie aanwijzingen dat de verdachte de moord gepleegd heeft ten eerste heeft de verdachte vanuit deventer een telefoongesprek met het slachtoffer gevoerd kort v r het tijdstip waarop zij vermoedelijk is overleden ten tweede is bij een geuridentificatieproef vastgesteld dat de lichaamsgeur van de verdachte overeenkwam met een geurspoor op het mes dat in de buurt van de woning van het slachtoffer is gevonden en waarmee de moord gepleegd zou kunnen zijn ten derde is er een financieel motief
744337 ik wil het hier verder maar bij laten en geef je dit advies probeer niet te strijd aan te gaan met mensen die je niet aankunt
744338 kun je me aangeven waar bij rechtspraak het financiele motief door de hoge raad besproken is dus svp benoemen onder welk punt ik het kan vinden want dan heb ik dat over het hoofd gezien
744339 daar staat heel duidelijk dat hof den bosch het arrest van hof arnhem handhaaft
744340 dat kun je bijvoorbeeld al zien aan het feit dat louwes daar in de derde persoon wordt opgevoerd in een pv van verhoor dat bekrachtigd moet zijn met een handtekening van de getuige daar ging het toen nog om wordt altijd de eerste persoon gebruikt
744341 amer ik weet dat je de vraag aan jan calis stelde maar ik voel me toch geroepen hierop te reageren het dringt blijkbaar nog steeds niet tot je door dat na den bosch het financiele motief niet meer relevant is machielse en de hoge raad behandelen het daarom ook niet slechts als het om ook herziening had aangevraagd omdat het financiele motief was afgeserveerd dan had machielse en de hoge raad zich er mee beziggehouden het om had dan echter wel met een novum moeten komen wilde ze succes hebben want de eerder aangevoerde bewijsmiddelen waren als onvoldoende beoordeeld
744342 kun je me aangeven waar bij rechtspraak het financiele motief door de hoge raad besproken is dus svp benoemen onder welk punt ik het kan vinden want dan heb ik dat over het hoofd gezien
744343 daar staat heel duidelijk dat hof den bosch het arrest van hof arnhem handhaaft
744344 nu naar het oordeel van het thans in herziening oordelende hof het motief van de verdacht niet is komen vast te staan wordt dit onderdeel van de redengeving niet overgenomen
744345 louwes heeft zich zeker geweerd op dit punt ik meen zelfs nog in zijn laatste woord maar dat mag je zelf opzoeken en eventueel mij weerleggen als dat zo uitkomt
744346 mevrouw h heeft in haar verklaring tegenover de politie gezegd dat zij het vreemd vond dat ik al met iemand van de bank had gesproken ik kan dat als volgt verklaren de vvaa was geli erd met de sns bank in dier voege dat cli nten voorzichtig in de richting van de sns bank werden gepusht ik kende als zodanig de directeur effecten van de sns bank de heer e met hem heb ik op 5 oktober 1999 kort na 21 00 uur gebeld en hem voorgelegd dat ik opeens een vermogen had dat moest worden belegd u kunt dat nazien in de printerlijsten de heer e zei mij toen dat ik mij tot een regiokantoor kon wenden mevrouw h was van dit gesprek natuurlijk niet op de hoogte de heer b van de zwolsche algemene was verontwaardigd omdat ik hem geen details van de moord wilde geven hij vroeg ook naar de naam van een huisvriend van mevrouw wittenberg ik heb hem verwezen naar de politie bovendien heb ik met de heer b woorden gehad over de vergoeding van rente over de lijfrente polis van mevrouw wittenberg
744347 overigens draai je het eigenlijk om jij beweert of beweerde dat hof den bosch geen motief had kunnen vaststellen omdat er niet meer over gesproken zou zijn dan moet jij laten zien dat dat zo is dat kun je niet want je hebt de nodige documenten niet
744348 louwes heeft het financiele motief zelf niet aangekaart in zijn vele verzoeken om een tweede mening herziening hogere beroep als niemand onderzoek naar het financieel motief vraagt is er ook geen reden dit te onderzoeken zomaar een financieel motief overnemen zonder er zelf naar te hebben gekeken lijkt me niet logisch ik denk dus dat het feit dat machielse het financiele motief helemaal niet onderzocht heeft de reden is dat de rechters dit niet hebben overgenomen
744349 machielse adviseerde voor 18 03 2008 daarna kwam de hoge raad die wees herziening af dus geen nieuwe behandeling en geen rechters meer
744350 overigens draai je het eigenlijk om jij beweert of beweerde dat hof den bosch geen motief had kunnen vaststellen omdat er niet meer over gesproken zou zijn dan moet jij laten zien dat dat zo is dat kun je niet want je hebt de nodige documenten niet
744351 louwes heeft het financiele motief zelf niet aangekaart in zijn vele verzoeken om een tweede mening herziening hogere beroep als niemand onderzoek naar het financieel motief vraagt is er ook geen reden dit te onderzoeken zomaar een financieel motief overnemen zonder er zelf naar te hebben gekeken lijkt me niet logisch ik denk dus dat het feit dat machielse het financiele motief helemaal niet onderzocht heeft de reden is dat de rechters dit niet hebben overgenomen
744352 bij de strafoplegging door het gerechtshof te arnhem is in aanmerking genomen dat aan het bewezenverklaarde feit financi le motieven van de verdachte ten grondslag hebben gelegen nu naar het oordeel van het thans in herziening oordelende hof het motief van de verdachte niet is komen vast te staan wordt dit onderdeel van de redengeving niet overgenomen
744353 vreemd is dat den bosch zoals uit bovenstaande blijkt geen enkel motief heeft kunnen vaststellen een gruwelijke moord dus zonder motief onbegrijpelijk
744354 en jij hebt nooit beweerd dat hof den bosch geen motief had kunnen vaststellen omdat er niet meer over gesproken zou zijn je bent dus nog oneerlijk en onwaarachtig ook
744355 tot driemaal toe er is niet over gesproken als reden waarom het niet is kunnen komen vast te staan en nu heb ik het helemaal verkeerd begrepen en fout weergegeven ik dacht het niet
744356 nu naar het oordeel van het thans in herziening oordelende hof het motief van de verdachte niet is komen vast te staan wordt dit onderdeel van de redengeving niet overgenomen
744357 de indruk wordt nu gewekt door de formulering van het arrest dat ze het er maar bij laten zitten
744358 nu naar het oordeel van het thans in herziening oordelende hof het motief van de verdachte niet is komen vast te staan wordt dit onderdeel van de redengeving niet overgenomen
744359 voor ieder weldenkend mens die zich verdiept heeft in de dmz is het wel duidelijk wat het motief is geweest voor louwes voor deze gruwelijke moord geld geplaatst door thomas zondag 20 juli 2008 om 22 26
744360 wat ik me nog kan herinneren van die advertentie is de merkwaardige tekst
744361 wat weldenkend is maakt jij niet uit thomas want mijn beeld van de dader is anders
744362 wetende dat ik toch niet voor vol wordt aangezien wat weer mijn cover is
744363 daarnaast is het wel heel hardnekkig om opnieuw met machielse aan te komen zetten die ook al geen onderzoeksopdracht voor de hr heeft uitgevoerd
744364 alleen wat in de aanvraag inclusief aanvullingen en bijlagen aan de orde wordt gesteld is voorwerp van bespreking in deze conclusie
744365 uit het bovenstaande blijkt wederom dat je nog steeds niet in de gaten hebt of wilt erkenning dat
744366 inderdaad passen beide kwalificaties niet bij jou en zeker niet in onderlinge samenhang geplaatst door thomas maandag 21 juli 2008 om 10 05
744367 het eindrapport van het ori nterend vooronderzoek van het om over de deventer moordzaak van december 2007 laat ook zien hoezeer men bezig was de eigen fouten te verdoezelen en daarbij en passent nog meer fouten te maken
744368 erg mee uitkijken dus met die geplaatst door dhr maandag 21 juli 2008 om 12 08
744369 machielse krijgt geen opdracht tot onderzoek van de hoge raad machielse moet bij de hoge raad zijn commentaar juridisch gezien zijn conclusie indienen n a v het herzieningsverzoek van louwes knoops

744394 dat dit geschiedde met het oogmerk om goederen weg te nemen acht het hof niet bewezen evenmin acht het hof bewezen dat verdachte met voorbedachten rade heeft gehandeld het medenemen van chloroform duidt op het voorbereiden van in elk geval bedwelmende handelingen doch het gebruik van naar het hof aanneemt in de woning van het slachtoffer aanwezige middelen voor de levensberoving een keukenmes een audiosnoer en een nylonkousje doet twijfel rijzen over levensberoving met voorbedachten rade
744395 de verdachte moet zich ofwel tevoren van een steekvoorwerp hebben voorzien ofwel dit steekvoorwerp in de woning van het slachtoffer erbij gepakt hebben

744400 amer quote dus het is wel behandeld maar het staat niet op papier oke en wat is er tijdens die mondelinge behandeling besproken dan quote als het behandeld is staat het wel op papier alleen dat papier hebben we niet hoe zou ik dan kunnen zeggen wat er precies besproken is geplaatst door jan calis maandag 21 juli 2008 om 16 02
744401 maar er blijkt naar mijn gevoel inderdaad uit dat amer niet alleen maar een beetje dom en hardleers is overigens spreekt dat ook uit bv de lasterpraat over de vrouw van louwes
744402 de officier van justitie zegt mij dat ik de waarheid moet zeggen ik weet dat ik niet mag liegen de officier van justitie vraagt mij of ik mij realiseer wat ik nu verklaar en wat daarvan de gevolgen zijn de officier van justitie houdt mij voor dat ik bij de politie heel anders heb verklaard en dat uit de telefoontap op 22 december ook wat anders blijkt ik blijf bij mijn verklaring zoals ik die nu ter zitting heb afgelegd

744409 de processen verbaal van de terechtzittingen amer daar heb ik je meermaals op gewezen
744410 bij de strafoplegging door het gerechtshof te arnhem is in aanmerking genomen dat aan het bewezenverklaarde feit financi le motieven van de verdachte ten grondslag hebben gelegen nu naar het oordeel van het thans in herziening oordelende hof het motief van de verdachte niet is komen vast te staan wordt dit onderdeel van de redengeving niet overgenomen
744411 gelet op het vorenstaande laat het hof bij de beoordeling van deze zaak dit mes buiten beschouwing daarom behoeven de wijze van veiligstelling van het mes p1 en de daarmee gehouden sorteerproef geen verdere bespreking

744416 wils 23 16 interessante bijdrage wat mij betreft zeker ook omdat dit arrest ook door hetzelfde hof den bosch is gewezen geplaatst door jan calis dinsdag 22 juli 2008 om 0 11
744417 ik persoonlijk zou best wel om de tafel willen gaan zitten met al die afhakers om de achtergronden gebeurtenissen en de motivatie van afhaken in kaart te brengen misschien wat voor de redactie van 1 vandaag of voor vn of voor elsevier of zembla lijkt me een meer dan boeiend item een kijkje in de keuken van het steekspel rondom de deventer moordzaak
744418 eenmaal met dit feit geconfronteerd ging jij beweren dat dit was omdat de rechters niet meer naar het motief gekeken hadden er geen aandacht aan hadden besteed en dat er na arnhem nooit meer over dit punt gesproken was
744419 amer je hebt blijkbaar iets fundamenteels tegen jan calis want je reageert nogal explosief op hem het rare is dat je dat niet op mij doet terwijl ik steeds narriger op je ben gaan reageren omdat ik werkelijk mijn geduld verloor
744420 dat kan kloppen ben zij is actief in een actiegroep tegen overlastgevende figuren zoals jij
744421 heel rare houding komt heel vreemd over op weldenkende mensen
744422 die schrijfproef lijkt mij niet helemaal in de haak dankbaar en andere zeueren er maar over door en het om heeft nog steeds niet openlijk laten zien hoe het er bij die schrijfproef precies aan toeging en dat doet mij vermoeden dat er iets niet in orde is wanneer er iets met die schrijfproef niet in orde is dan zou het ook best wel eens kunnen dat er meer niet in de haak is daarom vind ik dat heel het onderzoek over moet worden gedaan of er in ieder geval door een onafhankelijke instantie onderzocht moet worden of het om gefraudeerd heeft
744423 ze haalt alles door elkaar en is niet voor rede vatbaar
744424 in de telegraaf van zaterdag jl stond op pagina 5 een heel boeiend artikel voor de goede lezer en het is exemplarisch voor hoe onze rechtsstaat niet functioneert
744425 je hebt als dat nodig is ook nog video conference call maar ik denk
744426 conclusie je bent tegen een controleerbare rechtsstaat tegen checks amp balances en v r de bewust gehandhaafde mogelijkheid tot machtsmisbruik maar dat wist ik al heel lang
744427 ik denk persoonlijk dat hij hiermee niet aan hanss ruud joop en wieteke refereert ik denk eerder aan een andr een ingrid en een handjevol andere zelfbenoemde deskundigen
744428 je bent echt een man waarvan ik blij wordt om je gekend te hebben

744433 dat alleen al zou voldoende moeten zijn om duidelijk te maken dat het resultaat van de eerste proef het bewuste briefje is waarschijnlijk niet geschreven door n van de auteurs van de teksten n1 n4 het resultaat is van misleiding en manipulatie
744434 ria schreef anny alweer bedankt ik wens robert en annelies het allerbeste toe en genezing na deze onrechtmatige traumatische deportatie en gevangenschap en ik ben blij dat maurice de hond aan dit soort zaken een podium heeft gegeven en een inzicht heeft gegeven hoe de rechtstaat in nederland nu echt miserabel in elkaar steekt iets waar je altijd op vertrouwde daar is moed en karakter voor nodig hij had zich k stil kunnen houden maurice bedankt 25 jul 08 19 48
744435 hanss schreef dirk undercover is de echte internet expert ik ben slechts een leerling maar wat de dmz betreft ben ik volleerd ernest louwes is niet de moordenaar van mevrouw wittenberg maar iemand anders heeft haar vermoord er is iemand die daar meer over kan vertellen maar justitie wil niet dat er gerechtigheid geschiedt en dat de onjuiste persoon wordt gestraft voor wat een ander heeft gedaan wie bewust een onschuldige veroordeeld om een schuldige uit de wind te houden is een crimineel iets anders kan ik er niet van maken het is letterlijk spelen met mensenlevens 26 jul 08 01 29

744437 wat de bewijsbeslissing betreft heeft het openbaar ministerie de neiging om marginaal te toetsen
744438 in ons strafrechtstelsel is vooral door toedoen van de hoge raad het belang van de bewijsmiddelen geminimaliseerd onder rechters is het een bekend credo dat als de overtuiging er is het bewijs altijd wel te vinden is en dat bewijs is meestal het papieren bewijs want het horen van een getuige op de zitting kost tijd en is dan ook nog steeds eerder uitzondering dan regel
744439 ps hoe kom je erbij dat mensen hier dichtbij het om etc zitten ik ben geen fan van m m ken de mensen zelfs niet heb niets met de genoemde personen te maken bovendien geen connecties met om en nfi welke bewijzen heb je of is het duimzuigerij geplaatst door kwatta zaterdag 26 juli 2008 om 14 46

744451 in elke moordzaak wordt de lichaamstemperatuur van het slachtoffer gemeten aan de hand van een methode kan dan het tijdstip waarop de dood is ingetreden vrij nauwkeurig worden vastgesteld
744452 het rapport van de schouwarts is indertijd nooit doorgegeven aan het team dat de moord onderzocht men ging ervan uit dat de moord omstreeks half zeven s avonds had plaatsgevonden de commissie posthumus 2 heeft een patholoog anatoom ingeschakeld en de rapportage van de schouwingsarts boven water gehaald de conclusie van deze expert is dat de dood al rond het middaguur was ingetreden een verschil van een halve dag en bovendien een tijdstip waarvoor ina post een sluitend alibi heeft

744509 there is a general feeling i mean i often say that if i was if i was going to court or to do a business deal it is a terrible thing to say would i go to a hasid in monsey or somewhere or would i go to one rabbi ammiels reform congregants who can i trust more to tell the truth in the court and everything
744510 myself and rabbi lincoln once shared a dais at president ronald reagans inauguration now i am frightened at what i hear
744511 by saying that as he did he is as bad as he claims all of orthodoxy is by wantonly stating that hasidim or extreme orthodox jews all commit crime or allow it to happen or to suggest that we hold common law to be unimportant as a rule a way of life is nearing the kind of hatred gentile nations have committed against jews in some of the worst human atrocities throughout the centuries
744512 when i saw rabbi lincoln say that i could do little but gasp at the simplistically narrow view of a man who leads such an influential congregation and how he may be influencing jews against other jews i am not certain a simple apology would suffice for the sentiment runs deeper than any empty apology can contain
744513 i believe it is my duty to condemn such words that bitterly label an entire people out of convenience in the hope of grabbing a headline
744514 its a terrible thing to say but who would i trust to say the truth a torah observant jew or a secular assimilated jew
744515 is looking forward to he opinion of others on this matter

744526 thank you for the information but when it comes to the lashon hara laws i would like too tell you that the ones that really are protected by those laws are rapest abusers thives and other so called jews what is happening in judeskait is an abomination what is happening too many people in israel is just something horrible the racism the abuse of power the robbery assults the lies the manipulation the haridim world really knows how to kill the jew and the zionist in you and that will have to change even if the law of lashon hara and the people that abuse thier power dont like it naama november 22nd 2005 at 10 37 am
744527 but they do work most of the time even in jewish renewal
744528 additionally every other religious section of the jewish community from reform through mo operate with a large degree of transparency
744529 all segments of the jewish community except haredism have procedures in place to deal with abusers
744530 since all religions have clerics that are tainted one should never put complete and unconditional faith in any cleric

744540 its an insult to all the religious people and the orthodox people and all the people who have the highest standards
744541 its saying they dont care about the workers and the animals this assumes the orthodox people who give hekhshers have not been doing that
744542 that doesnt mean its never happened but we dont usually see that kind of smoking gun

744547 the high number of illegal people who were working here is more a testimony to the quality of their deceit

744579 took a town that had balls of hay rolling in it and they built up a community of approximately 120 jewish families
744580 the rubashkin family is charitable theyre not prejudiced theyll hire any kind of person anyone who will walk through the door
744581 what happened was when jews came to town they looked at us like were martians they didnt understand the black coats the white shirts the beards the black hats and they needed to learn about us
744582 a lack of respect of human dignity of people other than you
744583 politicians who should have been leading the way did nothing
744584 but maybe the rubashkins should have put a little bit more emphasis to reacting maybe to the town maybe they had a lack of communication with people
744585 its not his call in this country those things are based on evidence
744586 there is no such thing as conversation it is an illusion there are intersecting monologues that is all
744587 i would be interested in seeing an honest study of the industry and seeing where agriprocessors record places it
744588 my familiarity with the issues is light years ahead of yours
744589 the reason kaj left was because of control issues having two certifying agencies over one plant
744590 the certifying agencies do not rely on the management to cover any of their areas of responsibility
744591 incidentally to my knowledge the certifying agencies do not rely on the management to cover any of their areas of responsibility
744592 i hear that rubashkin is selling lubavitch meat from argentina in order to bolster its output
744593 i also hear that david elliot started to slaughter meat
744594 if kaj felt the kashrus was no good why did they allow agriprocessots to continue to produce meat for them until the publicized date
744595 the sheer volume and intensity with which these charges are leveled discourage many from challenging their conclusions but my knowledge of the personality mindset and approach of many of the people who run the plant lead me to the conclusion that dissecting the claims leads to the conclusion that this plant is run by human beings who attempt to run their plant in the best interests of their business and in full compliance with the laws human beings being opinionated fallible creatures and with the necessity to delegate leadership positions from foreman to operations manager issues will arise they may be challenged by management they may be discussed and they will be resolved i believe a proper analysis of the claims and statements done with complete information from all involved parties will bear out my words

744599 as i pointed out second hand information can often be false misunderstood out of context etc as is the case with much of the information in the affidavit for the raid
744600 now before the straw man conspiracy theory mockery begins let me say that i blame agriprocessors historical lack of pr which resulted in the distorted portrayal in the press but the fact remains that the portrayal does not accurately represent the truth
744601 the fact that so many were hired can be interpreted as a testimony to the quality of their deceit it can be interpreted as negligence it can be interpreted as intentional it can be interpreted in a number of ways

744813 it is a truism in evolutionary biology that conditional responses require more genetic complexity than unconditional responses
744814 is true except where general intelligence is at work it probably takes more complexity to encode an organism that can multiply 7 by 8 and can multiply 432 by 8902 but cannot multiply 6 by 13 than to encode an organism that can do all three
744815 what is the point of social science or indeed any analysis if we only ever use it to offer support for beliefs people already have my argument above is very simple and solid why ever bother with a twenty page journal article or a three hundred page book full of math if even this short post is too complex to persuade anyone who doesnt already believe the conclusion
744816 what is the point of social science or indeed any analysis if we only ever use it to offer support for beliefs people already have my argument above is very simple and solid and took only four paragraphs and two simple algebraic equations why ever bother with a twenty page journal article or a three hundred page book full of math if even this short post is too complex to persuade anyone who doesnt already believe the conclusion
744817 oh dear women with high math scores still are likely to suck at math better not hire all those female grad students just because they got high gres
744818 nah nah nah nah nah nah you actually are different in spite of equally test scores im smarter than you are cause i gotta penis and that prior is the most reliable predictor of success anyone has to go on i mean how better to cut down half of the work of selection then automatically taking a man over a woman i mean look at history napoleon mussoulini hitler churchill general george washington every us president for that matter women whats the point oh yeah sex damn bitches seem to want insane criminal types for some reason gee stupid hoes you know prisoners do really appreciate it more than i ever could maybe i should spend 5 years in the slammer cuz then ill actually get laid maybe they could teach me how to keep my hoes in the rows
744819 oh you performed that double slit experiment youve just shown newtonian physics is wrong whats the point i dont see your solution to the problem go work on a solution instead of coming up with problems idiot
744820 why ever bother with a twenty page journal article or a three hundred page book full of math if even this short post is too complex to persuade anyone who doesnt already believe the conclusion shall we just wait until society decides for example that we need affirmative action and then go searching for data and models to support that conclusion and then wait for societys next political fashion so we can go find support for that
744821 lara i thought i was clear about my proposed solution adjust the scores when ranking candidates
744822 people have social reputations for being pretty witty having popular friends having successful or failed businesses and so on and the adjust score i propose would still be under your volitional control
744823 people shouldnt be subject to systemic penalties they cant avoid for something they never did that they cant possibly dig themselves out from under no matter what they do
744824 when you start introducing systematic discriminatory practices based on priors beyond peoples control you get totalitarianism
744825 all i find it curious that my argument is seen as being against women when it is only hurts high scoring women it helps low scoring women
744826 i dont assume other people are just like me maybe im sad and they happen to be angry they believe other things than i do their personalities are different from mine

744833 detonated the warhead near apogee not over the target area where the thing would eventually land but at altitude
744834 thats exactly what you would do if you had a nuclear weapon on a scud or a shahab 3 or other missile and you wanted to explode it over the united states
744835 if even a crude nuclear weapon were detonated anywhere between 40 kilometers to 400 kilometers above the earth in a split second it would generate an electro magnetic pulse emp that would cripple military and civilian communications power transportation water food and other infrastructure
744836 explicitly discuss a nuclear emp attack that would gravely harm the united states
744837 secondly no small power is going to be stupid enough to attack the us with a weapon that has a return address this would simply result in complete annihilation of the attacker and while individuals may be suicidal enough to wish to die attacking their enemies nations even muslim ones are not
744838 if iran launched its attack from a cargo ship plying the commercial sea lanes off the east coast u s investigators might never determine who was behind the attack
744839 the only thing iran is lacking for an effective emp attack is a nuclear warhead and no one knows with any certainty when that will occur
744840 we simply announce that in the event of any nuclear attack emp or otherwise on the united states whose origin is not immediately obvious we massively retaliate against both iran and north korea regardless of whether or not we can prove they were responsible for the attack after we nuke the most likely suspects we then run the detailed analysis to see if they were say smuggled out of pakistan or russia or something
744841 since bush is evil and wants to invade every nation possible
744842 fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me
744843 when you quote this source as if its an actual newsman reporting about an actual expert it makes you look like a fool
744844 the claim that the nuke could not be traced back is unlikely inasmuch as isotope levels differ from country from country they all have unique isotopic fingerprints and this is a pretty reliable method
744845 when you quote this source as if its an actual newsman reporting about an actual expert it makes you look like a fool
744846 the claim that the nuke could not be traced back is unlikely inasmuch as isotope levels differ from country from country they all have unique isotopic fingerprints and this is a pretty reliable method
744847 thank you for further documenting the madness those are interesting editorials particularly the second though neither of them give any hint toward actual sources
744848 if they havent been observed testing then no not so much then you get a result that doesnt match any known pattern
744849 yes but they give no information about how to find a credible source
744850 the only thing iran is lacking for an effective emp attack is a nuclear warhead and no one knows with any certainty when that will occur

744881 uc santa cruz may consider themselves an institution of higher education but they are also an institution of animal torture and killing their research is a colossal waste of taxpayer money and is considered unethical and fraudulent by most physicians interested in research that might help their patients these animals are terrified and abused beyond belief in these experiments and this continued depravity by cruel wanna be scientists simply cannot be justified any longer in a civilized society this is historically what happens whenever revolutionaries begin to take the oppression and suffering of their fellow beings seriously whether human or non human its regrettable that certain scientists are willing to put their families at risk by choosing to do wasteful animal experiments in this day and age

744954 why should government be involved at all in our healthcare system aside from providing care for low income families the most persuasive argument is that in the absence of coercion people will have an incentive to be uninsured free riders in our society people who choose not to pay for insurance know that they are likely to get healthcare anyway even if they cant pay for it the reason is that there is a tacit widely shared agreement that no one will be allowed to go without care as a result the willfully uninsured impose external costs on others through the higher taxes or higher prices which subsidize the cost of their care

744958 apple relies on an emotional response to its products to sell them at least initially for example once youve used os x youll never go back to windows but that first leap of faith is just that a leap of faith that youre willing to take because the ui is so beautiful you recognize the power after the purchase

745012 spring is finally here spring when a young mans fancy turns to thoughts of love and eliot spitzer turns to the yellow pages also the fifth anniversary of the iraq war how romantic once again they forgot to greet us with flowers traditionally this is the wood anniversary five which is fitting cause thats what dick cheney gets when he thinks of war the war is going into its sixth year with no end in sight the economy of course is tanking but what is america freaking out about right now that apparently barack obama went to a church and heard his pastor criticize america and just sat there everybody knows when you hear something your pastor says that you dont agree with you get up there and you punch him in the f face and you beat him with the cross not only that this reverend wright apparently he officiated when obama got married wait til they find out the wedding band was the wu tang clan the thing is republicans of course dont allow dangerous religious freaks to advise their campaigns they nominate them of course obama had to answer this did you watch his speech he hit all the notes he said racism is real for black people he said white resentment is real for white people but at the end of the day why cant we all come together with the shared knowledge that asians cant drive the good news is on youtube the obama speech now is getting watched more than the clips of the pastor the bad news is that its still far behind the footage of spitzers hooker on girls gone wild this chick is everywhere i swear to god she won american idol the last person to get this famous for f some idiot was kevin federline new yorks new governor david paterson he made history this week hes black hes blind and hes hornier than the last guy he hadnt taken his hand off the bible when they swore him in before he admitted to having multiple affairs see this is what women dont get about the male sex drive he was blind and he still wanted to see other people and its not easy having an affair when youre blind he used to come home with lipstick on his shoes his wife was cheating too did you know that i would have loved to see that confrontation honey i may be blind but im not blind and now the new york post says that eliot spitzer is in therapy for sex addiction im not sure he really understands the process today he requested an analyst with really big tits

745014 a new cnn poll just came out about the campaign interesting results a new study shows that wine drinkers prefer hillary clinton to the other candidates yeah after hearing this bill clinton asked how much wine have they had i guess this is good news former new york governor eliot spitzer has reportedly entered therapy for a sex addiction spitzer said his therapy is going well and that his therapist has a fantastic rack in new jersey today there were dangerous winds with gusts up to 50 miles an hour the winds were so strong that they blew former governor mcgreevey off his chauffeur well of course this sunday is easter of course easter is that very very holy day when christians around the world honor a 2 000 year old jewish man who is not larry king a big insurance company just announced they will give 10 million to anyone who can invent a car that gets 100 miles per gallon meanwhile exxon says theyll give 11 million to anyone who kills that guy
745015 when people in this worn looking city near pittsburgh lament how the sagging economy is slowly crushing them some are also quick to add how much hillary clinton could help them
745016 with that in mind i believe that the best candidate for philadelphia is the one who has not only ideas but the skills to implement them is willing to embrace change while also working in collaboration with us at the local level is experienced and willing to extend a helping hand and possesses both good judgment and a profound sense of social justice based on those criteria ive made my decision on which candidate i support i have endorsed senator hillary clinton hillary clinton has an impressive 35 year record of fighting on behalf of working families and children fighting for universal health care for every american and has a comprehensive plan to end the war in iraq and restore our standing around the world but most importantly she has a strong commitment to revitalizing our urban centers and i believe that under her leadership our american cities will rise again the hillary clinton agenda for revitalizing philadelphia and other major metropolitan areas is called leave no city behind and it creates a vital partnership between our efforts here in philadelphia and the efforts of the federal government
745017 pledging to work her heart out if elected president democratic candidate u
745018 we need to send someone who can be commander in chief and president
745019 hillary clinton evoked themes of sisterhood and motherhood while addressing women voters in blue bell today and reminded them shed be a strong commander in chief and a fighter for universal health care
745020 we have seen changes that are unimaginable for our mothers and grandmothers
745021 there were colleges i couldnt go to scholarships i couldnt apply for
745022 there must be a republican gremlin in the sound system
745023 this is an issue of equality and justice this is a family issue

745095 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
745096 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
745097 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
745098 i was kind of sweating it but im glad it went in
745099 i had a putt for what i thought would get me into a playoff
745100 i hit the best putt i could have hit without it going in
745101 at the end of the match there were some long long volleys that took a toll on both of us
745102 a lot of this stuff weve already gone over so hes heard it once through the minicamp
745103 but now is when its starting to get critical for him because its all starting to come together even if he came out tomorrow hes got to learn multiple days of install in one day so hes way behind the eight ball now its going to be tough
745104 hes improved so much his arm strength you know its not what it was before he first got hurt but it was pretty close
745105 we made him work a little bit there in the middle innings but we didnt take advantage of it that was really the difference for us
745106 thats a good start to having him back in the rotation
745107 in the fifth inning and sixth inning i got the ball up a little bit
745108 they made me pay they put some good swings on the ball
745109 they had some gaps there and i just took advantage of them the ball found me and i was able to make them pay
745110 in that kind of situation where the game is kind of seesawing back and forth we have so many weapons it could be lebron it could be d wade one of us is going to kick into high gear
745111 its great to be so far from staples center and still have so much support i feel like im home
745112 russia did a good job of slowing us down a little bit but we still made our run at the end of the third quarter
745113 if you take a look in past games the american team most points they score is fast breaks and its dunks i think for the most part we contained the ball
745114 for the most part i think we did a pretty good job to stop them
745115 russia is a team we could see in the gold medal game and a team thats been playing very well of late so it was good competition they made us run some sets slow us down a little bit but i think overall we played good defense
745116 just did a great job of being aggressive so he played well
745117 this morning i was very nervous but i focused on my game and now i won so i am happy
745118 i was planning to play in japan but maybe now i change my plans and play in america
745119 to finish with a birdie was special there didnt seem to be any doubt it was going in
745120 im always trying to win more than one but this is what happened this year and im really disappointed
745121 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
745122 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
745123 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot

745126 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
745127 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
745128 substantial progress has been made by bringing to bear new and sophisticated scientific tools
745129 at the end of the match there were some long long volleys that took a toll on both of us

745154 when you hit times like this and reflect back you realize the nfl is bigger than everybody this situation is bigger than everybody its about the national football league then its about the green bay packers and finally its about the individuals i think thats very important and when that gets out of balance problems occur

745158 i think i was born to compete there were times i wish i didnt have it but i probably wouldnt have achieved what i have maybe there were times the last few months when i wish i had the desire and the motivation and the drive then i wouldnt step away
745159 but i just dont have that when you have the mind of a champion and the mind of a competitor but then theres a few pieces missing thats hard to accept sometimes
745160 i came up 18 made the corner turn and there was a sign saying annika you will be missed
745161 i thought that was very special i waved to the guys they clapped and then i came up 18 and everybody was cheering it just makes you feel good when you get that type of applause ive been out here for 15 years and ive experienced a lot of joy a few setbacks but overall its been great

745168 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
745169 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
745170 no one was seriously injured police officer hans eng told the associated press
745171 but some of them will stay in the hospital for observation
745172 ive never seen anything like it spectators fell off their seats a witness roar bringaker was quoted as saying on the web site of norwegian paper verdens gang
745173 it was a raining and suddenly the lightning hit the stand he was quoted as saying to the norwegian news agency ntb
745174 we all tried to get down from the hill many screamed and cried the situation was dramatic ive never experienced anything similar
745175 i was kind of sweating it but im glad it went in
745176 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
745177 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
745178 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
745179 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
745180 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
745181 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
745182 how sad you threw your car now we have to put it away
745183 i want you to know that your comment hurt my feelings
745184 excuse me but i am next in line the end of the line is back there
745185 i feel hurt when you make comments about my family
745186 i feel angry when you talk to me in that tone of voice
745187 you always use that condescending voice and i hate it
745188 you are right i dont always do a good job of listening to you
745189 i agree that something has to be done about this im feeling too frustrated right now to think clearly can we discuss this in a half hour when ive had a chance to think more clearly
745190 remember our agreement you said i should send you to your room to chill out when you get like this thanks for understanding
745191 at the end of the match there were some long long volleys that took a toll on both of us
745192 leaves the field of play at or near the outfield fence or should have been ruled out of the field of play
745193 i think everyone would agree that getting it right is most important
745194 we wanted to make the decision as impersonal as possible
745195 its always a tough decision when you leave an organization like detroit
745196 it was a wonderful ride for 15 years i spoke with all the people i worked with including the ownership and they understand the situation is an opportunity to come to chicago to be with stan
745197 when i first started with the blackhawks it was in the back of my mind but i kind of set it aside and wanted to go about and get my career in motion
745198 the free agent signings of the blackhawks caught my attention but you also have to develop your own players
745199 i can be another set of eyes for dale and denny and the organization
745200 with the outdoor game against detroit everything kind of goes together
745201 im really looking forward to getting this thing to where it should be
745202 i had to think twice time game situation score because you wouldnt always get the best result
745203 hasheems hunger to go get the ball is different than last year i just see a total difference he demands the ball you almost have to throw it to him
745204 were on a mission for a national championship but weve got to win games first
745205 right now were working hard to get to detroit and play in the final four were not thinking about yeah were going to win a national championship how are we going to get there thats what were thinking about
745206 there were a lot of presidents from europe at the summit jesse jackson was there
745207 i got to meet all of them it was great
745208 its easy to blame the racetrack but studies of injuries not limited to the catastrophic have produced conflicting data arthur said
745209 it is naive to think that the surface is the only factor there are a number of other management issues including the way horses are trained
745210 if you look at all the tracks with synthetic surfaces were still seeing a marked decline in racing fatalities arthur said
745211 training data is a bit different you dont see a big difference between synthetic and dirt in my opinion if you train on a synthetic surface and race on dirt youll have fewer fatalities
745212 we tend to seal tracks over and over and i think its taking a toll on our horses he said
745213 the tracks are being oversealed so far we havent seen enough synthetic tracks to be sure of anything
745214 the places where theyve installed synthetic surfaces thats where the worst tracks were anyway romans said
745215 anything they did was an improvement thats not to say that if theyd installed better dirt tracks that things would have been different ive seen injuries on both
745216 if you overreact youre taking a lot away from the sport youll spin the wheel a different way
745217 being number one in the coaches preseason poll does have significance since its one third of the formula to decide who plays in the national championship game
745218 but the postseason poll is the one that is the most important however i know the ranking is exciting for georgia football and hopefully we can do our part to stay in the race
745219 this is an exciting step forward for us as we offer our fans a new way to consume nfl games
745220 we are combining nbcs outstanding sunday night football telecast with extras that will enhance the fan enjoyment of the game
745221 in the first two seasons of nbc sunday night football we created a new destination to reach viewers and changed traditional primetime football viewing habits
745222 now together with the nfl we are adding the live streaming element where users can interact with the broadcast to enhance their experience
745223 numbers wise we are a bit short and experience wise were a bit short in midfield wenger said after the juventus match which arsenal lost 1 0
745224 i feel what we have to strengthen is our belief and keep complete confidence in ourselves wenger said
745225 we have to respect his development but dont reproach me for playing young english players wenger said of wilshere
745226 we have all been there face to face he always told me he wanted to stay at the club and it finished like that so i believe what he told me
745227 consider olympic sponsorship a stamp of approval with regard to the quality of a companys products
745228 we believe the torch relay is clearly a force for good
745229 those in charge at werder bremen have reached the conclusion that nothing on the facts in the conflict has changed bremen said
745230 the decision of the judge isnt based in any way on the actual rules in which it is clearly regulated under which conditions players have to be released
745231 taking part in the olympic games is a unique opportunity for all athletes of any sporting discipline fifa said
745232 i cant say enough how sorry we are and its our responsibility being nascar that we dont go through this situation again
745233 the race didnt come off like we had hoped the fans didnt get what they exactly wanted and well do everything in our power it wont happen again i can tell you that much
745234 its obvious that we didnt go there with the right car slash tire combination
745235 we have to run the race and we have to run the safest race possible and when were in situations where we have to take control under adverse circumstances thats what we do
745236 to get ahead of it and have the safest race possible we had to take control and thats what we did run 10 to 11 laps at a time and let the cautions fly
745237 the problem is solely nascars and by that i mean its theirs to figure out
745238 its not going to come with anything we do to the track figuring it out will only come with getting the car and tire combination right and that requires actually spending the time and effort to do something about it
745239 the track wont change next year so if they want to come back they better figure it out because i dont think the fans want to come back and see that
745240 it hurts us whenever we have a weekend like we had
745241 theres nothing worse than coming away from a race and knowing the result was it wasnt even close it wasnt even in the 25th percentile of what were capable of doing and what we do week in and week out
745242 but then i had one of my commanders sit me down and say brian you can use this platform to highlight the work of your fellow soldiers and you can use it to get the word out about mixed martial arts id never really looked at it that way before and it made perfect sense
745243 we have a war going on and lots of great young men and women fighting for us
745244 whether or not you disagree with the war and thats your right as an american i will always take the opportunity to highlight the great work and sacrifice of those serving overseas
745245 its pretty simple if people ask me questions im going to answer them
745246 they took one look at what i was doing and wanted no part of it
745247 everyones in for a surprise when they see the new and improved brian stann
745248 people have been saying i have no ground game for a long time
745249 to say his ground game is a billion times better i dont think he understands what that means i dont mind keeping that part of my game secret it gives me the element of surprise so ill keep it a secret as long as i can
745250 im missing that switch to give up and say im done
745251 when you watch mma you see guys break if were in the cage and youre beating me up ill go all five rounds and take that beating and ill never give up ill always think i can find a way to pull out a win and then even if you beat me well both go home knowing that you were the better guy but i couldve taken that beating all night
745252 we dont think its a perfect schedule but we think its progress towards a much improved schedule terry angstadt president of the irls commercial division said in a teleconference
745253 we are in active conversations with them for 09 angstadt said
745254 we are keeping a couple of slots open for them we are hopeful we can get them included
745255 this can only move our sport and therefore teams like hvm racing to the next level
745256 we are very pleased that texas motor speedway and infineon raceway will be returning to the lineup of tracks hosting indycar series events in 2009 smith said in a statement
745257 however we are disappointed that the indy racing league chose not to add dates for las vegas motor speedway and new hampshire motor speedway those two first class facilities would have been excellent additions for the league and race fans next year
745258 we hope we can work together in the future and in both venues angstadt said
745259 we certainly realize those opportunities arent open forever he said
745260 we know well need to make some decisions in the next year or two to keep those options open and available
745261 hes a very tough guy lots of the japanese fighters are just real tough
745262 hes got powerful hands hes a great striker and im going to have to be on my toes with my stand up hes also got good judo throws i have to make sure i dont get tossed on my head
745263 id like to fight a nick diaz josh koscheck or karo parisyan theyre tough opponents i got a lot of respect for these guys
745264 id think they would be good fights for me and theyre gatekeepers to the upper echelon of the welterweight division i could have said gsp george st pierre and jon fitch but i have to pay my dues before that
745265 im a younger guy so i got a bit of advice from urijah and b j penn
745266 hes penn got tons of experience and been around the game for awhile i look up to him and admire him quite a bit
745267 there is an ongoing war and we dont hear anything about it on the news
745268 our men and women are risking their lives it is dangerous
745269 were very happy to have kimbo slice co starring in kung fu u
745270 he has an enormous media presence and hell fit right in with our star hulk hogan and the other cast members in our made for kids 3 d movie
745271 we must provide an even playing field for all our equine athletes if we are to continue to offer the best thoroughbred racing in the world
745272 our number one priority remains preserving the integrity of our competition and protecting the welfare of our athletes
745273 the breeders cup board believes its crucial that we take a leadership role in eliminating anabolic steroids from our sport
745274 derrick and i had been talking you know all the way through the summer from long beach about trying to put something together and finding sponsorship working on things
745275 i went to indianapolis for a seat fitting got to know the team and four days later we were at the track
745276 in between i went home to las vegas and trained like crazy in the 100 degree heat i wasnt in the best shape of my life but definitely was able to carry it through here and was strong all through the race
745277 the whole thing was just a cinderella last minute deal
745278 that kind of makes you try even harder when you know people are not expecting much from you he drove a terrific race and my guys did a great job too
745279 in fairness to paul when he came here he wasnt ready for this quite frankly as the race went on i wondered i think his mentality carried over the fitness he needs to get back in racing shape but hes still got the fire in him hes still mad dog tracy thats what you want in a driver
745280 you always come in knowing the competition is where its at and that its going to be an uphill struggle
745281 without the help and guidance of the vision team and some of my friends wed have been finding things out the second time around and that wouldnt have worked
745282 there was action all the way through i was fighting with many different drivers passed a lot of guys made a lot of really daring passes in the infield you know i got this opportunity and we cashed in on it
745283 he was fantastic to watch and what a difference he made to the game
745284 its not often that we lose 5 1 and im smiling watching the opposition playing football he was just a real delight to watch
745285 i understand that everybody thinks that messi is different of course he is different but i have to treat him the same as the others
745286 i dont understand football only with one player i understand football as a result of the work of the group for him to do the things he does he needs someone to bring the ball to him to create opportunities to score
745287 the poster became an important medium for propaganda during this period combining text and bold graphics posters were extensively deployed both in germany and in the areas occupied their typography reflected the nazis preference for fraktur over modern sans serif typefaces which were condemned as cultural bolshevism although futura continued to be used owing to its practicality the use of fraktur was prevalent in advertising which was a state monopoly and books published during the third reich
745288 i dont think anything that went on in these chambers affected him
745289 his entire life as best i can tell is one in which hes always been a thoughtful listener and questioner but hes never stepped up to the plate and taken full swings
745290 by a desire to mobilize art as a means of change
745291 work though sort of the dark side if you will weve got to spend time in the shadows
745292 when cheney spoke about it on national television a few days after the attacks
745293 he had given it a note of recognition this is what we must do where we must live like it or not
745294 can come only from people who have never seen the night sky away from city lights
745295 the movies give a ritual pattern to the lives of many artists and this induces a kind of low budget mysticism which keeps them in a perpetual trance
745296 this is done by changing your dns settings and these changes take considerable time to propagate to all the millions of nameservers around the world

745311 could you not stop all of this allah is it not easy for you
745312 allah has purchased of the believers their persons and their goods for theirs is the garden of paradise they fight in his cause and slay and are slain a promise binding on him in truth through the tawrah and the gospel and the quran and who is more faithful to his promise than allah then rejoice in the bargain which you have made that is the supreme achievement those that turn in repentance that worship him and praise him and travel in his path that bow down and prostrate themselves in prayer that enjoin good and forbid evil and observe the limits set by allah so proclaim the glad tidings to the believers
745313 soon the nations will gather together to take from you in the same way you invite others to share in a feast
745314 no you will many like the foam on the sea but you will be like the rubbish that is carried by the flood and allah will take the fear of you from the hearts of your enemies and into your hearts he cast wahn
745315 this religion is easy none makes it hard upon himself except that it overwhelms him therefore be firm steadfast and balanced upon which have glad tidings seek help in this by journeying to allah at the beginning of the day at the end of the day and portion of the latter part of the night
745316 corruption has appeared on land and sea because of what the hands of humankind have earned so that allah may give them a taste of some of their actions in order that they may turn back to him
745317 the creation of the heavens and the earth is far greater than the creation of mankind but most of mankind do not know it
745318 it is he who has appointed you as viceroys in the earth
745319 serves you right act your age not your shoe size bla de bla
745320 let not those who are stingy in giving for charity from what allah has blessed them with think that it is good for them nay it is very bad for them all the wealth they hoarded with stingy behaviour will be hung around their necks like a collar on the day of resurrection it is allah who will inherit the heavens and the earth allah is well aware of all your actions
745321 my servant does not come close to me through anything more beloved to me than the obligatory deeds and my servant increases on those deeds until i love him
745322 the shaytaan comes between me and my prayers and my recitation confusing me therein
745323 that is a devil called khanzab if he affects you seek refuge in allah from him and spit drily to your left three times
745324 of the things of your world women and perfume have been made dear to me and my joy is in prayer
745325 and if an evil whisper from shaytaan satan tries to turn you away o muhammad from doing good then seek refuge in allaah verily he is the all hearer the all knower
745326 the prophets words that is a clear sign of faith means the fact that think of this waswaas as something terrible is a clear sign of faith for if you dare not utter it and you are so afraid of it and of speaking of it let alone believing it this is the sign of one who has achieved perfect faith and who is free of doubt
745327 they are speaking the truth for what would the shaytaan do with a house in ruins
745328 aamantu billaahi wa rasoolihi i believe in allaah and his messenger
745329 the shaytaan comes to one of you and says who created you and he says allaah then the shaytaan says who created allaah if that happens to any one of you let him say aamantu billaahi wa rusulihi i believe in allaah and his messenger then that will go away from him
745330 good yeah er i just wanted to ask you what a person has to do to become a muslim
745331 well i dont really know how to do anything and i dont know if i could do it all
745332 well you know it takes time and slowly slowly you learn more everyday and do more you cant be expected to do everything all at once or know everything all at once look at us even we are still learning
745333 so look do you believe that there is only one god and he alone deserves to be worshipped
745334 ok so are you convinced that he was a prophet of god the last messenger
745335 then you are already a muslim you just need to declare it so that you acknowledge it to god and to us muslims thats the shahadah youre testifying that there is nothing worthy of worship except allah the one and only god and that muhammad is the messenger of god
745336 so d are you ready you dont have to do it on the microphone or anything
745337 the most important thing now is to declare what you believe so that youll be counted as a believer because we dont know what could happen to any one of us when we walk out of this place tonight may allah protect us but we dont know when death will come
745338 yeah you say ash hadu allaa ilaaha illallah wa ash hadu anna muhammadan rasoolullah which means i bear witness or i testify that there is nothing worthy of worship except allah and i bear witness that muhammad is the messenger of allah ok
745339 ok so repeat after me well say it in arabic and then in english
745340 your colour is pale and sallow and your clothes have become worn and shabby
745341 dont cry for allah has sent your father with a mission which he would cause to affect every house on the face of the earth whether it be in towns villages or tents in the desert bringing either glory or humiliation until this mission is fulfilled just as night inevitably comes
745342 yes oh prophet of allah you indeed conveyed the message the whole world testifies
745343 youve made the right decision sister you wont regret it
745344 the punishment for those who are guilty of zinaa in barzakh i e after death and before the day of resurrection is that they will be in an oven the top of which is narrow and the bottom of which is wide a fire will be lit under it and they will be naked in that oven when the fire is lit they will scream and rise up until they almost come out of the oven then when the fire subsides they will go back down into it this is what will keep happening to them until the hour begins
745345 it is he who created u from dust and then from sperm and had appointer a term for u so that u may learn wisdom
745346 thou art the ruler of the minds of all people thy name rouses the hearts

745524 so youve lived here for over two years and have never come to realize that the speed limit for this area is 25 mph
745525 no i guess i just always assumed that it was 35 mph
745526 even so you were going 42 mph which is still 7 mph over 35 right
745527 please wait here in your vehicle sir ill be back with you in a moment
745528 the city must be real proud of you with all the money youre making for them
745529 im sorry sir i wasnt quite able to hear what you said right there
745530 well to be quite honest sir i think i heard you say something about how much money i was making for the city i assumed that i was mistaken since that is such a ludicrous statement one that i would never expect from a rational person such as yourself
745531 from a standard 124 fine the city gets about 45 that money is used to fund police court and prosecutor services as well as to help victims of crime about 5 goes to pay for medical services provided to people without insurance and the rest of the money goes to the state of washington i believe the state uses the money for educational programs traffic emphases vehicle theft prosecutions state level records management and the couple dollars left over is used for brain injury awareness unfortunately that leaves nothing for me
745532 so im funding a crooked state instead of a crooked city is that what youre telling me
745533 well sir my grandpa used to say that its better to strike a hard blow with a crooked stick then to spend all day trying to find a straight one

745571 despite a high coverage rate with two doses of mumps containing vaccine a large mumps outbreak occurred characterized by 2 dose vaccine failure particularly among midwestern college adults who probably received the second dose as school children
745572 honeymoon effect 1 in the 1984 measles outbreak 58 of school age children who had been vaccinated caught measles a w hedrich researched and published a study in 1933 on the patterns of measles in he surmised that the majority of children under 15 years of age who would catch measles would not go above 53 and would not drop below 32 during those 32 years would not have measles each time an outbreak ended 2 hedrichs research showed that the number of people in a community had nothing to do with the decline in virulence of the virus when an outbreak comes to an end measles is endemic and occurs whenever nature says its time epidemics have continued to occur even with high vaccine rate coverage and occur in both vaccinated and unvaccinated 2 where infants are concerned vaccinated mothers today do not have the full natural immunity to protect their infants in 1992 alone 22 2 of measles cases were in infants less than 12 months of age this was an increase from 19 2 in 1991 and 17 0 in 1990 in 1990 27 9 of reported cases occurred in children 1 4 years of age and 30 1 in 1991 in alone 75 of the cases were in children younger than 5 years old and 35 in children less than 12 months old in the opposite happened measles made up 49 of the cases in children 5 19 years old 3 according to the cdcs pink book measles chapter it is admitted that infants are now more at risk from measles during outbreaks than in the pre vaccination era in addition measles susceptibility of infants younger than 1 year of age may have increased during the 1989 1991 measles resurgence incidence rates for infants were more than twice as high as those in any other age group the mothers of many infants who developed measles were young and their measles immunity was most often due to vaccination rather than infection with wild virus as a result a smaller amount of antibody was transferred across the placenta to the fetus compared with antibody transfer from mothers who had higher antibody titers resulting from wild virus infection the lower quantity of antibody resulted in immunity that waned more rapidly making infants susceptible at a younger age than in the past
745573 infants whose mothers were born after 1963 are more susceptible to measles than are infants of older mothers an increasing measles
745574 if people had protection natural or vaccine acquired those exposures were actually helpful they acted as a sort of natural booster shot reminding the immune system to be on guard for this threat some experts now wonder whether these unrecorded natural boosts may have led the medical community to overestimate the durability of immunity generated by childhood vaccinations these days few people are getting natural boosting to these diseases
745575 however despite short term success in eliminating the disease long range projections demonstrate that the proportion of susceptibies in the year 2050 may be greater than in the prevaccine era present vaccine technology and public health policy must be altered to deal with this eventually

745587 one of the things ive always loved about nascar is that theres a sense of competition that was born with one family going against another family and another family and another family and theyre all from the same hometown and they ultimately got together and went down to daytona to race on the beach
745588 that basic sense of competition hasnt changed over the last 75 years so i have followed nascar

745594 it will be a mockery of justice to permit the accused to escape the extreme penalty of law when faced with such evidence and such cruel acts to give lesser punishment for the accused would be to render the justice system of the country suspect the common man will lose faith in the courts in such cases he understands and appreciates the language of deterrence more than the reformative jargon
745595 but an organised crime or mass murder of innocent people would call for imposition of death sentence as deterrence
745596 it is the duty of every court to award proper sentence having regard to the nature of the offence and the manner in which it was executed or committed
745597 security of persons and property of the people is an essential function of the state it could be achieved through instrumentality of criminal law undoubtedly there is a cross cultural conflict where living law must find answer to the new challenges and the courts are required to mould the sentencing system to meet the challenges

745931 wir gehen da nicht hin um uns selbst feiern zu lassen sondern es ist lediglich ein gro es dankesch n von uns spielern an die fans es ist ein sch ner ausklang einer em oder wm egal ob mit titel oder ohne
745932 wir haben als mannschaft entschieden dass wir dahin fahren weil die fans es verdient haben uns zu sehen
745933 ich habe bei der u19 em gemerkt dass diese feier einige spieler irritiert hat es war richtig sich bei den fans zu bedanken aber ich habe bauchschmerzen wenn wir uns f r eine sportliche niederlage feiern lassen ich habe das problem so etwas einem u19 nationalspieler zu erkl ren und dann vor einem finale den letzten siegerinstinkt rauszukitzeln
745934 die veranstaltung in berlin war keine siegesfeier sondern nur das dankesch n an unsere fans mit der veranstaltung in berlin haben die spieler auch in ihrer vorbildfunktion gegen ber den jugendspielern ein ganz wichtiges signal gesetzt

745941 the aim of marketing is to know and understand the customer so well the product or service fits him and sells itself
745942 marketing is the whole business seen from the customers point of view
745943 marketing is not only much broader than selling it is not a specialized activity at all it encompasses the entire business it is the whole business seen from the point of view of the final result that is from the customers point of view concern and responsibility for marketing must therefore permeate all areas of the enterprise
745944 drucker made crystal clear in the practice of management that business success and even the very definition of a business are determined by customers
745945 if you werent already in a business would you enter it today and if the answer is no what are you going to do about it

745962 if evolution doesnt wholly jazz someone religiously they should continue to reject evolution
745963 thank god for evolution how the marriage of science and religion will transform your world
745964 our trials are great opportunities but all too often we simply see them as obstacles if only we would recognize every difficult situation as something god has chosen to prove his love to us each obstacle would then become a place of shelter and rest and a demonstration to others of his inexpressible power if we would look for the signs of his glorious handiwork then every cloud would indeed become a rainbow and every difficult mountain path would become one of ascension transformation and glorification

746144 neither did i but carole was coming and i came with her and some other people from the womens center

746159 you will see our results gradually and steadily increase until they are on par with the other majors in this arena and soon after they will need to catch up to us
746160 you cannot persuade me there are not more disturbed or disgruntled persons with a political agenda in such a large group
746161 people given these kinds of responsibilities with this kind of power at their fingertips we have to make sure that they are not likely to do harm to others or misuse that authority be it intentionally or be it because of some mental problem
746162 these kinds of situations cry out for reexamination of our standards

746164 hiding it from your co workers that would have been very very difficult
746165 universities are pretty sloppy its an academic setting not a security setting
746166 youre basically going to scare off any scientist from wanting to work in this field if it becomes even more stringent
746167 it is a balance its a policy decision about how stringent we want to be
746168 one of the complaints by people who work in safety and security is they cant get the time of day from people running the labs
746169 are viewed as deeply offensive by a lot of scientists as if their patriotism is being questioned
746170 though several agencies have a need to know no one agency knows the number and location of these labs in the united states
746171 a rush of the public in a very small place
746172 we ask the public not to fall prey to rumors
746173 it is a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
746174 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
746175 if they could try something that could possibly work theyre going to try it
746176 the conversation always begins we know its not your fault but
746177 then people really get upset they just have to get it out

746183 the united states cannot stand apart attempting to control the world by violent military intervention
746184 we have a right to be there we were invited
746185 our role is not to police the planet a war that is not defensible even in military terms a war which is morally wrong
746186 yeah ill bet if he did hed use a spoon
746187 did you see those mccarthy students get clubbed and arrested

746285 jihadis leave their iraqi training ground for the real war
746286 iraq was nothing more than a country sized training ground for terrorist tactics and the surge provided the trainees with their last live targets before the real deal afghanistan
746287 iraq for al qaeda has been but one battlefield among many for bin laden it has never been the central front but rather a useful sideshow an unexpected opportunity to bleed the stumbling superpower even more
746288 the most important and serious issue today for the whole world is this third world war which the crusader zionist coalition began against the islamic nation it is raging in the land of the two rivers iraq the worlds millstone and pillar is in baghdad the capital of the caliphate
746289 likewise here is how ayman al zawahiri described the war in iraq in a letter to abu musab al zarqawi then al qaedas chief terrorist in iraq in 2005
746290 i want to be the first to congratulate you for what god has blessed you with in terms of fighting battle in the heart of the islamic world which was formerly the field for major battles in islams history and what is now the place for the greatest battle of islam in this era
746291 bin laden quickly grasped that iraq was a more important front than afghanistan in his global jihad and ordered many al qaeda forces to move there from afghanistan in 2003 according to taliban sources cited by newsweek bin laden sent emissaries to meet with taliban leaders in november 2003 to inform them that al qaeda was shifting resources and men from afghanistan to iraq in view of the high priority that al qaeda accords to iraq the u s cannot discount iraqs importance in the global struggle against terrorism premature withdrawal from iraq would demoralize the iraqi government tempt iraqi officials to strike deals with insurgents or defect to the insurgency and embolden al qaeda and other islamic militants to escalate their terrorist campaign using iraq as a sanctuary

746348 ordinary shyness could assume the dimension of a mental disease if a youngster is reserved the odds are high that a psychiatrist will diagnose social anxiety disorder and recommend treatment
746349 interferes significantly with the persons normal routine occupational academic functioning or social activities
746350 although definitions of the syndromes of shyness and social phobia may differ the distinction is difficult to make furthermore we should be skeptical about the potency and benefits of drugs for this condition
746351 everybody has some social anxiety so even though i see individuals of all ages with severe impairment i can understand some of the criticism of social anxiety as a categorical disorder
746352 social anxiety disorder is a real disorder in a small set of the population on the other hand because there are some medications now available for this disorder i believe it is being over diagnosed and that doctors do not rigorously or reliably apply the diagnostic criteria we do have

746358 im qualified to be a ceo and there is nothing like being a ceo once you have a taste its hard to give it up
746359 he has vastly more experience than i in the restaurant sector
746360 i wouldnt have been able to take us to the next level and he is the right person to do it
746361 i dont think going public is an end game but that could be a byproduct of all our hard work
746362 you go down the franchise path you lose some control and you have to be very cautious about it

746382 never attribute to malice what can be explained by stupidity
746383 and anyway peer review is a bit of a red herring theres plenty of papers out there that have been peer reviewed and are full of holes
746384 the inevitable question arises how did the journal editors and referees miss it that is to confuse the purpose of peer review somewhat peer review cannot be expected to detect every case of fraud particularly if it is carefully done its purpose is to review a papers originality that an appropriate approach has been used the conclusions are fair and that it is worth publishing its when other groups try to repeat work that fraud is more likely to become apparent in my view peer review is under pressure from very different and less publicized sources the burden on referees is reaching breaking point with more papers being published and increasing pressure to speed up the review process instead some method of successfully recognizing the valuable contribution of referees is needed that does not jeopardize impartiality
746385 in an unprecedented action representatives for more than 10 000 u s environmental protection agency scientists are calling on congress to take immediate action against global warming
746386 those scientists you call names would not appreciate your irreverence they number in the tens of thousands so im sure you could find a couple of crackpots in the bunch interestingly enough they say the same about the alarmist scientists
746387 click the audio button to hear a set of digits that can be entered instead of the visual challenge
746388 perhaps the most important conclusion to be drawn from our analysis is that the recent acceleration of global warming may not be occurring in quite the manner one might have imagined
746389 those scientists you call names would not appreciate your irreverence
746390 youre only young once but you can always be immature
746391 the contest for credibility between claimants and their critics in practise all members of the same community but adopting di erent roles according to the circumstances
746392 climate change science national academy of sciences global warming report fails to live up to its billing
746393 since the great majority of the incoming solar radiation incident upon the earth strikes the tropics any reduction in tropical radiative forcing has a disproportionate effect on mean global forcings
746394 the overlaps complicate things but its clear that water vapour is the single most important absorber between 36 and 66 of the greenhouse effect and together with clouds makes up between 66 and 85
746395 did lord monckton fabricate a claim on his wikipedia page
746396 models dont prove anything you just tamper with parameters to make your theory look good
746397 of the greenhouse effect co2 alone makes up between 9 and 26
746398 one way to quantify this is to take a radiation model and remove each long wave absorber this gives the minimum effect the complementary calculation using only each particular absorber in turn gives the maximum effect this isnt a perfect calculation but its quick and easy and is close enough to the right answer for our purposes
746399 each parameter is perturbed discretely and may assume one of two or three possible values which represent estimates of the extremes of the range of current uncertainty in the value of that parameter which were established
746400 if its not published in a reputable peer reviewed journal i dont bother reading it
746401 the earth will do this periodically anyway and that is irrefutable evidence based fact not some model based theory
746402 what is particularly interesting to me is how much more forgiving the models are on the high end of sensitivity than they are on the low end
746403 its possible to fiddle one parameter and get what youd like to see but read on to where they describe the limits when trying to match more than one
746404 values in excess of 50 c in australia india the middle east north africa the sahel and equatorial and subtropical south america at the end of the century
746405 i dont know but i havent studied it yet so i have yet to form a clear opinion what should i study to get more informed
746406 i dont yet understand this but its a good bet that the practioners consensus is as good an approximation as we have and if i care enough to express an opinion either ill go with the consensus by default or
746407 the problem is not that people arent hearing about climate change but that they dont want to know
746408 our results illustrate the need for a more robust understanding of the multiple feedbacks between climate forcing and plant and microbial feedbacks in the response of northern peatlands to climate change
746409 i am skeptical of agw but it is because i have yet to see a true smoking gun on this issue
746410 co2 that is of course where the 9 you refer to comes from
746411 i agree that for annual seasonal temperatue the distribution is symmetric but look where it is centered gt 5 if your goal is low not the one you want to upweight
746412 i am not a climate scientist but i do science research for a living this means that i would not be able to have a detailed discussion on the current research in the field but i would be able to spot something that didnt quite add up with my physical intuition
746413 sensitivity as determined by seasonal temperature does indeed favor a lower
746414 i have observed that some people who have genuine expertise in a particular field of knowledge imagine that this somehow bestows upon them expertise and insight regarding other fields of knowledge of which they actually know little
746415 its hard to make a model work with such a low sensitivity
746416 actually there is a recent paper in grl that argues for a climate sensitivity at the low end or lower of the ipcc projections see
746417 the need for a strong dust forcing simply melts away and the resulting climate sensitivity estimate of 2 3 9c is entirely unremarkable and completely consistent with what we already know
746418 e is radiant energy in watts per square metre per second wm
746419 attendance may be credited towards engineers australias continuing professional development cpd points
746420 seriously this intentionally cultivated misconception that mitigation is unaffordable is behind much denial
746421 some climate experts imagine they understand all the economic consequences of the mitigation requirements they propose one professional it might apply to would be james hansen
746422 that is the kind of economic denial i was talking about in 125 solar energy may be the solution eventually but good luck getting china india and brazil to stop building coal plants now
746423 our results illustrate the need for a more robust understanding of the multiple feedbacks between climate forcing and plant and microbial feedbacks in the response of northern peatlands to climate change
746424 the entire argument for continuing to burn fossil fuels for even one more day is based on economic denial
746425 ipcc ar4 states in effect that the concensus view is that the climate sensitivity is at least 2 k with 95 confidence
746426 the entire argument for continuing to burn fossil fuels for even one more day is based on economic denial
746427 it is likely to be in the range 2 c to 4
746428 what fraction of the human race would die of starvation if the above advice was followed
746429 actually i know an expert in that field that would love to discuss this with you
746430 what fraction of the human race would die of starvation if the above advice ending all fossil fuel use in one day was not followed
746431 what fraction of the human race would die of starvation if the above advice was followed
746432 egg headed near sighted girly men who read too much and who just want to sound important
746433 it seems to me it would be helpful for a clear and simple rebuttal of these kinds of ideas to be published
746434 doing that here doesnt help us amateurs understand the science
746435 needless to say the multiple errors completely undermine the conclusions regarding climate sensitivity
746436 there is just as much chance that the models are underestimating the severity of future warming as they are overestimating warming
746437 climate change is fundamentally a problem about uncertainty we are conducting an experiment with our planet by doubling co2 levels in the atmosphere from pre industrial levels concentrations have not been this high in hundreds of thousands of years by and large we dont know much about the implications tackling this uncertainty is crucial extreme outcomes fat tails matter and should be at the heart of much of research
746438 and how many people would die if we did that
746439 one should not cherry pick ones years the correct approach is to calculate the trend over a period of several years by linear regression
746440 the schmidt who did not bark in the night time
746441 am i alone in finding find him rather over sensitive to crticism of his ideas on climate sensitivity
746442 equilibrium sensitivity including slower feedbacks is of the order of 6 degrees c for doubled co2
746443 the falseclimate propaganda blog has launched a malevolent scientifically illiterate and unscientifically ad hominem attack on a publication by me
746444 much as right wingers might be unhappy with it nuclear war is still a bad idea
746445 if there are enough shovels to go around well be ok
746446 for the second time the falseclimate propaganda blog founded by two co authors of the now discredited
746447 the height of men walking through that door shows a pronounced downtrend
746448 monckton must move in some pretty sheltered circles it can be deduced from his sppi document in response to this posting that he thinks the following were ad hominem attacks
746449 i shall refrain from any ad hominem remarks of my own
746450 still mathematically moncktons 2001 2008 regression ought to have sufficient points for a mathematically accurate trend
746451 but tamino if you follow shaquille oneal through the door then saying the height of men walking through the door is in a downward trend is mathematically accurate
746452 you guys keep answering its statistically insignificant or misleading i knows dat wasnt what i was asking
746453 exxon mobil reported second quarter earnings of 11 68 billion the biggest quarterly profit ever by any u s corporation setting u s profit records has become commonplace for irving based exxon mobil the 11 68 billion topped its own u s record of 11 66 billion posted in the fourth quarter of last year right behind that was the 10 9 billion it reported to start 2008 exxon mobil owns the record for at least the top six most profitable quarters for a u s company as well as the largest annual profit
746454 classic denialist rhetoric as per usual and another flawed attempt to undermine ghg theory
746455 does the smoothed out global temperature measurements decrease between 1q 2002 and 2q 2008 the answer is a simple
746456 the numbers mean nothing until you know by what system they were measured
746457 until you know the systems variation you cannot predict the systems response
746458 al gore took care to ensure that hansens testimony to congress in the hot summer of 1988 was staged on a particularly hot day for maximum political effect
746459 does the smoothed out global temperature measurements decrease between 1q 2002 and 2q 2008 the answer is a simple yes or no and does not imply anything else
746460 i now realise i used the wrong word and gave you a misleading impression of my intention i apologise for the confusion it was unintentional to clarify i meant that the smoothed out figures decrease for the period concerned i understand that this is not a statistical trend and that monckton was in error if he claimed it was
746461 see even those rc people are admitting monckton was right 1
746462 does the smoothed out global temperature measurements decrease between 1q 2002 and 2q 2008 the answer is a simple yes or no and does not imply anything else
746463 al gore took care to ensure that hansens testimony to congress in the hot summer of 1988 was staged on a particularly hot day for maximum political effect
746464 but i was really just interested in the basic math operations
746465 does the smoothed out global temperature measurements decrease between 1q 2002 and 2q 2008 the answer is a simple yes or no and does not imply anything else
746466 cooling since 1998 claim is flatly wrong why would you have greater confidence in an analysis with 40 fewer samples
746467 that you guys can not seemingly mentally impossible to look at a graph of global temps which unquestionably and unequivocally shows the
746468 no really im just trying to get you to say decreasing temperature seriously we all agree it wont mean anything but just say it cmon say it whaddaya some kinda religious nut or something
746469 come up with a meaningful argument of why it is valid to cherrypick two dates calculate a slope report the value with no error bars and draw a conclusion based on that travesty of an analysis
746470 this friends while maybe not terribly important is interestingly and possibly sadly nothing short of defensive religion sadly because it frankly diminishes credibility
746471 a peoples history of the united states to set everyone nations tribes and ordinary individuals against each other
746472 want to know if the painter knew what he was doing is it red
746473 if i dont have others to compare its statistically meaningless
746474 there are 60 data points for something happening between 1995 and 2000 calculate and graph a least squares linear regression
746475 religion is always the last line of defense of those who do not have a real argument
746476 the linear fit produced a warming of 0 0349044 c for the entire decade
746477 whenever a parapsychology experiment seems to produce significant results tightening the controls eliminates the effect
746478 climate science hasnt proved that the warming is real or that humans are causing it there is no good data to support this its just the religion of environmentalists and a belief that falls apart under scrutiny the warming trend you claim to find is an artifact of flawed methodology or sloppy statistics and disappears when the data is more tightly controlled at best you need to do more research to prove that agw exists before i will accept it
746479 no the research is robust and has established that the warming is real and human activities are causing it the focus of research should now be on understanding how this phenomenon works in more detail
746480 the author provided a source for his data the hadcrut3 data set so i sat out to recreate the graph and managed to do so first of all while the used data did show a cooling trend my linear fit done with gnuplot produced a cooling of 0 00156427 c month extrapolated for an entire decade like the author has done this would translate into 0 00156427 12 10 c decade 0 1877124 c decade
746481 adam 190 et al is monckton incorrect in his temperature analysis
746482 any scientist who cant explain to an eight year old what he is doing is a charlatan

746485 you should write about david and all his awesome music
746486 we were told that the original land title given to us had included the swamp and a wetland
746487 its clear that the second land title of 108 acres is completely different from what had been issued to us in march 2007 and the minister richard nduhuura can testify
746488 the land title was taken from me that day and if it was reduced then i have to go back and ask why
746489 their land title is safe and nobody can interfere with it
746490 656 acres belonging to a hospital is like combining nakasero nakivubo up to wandegeya the argument that a hospital should have 656 acres is a lot of nonsense

746494 but your company sent me an email saying it shipped ups it provided me with a tracking number
746495 no kathy a technical error means that something didnt work correctly this is a falsehood there is a difference between providing the wrong tracking number and lying about which company you shipped with
746496 okay it was a technical error did the package even ship
746497 okay so what company did amazon ship this heavy weight item to me with
746498 what shipping company is currently in possession of my heavy weight item
746499 it is the shipping company we use for heavy weight items
746500 so the secret company that has my heavy weight item cannot be revealed to me
746501 i will fill out a form for them maam so that they will deliver your item
746502 the act of giving it to them and telling them to ship it to me wont get that done
746503 i dont understand i am filling out your form to get the heavy weight item to you
746504 kathy its a television we can say television cant we or is the secret company afraid this will lend some clue as to their identification
746505 yes maam i am trying to get this information so that i can fill out so that we can tell the shipping company what it needs to deliver to you
746506 kathy do you not know what company it is or can you noy tell me
746507 i cannot say it is the company we use for heavy weight items
746508 okay i give up what do you need from me to fill out your form kathy
746509 the one i gave you at the start of the call
746510 which i also gave you at the start of the call
746511 so basically you dont need anything else from me to fill out your form
746512 okay to summarize where we are my package has shipped with a company that needs a form to tell them to actually deliver the item you shipped to me you cant tell me the name of the company and they provide no tracking numbers
746513 i no i am going to fill out this form so that the item will get to you sooner maam
746514 okay lets try this at what point should i expect the package to get here
746515 i will fill out the form you will get it sooner
746516 no maam but if you want a call back i can fill out a form for a supervisor to email you or return your call
746517 email me or return my call im guessing the odds are id be getting an email isnt that right kathy
746518 how about this can i speak to your training assistant kathy
746519 the person who is telling you what to say to the difficult customer you have on the phone the one speaking with you in the background can i speak with them
746520 i cannot connect you with anyone else maam if youd like to get a call back or an email from a supervisor i can fill out the form
746521 no kathy lets not create a glut in the form room go ahead and fill out the shipping form and ill just consult my magic 8 ball each day for tracking information
746522 yes maam ill fill out this form and your heavy weight item shipper will get the item to you they will either send you an email or you will get the item
746523 they will either send me an email or i will get the item
746524 are they going to be asking for some kind of ransom in this email
746525 will they be revealing their identity in this email will i need a code word or decoder ring of some sort to recognize them
746526 okay so i will fill out the shipping form for the heavy weight item and you will get an email or the item
746527 thank you for calling amazon today is there anything else i can help you with
746528 i dont think we should tempt fate any more today kathy do you
746529 i yes no is there anything else i can help you with maam
746530 no kathy you have a good day and my condolences on your choice of employer
746531 wouldnt you feel different if you found out the guy was a serial killer
746532 you have to be sick to even think of having sex with a child

746534 having had the chance to examine in detail the circumstances surrounding richards death we are now reconciled to the fact that he did indeed take his own life we acknowledge that the amount of suffering and extreme hardship he witnessed first hand in many harrowing situations throughout the world proved too much for him to bear
746535 the death of this gifted colleague casts a fresh shadow over the crisis for democracy in zimbabwe

746538 a number of influential people in russia china india indonesia and vietnam say the planet is now entering a 30 year cooling period the second half of a normal cycle driven by cyclical changes in the suns output and currents in the pacific ocean their theory leaves true believers in carbon catastrophe livid to judge by actions not words the carbon warming view hasnt come close to persuading a political majority even in nations considered far more environmentally enlightened than china and india europes coal consumption is rising not falling and the continent wont come close to meeting the kyoto targets for carbon reduction australia is selling coal to all comers
746539 youre darned right they are and with good reason but whoa this body of science started settling core questions back when fourier sp asked his founding question in the 1820s and arhennius sp put the founding question to the test climate science is only uncertain how much pepper is in the shaker because it knows very well that the pepper is there

746542 while the basics of global warming are well established and our greenhouse gas emissions are causing the warming with many dire consequences there is still some scientific uncertainty about or debate on
746543 while human caused global warming is well established there is uncertainty about or debate on
746544 i simply hate when the line between the research and the politics becomes blurred
746545 then it devolves into agw promoters and denialists debates people will look at the debate and decide nobody knows whats going on
746546 i am a skeptic and do not have the knowledge to understand the papers even if i dug though thousands of them
746547 in his deposition cronkite said that an ethical journalist should resist directives that would result in a false or slanted story being broadcast
746548 he should not go a microinch towards that sort of thing that is a violation of every principle of good journalism
746549 dont believe anything you see in a tv documentary made in the uk
746550 the internet perceives censorship as failure and routes around it
746551 500 scientists with documented doubts of man made global warming scares
746552 i cant find what you claim pachauri said whered you find it mandatory doesnt always mean legally required
746553 an a priori determination not to accept the reality of anthropogenic global warming and an eagerness to grasp at any straw no matter how flimsy to support that determination is not
746554 why should i bother myself with talking to journalists who might distort what i say
746555 basically the combination of the transient response and the equilibrium sensitivity tells you something about how fast the climate will change as infrared absorbing gases increase and how extensive those changes will be the transient climate response sets a lower limit on the equilibrium climate sensitivity with the difference between the two apparently due to oceanic heat uptake rates upper bounds are somewhat poorly defined due to the likelihood of positive emissive feedbacks on the carbon cycle as temperatures increase these estimates are global averages actual temperature and precipitation changes in the real world will vary widely with latitude and with region
746556 so far without a pretty heavy amount of digging that reality is not presented in a clear cut way as you state
746557 add in people pushing political agendas by getting behind one view or another

746580 for almost a decade we have heard experts saying bangladesh will be under water but so far our data has shown nothing like this
746581 the rate at which sediment is deposited and new land is created is much slower than the rate at which climate change and sea level rises are taking place
746582 its not conducive to regrowing them its a one way process
746583 have any purpose other than to suggest the existence of nonexistent doubt that the shockingly rapid and massive changes in arctic ice are driven by anthropogenic global warming 31 july 2008 at 1 42 pm
746584 there are some here who are more satisfied spitting out venom and getting their off topic licks in tobacco right wing talk show hosts bush ii corporations big oil etc than converting a skeptic or two
746585 i can not tell who is right and who is wrong and niether side has really convinced me
746586 the take home message for me is that these ice shelves are not regenerating
746587 if were looking at an indicator of whether climate is to blame its really the lack of regeneration that convinces me theyre breaking away so rapidly that theres no hope of regeneration
746588 pretty strong evidence that suggests this is related to global warming
746589 i will protect you from those that want to undermine our way of life
746590 i want my cell phone ipod new car every 2 years and 2500 square foot home for me and my wife with cultivated lawn
746591 no man ever made a greater mistake by doing nothing when he could not do anything
746592 what are you personally doing in your life to solve the problem to clarify im not asking about your political actions or activism im talking about your personal choices
746593 homes are completely solar and wind powered or other renewables
746594 however everyone becoming vegan is not actually an effective nor practical solution though it would help somewhat
746595 i cannot stand pv as its a messy toxic disaster i am very pro nuclear power
746596 vulcan can be used to pinpoint co2 emissions down to the levels previously unseen gurney says the tool should not be used to affix blame
746597 ten years ago there might have been resistance to the notion of examining who is responsible for the co2 emissions in such a visually detailed way
746598 however what vulcan makes utterly clear is that co2 emissions cannot be exclusively affixed to suv drivers manufacturers or large power producers everybody is responsible we need to look for real solutions and have a deeper discussion about energy use its not about politics its about doing good science and solving the problem and we can all be a part of that
746599 lets suppose that i comply if i announce that i live naked in a hole and susbsist on dirt and twigs would you be satisfied or would you simply move the goalposts and take issue with the fact that i exhale co2
746600 the solar system is warming not just earth so it must be the sun at work not co2
746601 the final issue i see is that most people dont realize how mind numbingly ignorant they are
746602 there is a global resistance not to the facts but to environmentalists
746603 this spectacle of duelling and apparently contradictory science fuels the notion that scientists cant agree on anything
746604 is this inevitable or can scientists press officers and journal editors and journalists actually do anything about it
746605 radical enviros scientists in the employ of government and fat politicians with big carbon footprints who want to take over the world
746606 responsible defenders of capitalism who want to make sure that our economies are not gutted the poor are not trampled and science is not used to create bigger governments unless were really sure we need to act
746607 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years
746608 solar power has always been a limited far off solution now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon
746609 thats why i know this is going to work its so easy to implement
746610 the object of war is not to die for your country but to make the other bastard die for his
746611 quite frankly climate change is very bad news and we need people and bodies in the know to step up to the plate and put their money where their mouth is
746612 today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
746613 we are all in this together and we all need to tighten our belts and make sacrifices to save the planet
746614 can anyone here make the case that in order to accomplish mr gores goal that it wont take a governmental and societal effort exceeding any in our countries history
746615 that the real goal of the environmental movement is massive government intervention in the economy
746616 i think it is a reasonable statement that meeting mr gores goal would be a more difficult challenge than overcoming the great depression and world war ii combined
746617 i propose that before this year is out that we commit to mapping the denialist memome in the vein of human genome project all the memes that denialists trot out in place of actual thought
746618 just because something is difficult does not mean it should be ignored
746619 this paper examines the factors behind the rapid increase in internationally traded food prices since 2002 and estimates the contribution of various factors such as the increased production of biofuels from food grains and oilseeds the weak dollar and the increase in food production costs due to higher energy prices it concludes that the most important factor was the large increase in biofuels production in the u s and the eu without these increases global wheat and maize stocks would not have declined appreciably oilseed prices would not have tripled and price increases due to other factors such as droughts would have been more moderate
746620 i do think it is reasonable to make the statement that he al gore does speak for the agw cause
746621 because we will need solutions and so far only those who favor government intervention are proposing them
746622 so i will ask you directly do you believe this global warming event is human caused
746623 the continents will magically rise up and all will be well
746624 the false positive on agw mitigating it when it is not happening would be a great economic and environmental bonanza
746625 the resulting chaos could easily pose a far greater danger to the united states than we presently face from saddam
746626 we have always known that heedless self interest was bad morals
746627 public attitudes about climate change reveal a contradiction surveys show most americans believe climate change poses serious risks but also that reductions in greenhouse gas ghg emissions sufficient to stabilize atmospheric ghg concentrations or net radiative forcing can be deferred until there is greater evidence that climate change is harmful us policymakers likewise argue it is prudent to wait and see whether climate change will cause substantial economic harm before undertaking policies to reduce emissions such wait and see policies erroneously presume climate change can be reversed quickly should harm become evident underestimating substantial delays in the climates response to anthropogenic forcing we report experiments with highly educated adults graduate students at mit showing widespread misunderstanding of the fundamental stock and flow relationships including mass balance principles that lead to long response delays ghg emissions are now about twice the rate of ghg removal from the atmosphere ghg concentrations will therefore continue to rise even if emissions fall stabilizing only when emissions equal removal in contrast results show most subjects believe atmospheric ghg concentrations can be stabilized while emissions into the atmosphere continuously exceed the removal of ghgs from it these beliefs analogous to arguing a bathtub filled faster than it drains will never overflow support wait and see policies but violate conservation of matter low public support for mitigation policies may be based more on misconceptions of climate dynamics than high discount rates or uncertainty about the risks of harmful climate change
746628 accumulation is a fundamental process in dynamic systems inventory accumulates production less shipments the national debt accumulates the federal deficit
746629 here we demonstrate that poor understanding of accumulation termed stock flow failure is more fundamental in a series of experiments we find that persistent poor performance is not attributable to an inability to interpret graphs lack of contextual knowledge motivation or cognitive capacity rather stock flow failure is a robust phenomenon that appears to be a function of the mental models constructed and used when encountering a dynamic system we show that many including highly educated individuals with strong technical training use what we term the correlation heuristic erroneously assuming that the behavior of a stock matches the pattern of its flows we discuss the origins of stock flow failure and implications for management and education
746630 every living dynamic system is tied in some way to all other systems what happens at the macro level effects the micro level and vice versa with resonances equivalent to the relevance of the individual event
746631 heres the skinny on the revkin item as i read it in context with the what is reasonably understood in the science
746632 if they scientists had wanted to be in pr or sales theyd be there
746633 were in a good position right now going into the second round we wanted to be in the top two and we were able to accomplish that
746634 we got back to what really got us off to a good start and thats playing defense we got away from it the past two games we still got killed in the rebounds against ust but at the same time we got stops when we needed it down the stretch
746635 hes our best defensive player theres no question about that
746636 winning and doing it consistently are two different things we have to maintain that mindset
746637 im always satisfied when we play defense ust shot 27 percent today which is pretty good defense
746638 we decided to play jervy straight up we didnt want to double team him
746639 what we really wanted to do was shut down their shooters we felt that guys like clark bautista and jeric fortuna were getting a lot of wide open shoots because of the double teaming against jervy we tried to take away their perimeter game

746666 the notion that mcdonalds should abandon the positioning philosophy and instead adopt a brand journalism approach is lunacy

746678 but to the companys surprise a survey of more than 2 000 customers revealed that people didnt choose a bank on the basis of how convenient it was
746679 instead what customers wanted was a bank that demonstrably cared about them valued their business and recognized them as the same individuals no matter what part of the bank they did business with

746687 what i learned from sam walton how to compete amp thrive in a wal mart world
746688 i believe competitors who are losing the competitive battle against wal mart or who have already lost probably dont even understand the significance of the saturday morning meetings to competitive advantage its as if the company leadership has a management retreat every saturday of the year
746689 unless competitors are willing to go to a six day workweek and hold meetings with all their top executives each week to plot counter strategies i dont know how they can even think about competing directly
746690 run the pay week from thursday to wednesday so necessary labor cuts are made on the slowest retail days
746691 success strategies and tactics are easy to understand yet hard to duplicate
746692 by focusing constantly on trying to become more operationally efficient wal mart sets itself apart from its competitors
746693 wal mart isnt successful because of its strategies so much as because of its lockstep tactical execution of those strategies
746694 if you take care of your people your people will take care of the customer and the business will take care of itself

746699 scientists warn that there may be no ice at north pole this summer
746700 something about a volcano as big as vesuvius and if it could bury pompei it certainly could melt all that ice he went on to imply that scientists were ignoring this because of their hidden agenda who needs numbers when you have detailed analysis like this
746701 according to paleoclimatic records there is no evidence of an ice free summer arctic during the last 800 millennia
746702 much to their surprise scientists aboard the 2001 cruise dredged up rocks from the gakkel ridge that appear to have been chemically transformed by hydrothermal venting sensors on their dredging lines also detected whispers of warmer water chemicals and particles that are present in plumes of vent fluids that billow out from small vents the emphasis is mine

746714 snow extent and sea ice are also projected to decrease further in the northern hemisphere and glaciers and ice caps are expected to continue to retreat

746718 as long as the aeals and polar polar bears are alive they become co2 sinks since they need lots of fat for insulation to keep warm
746719 i have no idea what role this might play in a world with an ice free arctic ocean
746720 if there was a difference when a dominant nao vs pdo with the nao ocean current carrying higher ssts and saline ocean currents into the arctic region had differing results in regional melt i suspect it would be a good correlation for salinity playing a part

746732 munich re and its experts have been drawing attention to man made climate change and its effects since 1973 in the long term global warming will lead to a further increase in weather related natural catastrophes the financial impact of which will have to be borne by insurers and the public rapid international action is called for
746733 nasa now begrudgingly confirms that the hottest year on record in the continental 48 was not 1998 as previously believed but 1934
746734 the u s annual january december mean temperature is slightly warmer in 1934 than in 1998 in the giss analysis plate 6 this contrasts with the ushcn data which has 1998 as the warmest year in the century in both cases the difference between 1934 and 1998 mean temperatures is a few hundredths of a degree the main reason that 1998 is relatively cooler in the giss analysis is its larger adjustment for urban warming in comparing temperatures of years separated by 60 or 70 years the uncertainties in various adjustments urban warming station history adjustments etc lead to an uncertainty of at least 0 1 c thus it is not possible to declare a record u s temperature with confidence until a result is obtained that exceeds the temperature of 1934 by more than 0 1 c

746737 a cubic mile of molten rock like was launched by vesuvius on to pompeii converts to 4 186 billion cubic meters at a density of 3 000 kilograms per cubic meter that much molten rock works out to be approximately 1 25 x 1013 kg basaltic magma has a specific heat of 1 000 joules per kilogram per degree celsius in other words a kilogram of magma releases 1 000 joules of heat energy for every degree it cools until it transforms into a solid a kilogram of molten rock at 1350 degrees celsius therefore gives off 250 000 joules of heat as it cools to its crystallization temperature of 1100 degrees celsius passing through that phase from liquid to solid that kilogram releases another 400 000 joules of heat then as the solid rock cools from 1100 degrees to 0 degrees celsius it releases another 1 400 joules per degree or 1 540 000 joules in total one kilogram of molten basalt at a temperature of 1 350 degrees releases 2 19 million joules of heat into the surrounding atmosphere multiplying the weight of a cubic mile of lava by the heat energy released per kilogram and we find that a pompeii sized underwater eruption releases 2 739 x 1019 joules of heat into the sea one kilogram of ice at 0 degrees celsius requires the addition of 333 550 joules of heat energy to turn it into a liquid dividing that number into the quantity of joules of heat released by the volcano that we calculated above we find that the cubic mile of magma can melt roughly 82 trillion kilograms of ice a cubic meter of ice at 0 degrees weighs 917 kilograms so that works out to roughly 90 billion cubic meters of ice melted by our undersea volcano because of the shifting currents beneath the north pole the sea ice there is only two to three meters thick dividing 3 meters into the volume of ice that our volcano melted we find that it would cover an area of just under 30 billion meters square or a little less than 30 thousand square kilometers convert that into english and it works out to 11 532 square miles of ice three meters thick or an area about 10 larger than the state of massachusetts obviously ive made some simplifications like ignoring whatever effects the pressure of 13 000 feet of sea might have on the equation and i havent taken into account the change in melting point as a result of the salinity of the ocean but this is probably close enough to demonstrate that jonah goldbergs original question is worthy of much more analysis in short how much polar ice is melted by an undersea volcano a whole lot
746738 earth is not a museum but a geologically active place that reminds us frequently how relatively puny our activities are the whois voyage to the bottom of the sea shows it is climate alarmists who are skating on thin ice
746739 according to the article patrick michaels of the cato institute spoke at the 2008 international conference on climate change and said arctic temperatures were warmer during the 1930s and that most of antarctica is actually cooling now anthropogenic global warming apostles would have us believe the planet has never changed in all its history and suddenly man and his evil capitalistic oil company fed industry has plunged the planet into an unprecedented warming event that simply isnt the case the planet hasnt been sitting in a glass case all these years or in a museum as the idb article put it greenland wasnt so named as a joke it used to be warm enough for the vikings to plant vineyards but if youre already biased against capitalism and the west why let an inconvenient truth get in your way of a useful tool for bashing both
746740 but if youre already biased against capitalism and the west why let an inconvenient truth get in your way of a useful tool for bashing both
746741 a minor quibble with the krummy blog 217 he has neglected that he would have to heat a column of water roughly 4 3 km deep and several hundred km 2 in area so were talking a few degrees of heating at most now given that most of the deep ocean is right near freezing as well as salty and dense this heat will stay in the deep ocean and the ice will never see it
746742 why this has any implication for climate is mysterious to say the least
746743 on each occasion that the sun has done this in the past the worlds mean temperature has dropped by 1 2 c
746744 satellite data shows us that surface melt began earlier than usual over most of the arctic ocean see figure 4

746747 polar bears did not exist 125 000 years ago i believe
746748 figure 2 indicates that on a daily basis sea ice extent appears slightly higher than 2007 for most of the month this apparent contradiction arises because of the monthly averaging calculation and because some days may have areas of missing data june sea ice extents in 2008 and 2007 are essentially identical and near the lowest values for june ever recorded by satellite for the arctic

746756 summed up over the entire earth polar ice has remained constant
746757 i am an independent scientist engineer who has taken the time to analyze the data
746758 if someone wanted to present a case for a lot of recent warming adjusting data upwards would be an excellent way to do it
746759 when the data is calibrated in lockstep with a very high profile and public political philosophy we should at least be willing to ask some hard questions

746763 huh the tidal forces compared even to jupiter is miniscule
746764 a multi proxy approach to the analysis of deep sea sediment cores has been used to investigate paleoceanographical changes in the western arctic
746765 it is also possible that the isotopic composition of the planktonic foraminifera was influenced by enhanced sea ice formation and sinking of isotopically light brines during the early holocene this second hypothesis is compatible with reconstructions from dinocysts that suggest maximum sea ice extent during the early holocene
746766 numerous short sediment cores have been retrieved from the central arctic ocean many of which have been assigned sedimentation rates on the order of mm ka implying that the arctic basin was starved of sediments during plio pleistocene times
746767 during the cenozoic an open water arctic ocean changed to the modern permanently ice covered condition significant world climate modification accompanied this change but the precise role of the arctic ocean in major pleistocene climate events is controversial the present ice cover averages 3 m thickness but there are theories that during the pleistocene it was antarctic like several thousand metres thick the time of origin of the ice cover is placed as young as 0 7 myr ago and as old as the middle miocene
746768 the american engineers council for professional development ecpd the predecessor of abet 1 has defined engineering as follows
746769 the questions i have raised need to be answered they are completely legitimate questions formed from apparent contradictions and changes in dr hansens published data and public comments what is truly disturbing is that so few are asking them
746770 a number of death threats from zealous believers in catastrophic global warming
746771 for the first time in human history or so the experts at the national snow and ice data center nsidc in boulder colorado predict
746772 scientists warn that there may be no ice at north pole this summer
746773 been no net gain or loss of polar sea ice since records began
746774 the arctic is the first tipping point and its occurring exactly the way we said it would
746775 in 2004 dr hansen explained that most of arctic warming and melting is due to dirty snow from soot not co2
746776 our estimate for the mean soot effect on spectrally integrated albedos in the arctic 1 5 and northern hemisphere land areas 3 yields a northern hemisphere forcing of 0 3 w m2 or an effective hemispheric forcing of 0 6 w m2
746777 we suggest that soot contributes to near worldwide melting of ice that is usually attributed solely to global warming
746778 our estimate for the equilibrium global warming of current soot levels is 0 2 c most of which is already achieved
746779 most of arctic warming and melting is due to dirty snow from soot
746780 dr hansen also talks frequently about the unprecedented temperature rise in the arctic yet his own temperature records show that much of the arctic including greenland was warmer from 1920 1940 than now
746781 there was open sailing very close to the north pole that year
746782 what that hot burny thing hovering just beyond arms reach
746783 well what if after giving us intelligence he wanted to see if wed use it
746784 there are changes happening on mars jupiter saturn and pluto of similar nature warming
746785 actually there are changes happening on mars jupiter saturn and pluto of similar nature warming
746786 the blm decision had nothing to do with environmentalists and in any case was rescinded in short order given the overwhelmingly negative reaction from everyone
746787 anyone who thinks these issues are totally decided and not up for debate is delusional
746788 the real reason theyre having a water crisis in cali is not the water feed its pistachios
746789 we cant even predict the weather so how can we model climate
746790 so i am still making up my mind until i see better proof from either side
746791 exclusive no ice at the north pole polar scientists reveal dramatic new evidence of climate change it seems unthinkable but for the first time in human history ice is on course to disappear entirely from the north pole this year
746792 our estimate for the mean soot effect on spectrally integrated albedos in the arctic is about one quarter of observed global warming
746793 theres nothing to be necessarily alarmed about theres been open water at the pole before
746794 a large body of ice free water about 10 miles long and 3 miles wide near the pole
746795 i know that many of you believe we must act drastically now to curb the effects of global warming and because of that you cannot accept a
746796 the climate forcing due to snow ice albedo change is of the order of 1w m2 at middle and high latitude land areas in the northern hemisphere this compares with a global mean forcing by present anthropogenic co2 compared to preindustrial times of 1 5w m2 which is relatively uniform over the globe
746797 soot snow ice albedo climate forcing is not included in intergovernmental panel on climate change evaluations this forcing is unusually effective causing twice as much global warming as a co2 forcing of the same magnitude
746798 on the other hand our calculations exclude a factor that magnifies the soot warming effect melting snow tends to retain aerosols darkening the surface more in the late winter and spring when the sun is high in the sky and most effective thus increasing absorption and lengthening the melt season
746799 we arent sure what the oceans will do with this
746800 what gets us into trouble is not what we dont know its what we know for sure that just aint so
746801 paul you use 3 4 sentances where one word will do
746802 nasas published data is largely based on data from the us historical climatology network ushcn
746803 what gets us into trouble is not what we dont know its what we know for sure that just aint so
746804 in 2004 dr hansen returned to the subject this time he explained pdf that most of arctic warming and melting is due to dirty snow from soot not co2
746805 by any reasonable interpretation hansen did imply that most of the warming in the arctic is due to soot
746806 if you look at the info youll see that there was a great amount of debate but that the spherical concept did originate in the western world in the third century bc there were many people and many descriptions of the earth as being a flat sphere
746807 so i am still making up my mind until i see better proof from either side
746808 gavin im curious to hear your interpretation of this graph
746809 from the viewpoint of science the north pole is just another point on the globe but symbolically it is hugely important there is supposed to be ice at the north pole not open water
746810 the issue is that for the first time that i am aware of the north pole is covered with extensive first year ice ice that formed last autumn and winter id say its even odds whether the north pole melts out
746811 indeed for the arctic as a whole the melt season started with even more thin ice than in 2007 hence concerns that we may even beat last years sea ice minimum well see what happens a great deal depends on the weather patterns in july and august
746812 experts at the national snow and ice data center nsidc in boulder colorado predict
746813 you are not completely sold on agw you must not comprehend science or else you would see the truth as i do
746814 to those of us who arent believers there is a lot of debate and there are a lot of legitimate questions that frankly those of us who look at it from the outside have for the debate to be over it has to be accepted science
746815 the chemical you can add to water to make it burn like gasoline
746816 i think there are some plausible natural explanations for the climate change
746817 we see a tipping point occurring right before our eyes the arctic is the first tipping point and its occurring exactly the way we said it would
746818 our estimate for the mean soot effect on spectrally integrated albedos in the arctic is about one quarter of observed global warming
746819 so theres essentially no prospect of a negative forcing that will outweigh co2 over the next 50 years or more
746820 no matter how many times you write that climate science is a young field you will still be wrong it isnt deal with it
746821 the fact that the models have more recently been adjusted to match empirical evidence in the antarctic does not negate my point
746822 their study shows that the time dependent response of zonal mean surface temperature differs significantly from its equilibrium response particularly in those latitude belts where the fraction of ocean covered area is relatively large based upon the study they conjectured that the response in the southern hemisphere should be delayed as compared to that in the northern hemisphere because of the inter hemisphere difference in the fraction of the area covered by the oceans
746823 they found that the increase in surface temperature is very small in the circumpolar ocean of the southern hemisphere in contrast to high latitudes of the northern hemisphere where the increase is relatively large
746824 however the detailed analysis of the numerical experiment reveals that the absence of substantial surface warming in the circumpolar ocean is attributable not only to the large fraction of the area covered by the oceans but also to the deep penetration of positive temperature anomaly into the oceans
746825 figure 3 also reveals that there is a large asymmetry in surface warming between the two hemispheres in the northern hemisphere the surface warming increases with increasing latitude and is particularly large in the arctic ocean this is in sharp contrast to the southern hemisphere where warming is relatively large in low latitudes and decreases with increasing latitudes it becomes small in the circumpolar ocean of the southern hemisphere particularly in the immediate vicinity of antarctic continent
746826 one can ask why the polar amplification of warming does not occur in the southern hemisphere despite the existence of extensive sea ice which has a positive albedo feedback as discussed in the following section the absence of significant warming in the circumpolar ocean of the southern hemisphere is attributable mainly to the large thermal inertia of the ocean which results from very effective mixing between the surface layer and the deeper layers of ocean in this region this is in sharp contrast to the arctic ocean where very stable layer of halocline prevents mixing between the surface layer and the deeper layer of the ocean
746827 in view of the absence of significant surface warming it is not surprising that the area coverage of sea ice hardly changes in the circumpolar ocean despite the co2 doubling
746828 the ph of the ocean water has dropped to 7
746829 earths energy imbalance confirmation and implications science 308 1431 1435
746830 is our knowledge and understanding of the climate system and its response to enhanced greenhouse gas forcing sufficient for us to make informed policy decisions with respect to our emissions and their future consequences
746831 i see a lot of very sloppy discourse going on over here and am disappointed
746832 anyway rather than playing semantic games about whether the science is young or old and highlighting areas of residual uncertainty as if these negated an assessment of
746833 is our knowledge and understanding of the climate system and its response to enhanced greenhouse gas forcing sufficient for us to make informed policy decisions with respect to our emissions and their future consequences
746834 when someone shows me that i am wrong i usually thank them for their efforts this is one reason why i am still happily married
746835 the temperature shown on the image is the temperature of the camera and may be warmer than the surrounding air temperature think about how your car heats up on a sunny day
746836 very few folks working in climate science at least through the 19th century hardly anyone paid those few folks any heed so couldnt be an established science
746837 no matter how many times you write that climate science is a young field you will still be wrong it isnt deal with it
746838 for example i could make a solution from sodium chloride and dissolved carbon dioxide and also make the exact same solution from sodium carbonate and hydrochloric acid
746839 and why do you think the measured increase in co2 partial pressure in the ocean is insufficient to explain the observed declines in ph and ta
746840 what acids do you think would be produced by bacteria
746841 there is little or no empirical evidence that the arctic is behaving any differently than during the last warm period in the 1940s temperatures are no higher across most of the arctic than they were 70 years ago
746842 dissolved co2 concentration usually refers to the sum of the dissolved gas and carbonic acid the latter being so minimal as to safely ignore it in most calculations e
746843 the claim in the independent that the north pole has never been ice free before has propagated all over the internet and major news sources and the inconspicuous withdrawal of that text from the article has gone unnoticed the damage was done and is irreversible
746844 three attack submarines navigated under the ice to surface at the north pole last spring in the most ambitious expedition mounted until that time
746845 the periscope and a seamans eye were the best tools we had for finding friendly ice
746846 instead of sliding up the way you do in open water
746847 you lower the periscope and go blind for a while its a tense moment sometimes when the ice is thin you crack it and slip right through at other times you bump up through thicker ice and then stop like an elevator stopping if you dont go right through you listen for the ice cracking like ice cracking in a glass when you pour a drink on it

746852 the aim of this work was to determine the characteristic effective uv range surface albedo of various land cover types when covered by snow
746853 fresh pure snow uv albedos near unity have been reported grenfell et al 1994 wuttke et al 2006
746854 peak values of incident ultraviolet irradiance occurred in mid june
746855 observations of the incident ultraviolet irradiance on the sea ice in the arctic ocean are sparse also lacking is information on the partitioning of the incident ultraviolet light between reflection to the atmosphere absorption in the snow and ice and transmission to the ocean
746856 the interaction of ultraviolet light with arctic sea ice during sheba
746857 how much of the polar ice gets some surface melt
746858 since ultraviolet light burns our skin and eyes and tender vegetation does not this radiation raise tropospheric temperature at the ground level
746859 i categorically reject the term denialism in the context of climate science
746860 the pages working group wg on arctic climate during the last two millennia arctic2k was launched in march 2008 to generate and synthesize high resolution paleoclimate data to assess and elucidate both the timing and variability of the arctic climate change during this period
746861 our knowledge as made us cynical our cleverness hard and unkind we think too much and feel too little more than machinery we need humanity more than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness without these qualities life will be violent and all will be lost
746862 the employment of rhetorical tactics to give the appearance of argument or legitimate debate when in actuality there is none
746863 the tactical unwisdom of throwing the simile around as more people may be offended mistaking it for hyperbole than convinced

746886 there are rigorous rules in place for our beaches and pools for how many lifeguards we need and how they must be deployed

746901 i have seen your blog liked what youre doing and am linking it weve gone through a similar transformation
746902 is it a good thing to watch intervention should i be fascinated by the collapse of another human being because of drugs or alcohol or something just as debilitating
746903 i have this problem someone told me i should use a regular expression
746904 its imperative that we do something and do it now
746905 id say 95 to 98 per cent of the people want this to sit and wait until homes wash into the ocean is not an option
746906 we have a nice view if they build dunes higher it would go
746907 i dont know the statute on paying taxes on your home if its in the ocean

746909 its not fair for a handful of people to jeopardize everyone elses property in the borough
746910 when you look at oceanfront property there are three things any property owner is interested in
746911 number 1 and the most important is the view of the ocean number 2 is access to the ocean and number 3 is the breeze which is an important factor a lot of people dont like to use their air conditioning they say the evening breeze off the ocean is something special

746915 theres a whole new generation of young people that were born with hiv that are reaching adulthood it presents very interesting challenges
746916 they cant talk about their diagnosis in the school because they can be kicked out they cant talk about it in their communities with their neighbors
746917 we need to start getting young people involved in leadership again in hiv and aids because its easy to get kind of complacent
746918 i want to congratulate all the boys and girls who have graduated and got good grades
746919 sometimes i have so much fun that i forget i have this
746920 as these delegates go about the important business of the convention i believe party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories
746921 this underscores the need for a fairer and more sensible process for selecting presidential nominees
746922 we have always been confident that michigan would have a full delegations and a full vote
746923 young womens breasts are dense and if they get mammograms their breasts show up very white on mammograms and cancer shows up as white
746924 but as women get older their breasts are less dense and show up gray on a mammogram which makes it easy to identify the white cancer if there is a family history and women are worried they can start earlier and in this case a digital mammography may work better than a traditional mammography
746925 in fact most of the women who get mastectomies dont need them
746926 and for women to lose their breasts in addition to the normal emotional turmoil that they go through having breast cancer is harmful emotionally and physically
746927 women with early stage breast cancer usually do not need a mastectomy and will benefit from chemotherapy almost always
746928 women who get a lumpectomy will need radiation and thats the difference women who get a mastectomy will not need radiation but with a lumpectomy you always need radiation
746929 breast cancer in women younger than 30 is so rare and this is one of the things that concerns me
746930 i think the media focuses on young women because its so shocking when someone in their 20s gets cancer but what you end up with are women in their 20s and 30s who are terrified that theyre going to get cancer and women in their 50s who think they dont need to worry about it when the opposite is true
746931 its still a significant number but when you compare it to the overall number of women who get breast cancer its a small percentage
746932 what makes it fatal is if it goes into other parts of the body and gets into the lymph nodes lungs and other organs
746933 also if it gets into the blood or the bones it can kill a person thats the risk of metastasized cancer that means it has spread and once it hits the lymph nodes it can become out of control

746961 youve got to step it up if you want to be in the hunt
746962 you dont want to be in the hunt go home take an early vacation come back for spring training well bring some kids up to play we should be embarrassed im not sure enough people are
746963 we wanted to set a tone coming into the new month and i think we did that
746964 the teams been revived i dont think it was a matter of anyone coming or anyone going
746965 hes done a great job playing great defense and getting on base
746966 thats why they brought him here they thought he could come out and help this team win and thats what hes doing
746967 one of the things we talked about was not looking back or looking forward just attacking whats at hand
746968 i think where were at right now we can be pretty darn good
746969 but we did get a few home runs here which weve been lacking
746970 he threw a 100 pitches in the first few innings
746971 we had a lot of guys on base but just didnt capitalize on it
746972 weve just got to come out and continue playing good baseball
746973 we definitely had some opportunities we really didnt take advantage of them
746974 but i feel real confident that well turn this around and swing the bats the way were capable of
746975 we dont want to be scoreboard watching later on we dont want to wait til september to make our move we have to push ourselves and get it going again
746976 we should be ok some of the guys i wont say they were pressing but in situations we werent getting hits
746977 weve got to find a way to get better at that
746978 their bullpen came in and it seemed like this whole series they shut us down
746979 its a play ive made so many times i just didnt come up with it i know bright sky and all that stuff but i didnt make it
746980 im comfortable here its good to be with a ballclub with so many great hitters
746981 i see these guys and the at bats they have and maybe it rubs off on me i just sit and watch
746982 a couple of tough hops for the guys we have nobody to blame but ourselves
746983 we talk about a lot of things but right now raz is in the rotation
746984 sitting there on the bench for a week just watching is hard to do
746985 i feel great ive been feeling pretty good the last two or three days
746986 i try not to throw a lot of pitches in the bullpen
746987 he has one of the best changeups ive ever seen
746988 he throws an 86 fastball that looks like a 95
746989 i came here for an opportunity and i want to stay here in the starting rotation
746990 i dont care if its no 1 or no 2 or no 5
746991 he clutched it up in that one inning when they had runners on second and third and one out to get out of that jam and not give up one run is really something
746992 this may sound stupid but i thought that was one of bens better outings for a while
746993 he pitched six innings and kept us in the game he didnt have a finishing pitch
746994 hes improved so much his arm strength you know its not what it was before he first got hurt but it was pretty close
746995 we made him work a little bit there in the middle innings but we didnt take advantage of it that was really the difference for us
746996 thats a good start to having him back in the rotation
746997 in the fifth inning and sixth inning i got the ball up a little bit
746998 they made me pay they put some good swings on the ball
746999 afterward if the report is a little positive then thats real important
747000 if its real negative thats important if its somewhere in between then were probably making too much of it

747007 are emerging significantly in the palm cement starch fuel switch geothermal hydro and biogas sectors
747008 asia is experiencing a period of rapid economic growth and governments across the region are striving to meet the ever rising energy demands of their populations and industries
747009 this need for more energy coupled with rising oil prices increased consumer awareness on environmental issues and the certain threat of climate change make an excellent case for sustainable energy and to ensure that asia leapfrogs onto a clean technology development path
747010 they have a long way to go before their full potential to immerse into carbon trading is realized
747011 do you think youre going to be comfortable next year in the democratic caucus
747012 china and india with their rapid growth with dirty sources of energy principally coal and other hydrocarbons based sources is a problem
747013 i certainly see global warming as a threat and a threat to our well being in the future and yes in that sense a national security threat
747014 i think that we recognize that it has a strong human element but then the question becomes what do you do about it once youve said that
747015 i know its still being reported that we were talking about delaying some aspects of the constellation program to pay for our early education program
747016 i told my staff were going to find an entirely different offset because weve got to make sure that the money thats going into nasa for basic research and development continues to go there that has been a top priority for us
747017 barack obama understands how critical nasa is to americas scientific and economic edge
747018 that is why we have an alternative offset to pay for his early edcuation plan by reforming and reducing earmark spending reforming federal contracting procedures
747019 its the most natural way to allow the ecosystem to perpetuate itself
747020 we dont put a blindfold on and look the other way
747021 but when such a fire does encounter one of those areas where theyve done prescribed burns itll change its intensity itll drop to the ground and allow firefighters to get a handle on it
747022 the old policy was to put the fire out as quickly as possible keep it to the smallest size the shortest duration
747023 thats not humanly possible any more in the midst of climate change invasive weeds urban sprawl and a lot of careless recreationists
747024 then they said 2070 and then they said 2050 and then they said 2030
747025 not only do i see the change but its like theyre moving the goalposts toward me and its an amazing thing
747026 we might see an ice free arctic ocean by the year 2030 within some of our lifetimes
747027 there are some scientists out there who think that even might be optimistic
747028 as near as we can tell looking at the historical record theres been ice in the arctic in the summer for at least 16 million years
747029 theres a group that makes a very strong case that in 2012 or 2013 well have an ice free summer arctic as soon as that its astounding whats happened
747030 as the ice recedes its opening up not only the arctic passage but all the resources in the arctic ocean
747031 we could think of the arctic as the refrigerator of the northern hemisphere climate system
747032 what were doing by getting rid of that sea ice is radically changing the nature of that refrigerator were making it much less efficient but everything is connected together so what happens up there eventually influences what happens in other parts of the globe
747033 the arctic really can feed back into the global climate system
747034 you know what happens when you get feedbacks you get surprises and we dont like surprises
747035 a race has developed between the waning sunlight and the weakened ice
747036 a combination of these two forces led to what we observe now and we should not ignore either forces
747037 there have been numerous models run that have looked at that and basically they cant reproduce the ice loss weve had with natural variability
747038 you have to add a carbon dioxide warming component to it
747039 we should care in the sense that what happens here is coming to us and sometimes you know a warning is a helpful thing to mobilise people
747040 there have been two conferences one was the ecumenical basically all the faith based organizations and church based groups that are attending the international aids conference and then there was a child focus symposium as well that included all the child focus ngos agencies and donor governments representatives so basically anybody whos basically interested in how children are being affected by hiv and aids

747060 thats a good start to having him back in the rotation
747061 in the fifth inning and sixth inning i got the ball up a little bit
747062 they made me pay they put some good swings on the ball
747063 it was a good race for us today we got a decent start on the rockstar makita suzuki gsx r1000 and the guys got out there i didnt want to let them get in a rhythm so i pushed past as quick as i could and wanted to set my pace we made a couple changes this morning and i realized i had a bike that was capable of going a little bit quicker than yesterday so i wanted to get out there and get the most out of it while i could i opened up a gap and was able to hold on at the end
747064 we got a way better start than yesterday and i got into the lead and tried to go as quick as i could then mat came by and i got in behind him and i was riding as hard as i could but then i settled into a pace that was good for me the rockstar makita suzuki gsx r1000 was working a little better today than yesterday but we just didnt have the quick laps in the middle of the race overall the bike was working a little bit better and i was feeling a little bit better too
747065 things were a little bit better today than yesterday more normal we at least got to go the full distance my crew made some changes overnight to the rockstar makita suzuki gsx r1000 and it was faster today it was quite a bit faster today im happy with today because we improved all weekend long we were a little bit behind because we missed the test at this track while i was injured but we made small improvements all weekend now im looking forward to the test at road atlanta next week and getting back to normal

747122 is belief in jesus the only way to get to heaven
747123 we who practice the christian tradition understand him as our vehicle to the divine but for us to assume that god could not act in other ways is i think to put god in an awfully small box
747124 the faith that was once for all entrusted to the saints
747125 speaks authoritatively not only on what things are true but on the nature of truth itself
747126 for this reason i was born and for this i came into the world to testify to the truth jn 18 37 truth decay p 63
747127 we who practice the christian tradition understand him as our vehicle to the divine
747128 for christians we say that our route to god is through jesus that doesnt mean that a hindu doesnt experience god except through jesus it says that hindus and people of other faith traditions approach god through their own cultural contexts
747129 simply what we as individuals and as communities make it to be and nothing more
747130 i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me

747164 its sad to say theyre at the veterans day sales and the movie theaters
747165 they decided theyd just rather have a ceremony at city hall plaza because there wouldnt be any participants in the parade plus the crowds wouldnt be there on a friday afternoon
747166 if lack of participation is the reason then i guess that says a lot
747167 if thats the way things are its just a shame
747168 a lot of people are pissed off to be very frank about it
747169 this was the first time in all these years they never had a veterans thing as far as the parade goes

747198 my perception is that it is a way to engage families and parents in being their childs first teacher
747199 i think developing those parenting skills is important and even as educators we still enjoyed the program a great deal
747200 when youre a parent for the first time or even for a second or third time its important to have an objective person come in and guide you through what to expect
747201 we know that greater family involvement in a childs learning is critical to their development which is why parenthood is such an important and rewarding responsibility
747202 to help empower parents to succeed as their childs first teacher we have worked to expand the parents as teachers program and encourage parents of young children to participate
747203 its nice for parents to be able to say this is what my childs doing is this normal what should i expect
747204 its good at pointing out those milestones and helps with the neurological development its getting a good understanding to parents

747208 the guilty plea ensures the defendant will be sentenced for his actions and simultaneously negates any possibility of appeal
747209 as with any case involving ongoing confrontations between two people who know each other the incident usually involves poor choices and confrontations by both parties to the incident
747210 for that reason the law provides that an act which was intended to cause physical injury which results in the death of one of the individuals is voluntary manslaughter if the person was acting in response to a confrontation or provocation by the victim
747211 the law makes the actions of the victim relevant to the response and decision making by the defendant
747212 by this plea the family is assured the matter is concluded we have avoided the appeal that would follow any conviction at trial and reached the same result as would have occurred had a trial actually been held
747213 originially when the class started they had around 20 participants

747218 i hope that they gain a better understanding of what the area has to offer to people
747219 but i also hope they gain the ability to become a leader in the area because of the knowledge that theyre learning from the program
747220 being elected prioress was something i wasnt expecting at all

747224 i lead the prayers and meetings i am responsible for organizing the things that go on at the convent as well as the administration and official business for our community there is a lot of paper work involved i have never been that good at paper work this really is a learning experience
747225 we discuss what our goals are what we might need in leadership in the next four years there is much prayer and discussion and then we elect who we think will best serve in that position for the next term

747241 gt a group of maryvilles head start students visited the conception wind farm last friday as part of their week long energy learning experience through the energy and weatherization department at community services inc
747242 when eric got on the bus he asked the kids do you know what these meaning the wind turbines are for
747243 and right away several of the kids said to save energy
747244 some of them even responded by saying to save mom and dad money they are very intelligent
747245 kids are a lot smarter than we give them credit for

747255 it would be great if someone could provide a patch for this undocumented swtich function to disable it forever
747256 although you can access this function by using loadlibrary and getprocaddress combined in microsoft windows versions prior to windows xp the function is not accessible using the standard include file and library linkage
747257 it is off topic so do not post any comments about it
747258 virus and malware scanners are the most obvious programs to have a somewhat valid reason to do it the only other things i can think of simply do it to be obnoxious

747270 a misconfigured copy of excel resulted in an error message that by all indications looked like an explorer bug
747271 the real problem here is that explorer is displying a misleading error message which leads to a very unpleasant user experience
747272 so far as the shell was concerned it was sending the command that excel registered as the please send me this command when you want to open a document and yet when explorer sent that very command excel responded with huh

747286 if you dont like suvs dont buy one but dont tell other people who can afford the vehicle and the requisite gasoline that they cant drive them
747287 absolutely robert most sensible people want manufacturers to stop making
747288 we own a suv but never wanted to own one local laws mandated we had to have full sized child seats for our three children guess the soccer emblems on the back at least let people know we use it for family purposes
747289 as a result suvs sit in this sweet spot where they get to pretend theyre a truck when its advantageous to be a truck avoiding cafe regulations and pretend that theyre a car when its advantageous to be a car highway regulations
747290 as i noted it looks like economic forces have solved the problem on their own
747291 absolutely robert most sensible people want manufacturers to stop making environment destroying deadly often less safe in accidents than well designed cars and much more dangerous to pedestrians since they are higher and weigh up to 3 times as much over sized vehicles for the convinience of some 25 of americans
747292 many cities prohibit parking heavy vehicles e g over 3 tons in residential areas one city ticketed a bunch of residents for parking their suvs in the neighborhood this led to a debate over whether the gross vehicle weight or the curb weight should apply one city council member said it should be the weight thats used in the cafe classifications

747304 canada claims the telephone because bell lived in canada at the time he was inventing it seems reasonable to me

747333 there are beliefs taught with varying degrees of authority a
747334 subjectivity is the realm where we find that very special sense of existence
747335 has very much to do with how we think of ourselves how we behave how we think about our behavior the idea is that freedom has to do with making choices it has to do with deciding how you are going to live your life freedom also has to do with taking consequences once you have made your choice you cant say i didnt anticipate that i dont take responsibility for that having chosen you are then responsible for what follows as well
747336 realizing what your particular talents and virtues are falling in love with yourself in a very important way and understanding what your life is about manifesting those virtues manifesting those talents passionately throwing yourself into the work you do and as he put it borrowing from the ancient greeks becoming the person that you really are

747341 i f we use a large discount rate they will be judged to be small effects
747342 a series of studies on the impacts of climate change have systematically shown that the older literature overestimated climate damages by failing to allow for adaptation and for climate benefits
747343 failed to mobilize an expert group that could credibly identify and communicate a true consensus of expert knowledge on the range of issues under consideration
747344 a substantial contribution to our understanding of important issues facing the world
747345 the panel that drew up the copenhagen consensus was asked to allocate an additional us 50 billion in spending by wealthy countries distributed over five years to address the worlds biggest problems this was a poor basis for decision making and for informing the public by choosing such a low sum a tiny fraction of global income the project inherently favoured specific low cost schemes over bolder larger projects it is therefore no surprise that the huge and complex challenge of long term climate change was ranked last and that scaling up health services in poor countries was ranked lower than interventions against specific diseases despite warnings in the background papers that such interventions require broader improvements in health services
747346 experience shows that pledges and actual spending are two different things in 1970 the un set itself the task of doubling development assistance since then the percentage has actually been dropping
747347 but even if sachs or others could gather much more than 50 billion over the next 4 years the copenhagen consensus priority list would still show us where it should be invested first
747348 generally towards the right and to the extent that they had stated views to be opponents of kyoto
747349 sachs disparaged the consensus dream team because it only consisted of economists but that was the very point of the project economists have expertise in economic prioritization it is they and not climatologists or malaria experts who can prioritize between battling global warming or communicable disease

747391 bloop and a blast is what we kept saying in the dugout bloop and a blast were in the ball game
747392 we had the upper hand seven innings of the game
747393 we didnt do a very good job of finishing the game from an offensive standpoint we scored the first two innings and didnt score again we have to keep the pressure on and put another run on the board

747447 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
747448 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
747449 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
747450 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
747451 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage

747480 the wine has a bright straw yellow colour it displays a floral aromatic citrus character with pronounced minerality matured on the lees in stainless steel tanks which will impart more complexity and body into the wine ideal summer drinking
747481 let me be very clear on this we require the different media have the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games and i am adamant in saying there has been no deal whatsoever to accept restrictions
747482 ioc officials negotiated with the chinese so that some sensitive sites would be blocked on the basis they were not considered games related
747483 our requirements are the same from host city to host city and remain unchanged since the ioc entered into a host city contract with beijing in 2001
747484 when beijing was awarded the games the ioc required it to provide media with the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games the ioc required this and this is what bocog beijing organising committee for the games of the xxix olympiad has said it will deliver
747485 i am not going to apologise for something that we are not responsible for we are not running the internet in china the chinese are running the internet in china

747491 we underestimated the number of firewalls out there that were deployed in front of dns servers
747492 cisco juniper citrix and a number of other firewall vendors have been absolutely scrambling to update their equipment
747493 if you have a pat firewall the best thing you can do is look through our document understand how our network is configured and if you need the fix thats provided then install the fix
747494 but at least there are no more deniers out there muddying the waters with the overblown not urgent message
747495 the difficult news this morning is that we thought we were getting a patch but we havent gotten anything
747496 essentially were at the same place as we were yesterday before apple released the patch
747497 so apple might have fixed some of the more important parts for servers but is far from done yet as all the clients linked against a dns client library still need to get the workaround for the protocol weakness
747498 this update addresses the issue by implementing source port randomisation to improve resilience against cache poisoning attacks
747499 for mac os x v10 4 11 systems bind is updated to version 9 3 5 p1 for mac os x v10 5 4 systems bind is updated to version 9 4 2 p1
747500 is apple modifying the bind distributions from isc and somehow didnt realise this repercussion or is there some kind of configuration file that they forgot to change it must be one of those two
747501 if you take the bind distribution from isc and patch your system on a linux box youre patched

747504 what point am i trying to make with this post
747505 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
747506 our situation is that we either face the storm here addressing the difficulties in the next two days or find the storm ahead when we have returned home i dont think the difficulties will go away
747507 i hoped we would be able to talk about the very serious things
747508 level of conflict fear mistrust and frustration hasnt allowed it
747509 the frustration that i have and i think other canadians have is that i asked point blank in the second session around the windsor continuation group for canada to be heard in this conference
747510 if youre going to have a hearing you sit and listen and you allow a church a province to tell its story
747511 let every single voice be heard but we need action something concrete
747512 do something rather than live down to the worst expectations of the bishops who stayed away
747513 we need to negotiate a separation in the communion sooner rather than later to leave the strongest possibility of remaining in some kind of fellowship
747514 a major question is how we move towards that point the highest degree of fellowship whilst allowing for an orderly separation
747515 but de facto there is only one the archbishop of canterbury
747516 the peculiar thing is that this one man who is at the centre of the communions structures is not even elected by his peers
747517 even the pope is elected by his peers but what anglicans have is a man appointed by a secular government
747518 over the past five years we have come to see this as a remnant of british colonialism and it is not serving us well the spiritual leadership of a global communion of independent and autonomous provinces should not be reduced to one man appointed by a secular government

747673 it was a scary experience for me to have my four year old daughter wander through to my room in the middle of the night coughing and wheezing like a steam train she sounded so clogged and her cough was brassy my husband and i didnt know what to do and we took her into the bathroom and ran the hot tap till the room steamed up we sat with her for 20 minutes till she seemed a lot better the next day first thing i got online and found you guys we had another episode two nights later i used these sprinkles and what a difference i cant tell you the relief i felt to see her settling and i think the idea of the sprinkles also calmed her down thank you

747679 crossjoin descendants and nonempty in addition to sum count and aggregate my personal favorite is crossjoin because it allows me identify non contiguous slices of the cube and aggregate even though those cube cells dont roll up to a natural ancestor
747680 if you want to create a calculated member that intersects all measures where do you put it
747681 because a member in a dimension cannot intersect its own relatives in that dimension
747682 where would you put a calculated member if you wanted it to intersect all other dimensions

747691 tell me about some great business problems youve solved with analysis services
747692 i used analysis services to provide certification supplier metrics for a retail supply chain the database and cube s that provided these answers had 45 dimensions about 10 measures and 25 calculated members my favorite metric was a ratio of dollars ordered to dollars received because the business could ensure they were getting what they paid for additionally they were able to reduce back office labor for receiving because they could avoid detail receiving for suppliers they knew were doing well
747693 first i talk to the business and gather requirements then i make a design then i build software
747694 americans love process if you tell them this theyll see that youre truly an expert and will have no choice but to take you
747695 that isnt a business problem what interesting business problems have you solved
747696 when nothing seems to help i look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock perhaps 100 times without as much as a crack showing in it yet at the 101st blow it will split in two and i know it was not that last blow that did it but all that had gone before

747699 i swim at the homestead library three days a week
747700 i am surprised that the union movement has been so silent over the slow pace of labour market reform under the rudd government
747701 theres almost a feeling amongst union leaders that they dont want to be disloyal to the government
747702 if the rudd government doesnt change the unfair dismissal limitations until 2010 the work choices unfair dismissal law will have operated longer under the rudd government than the howard government
747703 there has been no change yet to the collective bargaining laws to make it easier for collective bargaining reform has been at a snails pace
747704 basically what the rudd government is doing is leaning towards business because they figure the trade unions have no one else to vote for
747705 never before has a government had so many ex union officials in its caucus and yet keeps them silent and co opts them in unions will contain their members if they stand up for workers and ask why it is the rudd government has been in power for six months and nothing has happened
747706 were very grateful to god that insurance came through people put in their time their money their efforts to get the church put back together

747708 toll free numbers are not enough people dont want to talk at you they need a reliable way to get hold of you and if you know how to effectively use blogs and websites youll control 100 percent of the message
747709 if you know how to effectively use blogsand websites youll control 100 of the message jonathan bernstein bernstein crisis mgmt rly
747710 100 is a lot of percent why not 99 99 i always say
747711 obviously he does not have kids there is no 100
747712 not sure you want to control 100 of the message if you are using a blog for marketing comments should also control it some
747713 if you are controlling 100 how does that encourage the interaction and conversation so valuable of a benefit of blogging
747714 if you know how to effectively use blogs and websites youll control 100 percent of the message
747715 but the only excursions offered were to the local mall where a wealth of unaffordable merchandise stared them in the face

747720 it looks like a river over here most of the time
747721 we have to clean it year after year after year
747722 we keep calling them year after year and no one is doing anything
747723 there is just not that kind of money in the county to do that

747733 for too long many governments businesses andindividuals have been wary of committing to action on climate change because they perceive thatchina the worlds largest emitter is doing little to address the issue however the reality is thatchinas government is beginning to unleash a low carbon dragon which will power its future growth development and energy security objectives
747734 far from ignoring climate change chinese leaders have already committed to improving energy efficiency and scaling up the growthof low carbon industries china is beginning to pull its weight on climate change and the targetsand policies in place are in line with those being taken by leading countries like the uk andgermany
747735 chinas current trajectory will ensure it remains a strategic global hub for lowcarbon investment innovation and growth over coming decades

747738 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
747739 and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
747740 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it
747741 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
747742 of course the u s government should pay compensation its the u s militarys fault
747743 we feel detailed investigation should be done by the u s government itself
747744 the no gun ri incident became one of the milestones to take on this kind of incident in the future
747745 u s forces napalmed numerous small buildings and strafed children women and old people in the open area
747746 there were many similar incidents refugees gathered in certain places and there were air strikes
747747 everybody came out of their houses to see these low flying planes and everyone was hit
747748 civilians in villages cannot normally be identified as either north koreans south koreans or guerrillas
747749 i ran forward and all i could hear were people coughing and screaming and some were probably already dead
747750 how could they not tell the cows the pieces of furniture
747751 the killings of korean civilians were extensive intentional and indiscriminate
747752 now the bereans were of more noble character than the thessalonians for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the scriptures every day to see if what paul said was true
747753 so he reasoned in the synagogue with the jews and the god fearing greeks as well as in the marketplace day by day with those who happened to be there
747754 paul then stood up in the meeting of the areopagus and said
747755 for in him we live and move and have our being
747756 is it wrong for someone whos bought a film on dvd to let a friend watch it for free of course its not it never has been and never will be i think information art and ideas should be shared i dont agree with the copyright laws and i dont have a problem with people downloading the movie and sharing it with people as long as theyre not trying to make a profit off my labour i would oppose that i do well enough already and i made this film because i want the world to change the more people who see it the better so im happy this is happening
747757 our official policy is to politely ignore negative comments about our methods
747758 although in reality we would love to round up all of those trash talking foreign journalists throw them in prison shoot them and sell their organs to hospitals
747759 it has been difficult for our athletes to maintain focus and motivation
747760 they are swiftly executed if they lose as opposed to enduring a slow lingering death if they win
747761 we view the beijing games as being very heavily tilted in favor of the chinese teams

747763 when the f 22 raptors development program commenced twenty two years ago
747764 it seemed like the sky was the limit as far as per unit costs were concerned now the damned planes are lined up at the factory we can hardly give them away
747765 the raptors valuation jumps back up during times of crisis in the middle east
747766 but all it takes is for some peace and cooperation to break out and prices drop like a rock
747767 we could lease patriot missile batteries or apache helicopters to a small nation for less than the selling price of second hand post cold war russian relics
747768 but its too late for the old soviet t 72 main battle tanks blown up and rusting in the iraqi desert we could use some smaller more fuel efficient armored vehicles like those today
747769 one of the u s air forces 65 000 laser guided jdam smart bombs delivers a half ton of high explosives right through an open window
747770 without even touching the curtains a terrorist can load a 12 000 toyota pickup truck full of tnt and drive it directly into an embassy gate how can we compete with that
747771 so were offering the same discount our defense contractor workforce saudi arabia and israel receive you pay what we pay
747772 the good looking guy tried to get out of the way

747779 bob novak is old as hell changes positions a lot has a famously short fuse and hardcore right wingers despise him i tell you its as if were twins separated at birth a hundred years ago
747780 and put all of our surveillance teams on the highest alert theres absolutely no way a jaywalker or robert novak will get through our gates
747781 my friends and i truly think of all of you as friends listen up
747782 the u s will withdraw from iraq only after victory is achieved we will achieve that victory by pounding the terrorists as if they are economical cuts of flank steak
747783 i have the military and foreign policy experience to make statements like that
747784 even if i clearly cant tell the difference between a shiite and a sunni
747785 while some of you may want to keep loyal friends close by your side i prefer to send them to the worlds most volatile and conflicted regions places like iraq or washington dc
747786 he simply didnt expect anything like that to come from such a normally left leaning source then he talked to mrs obama and they agreed the new yorker pretty much nailed it
747787 at no time or under any circumstance has senator obama ever consumed a human infant he is not a baby eater
747788 he and his wife want to either undermine our nations fundamental way of life replacing it with a radical islam centric anarchist agenda or they dont
747789 senator obama has an obligation to describe exactly how he intends to fund the systematic deconstruction of americas social values and well established democracy
747790 his campaign slogan is change we can believe in or something like that
747791 folks all thatll be left after my opponents nihilistic un patriotic free spending first term will be pocket change believe
747792 let it be clear to all who would dare threaten the iranian people
747793 our great nation will retaliate using every vessel at its disposal to any aggressor planning a land assault i tell you the desert sands will be drowned in light sweet crude oil
747794 we are interested in more efficiently serving the worlds energy needs
747795 our talented engineers are simply researching faster more effective delivery systems irans mission is peaceful if that mission coincidentally enhances my own personal investment portfolio then that is just a side benefit
747796 we hope to have perfected the means of speedily transporting large volumes of nuclear fuel as well
747797 those shahab 3s have a range of up to 1 250 miles
747798 which is sufficient to threaten israel u s troops in iraq and commodity futures brokers worldwide these are oil exports on a scale previously unimaginable
747799 the israelis wont wait for those things to go whistling overhead in tel aviv and cause petrol prices to surge
747800 the idf has been known to plan preemptive air strikes simply because someone submitted a badly edited article about israel to wikipedia theyre a little edgy
747801 the iranians actions could be perceived as provocative ill admit
747802 but if shooting a few puny missiles into the sea makes them happy so be it we could use a little oil on those troubled waters over there
747803 america is committed to engaging in a peaceful dialogue with iran
747804 our state department is actively working on scheduling new discussions and maybe even some social activities i have sent mr ahmadinejad numerous messages saying we can take him out anytime
747805 both capital and expertise will be sought so professional investors wanting to be equity partners local authorities technology companies mum and dad investors through bonds plus telcos will all be possible players
747806 consumers would not be forced to take their services over the fibre cable but the product offered and pricing would mean it would be hard to understand why all consumers wouldnt change
747807 the government would forgo any return on its investment if the revenue stream in early years was inadequate to pay the set rate of return
747808 i dont know who it is that keeps this speculation running national has been quite specific in our response and continues to be so our solution is different to the bif and both cannot stand together so of course we will go with our proposal not the current governments
747809 fannie mae and freddie mac have endured troubled times lately
747810 but that will change now that they have joined our corporate family a little tweaking some layoffs there is no limit to what we can achieve together
747811 we often make our expansion decisions based on brand equity
747812 however in this particular case the first thing we will do is change those incredibly stupid company names
747813 an injection of cash into fannie and freddie at this time is nothing short of a miracle
747814 of course thousands of loan writers financial consultants and branch managers will have to learn how to scrub copper beer brewing kettles
747815 inbev has a bad history of slashing costs to improve its profit margins
747816 news of president bushs decision to end the offshore drilling moratorium sounded encouraging at first our furloughed brothers and sisters could be retrained to become oil rig drillers toolpushers and derrickmen

747835 helen clarks dreaming in 1984 when rob muldoon left office debt to gdp was enormous
747836 i just think its mind boggling stupid you go out and borrow at a time when the international markets are in crisis
747837 the big idea is just borrow the money run up the debt all our students know how hard it is to pay a debt back all our families know how hard it is to pay a mortgage back and here we are in the middle of international financial market turmoil and the national party want to borrow the money
747838 i want to reassure people that national will not worsen this situation we will be careful stewards of the economy and of taxpayers money
747839 on the other hand we need to keep things in perspective small operating deficits for a limited time are not the end of the world
747840 our policy focus is on lifting our prospects over the next three to five years
747841 it is a tragedy of new zealand history that previous national administrations got our country into a mess in the past through massive overseas borrowings
747842 the hurt caused to families and to small businesses when those damaging policies eventually had to be corrected was immense in our not so distant past
747843 we want to unclog the arteries of our economy if you like so that we can grow
747844 la sfarsitul primului semestru din anul 2008 angst a inregistrat afaceri de 99 2 milioane de lei in crestere cu 15 5 fata de aceeasi perioada a anului trecut si un profit operational de 2
747845 ei vroiau taxe cat mai mici si cat mai multe servicii din partea noastra iar acest lucru nu s a putut realiza intr adevar orice operator care pleaca inseamna o lipsa dar ducem negocieri cu alte companii pentru a suplini acest deficit
747846 privind in perspectiva realizam faptul ca va trebui sa depasim o situatie mult mai grava decat ne asteptam
747847 vom inregistra o rata de crestere foarte scazuta multe trimestre de acum incolo
747848 nu intrevedem o redresare a economiei pana in primavara sau vara anului 2009
747849 petrom este compania din europa centrala si de est cel mai bine pozitionata in acest mediu caracterizat de preturi ridicate la petrol datorita rezervelor mari de titei si segmentului de explorare si productie
747850 putem spune ca mergem in paralel cu piata si tinand cont de contextul actual in care vanzarile au scazut semnificativ in majoritatea proiectelor rezultatele sunt satisfacatoare in plus investitorii in apartamente off plan cumpara mult mai putine locuinte fata de anul trecut
747851 avand in vedere faptul ca in numai cinci luni de la lansarea proiectului rasarit de soare s au vandut mai bine de 50 din totalul apartamentelor putem spune ca rezultatele se ridica la nivelul asteptarilor
747852 taxele pentru scoala unui copil pot ajunge pana la 20 000 de euro pe an iar chiria pentru un apartament la 6 000 7 000 de euro tot aici putem include si un salariu mai mare cu 20 comparativ cu al unui roman vizite periodice in tara de origine si asigurari medicale in clinici private
747853 firmele platesc o suma fixa pentru casa cand managerul este detasat in romania din interiorul firmei la firmele foarte mari suma aceasta depaseste 10 000 de euro pe luna cu alte cheltuieli curente o companie poate cheltui cu usurinta 20 000 de euro pe luna cu un expat detasat in romania
747854 pentru expati consideram un pachet de compensatii si beneficii cu aproximativ 20 mai mare la care se adauga alte beneficii ca asigurarea locuintei sau plata gradinitei pentru copii
747855 in acelasi timp un ceo expat va avea un salariu de 6 000 10 000 de euro in firmele mijlocii 10 000 15 000 de euro in cele mari si peste 15 000 20 000 de euro in cele foarte mari
747856 prima de motivare variaza de obicei intre 5 si 25 din salariul anual de baza o astfel de prima se plateste fie ca o suma lunara fie ca o singura suma la inceputul sfarsitul perioadei de detasare a doua metoda fiind mai fidela scopului acordarii ei
747857 prima de dificultate se acorda angajatilor trimisi in detasare in cazul in care in tara gazda se considera ca exista conditii mai dificile din cauza instabilitatii politice apropierii de zone de razboi sau existentei unor diferente culturale semnificative
747858 in plus compania acopera costul legat de mutarea transportul obiectelor personale cu unele exceptii ca de exemplu obiecte mari sau de valoare
747859 cazarea este in majoritatea cazurilor asigurata prin inchirierea unor case apartamente si nu este incurajata achizitionarea unei case de catre expatriat in tara gazda din cauza complicatiilor care pot aparea la momentul repatrierii sau din punct de vedere fiscal
747860 meinl nu a vandut niciun centru comercial de trei ani si jumatate de cand sunt eu aici in firma iar atata timp cat randamentele sunt peste media pietei nu vom avea probleme sa ne dezvoltam proiectele in militari unde avem inchiriate spatiile aproape integral vom obtine un randament anual de circa 10 care este foarte bun pentru noi
747861 strategia financiara privind alocarea resurselor a fost de concentrare pe pietele din polonia si rusia unde randamentele obtinute pana acum au justificat alegerea in romania probabil am pierdut putin startul si ar fi fost mai ieftin sa construim acum cativa ani dar probabil nu am fi avut acelasi mix de chiriasi pe care il putem avea acum
747862 proiectul nostru este deja cunoscut datorita praktiker care reuseste sa umple parcarea singur chiar si in timpul saptamanii in plus reprezentantii auchan estimeaza un trafic zilnic in hipermarket de 15 000 de oameni in conditiile in care 20 000 de vizitatori pe zi ar fi suficient pentru intreg proiectul
747863 oamenii au deja un obicei in a merge acolo iar accesul larg la drum reprezinta de asemenea un avantaj toti consultantii si managementul companiei apreciaza ca pozitia proiectului este foarte buna
747864 la arad vom avea cel mai mare proiect din oras care va avea cel mai mare cinematograf si zona de entertainment astfel sa putem tine oamenii in mall 2 3 ore cheltuim sume mari cu studii psihologice si am aflat ca in viata pot fi distinse trei arii mari unde locuiesti unde traiesti si unde te simti bine noi vrem sa construim un al treilea loc
747865 avem terenul pentru seaside shopping center in apropierea unui hipermarket real si a unor unitati praktiker si metro dar vom dezvolta singurul centru comercial de mari dimensiuni din sudul orasului cel mai mare competitor in constanta va fi probabil polus center
747866 incercam sa nu ne presam chiriasii cu nivelul chiriilor deoarece ar putea ajunge in cativa ani sa nu le mai poata plati iar in conditiile in care vrei sa pastrezi un mall aceasta este singura varianta viabila
747867 in sua donatiile cu o destinatie specifica reprezinta o practica frecventa prin care institutii sau persoane fizice aleg sa sprijine o catedra sau un anumit profesor pe parcursul unei perioade stabilite suma este transferata universitatii care o poate folosi numai in scopul in care a fost alocata
747868 este o diferenta uriasa intre scolile de business europene si cele americane in ceea ce priveste colectarea de fonduri scolile din sua au o istorie lunga in strangerea de fonduri
747869 absolventii nostri sunt ambasadorii programelor noastre dar nu primim finantari sau sponsorizari de la acestia
747870 am concluzionat din discutiile de tatonare ca inca nu exista aceasta deschidere o posibila explicatie este chiar mitul potrivit caruia scolile de afaceri ar fi bogate si nu au nevoie de acest sprijin
747871 scolile de afaceri in special cele europene nu sunt bogate in general si trebuie sa stranga bani
747872 modalitatile de finantare ale scolilor de business romanesti sunt influentate de particularitatile culturale din tara noastra
747873 supraincalzirea pietei muncii este o veste buna pentru noi in conditiile in care programele de mba reprezinta un instrument de retentie si dezvoltare
747874 in romania crestem in fiecare an cu cel putin 50
747875 din 1993 anul in care au fost puse bazele parteneriatului dintre the open university business school si codecs si a inceput prezentarea primelor cursuri ale scolii de afaceri britanice in romania numarul studentilor a crescut continuu ceea ce a generat si o majorare corespunzatoare a veniturilor in medie cu 10 15 pe an trendul a fost permanent ascendent
747876 anul trecut am avut 60 de inscrisi cu o taxa de 10 000 de euro
747877 marea majoritate a programelor de mba sunt livrate prin intermediari locali respectiv firme sau persoane care joaca rolul de interfata si care nu au acces nelimitat la situatiile financiare ale universitatii mama consider insa ca poate fi un business profitabil atata timp cat tintesti continuitate si dezvoltare si pui accent pe seriozitate si corectitudine
747878 programul tiffin se autofinanteaza singurele venituri provin de la studentii nostri
747879 veniturile noastre au crescut prin marirea taxei de scolarizare si a numarului de studenti deoarece incepand cu aceasta toamna vom avea programul si in timisoara
747880 sigur ca london business school are o marja de profit confortabila care ii permite sa se dezvolte si sa inoveze permanent daca ne referim la tara noastra avem o industrie de educatie postuniversitara care este profitabila dar este un business cu costuri operationale mari si investitii in infrastructura si logistica care trebuie realizate consecvent
747881 toata lumea vede veniturile dar nu se gandeste ca o scoala de business are de acoperit o gama destul de larga de cheltuieli
747882 nu sunt dintre cei care cred ca nu mai exista viata dupa traian basescu
747883 childrens schooling taxes can reach up to 20 000 euros a year while rent for an apartment can amount to 6 000 7 000 euros a year also included are the salary 20 higher than a romanian managers regular visits to the country of origin and medical insurance in private clinics
747884 companies pay a fixed sum for housing when the manager is relocated to romania from within the company for very big companies this sum exceeds 10 000 euros a month other routine expenses can easily amount to another 20 000 euros a month for an expat transferred to romania
747885 for expats we take into account an around 20 higher compensations and benefits package to which other benefits are added such as home insurance or kindergarten expenses for children
747886 meinl has not sold any shopping centre for the 3 and a half years ive been with the company and as long as yields are above the market average it will be easy for us to develop our projects in the militari area where we have almost entirely rented our space we will get a 10 annual yield which is great for us
747887 in cei trei ani pe care i am petrecut aici nu am cunoscut niciun manager roman
747888 studenti remarcabili foarte ageri la minte evident cu un bagaj intelectual stiintific mult superior mediei si intreprinzatori
747889 in cei trei ani pe care i am petrecut aici nu am cunoscut niciun manager roman toti studentii romani pe care i am cunoscut erau tineri care aveau de la unu la patru ani de experienta profesionala
747890 aceasta tendinta provine probabil din educatia noastra in care accentul este pus de la varste fragede pe stiinte dure ca matematica sau fizica in sua de exemplu mult mai multi studenti foarte dotati nu ezita sa se preocupe si sa se specializeaze in stiinte sociale ca economia sau sociologia si chiar materii umaniste cum este istoria
747891 stiu trei patru exemple de absolventi romani care au plecat in banci de investitii precum mckinsey
747892 ce i drept cei mai multi dintre cei care lucreaza in banci au terminat stiinte economice mai multi decat cei care au facut istoria dar exista si cazuri in care unii manageri au terminat stiintele umaniste
747893 la fiecare sesiune exista un studiu de caz de 10 15 pagini pe care studentii trebuie sa le citeasca inainte toata sesiunea este ca o conversatie dar fiecare student trebuie sa vina pregatit noi profesorii avem anumite concluzii la care vrem sa ajungem
747894 obtinusem prin trimiterea dosarului interviuri scurte de jumatate de ora cu vreo 20 de departemente majoritatea top business schools dupa care am avut invitatii de la toate top 10 business schools din sua plus universitatea insead din franta si singapore pentru fly out adica vizite de o zi care constau in intalniri non stop cu membrii departamentului si cel mai important un seminar in care candidatul isi prezinta job market paper adica lucrarea sa cea mai reprezentativa
747895 reducerile de personal s au facut treptat intre 1998 si 2007 dar foarte multe dintre ele au aparut ca urmare a externalizarii anumitor activitati
747896 angajatii nostri au o dispunere relativ echilibrata in randul unitatilor de productie in fiecare fabrica fiind aproximativ 300 de persoane
747897 ne dorim ca angajatii pentru bicaz sa fie disponibili pana in martie anul viitor pentru a avea suficient timp sa i pregatim procesul de recrutare pentru bicaz nu a inceput insa va demara dupa perioada concediilor undeva in luna septembrie
747898 mare parte dintre fostii nostri angajati lucreaza acum pentru subcontractori recrutarea de personal pentru bicaz se va face prin intermediul departamentului de resurse umane
747899 nu s a luat nicio decizie concreta in ceea ce priveste constructia unei fabrici dar o hotarare de acest gen va fi adoptata astfel incat sa ne acorde suficient timp pentru a angaja oamenii necesari
747900 consultam diverse studii de specialitate pentru a vedea de la an la an unde ne plasam din punct de vedere salarial
747901 nu avem o problema cu fluctuatia de personal in ultimii doi ani plecarile voluntare de personal s au situat sub 1 din totalul angajatilor
747902 nu pregatim angajati doar pentru piata locala ci si pentru celelalte piete pe care este prezent grupul
747903 expatrierile au inceput in urma cu trei ani iar in momentul de fata avem trei angajati in misiuni internationale unul este in statele unite ale americii unul se afla in suedia iar un altul lucreaza pentru heidelbergcement tehnology center in zonele georgia rusia ucraina si romania
747904 dupa privatizare strategia de resurse umane s a schimbat iar prioritatile au inceput sa fie dezvoltarea evaluarea si motivarea angajatilor precum si identificarea de talente si asigurarea unui plan de succesiune
747905 ne uitam foarte mult in directia tinerilor si aceasta strategie ar trebui sa fie urmata de toate companiile practic trebuie sa existe o colaborare intre facultati si angajatori pentru ca fiecare sa se cunoasca reciproc
747906 in domeniul vanzarii de echipamente industriale si de constructii unde pretul utilajelor poate ajunge la sute de mii de euro se poate incasa un bonus de 10 000 50 000 de euro totusi in acest domeniu o vanzare se face in 3 5 luni sau chiar un an si astfel bonusurile nu au un caracter de permanenta
747907 in fmcg un key account manager poate incasa lunar 2 000 2 500 de euro in vreme ce un vanzator de excavatoare sau poduri rulante poate ajunge la 3 000 4 000 de euro
747908 un junior intr un magazin de produse de larg consum nu se poate astepta la mai mult de 600 1 000 lei pe luna 165 280 de euro un salesman dintr un magazin specializat poate spera la o crestere de 30 40 fata de nivelul anterior
747909 in ultimele luni oferta angajatorilor si cererea au crescut insa avansul ofertei il depaseste pe cel al cererii
747910 sectorul farmaceutic este foarte afectat de deficitul de forta de munca in domeniul vanzarii in ceea ce priveste celelalte industrii cred ca se confrunta cu aceeasi problema aspect vizibil din multitudinea de anunturi de angajare din presa din discutiile de pe forumurile de resurse umane sau din cadrul conferintelor de profil
747911 in perioada urmatoare salariile din industria farmaceutica vor fi influentate pozitiv de faptul ca in luna ianuarie multe companii vor acoperi deficitul cauzat de inflatie dar si de deficitul continuu de forta de munca in domeniu
747912 pana la sfarsitul lui 2008 vom mai deschide intre doua si patru unitati in centre comerciale precum cora esplanada fashion house sau arena grand berceni toate din capitala si intr un mall din galati planul de dezvoltare este insa mult mai ambitios urmand ca pana la sfarsitul anului 2009 sa functioneze cel putin 50 de magazine sub brandul lee cooper
747913 este adevarat ca jeansul ramane in continuare punctul forte al companiei dar avand in vedere ca piata de fashion s a diversificat foarte mult in ultimul timp prin intrarea pe piata a brandurilor mari nici lee cooper nu se poate limita in a comercializa un singur produs de aceea am diversificat incet incet si modelele de textile incaltaminte si accesorii
747914 pentru 2008 ne am bugetat o crestere a cifrei de afaceri cu 20 pentru magazinele existente dar dezvoltarea previzionata pentru perioada urmatoare va urca afacerile la peste 14 milioane de euro
747915 vom dezvolta o colectie clasica dar si una pentru copii incepand cu varsta de 2 ani
747916 acest lucru se observa in volumul vanzarilor carora nu le poti identifica un ritm sustinut ci unul sinuos de asemenea costul utilitatilor si al traiului zilnic a facut ca publicul larg sa fie atras numai de campaniile de reduceri promotionale substantiale
747917 este vorba despre un parteneriat care exista deja in bulgaria si pe care il extindem si in romania cu pluri consultants s a incheiat colaborarea pentru ca ne doream un partener care sa se ocupe exclusiv de serviciile hewitt
747918 amenintarea unor actiuni militare de mare anvergura intre georgia si osetia de sud devine din ce in mai reala

747924 well i take a few things into consideration when making my choice
747925 i usually choose the medium sized ones and look at the stem end to determine when it was harvested if it was cut from the vine and has a long green stem that means it was harvested early so it is not vine ripened if the stem has dried up and fallen off or is loose enough to gently pull away from the melon than its probably ripe i look for the ones that have a clean divot like that one see where the stem used to be then i press on the divot to see if it yields a bit to the pressure which is a good sign oh and when most melons are fragrant theyre ripe

748132 we believe romantic love is a developed form of one of three primary brain networks that evolved to direct mammalian reproduction
748133 the sex drive evolved to motivate individuals to seek sex with any appropriate partner
748134 attraction the mammalian precursor of romantic love evolved to enable individuals to pursue preferred mating partners thereby conserving courtship time and energy

748192 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
748193 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
748194 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
748195 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
748196 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
748197 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
748198 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
748199 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
748200 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
748201 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
748202 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
748203 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
748204 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
748205 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
748206 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
748207 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
748208 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
748209 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
748210 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
748211 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
748212 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
748213 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
748214 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
748215 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
748216 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
748217 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
748218 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
748219 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
748220 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
748221 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
748222 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country

748226 the statistics are alarming eight women and one man have been sentenced to death over an adultery conviction in none other than ayatollah mullah ridden iran
748227 european envoy javier solana stated that iran must provide more definitive answers within two weeks
748228 the international community is acutely aware of the iranian threat
748229 boasted of being involved in the transport of wmd warheads to syria
748230 they knew the locations of the missile hulls buried in iraq
748231 wanted to trade their information for a release from prison and were amenable to showing the locations
748232 included nitrogen mustard gas warheads for tariq i and ii missiles

748240 the independent filmmaker may have confused the madrassa with one with a similar name tied to islamic extremists
748241 and the filmmaker admits his mistake in my opinion that is one whopper of a mistake for filmmaker imran raza as this entire episode including a law being presented to congress was based upon this being a taliban like madrassa
748242 the school is home to as many as 500 boys and girls from 29 countries and associated with some militant groups in pakistan
748243 i do need to take responsibility for these things in terms of these were errors that sort of spun out of control
748244 i have to take responsibility for the mistakes i take responsibility for the error in the allegation that osama bin laden was there i take responsibility for the error that some of the taliban leaders were there
748245 mr naeem insisted that his seminary did not train students for military jihad but added somewhat ambiguously that none of his charges was allowed to fight in afghanistan
748246 statement of imran raza regarding release of american children from pakistani taliban madrassa
748247 it was clear that they were there against their will
748248 do the american school systems give these kids credit for attending madrasses rather than having than attending classes here in the us
748249 mr naeem insisted that his seminary did not train students for military jihad but added somewhat ambiguously that none of his charges was allowed to fight in afghanistan

748267 its a broken system and as people of god we must insist that they level the playing field
748268 i do believe we have nothing to lose at all if we keep our children away from the chicago public school system
748269 this culture of violence and vindictive procedures which are often covered under the liberty of speech not only targets the holy prophet but also other divine characters like christ mary moses and abraham
748270 the european unions support to selman rushdie and recent stupid caricatures and turning freedom of speech into freedom of insult is nothing but aggression and cultural terrorism
748271 muslims no longer expect pluralism from you but just some politeness and justice
748272 the secular europe should note it cannot compensate its christian violence of the past centuries by secular and modern violence and in a prejudiced manner against islam which played no role in europes violence
748273 the muslims keep having children while the europeans do not this means that within 20 years the muslims will be a majority
748274 the most important thing is that there are 25 30 million muslims in europe this figure has many implications

748338 in many respects the soa market has lost its vision around what soa is actually trying to do not provide a new set of technology but provide a transformation focused on a design point called a business service a business service drives measureable business outcome
748339 how we map business capabilities in a consumer provider fashion and map that into it systems and technologies a business person should be able to consume and provide capabilities without knowledge of the underlying technology and platforms and do that in a changeable manner
748340 in this user panel co moderated by gartner and the soa consortium several enterprise architecture ea practitioners will look at the links synergies and dependencies between service oriented architecture soa and ea how does soa fit into the ea picture how can it help make ea more valuable does soa need to be part of a broader ea hear the first hand experience and lessons learned from our panelists and ask them your own soa ea questions
748341 how do you balance governance with productivity actually being able to get something done and out the door
748342 if you are trying to solve a big societal problem then these formalities and these structures are important because there are so many stakeholders there are so many different levels and so many issues there are the technical issues but also in many cases privacy civil liberty type issues or security and protection personally liable information i mean so many different considerations that come into play and there are plenty of examples where somebody skipped a step or did not do the full due diligence and it later on kind of came back and torpedoed the program and forget about the waste of money and time and effort you are still not filling that societal need right so these structures they have grown up through a need to have this level of control and another thing i would add is that sometimes they can be your friend right if you can work within those processes right and then when things get to be mature like service oriented architecture we are able to inject them in the appropriate way through the governance processes and the establishments practices then it becomes easier to get the broad based adoption because it is familiar to people
748343 i put the requirement in their contracts that if they did not follow those things architecture and programming standards i did not have to pay them they would do the work for free and that tends to herd them in the right direction another thing that we did is incentives for re use most systems integrators are going to be incentivized not to re use because they are time and material to build everything from scratch that they can for each individual chance and sell the same thing over and over again so what we did is we built into our contracts that if a service was created that could be re used and it gets re used then they get a bonus and then if they re use a service they get a bonus so they make more money if they re use existing things and this changed the behavior within the governance model where they went out and looked in the universal business registry for a get order status before they wrote it because they got paid more if they re used one because they would have less labor and greater profit and if they created the get order status routine they would generalize it enough so others could use it so they would make profit off of that and this herded the cats towards an integrated architecture over time without again people are always the problem it is not the technology so i would love to see the government look at that kind of incentivized capability inside their contracts
748344 it is finding people who can abstract even people who can build an architecture without putting a product name in it is extremely hard it is not an architecture if it has a product name in it i spent a long time explaining that because architecture lives beyond that right and i think that is a challenge across the board
748345 the survey asks architecture leaders to share their views in 4 key areas soa adoption current practices value and results and barriers to soa success we also intend to understand linkages if any between soa initiatives and company financial performance our objective is to help those responsible for architecture better understand how their organizations stack up on a variety of key soa metrics investment progress reuse and others the survey which will take 10 15 minutes to complete is available here the survey will be available on line through the end of may this survey is a joint effort of mits center for information systems research and diamond management and technology consultants all responses will be kept completely confidential only research team members will know the responses from any organization and findings will be reported only in aggregate of course you will receive a complimentary copy of the full report

748453 in many ways our reliance on experts makes sense as well educated and experienced people they seem a source of advice far superior to anything a grandmother or aunt might offer they present themselves as objective and unbiased basing their instructions implicitly or explicitly on scientific studies if they sometimes turn out to be wrong it is only because the science underlying their advice evolves from month to month and year to year and new studies topple old ones they have no axes to grind no agendas to advance or so we are encouraged to believe but this trust has again and again been betrayed

748753 i have already paid for the flights and accommodation and i have managed to get a few tickets to a few events but obviously the tickets that i bought through this website are gone
748754 i had bought opening and closing ceremony tickets swim finals and some football tickets i must say that up until now i was hoping that the tickets would just turn up but i have been complaining to various authorities about this because i sensed it was a scam a few months ago
748755 ill pursue this when i get back i am going to track these guys i have been in touch with some others who have lost money and we estimate these guys have been raking in much more than 50 million
748756 with respect to ticket scamming there has been a reasonable number who have been caught
748757 the aoc has always advised consumers to only buy tickets from the official ticket provider and no one else despite the fact they all claimed offshore websites had plenty of tickets when cosport had none
748758 as you surely know the usoc has been working with the ioc on the us lawsuits involving the fraudulent sales of olympic tickets through www beijingticketing com and other related websites
748759 then they said 2070 and then they said 2050 and then they said 2030

748761 we might see an ice free arctic ocean by the year 2030 within some of our lifetimes
748762 there are some scientists out there who think that even might be optimistic
748763 as near as we can tell looking at the historical record theres been ice in the arctic in the summer for at least 16 million years
748764 theres a group that makes a very strong case that in 2012 or 2013 well have an ice free summer arctic as soon as that its astounding whats happened
748765 as the ice recedes its opening up not only the arctic passage but all the resources in the arctic ocean
748766 we could think of the arctic as the refrigerator of the northern hemisphere climate system
748767 what were doing by getting rid of that sea ice is radically changing the nature of that refrigerator were making it much less efficient but everything is connected together so what happens up there eventually influences what happens in other parts of the globe
748768 the arctic really can feed back into the global climate system
748769 you know what happens when you get feedbacks you get surprises and we dont like surprises
748770 a race has developed between the waning sunlight and the weakened ice
748771 a combination of these two forces led to what we observe now and we should not ignore either forces
748772 there have been numerous models run that have looked at that and basically they cant reproduce the ice loss weve had with natural variability
748773 you have to add a carbon dioxide warming component to it
748774 we should care in the sense that what happens here is coming to us and sometimes you know a warning is a helpful thing to mobilise people

748777 if she were to approach us with an addiction problem we would help her
748778 it would be important she was left alone to get on with it which can be difficult with the media attention she generates

748781 i have seen her in the news with her unusual hair but i dont read the stories
748782 if she were to come here to be near a loved one she would be just like other celebrities who call suffolk home
748783 i am sure it would be good for her to see a different side of life maybe she would like to become involved in some of the excellent community work here i think she would find it very soothing
748784 and i dont think she will find it too quiet because we have a vibrant town with a lot going on

748791 both jess and lisa have had an incredibly difficult week and without doubt i am talking to them and helping them out where i can
748792 from the whole situation with the pictures to lisas break up with dean i cant even imagine how they are coping with it all
748793 what has happened with those images is obviously completely illegal and there are lawyers getting involved
748794 its just such an upsetting situation there is a real tall poppy situation in australia and both jess and lisa deserve more support especially from their australian fans
748795 at the moment they are being advised not to say anything because theyre still getting their head around it themselves its all been pretty crazy
748796 but if things keep progressing between them they wont have a problem discussing it further down the track

748820 gen y is a market of comparable size theres a big aha when hotels discover that
748821 if you were designing a new concept it would be logical to appeal to the high propensity consumer
748822 theyre interested in things that are a lot less traditional things that have much greater personality and the experiences that are a little less predictable
748823 which is why design has become the primary basis of differentiation for these lifestyle hotels they dont want stuff that looks like it was all shipped out of the same warehouse in north carolina
748824 their customer is maybe a little more conservative than aloft

748829 hilton and marriott have shown that you can have a family of brands without diluting the name

748937 sascha wilde in de derde wedstrijd hetzelfde doen wat ik wilde voorkomen ik gooide daarom het gat dicht maar raakte daarbij de startboei en dus moesten we een strafrondje draaien
748938 ik zag een winddraaiing naar links aankomen dus we gingen wat eerder overstag dan de rest zo konden we perfect van die shift profiteren helemaal omdat veel andere mensen de boei overzeilden
748939 we zijn zeker blij met de eindzege we hebben enorm naar het wk f18 toegeleefd daarna valt de spanning weg en is het mentaal moeilijk om je weer op te laden voor andere evenementen we gingen al vrij snel naar polen voor de baltic sailing cup en dit kampioenschap kwam er achteraan
748940 nu hebben we onze zinnen op het nk f18 gezet
748941 voor de laatste rac stonden we op het gelijke aantal punten met sascha en christa alleen hadden zij twee eentjes en wij n dus zij zouden dan tweede worden en wij derde
748942 we verwachtten daar een vette header en die kregen we ook dat was fantastisch want we vlogen als eerste om de boventon coen en jeroen gingen ons in het tweede spinnakerrak voorbij maar zij zijn echt een maatje te groot daarna hebben we alleen nog maar naar sascha gekeken want we moesten voor hem blijven en dat is gelukt wij zijn wat zwaarder dus we hebben meer wind nodig de weergoden waren ons dit weekend goed gezind
748943 die was echt spannend onze stuurboordstart mislukte waarna we als allerlaatste weg waren vervolgens zaten we nog op de bovenboei en moesten we een strafrondje draaien maar we zijn toch naar een derde plek teruggevaren
748944 ook de rest van het veld ging steeds beter varen dus we hadden best een zware dobber aan hen
748945 leuk dat er drie dagen zoveel wind stond we moesten ouderwets aan de bak

748966 the first team called kings was very active and he pitched himself for around five years beginning in 1975 he gathered good players from high school baseball team and got the second prize in nara prefecture if my memory is correct the second team called stars using softball around seven years later in the city his team won almost all the games i do not know the third teams name but he made little league member he guided the children using his own baseball theory and the team was also very strong
748967 the thing i probably enjoyed most about jack was his sense of humor
748968 he could readily laugh at himself and found humor in many situations
748969 i needed to complete a lot of hours in order to get the chance to receive the award
748970 the mentors are usually former leaders and or have direct experience with gold award kids
748971 i learned in school that when soldiers came back from the korean and vietnam wars many of them were disrespected
748972 with soldiers who are coming back from iraq this is my way to show respect for our country something that i think others should do too
748973 only 2 percent of registered girl scouts get the award
748974 the referenced deed is unenforceable unless holcomb agway cooperative inc or its successors produce a certified copy of a declaration of intention to preserve recorded in the applicable time period
748975 the board directed me to get on with putting together a plan
748976 wed still maintain a portion of the pond for skating and recreational purposes my plan might be to start filling in a portion of the pond
748977 you are talking a relatively large amount of money for east and west bloomfield
748978 weve got to deal with the maintenance issue and challenges before us and we will
748979 i didnt see it the dams to be an immediate safety problem
748980 its really critical in east bloomfield i think were probably a little bit worse than the national norms
748981 that drops down to as low as 40 to 60 percent in the daytime largely because we dont have people who live in the community who volunteer
748982 i continue to do this each year because of all the people who help and the heroes certainly i want to help the firefighters raise awareness of the shortage of firefighters i dont think people realize that there is a very severe shortage not just locally but nationwide
748983 once we have concrete project costs or prices for equipment were more than happy to entertain approving appropriation of our share
748984 if two of the towns vote then the other has to put up their share and go along with it
748985 i wanted more due diligence and understanding of the financing structure
748986 i just want to have us do the right thing
748987 we didnt have the parks we have today in victor weve added five or six new parks
748988 the state was very interested at that point we went with the state for a little while but i dont think this is a time to ask new york state to step up to the plate and buy something like boughton park
748989 if i were the three towns id try my representative in albany and say hey look this is something we need financial resources to bring about
748990 im not pretty im not pretty i need more makeup
748991 i figured it wouldnt be hard to find someone since girls have a thing for babies anyways and like doing that stuff
748992 of course we want to pay good wages youre taking care of our kids what is more important than that
748993 probably not something that a spammer would be motivated to do
748994 in no way do i think john mccains campaign was racist i think they are cynical
748995 their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks

749007 i wish i wanted it as much as i used to but i dont
749008 ive been with her for 10 years a lot of wins she hit every green today it is the sign of a champion to come out when you dont have a chance of winning and play like that shes great nobodys done it better ill never forget this
749009 i think i was born to compete there were times i wish i didnt have it but i probably wouldnt have achieved what i have maybe there were times the last few months when i wish i had the desire and the motivation and the drive then i wouldnt step away
749010 but i just dont have that when you have the mind of a champion and the mind of a competitor but then theres a few pieces missing thats hard to accept sometimes
749011 i came up 18 made the corner turn and there was a sign saying annika you will be missed
749012 i thought that was very special i waved to the guys they clapped and then i came up 18 and everybody was cheering it just makes you feel good when you get that type of applause ive been out here for 15 years and ive experienced a lot of joy a few setbacks but overall its been great
749013 im going to miss it no doubt about it i love the majors i try to gear up for them and kind of be ready for them ive had happy tears there ive had unhappy tears this game and this championship just sucks everything out of you
749014 the competition the cheering being under the limelight to hit that perfect 6 iron and make that putt
749015 i wish this one on 18 was for the championship that would be the ultimate thats why i spent all that time on the putting green and the driving range those are the moments i miss

749071 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
749072 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
749073 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
749074 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
749075 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
749076 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
749077 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
749078 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

749081 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
749082 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
749083 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
749084 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
749085 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
749086 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
749087 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
749088 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
749089 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
749090 he did not complete a single investigation or risk assessment
749091 indeed his file on the family was buried at the bottom of a filing cabinet sized box beneath food wrappers and unopened envelopes relating to other childrens cases
749092 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
749093 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
749094 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
749095 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
749096 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
749097 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
749098 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
749099 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
749100 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
749101 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
749102 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
749103 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
749104 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
749105 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
749106 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
749107 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
749108 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
749109 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
749110 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
749111 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
749112 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

749119 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
749120 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
749121 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
749122 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
749123 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
749124 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
749125 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
749126 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
749127 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
749128 with a mccain avatar that whether it was a mccain avatar or someones member both were dicks

749130 hopefully everybody took something positive from that negative situation to be able to learn from
749131 you learn from it now i know what to expect
749132 ive just got to be a professional this is my job now
749133 he played in a very good conference in the sec he competed against top competition and he performed week in and week out so we feel very fortunate to have drafted him where we did seventh round 224th overall
749134 he cant allow this to be a setback when he gets back in there
749135 just coming in in the seventh round im already a sleeper
749136 anywhere you go you have to make a name for yourself it was like that at kentucky it was like that in high school its nothing different
749137 my own personal grade was much higher than where he got drafted
749138 the primary focus is the safety of the detainees as well as the detainee guard force and thats why we have this intelligence activity
749139 guantanamo has become little more than a holding center for hundreds of men most of whom will never be charged with a crime and have nothing to offer the u s government in the way of actionable intelligence
749140 you always want to make sure you understand the mood of the camp
749141 if i see a change in behavior my question then will be well is this because of a new procedure ive implemented or is this just because its hot outside or ive got a new rotation of detainee guards
749142 confirms what professional interrogators have been saying for years that captured terrorism suspects provide no useful intelligence after the first six months of detention
749143 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy

749146 no ones quite sure which business model is going to work
749147 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
749148 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
749149 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
749150 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
749151 d ue to mechanical differences in the rotating head assemblies none of the early machines produced recordings that were really fully interchangeable the networks got around this by making sure that the head assembly used for recording also did the playback this had to be carried out in the extreme if a show was recorded in los angeles and then played back in new york in such cases the video head was removed from the recorder and shipped along with the tape
749152 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
749153 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
749154 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
749155 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region

749160 yup trying to find out whats up on that one it did it for me too wiped them out
749161 he felt ok looked a little rusty thats to be expected
749162 the important thing now is to see how he feels tomorrow after that ill put together a schedule to get him back pitching
749163 he threw a lot of breaking balls fastballs and a few cutters
749164 he didnt feel pain initially he had problems getting the breaking ball over and then it started getting more consistent as he finished up look forget all of that whats important is to see how it feels tomorrow and if it feels fine then we can step it up and get him ready to pitch
749165 im working for visual studio which is most powerful dev tool in the world at least in my opinion
749166 the increased complexity of software development environments and the cost of fixing defects in the field rather than early in the software cycle combine in exorbitant ways to drain income and to hamstring businesses as a result of critical software downtime
749167 they always knew there was water and if you ask any scientists at nasa they also are 99 sure theres no life there

749175 if you look at most businesses today it organizations are expected to have very managed processes for their supply chain systems and for their human resources systems but when it comes to software delivery or software development as you mentioned there is this sense that software is some sort of an art
749176 we would really like to demystify this and put some rigor to the process that individuals and organizations leverage and use around software delivery this will allow organizations to get the same predictability when they are doing software as when they are doing the other aspects of the it organization so our focus is really about helping organizations improve the way they do software leveraging some core solution areas and processes but also providing more holistic insight of whats going on inside of the application lifecycle

749183 tea has not met its obligation to remedy the language deficiencies of texas students
749184 the failure of secondary lep students under every metric clearly and convincingly demonstrates student failure and accordingly the failure of the esl secondary program in texas

749198 maybe some gang members who do not qualify to buy a firearm may do a straw purchase but all theyre doing is breaking into homes and stealing them
749199 the reality of it is that straw purchasing is not a primary means of how u s criminals get guns

749208 when i come upon a bad assonance or a repetition in my sentences im sure im floundering in the false by searching i find the proper expression which was always the only one and which is also harmonious the word is never lacking when one possesses the idea is there not in this precise fitting of parts something eternal like a principal if not why should there be a relation between the right word and the musical word or why should the greatest compression of thought always result in a line of poetry

749212 currently icidu is available in major retail stores in the netherlands denmark and romania as well as having product availability in many other countries

749216 ahmed khalil has chosen to resign from his position at lenovo for personal reasons in agreement with management with khaled kamel at the helm its business as usual during what really is a very exciting time for lenovo in the middle east region with continued growth showcased by both our financial and volume results
749217 each region has to achieve a set of targets and we were not achieving those targets
749218 those targets are fairly hard and high because we are owned by a private equity company called platinum equity and they are fairly hard on the finance side it is right for the long term because if you are not generating enough profit you need to change things
749219 one of the things about the middle east is transport in and our hub is in europe which means we normally have to fly the product over and that is more expensive that is a bit of a challenge and it hurts the p amp l which means the bottom line is not as big as it should be so you have to look at the costs and decide what you can change unfortunately it meant changing people on this occasion
749220 there were various discussions and they were internal as to what we should do but the end result is that i will be supporting the middle east through bdl
749221 what we decided to do is focus ourselves through one partner
749222 that is a better business decision for both parties and that is what we are going to do bdl will provide product and support and the main communication out to the channel
749223 i think each company and product set goes through cycles
749224 we would hope that with some changes we have put in place that we would again be able to provide better local support in the future and so we are not withdrawing from the middle east far from it we would hope and expect to be able to improve our local visibility in the future

749230 we have been investigating the opportunities for teleware services in the middle east with a consultant firm and identified the need for setting up a joint venture in the region to service our clients closely

749239 the number of distributors here is more than hp requires and when that happens the profitability of the distributors comes down thats the natural process that is why they have decided to review it
749240 we want to increase our product availability capabilities meaning we increase working capital and buying power for distributors in the region and secondly we have a programme to develop the sales power into the reseller community this channel development part will be the focus in the next year
749241 we learnt that the main requirement from our resellers was for distributors to become what we call a broadliner a one stop shop that has all our products you wont find an hp distributor anymore who only sells psg notebooks and cant offer you a printer this is what we have done with the exercise there was nobody cut
749242 this will give them the opportunity to build their business with hp it is going to require greater investment from distributors and they must expect some realignment internally but it should lead to the profit going up the growth momentum at hp is high and they expect this to be maintained at the very least
749243 executive partners are purely for the corporate business and they can buy directly from acer or from our authorised distributors depending on the urgency of delivery
749244 the value addition of these partners is that they get to work closely with acer to crack the account once the account is cracked they can then decide how to route the product
749245 a layer that provides a fluent interface over a regular api apis are usually designed to provide a set of self standing methods on objects ideally these methods can be understood individually this is in conflict to a fluent interface which is designed around the readibility of a whole expression which leads to methods that make little sense individually an expression builder provides a fluent interface as a separate layer on top of the regular api this way you have both styles of interface and the fluent interface is clearly isolated making it easier to follow

749295 when clark left the apartment he was immediately placed under arrest by fbi agents reigh was located alone in the apartment

749306 boys do we do that lie to even ourselves even when we are alone and allowed to have feelings
749307 why didnt he just say tears or that he cried what does he mean without his permission
749308 i cried miss im not embarrassed i cried over a girl once
749309 dont we all do this after a bad break up yeah well at least i learned something but then oh no once the love hammer drops here we go all over again
749310 well you might be lucky or not lucky im not sure
749311 boys why does he say folded notes and not letters
749312 and where did you meet your love boys imagine he calls her out and hes waiting for her at the top of the stairs and then he sees her and the moon oh the moon is a magical light isnt it not a streetlight maybe they are at the park and so you can imagine that they are alone and he doesnt want it to end like when you were with that person and you didnt want the night to be over you didnt want to say goodbye at that moment or ever for that matter
749313 yes boys she did but what do you think he means by too soon one day one month or five years when you are in love anytime they leave you is too soon
749314 and now there you are its over and now you are just left with that memory those memories of the person you loved and that special place or that special way you remember them where was that for you boys what did she look like at that moment
749315 it hurts yes but it also can bring back that butterfly feeling if you let it dont think about the going part just think about the feeling part let it fill you with the happy memories of at least having love or lust were so lucky to know what butterflies feel like just remember that part

749329 there was a pattern of problematic behavior going back before he used the f word
749330 i imagine his dismissal was the result of all of that
749331 im mad as hell and im not going to take it anymore
749332 why didnt they fire him when the incident happened why did they say heres what you need to do if you want to come back and then when he did everything that was asked of him he still gets fired why do you treat somebody like that
749333 if you made a mistake you acknowledged the mistake you went into counseling you met with the groups you did the psa you did everything that was asked of you and then they still kick you in the gut how would you feel
749334 there was a discussion and it was agreed upon that this is what needs to be done to come back and he did everything
749335 and in fact we were the ones that pushed for the psa
749336 it would be premature to speculate we have time to discuss that
749337 i certainly cant imagine they would tell him theyre not renewing his contract and then ask him to come back and clean things up

749348 i like to stay active and i love the passion in dance
749349 its very fulfilling and after school it was a good way to relieve everyday pressures it felt good to let go even in doing simple bar exercises
749350 i think i own all the dance movies you could think of and i watch dance shows on tv
749351 i taught them basics different movements and leaps and choreographed a hip hop and lyrical dance for them
749352 i enjoyed every minute of it it was a little bit of everything and the people were as passionate about it as i was they made it so much fun
749353 i just wanted to try it and i really liked it so every year i asked for another italian song
749354 im always active and looking to lead a healthy lifestyle so i looked into dietetics and did some job shadowing
749355 i really like the sciences and i think the medical field kind of runs in the family my mom is a nurse and diabetic educator and my aunt is an x ray technician

749358 there arent many schools that offer pharmacy and its hard to get into and butler accepted me so
749359 it will be good though ill have to get tickets i think the colts will play the bengals this year at indianapolis and they have a new stadium
749360 its a new sport for me it feels like im getting old im going golfing its fun and its relaxing like fishing
749361 i went with him a lot when i was little i think about him quite a bit when im fishing
749362 it is critical to our survival to be able to offer to our kids all the different opportunities that we are able to
749363 without the support of community business the parents we wouldnt be able to probably do half of what we do
749364 its helpful for those courses and we really appreciate it but it is a small piece of a great big pie
749365 every little bit counts but it certainly isnt a substitute for the general fund doing the textbook adoptions
749366 if it wasnt for us a lot of the things teachers want to do for kids probably wouldnt be able to happen
749367 these are things we wouldnt have things that all go into the total package of educating the kids
749368 in some instances they do things that maybe we wouldnt even purchase for instance the athletic boosters put in a new track i may not have seen that as a priority
749369 that is where the boosters come into play to help fill that gap
749370 that takes the pressure off the taxpayers of the community
749371 if you have donations toward something then the people who donated will look after those facilities
749372 if someone is abusing them they are not afraid to walk up and say
749373 if we did not receive the donations we would not have the ability to get out the message for the need and how the levy would be used

749423 hero fiennes tiffin who plays the young tom riddle in the orphanage scene with dumbledore got raves for being extra creepy jen bensoussan who runs the fan site
749424 from the graphic effects surrounding dumbledore to the chilling scene of bonnie in the woods or of ron lying death like on the floor half blood prince looks to be bolder darker and more intense
749425 i thought this was a bold move and a wise choice
749426 and its a wise choice hes easily one of the most fascinating characters in the book young tom riddle is all the right amounts of crabby stubborn and adorable which will make his story even more tragic
749427 it seems that in the way the universe revolved around the role of dolores umbridge in the last film perhaps voldemort will be stealing the stage this go around
749428 hero fiennes tiffin will make an excellent dark lord in training
749429 i think the trailer did a good job of showing that the concept of absolute power turned an innocent boy into a madman
749430 i can make bad things happen to people who are mean to me
749431 only i didnt know the newest harry potter was being directed by m
749432 from the graphic effects surrounding dumbledore to the chilling scene of bonnie in the woods or of ron lying death like on the floor half blood prince looks to be bolder darker and more intense
749433 but this one looks dark and creepy which is how the book was
749434 i think they did a great job of young dumbledore in the tom riddle orphanage but what is he wearing
749435 its supposed to be a silly suit and instead they put him in a polka dot tie its a testament to j k rowling that i even notice these things
749436 where was snape where was merope and the battle on the tower
749437 i dont think it was exciting enough for non potter fans
749438 i dont think it would attract people who are on the fence
749439 if you havent read the books why would you go see this
749440 it doesnt move you forward from the last book at all
749441 the trailer gave me hope that this could be the best harry potter movie yet

749452 so you thought youd come back my wicked one where have you been
749453 id rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints
749454 create a deleting rule in outlook for everything sent on the alias
749455 who is tentative it should be a lot of fun
749456 hey let us buy you a red bull and pop rocks next time were at the convenience store
749457 it is a shame the imperial troops were so heavy handed
749458 we still do not know where she was staying on earth and the eg is not releasing any details yet it all depends on the response from the palace
749459 i want to know exactly what she did and where she went while she was here
749460 its just that i felt something too and i didnt know if you
749461 were going to be stuck together for the immediate future so lets do this slowly if you know anything about my religious upbringing you know why that i have to move slowly when it comes to these new feelings
749462 i thought you didnt believe that crap to use your word
749463 when i was young they shut down my sex drive the purity thing is not just a fable they take it seriously
749464 i guess i dont need to jump into anything right now anyway especially after ending it with vanessa the way i did
749465 i am sorry for your loss ms lexington it was such a tragedy losing those two young lives
749466 i just know that earth guard wanted to arrest her for flying erratically through a space lane almost hitting a freighter she tried to escape by flying into the test range but she made the mistake of approaching space dock and savior fleet commander uric had no choice but to protect his ship unfortunately she was not as good a pilot as she thought she was
749467 i cant believe she entered the asteroid belt at that speed
749468 but find solace in the fact bradley did not suffer
749469 no maam but death in the vacuum of space can take horrible agonizing forms hitting a mountain at one third ls neither of them felt a thing
749470 i am a line officer in the imperial navy ms lexington i have seen enough death for three lifetimes
749471 sure but ill have to be gentle with her if i come too close to something big at anything over an eighth ls ill rip her in half
749472 only if were spotted by eg or captain renkins people but if we have to run were screwed
749473 but first i want to know whats worth going back to earth for
749474 there are some things about me you dont know so i guess i should start at the beginning my great grandfathers name was justin travis he was noahcorps deputy chief medical officer he was there when the savior was brought to sirat and he kept a journal of what he was privy to in the years after when the ellingsons took over he made vague hints to things that went on there
749475 noahcorp was not just a corporation kimmy not at first you read some of that in amy dietrichs book they knew things knew how things should go
749476 its not nonsense and there is no mysticism involved they were the ones who united the earth under one government they were the ones who discovered the hyperdrive years ahead of the level of technology at the time and they did it in an incredibly short time
749477 have you read any earth history aside from that book
749478 sixty years before the earth was united the nations of the world were just ending a global conflict that killed millions twenty years before unification the two most powerful nations were still fighting an undeclared cold war each with the ability to destroy the planet a hundred times over there were entrenched hatreds kimmy hatreds that had festered for fifty a hundred even a thousand years and the johnsons and their daughter managed to get these people to put them aside to form a united planet think about it kimmy youre a politician of sorts think about what it would take to achieve that in so short a time
749479 what you dont realize is they were the ones who spun the fairy tale youre running from kimmy
749480 the right of rule was written twenty thousand years ago long before anyone knew earth existed it predicted the savior would come
749481 i dont dispute that but there is evidence kim mchenry knew of its existence and the obscure passage regarding the savior and exploited that your great grandmother the revered mother was an earther and so is your grandmother the savior dont you see earth conquered the empire a hundred years ago and they just havent realized it yet there is an earth woman on the throne
749482 no shes not the savior she was a little girl who happened to be born with blue eyes to a woman who was a marketing genius your great grandmother saw the opportunity somehow and took it
749483 so why are you so convinced there is something under the lake
749484 because noahcorp was originally allied with the navajo before the ellingsons and they had to have a reason beside their dislike of randolph ellingson to revoke the lease i think they are protecting something and i intend to find it your being in sedona clinches it for me
749485 before the revered mother founded noahcorp she was a fashion model that and the fact you could be her twin is too great a coincidence to me i think the same thing that helped them then has arranged to have us both meet in sedona this week i think we are meant to find what is below the lake
749486 thats the reason i came after you instead of staying behind to finish the project and make up with vanessa i believe the two of us were meant to do this together i knew that when i found out whom you really were
749487 get the rest of your things off our land and it will be put to rest
749488 the mansions and the lake are historical sites integral parts of noahcorps history as well as earth history i want assurances from you that they will be treated as such
749489 but you would close this area to all non navajo
749490 you want this place because you make billions on the tours and souvenirs every year this place was not about money ellingson
749491 this place was created as a haven of discovery for the protection of the people the money only enabled them to do their work
749492 name your price campbell anything you want and ill pay it
749493 my great grandfather told yours to shove his money and im telling you the same thing we do not want your money all we want is the remainder of our land back
749494 noahcorp will not leave this area until i get guarantees the public will have access to this place
749495 i can tie this up for so long that i will bankrupt the navajo nation
749496 do you think i fear a few hundred men with shotguns on horseback anytime you want a war feel free to attack your men wont last twenty minutes against noahcorp security
749497 we are willing to give our lives to protect our property
749498 read about how the u s cavalry killed your warriors and put your people on reservations
749499 we will have justice ellingson even if it takes another hundred years even if it takes a thousand
749500 the navajo believe there is a spirit in there that
749501 i dont believe in ghosts either brad but maybe there is something else in there maybe the thing youre looking for really is in there we could use his help
749502 because the navajo have issues with noahcorp if i can show him we both have a common enemy he might just give us the help we need
749503 do you think ellingson would waste a million six on a garbage picking expedition on the slim chance you would find anything
749504 damn it bradley dont look at me like that i didnt mean it as a dig im looking at this from ellingsons point of view as it relates to the navajo
749505 and i dont like the idea of dealing with the indian
749506 how did you put up with vanessas job for so long
749507 friday night was the worst yet because i had to watch as that damn renkin monopolized her time
749508 i told you i wasnt making any promises i think nighthorse is attractive i wont lie to you but i have no plans to seduce him if something happens while we are there then it happens
749509 we will have to take it on faith he will know we are coming back
749510 i dont but there are other cultures that practice mysticism throughout the galaxy there are still many things that cannot be explained he knew things about me i think he knew my true identity
749511 what are we going to do just show up and hell be waiting how are we even going to get close to earth where are we going to put the spyder if we do
749512 this concerns the empire as well as earth kimmy not some quest for an orgasm befitting a princess
749513 thats the best idea youve had since we left phoenix
749514 were on a stinking asteroid bradley ill activate it after you leave and someone will find me before my air runs out
749515 what happened to all that talk about what we are destined to do how we were destined to find it together
749516 what will you tell them that you were brought back from the dead youre not the revered mother you cant get away with crap like that
749517 ill tell them you dropped me off here before you killed yourself
749518 but you still cannot reconcile with vanessa i can almost guarantee that
749519 youre one to give advice on matters of the heart
749520 the priesthood took yours remember you have no heart and they probably took your soul too maybe the indian knows that
749521 im going back to finish the project and ask vanessas forgiveness
749522 im sorry the facilities are not what you are accustomed to
749523 i have spent weeks at a time on navy ships captain
749524 kimmy and i were not having an affair i hired her as my assistant that was all i had no intention of hurting vanessa
749525 i want to know what the princess told you and why you went with her
749526 i didnt know she was a princess until we were on our way to a jump point she didnt tell me anything we had personality conflicts
749527 why did you go with her and leave vanessa alone in the noahcorp apartment
749528 i put vanessa on the bed and went after kimmy to talk her into coming back she said vanessa was going to be out for an hour anyway
749529 i was scared the princess dropped me off on the asteroid and said she was leaving the system i didnt know shed been killed until i got back to earth
749530 im sorry you had to go through that son he left the door open and she appeared seconds later
749531 to talk her into coming back to try and get the two of you to work it out so she could stay on and you could assure yourself she wasnt the princess i was a fool babe and i hope youll forgive me
749532 im going to finish this project and im coming to new york i want to be with you and if getting a real job is what it takes then thats what im prepared to do
749533 i have a few cute little places to show you ms won
749534 everyone who lives out here works in new seoul mostly in the administration and services sector they like the escape from the stress of their jobs
749535 i want to see travis as soon as he gets in
749536 she was working with travis and all schaffer could think to do was watch her ship
749537 while you have them i want a way to deal with the indians campbell is starting to get nervous and im going to have to do something about him

749548 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it
749549 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign

749558 aw bella why dont you wear something i bought you

749560 come on lets get going we dont was to be late
749561 bella were going to a party your allowed to be late its called being fashionably late
749562 bella couldnt you at least have tried with your appearance youre beautiful but these men at the party dont care about natural beauty they only care about how much of your cleavage is showing dont you want to attract someone
749563 im going to the party and i said id dress myself that included my face
749564 ive got to say hello bella ill be right back
749565 thats all well and good unpack seems like a useful function but it looks so cryptic
749566 right then i went down hook line and sinker she just knocked me out a lot of people saw that happen
749567 we kept looking at the stage and then at him and then back at her
749568 and we thought somethings happening here it was so obvious
749569 he was totally hit between the eyes she took his breath away
749570 streisand loved that song but they cut it from the movie
749571 well drive your damn car christopher reeve wants to give you a ride now go for it
749572 but why would i leave my perfectly good car in the parking lot
749573 we didnt get a drink we didnt sit down we didnt move
749574 its getting late it was very nice to meet you
749575 what i think is happening is that the customer is getting more in charge i challenge you to find large enterprise customers who are unhappy with this deal
749576 why the hell am i with a person more old fashion than me

749578 wait a minute technically speaking i am aunty already nevermind lar
749579 i guess you had some lean years and didnt have to beat it hard
749580 hm whos day to be the hero is it today
749581 i guess you had some lean years and didnt have to beat it hard
749582 talk about mind over matter thats danny way this is a lesson in determination
749583 the princess is naked i have to get her some clothes
749584 eso es dif cil explicarlo pero en el fondo puede ser una se al de dios que est invitando a cambiar de forma de actuar porque el hombre quiere cambiar el curso de la historia y ser l mismo dios

749586 overheated rhetoric and personal attacks on our opponents distract from the big differences between john mccains vision for the future of our nation and the democrats this campaign is about john mccain his vision leadership experience courage service to his country and ability to lead as commander in chief from day one
749587 what youre going to see is a great debate which is what the american public deserves none of this negative stuff though you wont see it come out of our side at all
749588 the ad e mailed to supporters refers to obama as the one and uses rhetoric from some of obamas high flying speeches making fun of quotes such as we are the ones weve been waiting for and this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal
749589 it shall be known that in 2008 the world shall be blessed the announcer intones
749590 mccain at a news conference smiled as he talked about the new ad
749591 we were having some fun with our supporters he said were going to display a sense of humor in this campaign
749592 i dont think our campaign is negative in the slightest he said
749593 encourage the professionalization of sports teams by emphasizing the value of athletic performance over academic achievement
749594 distribute a larger share of ncaa revenue to schools based on need and eliminate performance based rewards
749595 while that athlete can challenge such actions at a scholarship withdrawal hearing the ncaa hasnt set any rules or standards for those hearings
749596 mais ma foi cest la commande du client ce serait impoli de corriger
749597 now that enrollment in advanced math courses is equalized we dont see gender differences in test performance
749598 but people are surprised by these findings which suggests to me that the stereotypes are still there
749599 the stereotype that boys do better at math is still held widely by teachers and parents
749600 and teachers and parents guide girls giving them advice about what courses to take what careers to pursue i still hear anecdotes about guidance counselors steering girls away from engineering telling them they wont be able to do the math
749601 i dont want my daughter high jumping or running over hurtles because she may not be able to have a baby
749602 perhaps the greatest lesson however randy taught us all was how to live even in the face of great challenges and how to follow our passion while randys greatest passion was clearly his family he did not shy from sharing his passion for his work as a professor for his students and for carnegie mellon we will miss randy but we will carry the memory of him and all that he did to make carnegie mellon a better university and each of us who knew him a better person
749603 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
749604 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
749605 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
749606 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
749607 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
749608 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
749609 eso es dif cil explicarlo pero en el fondo puede ser una se al de dios que est invitando a cambiar de forma de actuar porque el hombre quiere cambiar el curso de la historia y ser l mismo dios
749610 se ven cosas inexplicables por eso uno no puede aventurar a dar hip tesis lo que estamos haciendo es esperar a que el padre mande a quibdo la muestra del l quido

749917 im sure this isnt the reaction you are normally met with
749918 mr k its very kind of you to think of me for this exclusive one time only offer but you dont understand right now i need every single penny i have to actually stay alive
749919 but ms red we actually have various plans and the most inexpensive one we have is so cheap it works out to only xx cents per month
749920 but ms red what if i may ask is it that you do for a living then
749921 actually mr k the fact that im as broke as i am should tell you exactly what a terrible and very obscure writer i am
749922 but ms red if you purchase this funeral coverage that amounts to the minuscule amount of xx cents per month your family wont have any worries about your funeral when you die and ms red you do realise that you are going to die dont you
749923 ms red listen i feel so awful for you i almost want to buy you this coverage for you
749924 thats all right mr k really very generous of you but i assure you its fine
749925 you know ms red it doesnt even matter how you die there will be no medical check up before or after the fact
749926 wow thats reassuring so you mean to tell me that id be able to get this insurance even with a knife stuck in my heart its blade piercing the last bit of life out of me
749927 so youll pay out even for writers who have offed themselves by gnawing off their own wrists
749928 mr k now you are making me feel so bad about not buying this coverage from you i could just about die from the guilt
749929 why should it make any difference to you whether i live or die mr k you dont even know me
749930 because you dont own our one time only exclusive funeral coverage plan
