1890073 tl lets make a music video for our daily disciples womens conferences and use mary james song do you know my name
1890074 we know from speaking daily with prisoner rape survivors that the vast majority will never file a formal complaint for fear of retaliation stigma or further abuse
1890075 not surprisingly todays report establishes a 15 times higher rate of sexual abuse than an analysis of formal inmate complaints over a one year period published by the bjs four months ago
1890076 after being raped by a prison guard i was devastated and terrified i felt sure that filing a formal complaint with the perpetrators colleagues would only have made my situation worse
1890077 when the government makes the grave decision to remove a persons liberty it takes on the responsibility to guarantee his or her physical safety
1890078 whether perpetrated by staff or by inmates sexual abuse in detention is a problem of poor prison policies and practices it is not an inevitable fact of life behind bars
1890079 irremediably in violation of international law and break our treaty promises
1890080 the execution of jos ernesto medell n rojas by the state of texas is a violation of international law
1890081 it undermines the authority of the international court of justice icj which had ruled in favour of a stay of execution
1890082 constitutes an international law obligation on the part of the united states
1890083 all decisions and orders of the international court of justice must be respected by states
1890084 the government of mexico sent the us department of state a diplomatic note of protest for this violation of international law expressing its concern for the precedent that it may create for the rights of mexican nationals who may be detained in that country
1890085 this is the third time since 2004 that the uss highest court has rejected arguments advanced by the bush administration that it can indefinitely detain people without charge or trial with no meaningful access to justice
1890086 the time has come for the us government to finally bring its detention policies and practices in the war on terror in line with international standards it must stop all interference with the access of detainees to civilian courts it should close guant namo promptly abandon the fundamentally unfair military commission proceedings and either release or charge and try detainees held there in us federal courts
1890087 study this opinion and well do so with this in mind to determine whether or not additional legislation might be appropriate so that we can safely say or truly say to the american people were doing everything we can to protect you
1890088 as long as corrections staff are able to victimize youth with impunity sexual abuse will continue to fester in juvenile detention facilities
1890089 when a report of abuse is confirmed and the staff involved are still not disciplined officials send a clear message that abusive behavior is acceptable and that reporting such abuse is at best futile
1890090 we have consistently called for justice and security to be pursued within a framework of strict adherence to international law however the us government has systematically failed in this regard

1890093 the data provided by the bjs today are alarming enough but unfortunately they represent only a fraction of the true number of jail inmates who are victimized

1890096 which so far as bears on this case forbids knowingly attempting to persuade induce entice or coerce a person under 18 to engage either in prostitution or in any sexual activity for which one could be charged with a criminal offense
1890097 it is always possible that had the intended victim been a real girl the defendant would have gotten cold feet at the last minute and not completed the crime even though he was in position to do so but there is a sufficient likelihood that he would have completed it to allow a jury to deem the visit to meet the pretend girl a substantial step toward completion and so the visit is conduct enough to make him guilty of an attempt and not merely an intent

1890113 the purpose of this study is to find out whether or not the study drug fingolimod is safe and have beneficial effects in people who have ms fingolimod is an oral once a day medicine which has not yet been approved for the treatment of ppl w ms it is an fda approved med for pts who have had kidney transplants and available for them the main purpose of the study is to evaluate how effective fingolimod is in reducing the number of relapses in pts with rrms treated for a longer time ie up to 2 years it will also evaluate how safe and well tolerated fingolimod is when used for up to 2 years about 1080 pts with rrms will join in this study at about 100 hospitals clinics approx 9 10 pts will participate at the hospital of the university of pa aka hup im 7 study pts will be asked to come to the study site at least 14 times over a period of about 25 months some visits may require a return visit to complete all of the required tests after completing the 24 mnth study pts will be eligible to join a study extension fingolimod is an oral capsule once daily drug that acts on the immune system fingolimod acts on certain types of white blood cells lymphocytes responsible for immune reactions it make a proportion of these cells move away from areas of inflammation and redirecxts them towards lymph nodes and other places in the body where they rest these cells are believed to play an important role in the inflammation process associated with ms in kidney transplantation this mechanism of action would be hypothesized to help prevent the rejection of the grafted organ to date over 2300 subjects approx 400 healthy volunteers 1800 stable and new renal transplant recipients and 280 ms pts have been treated with either single up to 40 mg or multiple up to 5 mg day doses of fingolimod fingolimod has been studied for 6 months in 280 pts w rrms who recvd either placebo 1 25 mg or 5 mg of fingolimod daily of the pts who completed the study both doses of the med reduced the number of relapses and the number of active lesions on brain mri there were no differences between higher and lower dose in this study based on the results from the previous study in ms pts the 1 25 mg dose appeared to be as effective as the 5 mg dose but with a somewhat more favorable safety profile the study will also test a lower dose 0 5 mg which has not yet been tested in ms pts but has been shown to reduce the number of lymphocytes in the blood of healthy volunteers and transplant pts an effect which is expected to contribute to the efficacy of fingolimod in ms therefore pts will be randomly assigned to one of three treatments 1 25 mg fingolimod daily 1 capsule a day for 24 months 0 5 mg fingolimod daily 1 capsule a day for 24 months the reason for the placebo control group is to make the evaluation of fingolimod for the treatment of ms as objective as possible to ensure that the changes that are reported and observed by study pts and study doctors are not just happening by chance study pts and their study doctor will not know which treatment the pt is receiving unless there is an emergency the study dr can then find out which treatment the pt is on the clinical study includes a total of 14 visits 2 pre treatment visits screening and baseline and 12 treatment visits over a period of 24 months on the first day of the treatment period aka randomization visit pts will be given their first doese of their study med by a medical dr and will be monitored for at least 6 hrs before being allowed to go home after the randomization visit treatment visits are scheduled at 2 weeks one month two months three months six months nine months twelve months fifteen months eighteen months twenty one months and twenty four months if the pt completes the 24 month study while taking the study med participation will be offered in a long term extension study with fingolimod only

1890142 finally the third step i will take is to call on businesses government and the american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 by the end of the next decade this is by far the fastest easiest and cheapest way to reduce our energy consumption and it will save us 130 billion on our energy bills since dupont implemented an energy efficiency program in 1990 the company has significantly reduced its pollution and cut its energy bills by 3 billion the state of california has implemented such a successful efficiency strategy that while electricity consumption grew 60 in this country over the last three decades it didnt grow at all in california there is no reason america cant do the same thing we will set a goal of making our new buildings 50 more efficient over the next four years and well follow the lead of california and change the way utilities make money so that their profits arent tied to how much energy we use but how much energy we save in just ten years these steps will produce enough renewable energy to replace all the oil we import from the middle east

1890153 the priority is to see the usa womens team win a gold medal because itll be the pinnacle of our sisters success that shes had on the basketball court
1890154 she doesnt want to be the coach of the first womens team to lose the olympics
1890155 im not sure that shed be a first but you dont want to lose theres a lot of pressure
1890156 i think any coach would be concerned but i think shes very positive
1890157 from what she told me they could win but itll be close there are no run aways
1890158 one of the hard things about my sister being a coach anyone being a coach whether its coach kevin bromley on the mens team at cal poly or coach rich ellerson for cal poly football is that its really hard for people to understand that theyre valuable people when theyre being defined by winning or losing

1890232 engkau menyangka rnereka bersatu dalam suatu urusan dan pendapat padahal pikiran dan perasaan mereka terpecah belah penganut kebatilan
1890233 wahai kaum mukmin sungguh kalian lebih ditakuti di dalam hati kaum yahudi dari kalangan bani nadhir dibandingkan dengan allah hal ini disebabkan karena mereka adalah kaum yang tidak paham akan derajat keagungan allah swt sehingga mereka menyembunyikan kemaksiatan kemaksiatannya serta tidak takut akan siksanya sebagaimana ketakutan mereka atas kalian allah zat yang maha terpuji menyatakan bahwa kaum yahudi dari kalangan bani nadhir tidaklah memenangi kaum mukmin kecuali dari kampung kampung yang dilindungi atau dari balik benteng allah swt juga menegaskan bahwa permusuhan mereka kaum yahudi itu dengan sesama mereka sangat luar biasa engkau menyangka meneka kaum munafik dan ahli kitab itu memiliki satu sikap padahal pikiran dan hati mereka bertentangan karena mereka saling bermusuhan sesama mereka itu allah yang mahatinggi menjelaskan ciri yahudi dan kaum munafik dalam ayat itu adalah perbedaan kepentingan dan permusuhan satu sama lain karena mereka tidak menggunakan akal untuk mernahami mana yang memberikan kebaikan pada mereka dan mana yang mendatangkan kekurangan atas mereka ath thabari pun mengutip pendapat pendapat muj hid qatadah serta abdullah bin masud seperti yang dinukil oleh imam al qurthubi dalam kitabnya imam ibn katsir 7 memaknai ayat ini sebagai isyarat atas sikap pengecut dan ketakutan rmereka yaitu ahli kitab dan kaum munafik mereka tidak mampu berhadapan langsung dan duel dengan pasukan islam sebaliknya mereka berperang dari gedung atau benteng untuk melindungi diri dalam keadaan penting di antara sifat mereka adalah permusuhan di antara sesama mereka yang demikian hebat hal ini senada dengan firman allah swt dalam surat 6 ayat 65 yang artinya dia mencampurkan kalian dalam beberapa golongan yang saling bertentangan dan menimpakan atas sebahagian kalian keganasan sebahagian yang lain engkau melihat mereka itu menyatu sehingga engkau menyangka mereka itu saling terikat padahal mereka memiliki tujuan yang berbeda beda dari surat at hasyr 59 ayat 14 di atas dapat diketahui beberapa karakter asli kaum kafir dan munafik yaitu 1 takut dan pengecut mereka takut mati karenanya allah swt menegaskan yang artinya mereka tidak akan memerangi kamu dalam keadaan bersatu padu kecuali dalam kampung kampung yang berbenteng atau di balik tembok hal ini karena tolok ukur mereka adalah materi kebahagiaan yang dicari adalah kebahagiaan di sini di dunia ini dengan meninggal dunia berarti meninggalkan kesenangan dalam pandangan mereka oleh sebab itu muncullah sikap takut pengecut dan takut mati lain halnya dengan kaum mukmin tolok ukur kebahagiaan mereka adalah ridha allah pencipta mereka mereka sadar mereka mempunyai rasa takut tetapi musuh mereka pun mempunyai rasa takut mereka lelah musuh mereka pun lelah mereka khawatir musuh mereka pun khawatir akan tetapi bedanya bila kaum mukmin ditetapkan harus meninggal dalam perjuangan melawan kebatilan allah swt pasti memberikan ampunan dan rahmatnya yang tidak akan diperoleh kaum kafir dan munafik dia menegaskan yang artinya sungguh kalau kalian gugur atau meninggal tentulah ampunan allah dan rahmat nya lebih baik bagi kalian daripada harta rampasan perang yang mereka kumpulkan oleh karena itu kaum mukmin tidak memiliki sikap takut apalagi pengecut dalam perjuangan menegakkan islam lebih dari itu allah swt akan meneguhkan hati kaum mukmin seperti pada saat perang badar allah swt berfirman ingatlah ketika tuhan kalian mewahyukan kepada para malaikat sesungguhnya aku bersama kalian o eh karena itu teguhkanlah pendirian orang orang yang telah beriman
1890234 sebab sebab peperangan ditujukan untuk mengusir musuh menjaga dakwah dan untuk menjaga kekebasan beragama dengan alasan alasan inilah allah swt mensyariatkan perang
1890235 sebab peperangan di dalam islam adalah mengusir musuh menjaga dakwah kebebasan menjalankan agama serta mensucikan muka bumi dari th gh t dan kezaliman kezaliman
1890236 rasulullah mengumandangkan peperangan karena dua alasan penting i mengusir dan melawan musuh 2 menjaga dakwah islam karena islam adalah seruan kebenaran
1890237 islam tidak semata melakukan peperangan secara ofensif dengan tujuan menaklukkan suatu negeri atau memperluas wilayah perang yang dibenarkan oleh syariat islam adalah perang untuk mempertahankan diri mengusir musuh mempertahankan perdamaian atau perjanjian yang telah disepakati atau menjaga dakwah islam
1890238 gencatan senjata dengan musuh boleh dilakukan apabila di dalamnya benar benar terdapat kemashlahatan kaum muslim

1890271 as far as your home network is concerned fios internet is just like any other broadband internet connection the interface box that verizon will install called an ont or optical network terminal will convert the fios optical signals to tv telephone and ethernet outputting them to ordinary garden variety f rj 11and rj 45 connectors respectively they will run a cable from the rj 45 to your new router which they will supply i elected to go with their wired router since all of my network is wired but i think you can also choose a router that has a built in access point they may ding you another 20 or so for it for connecting to your wireless stuff your macs should work fine talking to the router directly i have no info on how or if it will interface with dedicated mac wireless gear btw when they install the fiber drop the cable that connects your house to the utility pole assuming thats your setup they will cut down your existing copper drop and take it away forever this means that if you should have a prolonged power outage that your phone service will only work as long as the little back up battery supplying the ont lasts when a tree branch came down on a power wire in my neighborhood a couple of months ago the power was off for over 5 hours in anticipation of this sort of an event id installed a small 500va ups ahead of the fios power supply it wasnt big enough the ups and the fios battery together lasted less than 3 hours i have since upped the ups in front of the fios supply to 1 kva alternatively there is a 12vdc input socket on the power supply you could probably connect a car battery to if you can dertermine what kind of plug to use radio shack should stock them and get the polarity right of course youll need to keep at least one corded phone around i really like my fios service the internet connection has never missed a beat in over two years and the tv service is superb i jumped ship on the plain vanilla telephone service and went to a non verizon voip service but verizon voicewing voip has since come down in price and is now competitive in pricing and features with vonage ga

1890369 since my life as a prisoner has begun i have heard the teachings of the white mans religion and in many respects believe it to be better than the religion of my fathers believing that in a wise way it is good to go to church and that associating with christians would improve my character i have adopted the christian religion i believe that the church has helped me much during the short time i have been a member i am not ashamed to be a christian and i am glad to know that the president of the united states is a christian for without the help of the almighty i do not think he could rightly judge in ruling so many people i have advised all of my people who are not christians to study that religion because it seems to me the best religion in enabling one to live right

1890398 the picts have always been an attractive lost people they are one of the most interesting lost peoples of europe
1890399 the big question is what happened to them and did they ever really make a kingdom of their own
1890400 they would have been dreaming of a new rome and a new world connected by water rather than roman roads
1890401 they were the most extraordinary artists they could draw a wolf a salmon an eagle on a piece of stone with a single line and produce a beautiful naturalistic drawing nothing as good as this is found between portmahomack and rome even the anglo saxons didnt do stone carving as well as the picts did not until the post renaissance were people able to get across the character of animals just like that
1890402 the most important piece had a latin inscription thats as common as muck in the mediterranean but extremely rare in scotland
1890403 it says this is the cross of christ in memory of reo and the rest is broken away unfortunately the key bit the name of the person is missing it means theres someone around there who knows how to write in the eighth century that itself is a revelation
1890404 the golden section together with its inverse the golden number 1 618 has been valued by artists for millennia and it is a true delight to observe it among their architects
1890405 it shows the importance of symbol and worship in everything done in the service of the christian god
1890406 there is something rather intriguing in the learnt character of them this is a building put up to house metal workers its the idea they were all possessed of the same kind of knowledge and all trying to serve it
1890407 this is staggering to hear but im not totally surprised i think they were pretty sophisticated when you think of all the pictish stones and the wonderful carvings that they made a lot more sophisticated than perhaps they are given credit for in public perception
1890408 to describe an event in a horrific gruesome and tragic way
1890409 consider how the lilies grow they do not labor or spin yet i tell you not even solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these
1890410 do not be afraid little flock for your father has been pleased to give you the kingdom
1890411 i need to build my faith so that i dont begin to panic when i cant see how things are working
1890412 even if god doesnt take my eczema away i will still obey him
1890413 our secrets keep us sick we have to let them out into the light so god can have them
1890414 beli tiketnya nanti dulu ya mba sekarang keretanya masih di purwokerto

1890418 sekali dua kali kami menanyakan tempat untuk menunggu bis ke malang berjalan beberapa ratus meter lagi tidak ada artinya sudah di jombang tinggal sedikit usaha lagi untuk sampai di malang semangat pagi

1890422 do you personally have any regrets about what you did campaigning for your wife
1890423 yes but not the ones you think and it would be counterproductive for me to talk about there are things that i wish id urged her to do things i wish id said things i wish i hadnt said but i am not a racist ive never made a racist comment and i never attacked him personally
1890424 kelima kandidat cawapres itu harus dimasukkan dalam tim di kabinet bayangan megawati meski nanti hanya satu nama yang terpilih

1890427 often we may be in doubt as to what to do it is no easy matter to decide what is right and what is not one little test i shall ask you to apply whenever you are in doubt it may help you never do anything in secret or anything you wish to hide for the desire to hide anything means that you are afraid and fear is a bad thing and unworthy of you be brave and all the rest follows if you are brave you will not fear and will not do anything of which you are ashamed
1890428 i texted ed on monday one word thank you took me off the front page
1890429 the premier would not even know what he was talking about wouldnt have seen the show
1890430 when youre clearly in the wrong lash out at everybody else and make out that your the victim
1890431 we wish her well whatever her trials and tribulations are and we hope that we can get her on here one day and actually speak to her about the subject that got a bit hijacked for one reason or another
1890432 and if she is listening or any of her friends are listening we pass on our best wishes to her
1890433 raise the minimum wage and index it to inflation to make sure that full time workers can earn a living wage that allows them to raise their families and pay for basic needs such as food transportation and housing
1890434 labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1890435 what if im wrong and its not really bs or maybe it is bs but they dont know it now what am i being judgmental etc
1890436 it just seems like everyone is terrified ahead of the olympics that something will happen on their patch so they are overreacting
1890437 if id known the city was going to be like this i would have left for the games
1890438 she got them apple bottom jeans and the boots with the fur

1890442 i noticed you used to work for company x so did i from 95 98 what a coincidence
1890443 we are two very good tailors and after many years of research we have invented an extraordinary method to weave a cloth so light and fine that it looks invisible as a matter of fact it is invisible to anyone who is too stupid and incompetent to appreciate its quality
1890444 besides being invisible your highness this cloth will be woven in colors and patterns created especially for you
1890445 just tell us what you need to get started and well give it to you
1890446 were almost finished but we need a lot more gold thread here excellency admire the colors feel the softness

1890453 and the colors the colors of that beautiful fabric i have never seen anything like it in my life
1890454 the boy is right the emperor is naked its true
1890455 why did the person who had this role prior not work out what is causing the problems in technical support that you mention
1890456 i know these guys blah blah blah from way back when they first started they know me
1890457 yeah brady told me all about it blah blah blah
1890458 you probably dont remember when brady was in the group
1890459 i guess that was enough explanation on that one cause he shut up for like a minute
1890460 yeah brady is with a band called hot cherry pie now
1890461 yeah buddy smoke another one it is freakin hot apple pie sounds like you really know what you are talking about there bud
1890462 i am not sure what tim is up to now

1890464 youll be fine this weekend and youll be fine at the world
1890465 you see why i hate showing hell do this to you every time too much stress youll learn to hate showing too
1890466 goes back to the days when all gentlemen wore powdered wigs like the ones still worn by the judges in british courts the word wool was then a popular joking term for hair the expression pull the wool over his eyes came from the practice of tilting a mans wig over his eyes so he couldnt see what was going on
1890467 that is my thunder by god the villains will play my thunder but not my play
1890468 in the old time european armies the soldiers were aligned side by side in neat rows or ranks on the battlefield when the enemy attacked officers would order the troops to close ranks that is to move the rows close together so that the enemy faced a seemingly impregnable mass of men
1890469 when i was a youngster on the streets of new york one could both see and smell the emissions of horse drawn wagons since there was no way of controlling these emissions they or the undigested oats in them served to nourish a large population of english sparrows if you say somethings for the birds youre politely saying its horseshit
1890470 the pale in this expression has nothing to do with the whitish color but comes originally from the latin palus meaning a pole or stake since stakes are often used to mark boundaries a pale was a particular area within certain limits
1890471 those who lived beyond the pale were outside english jurisdiction and were thought to be uncivilized
1890472 infections such as thrush were sometimes treated by putting a live frog head first into the patients mouth by inhaling the frog was believed to draw the patients infection into its own body the treatment is happily obsolete but its memory survives in the 19th century term frog in ones throat
1890473 a more likely explanation is that the expression was originally to a tittle
1890474 contracts were not considered legal until each signer included st andrews cross after their name
1890475 throughout the centuries this custom faded out but the letter x became associated with a kiss
1890476 work and pray live on hay youll get pie in the sky when you die thats a lie

1890481 this is an overwhelming experience in a good way i now understand what makes you the man i admire and respect
1890482 our capacity has been reduced 3 1 per cent versus last year i think that willie walsh has been quite upfront about that he has said it is inevitable that fares will rise
1890483 the data speaks for itself it took a good three years for the industry to recover from the downturn in 2001 when it had a five per cent drop in capacity and a sevenper cent drop in flights
1890484 from our statistics it looks quite possible that we may be facing a far more severe global downturn than we have experienced before
1890485 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document from habbush as outlined in mr suskinds book
1890486 i have no knowledge to the origins of the letter

1890495 dopo lesperienza dellestate del 2007 in cui abbiamo lanciato il progetto seemap su cartaceo i semi raccolti ci hanno spinto a ri lanciare con un respiro pi ampio e permanente non solo limitato ai mesi estivi oggi il cuore del progetto vive sulla piattaforma globale di internet permettendo anche al piccolo bar di essere visibile ed il caso proprio di dirlo visto che tutto il concept come detto si sviluppa sul principio della vista

1890511 there is no one policy or practice that will make our health care system run like an efficient well oiled machine
1890512 this result indicates that it is unnecessary to carry the 1 500 mg dose forward since the 1 000 mg dose may provide a greater margin of safety over longer treatment periods without sacrificing efficacy
1890513 i think it is the best hepatitis c therapy out there but it is still early in development and we need to keep that in mind
1890514 the administrations proposal says these deals should only be permitted when the acquiring entity has a higher credit rating than the seller
1890515 such a transaction creates greater security for retirees and the pension system
1890516 los equipos est n en el derecho de pedir a sus jugadores que regresen a europa
1890517 no est incluido en el calendario coordinado de partidos internacionales y no hay una decisi n espec fica del comit ejecutivo de la fifa que establezca la obligaci n de los clubes de liberar a los jugadores menores de 23 a os para este torneo
1890518 se hizo mayormente sin diego y est tan avanzada que no tiene mucho sentido traerlo a esta altura
1890519 nos complace que el tas haya confirmado nuestra interpretacin legal
1890520 aqu no hay vencedores porque se cre una situaci n imposible como resultado de la demora en resolver el asunto cinco minutos antes del inicio del torneo tenemos que decidir si traer de vuelta a un jugador o no
1890521 nuestra decisi n hubiera sido muy distinta si la posici n legal hubiera sido aclarada antes en ese caso
1890522 no hubi ramos permitido que rafinha viajase bajo ninguna circunstancia
1890523 la fifa est sorprendida y decepcionada por la decisi n pero la respetamos
1890524 no obstante les pido a los clubes dejen que sus jugadores participen en los juegos ol mpicos
1890525 ser un acto solidario que armonizar perfectamente con el esp ritu ol mpico ser maravilloso tanto para los jugadores como para los aficionados y el propio deporte
1890526 las relaciones entre la fifa y los clubes no est n tan bien como deber an y parece que hubo una falta de clarificaci n por ambas partes ahora vamos a trabajar con la fifa para que las reglas ayuden a los atletas en un futuro a participar en los juegos ol mpicos
1890527 este es el momento de sentarse en la mesa y encontrar una soluci n razonable
1890528 no creo que sea en el inter s de nadie destruir el que podr ser un torneo extraordinario este a o
1890529 la fifa y la confederaci n brasile a de f tbol estaban al tanto de la situaci n desde hace meses creo que demoraron deliberadamente su resoluci n para poner en una situaci n inc moda a los clubes
1890530 it probably makes most sense today to talk about my departure to see how i can be as productive as possible before i leave plus i really want to leave things on a positive note with you what can i do in my last two weeks to help transition my work most effectively
1890531 youve got to understand that many of us have been doing what were doing in some form for much longer than the term emerging church has even existed
1890532 the mature christian of the future will not belong primarily to a christian denomination he will belong to a community of people who believe in the christian interpretation of life
1890533 we will hit those points in a few years and that will help in many ways
1890534 we just have to survive through this part of the cycle
1890535 more delinquencies look like they are on the horizon because so few of them have reset
1890536 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
1890537 this is not supposed to happen in america in a free society which relies on the engagement of citizens in debate and protest and political activity to maintain that freedom you should be able to attend a meeting about an issue you care about without having to worry that government spies are entering your name into a database used to track alleged terrorists and drug traffickers
1890538 there were about 75 80 protesters at the rally and none participated in any type of civil disobedience or illegal acts protesters were even careful to move out of the way for division of correction employees who were going into the parking lot for work
1890539 americans have the right to peaceably assemble with others of a like mind and speak out about what they believe in
1890540 for state agencies to spend hundreds of hours entering information about lawful and peaceful political activities into a criminal database is beyond unconscionable it is a waste of taxpayer dollars which does nothing to make us safer from actual terrorists or drug dealers
1890541 this is couldnt be a worse time weve got a release next week
1890542 everyone looks up to joe this is going to be bad for morale
1890543 my team is already stretched to the limit as is
1890544 he was my go to guy the fact that i didnt see this coming is going to make me look bad
1890545 really i didnt know that you were unsatisfied what can i do to make it better for you
1890546 there are great plans we just havent had a chance to tell you yet
1890547 you cant be serious you are going to work for who
1890548 you know if i could go back id handle things differently luckily ive learned from the experience

1890554 shia militant groups and afghan warlords to attack american and allied forces
1890555 any threat to the peace breach of the peace or act of aggression
1890556 may include complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail sea air postal telegraphic radio and other means of communication and the severance of diplomatic relations
1890557 call upon the parties concerned to comply with such provisional measures
1890558 agreed yesterday to seek new sanctions against iran over its nuclear program after the country failed to meet a weekend deadline to respond to an offer
1890559 we have no choice but to pursue further measures against iran
1890560 calling on the administration to focus on the urgency of the iranian threat and to impose tougher sanctions on tehran
1890561 to enhance united states diplomatic efforts with respect to iran by imposing additional economic sanctions against iran and for other purposes
1890562 authorize s state and local governments to direct divestiture from and prevent investment in companies with investments of 20 000 000 or more in irans energy sector
1890563 support ing israels quest for peace and press ing the arab states to do more to support israeli palestinian talks
1890564 the radical regime in iran has sponsored terrorism against the united states israel and the west for decades
1890565 the worlds leading state sponsor of terror noting its support for groups such as hamas hizballah and islamic jihad
1890566 insurgency in iraq supplied arms to the taliban and hosted al qaeda terrorists
1890567 relentlessly pursu es nuclear weapons and thus is a particularly implacable and lethal regime
1890568 only a sustained unified international effort to isolate and sanction iran is likely to convince it to give up these dangerous activities
1890569 speaking from the heart as a true friend of israel when i visit with aipac i am among friends good friends who share my strong commitment that the bond between the united states and israel is unbreakable today tomorrow and forever
1890570 by israel in the face of all threats speak s up when israels security is at risk and voices concern that americas recent foreign policy hasnt made israel more secure hamas now controls gaza hizbollah has tightened its grip on southern lebanon and is flexing its muscles in beirut because of the war in iraq iran which always posed a greater threat to israel than iraq is emboldened and poses the greatest strategic challenge to the us and israel in the middle east in a generation we must isolate hamas syria continues its support for terror and meddling in lebanon and pursu es weapons of mass destruction there is no greater threat to israel or to the peace and stability of the region than iran it supports violent extremists pursues a nuclear capability and threatens to wipe israel off the map my goal will be to eliminate this threat
1890571 foremost in his mind is the threat posed by the regime in tehran the iranian president calls israel a stinking corpse it uses violence to undermine israel in the middle east peace process it supports extremists in iraq killing american soldiers remains the worlds chief sponsor of terrorism and its pursuit of nuclear weapons poses an unacceptable risk a danger we cannot allow
1890572 the most dangerous regime in the middle east characterized by its cruel despotism and fanatic militancy if this regime acquires nuclear weapons this would presage catastrophic consequences not only for my country not only for the middle east but for all of mankind the fact that iran is building nuclear weapons is beyond question and they may be the worlds first un deterable nuclear power so the danger is clear and the question is what do we do about it my message to you is divest iran
1890573 iran has not complied with the international communitys demand to stop enriching uranium so the security council has no choice but to increase the sanctions
1890574 national tragedy demagogically justified an economic catastrophe a regional disaster and a global boomerang for the united states
1890575 a historic strategic and moral calamity undertaken under false assumptions it is undermining americas global legitimacy tarnishing our moral credentials and intensifying regional instability
1890576 plausible scenario for a military collision with iran based on iraqi failure to meet the benchmarks followed by accusations of iranian responsibility for the failure then by some provocation in iraq or a terrorist act in the us blamed on iran culminating in a defensive us military action
1890577 a lonely america into a spreading and deepening quagmire eventually ranging across iraq iran afghanistan and pakistan
1890578 when the president flatly asserts iran is seeking nuclear weapons hes overstating the facts we have very scant supportive evidence and after the iraq calamity he should be very careful about the veracity of his public assertions
1890579 if his secretary of state is joe lieberman and his secretary of defense is rudy giuliani we will be moving towards the ww iv counting the cold war as ww iii that they have been both favoring and predicting an appalling concept
1890580 the us did not give the green light for an israeli attack on iran george bush made it clear to all parties that the first option is diplomacy
1890581 it is the absolute responsibility of everybody in uniform to disobey an order that is either illegal or immoral
1890582 not obey illegal and immoral orders to use weapons of mass destruction they cannot commit crimes against humanity
1890583 if sanctions and incentives cannot be made to work the voices for military action will only get louder no matter what aides may be telling mr bush and mr olmert or what they may be telling each other an attack on iran would be a disaster
1890584 israel will almost surely attack irans nuclear sites in the next four to seven months conventionally
1890585 assault fail to significantly harm or stall the iranian program a nuclear attack will most likely follow
1890586 only one option if it wishes to halt irans march toward nuclear weaponry the military
1890587 which leaves only israel the country threatened almost daily with destruction by irans leaders irans leaders would do well to rethink their gamble and suspend their nuclear program
1890588 will destroy their nuclear facilities even though this would mean thousands of iranian casualties and international humiliation
1890589 the nuclear incineration of 70 million iranians and the contamination of the better part of a billion people in the middle east asia and europe
1890590 that appeared to be a rehearsal for a potential bombing attack
1890591 escalating tensions that would peak with an iranian inspired insurgency strike against us
1890592 generations of jihadists and our grandchildren will be battling them in america
1890593 at least ten senior flag and general officers including combatant commanders
1890594 id like to learn more about how your company has performed through the last economic cycle would you mind sharing the overall financial picture over the past few years
1890595 whats the landscape of competition for your vertical product service and where do you feel this company stands within that context
1890596 tell me more about the current technical environment so i can determine what other overlap there might be with my skill set id also love to learn about any up and coming projects for the same reason
1890597 so what do you like most about working here and how long has it been what types of things would be important for me to understand about your current work environment so that i can ensure that i fit in and contribute value to that

1890599 what im looking for is the most competitive offer im hesitant to give you an exact because im not sure what you think im worth and how id fit in with the compensation structure of the rest of the team so i guess this is a better question to ask of you what do you think i might be worth to your organization
1890600 while money is very important the opportunity within the position is really my 1 consideration if we agree theres a match im confident that youd offer me the most you felt that i was worth
1890601 i approached him and he told me in a very matter of fact way that he was going to the shop
1890602 he told me that his family were at home asleep
1890603 he was fine but it must have been such a shock for his family when they found out what had happened

1890621 they benefited to some degree where a couple of their very important models in their second year on the market the es and the rx which together account for over two thirds of lexus sales both improved significantly
1890622 the lower score is largely due to vehicles that are no longer in the marketplace
1890623 the vehicles are still out there so the study is still relevant but obviously they had some problems

1890650 after levang the cour and reaching motpellier diego met the venerable arnold abbot of citeaux and brother ralph and borther peter of castelnau cistercian monks from fontfroide who were legates of the apostolic see all three had decided to resign from their posts because so much had been demanded of them that they were dscouraged jthey had made scarcely any progress in their preaching against the heretics whenever they spoke out the bad lives of the clergy were dragged into the argument in opposition yet if they dared to attack clerical slackness they would be prevented from preaching altogether
1890651 preached and dispute in public without any ostentation making no use of their authority but relying solely on the persuasive power of plain truth to give weight to their words at the same time they put thier preaching to the test of sincerity this was indeed an unusual sight papal legates a bishop and a canon daring to assume contemptible garments in order to speak to despised men after teh example of christ the poor man
1890652 the people were deeply stirred by the preachers and sometimes whole villages declaring themselves for diego and dominc turned out and follwed them for miles

1890691 at the democratic convention we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election
1890692 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected
1890693 i mean everybody comes and they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity and i think thats all to the good because then you know everybody can go ok great
1890694 since the delegate count is so close what if you are called up for nomination and what if you do win by a narrow margin
1890695 that is not going to happen not going to happen look what we want to have happen is for sen obama to be nominated by a unified convention of democrats
1890696 the best way i think and i could be wrong but the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like theyve had a role and that their legitimacy has been validated and that kind of you know there is a catharsis
1890697 ive consistently said im very happy being a senator for new york i love my work i love representing the people of new york

1890733 kami tidak berhak memberikan sanksi dan hanya menghimbau agar perusahaan pembuat roti itu mengganti bahan kuasnya
1890734 kami juga menemukan beberapa perusahaan pembuat roti di kabupaten bulungan yang menggunakan kuas bulu babi saat ini kami tengah berada di kabupaten berau dan juga menemukan empat perusahaan roti menggunakan kuas bulu babi kami akan melakukan sertifikasi di sejumlah perusahaan di kabupaten nunukan dan tarakan hingga tanggal 11 agustus 2008
1890735 jika diprosentasekan 90 persen perusahaan pembuat roti menggunakan kuas berbahan bulu babi alasan mereka bahannya lembut sehingga mudah digunakan

1890788 yes my coach was kind enough to come and see me in lisbon a few days ago which i think is common knowledge it was a very honest conversation between two people that respect one other and that im sure share a mutual affection and friendship what we said to each other will remain private sir alex listened to me i listened to him and we established that the best for both sides would be for me to continue at old trafford so i can confirm that ill be playing for manchester united next season and before there are any rumours and speculation about me staying against my will i want to make one thing clear whoever says or writes anything to that effect is lying ill be playing at manchester united with my heart and soul i will fight and honour the shirt with the same desire and dedication as i always have
1890789 i want to say that i was the one that was responsible for all this controversy it wasnt their fault because it was me that said publicly that i wanted to move to real madrid it was also me although wholly unintentionally that caused the friction between the two clubs
1890790 i knew that real madrid was interested in signing me and that they had allegedly made a very substantial offer to manchester united for a while i wanted manchester to accept the offer and for me to move to madrid if i denied it i would be deceiving everyone including myself anyone who knows me knows that it would have to be something very important for me to admit such a thing if theres one thing ive never been nor do i ever want to be is ungrateful manchester united from the glazer family the directors namely david gill to the coaches teammates and backroom staff is a club that will always be dear to my heart whatever happens in the future that will never change im very aware of what this club has done for me and ill be eternally grateful come what may but it was because of this because i knew this club was different and extraordinarily human that i hoped that my wishes and my reasons would be understood
1890791 after wed won the champions league i felt that in five years i had helped win everything there was to win wed won the premier league twice and id won a host of individual awards including the best goal scorer in the premier league champions league and in europe so i felt that maybe i needed a new challenge i never hid the fact that i wanted to play in spain at real madrid in particular and i thought this could be the right moment manchester united and real are probably the two biggest clubs in the world and it would never be an easy decision to make apart from the challenge everyone realises that spanish and portuguese culture and lifestyle are more similar those were the reasons that made me consider the change
1890792 im aware that whatever the circumstances there will always be speculation about me i knew that there would always someone whod say that my main concern was making more money others would insist that my vanity couldnt resist being linked to the biggest transfer fee of all time at the age of 23 of course i proud to see my work recognised but none of this had any major effect on what i wanted in fact if it was just a question of money i would never leave manchester united apart from the reasons ive just given i also have to recognise that my family would welcome the change the chance of being an hours flight from my mother and the rest of my family was very attractive even more so playing for a club like real madrid i know i have to deal with these circumstances even though its difficult sometimes but its harder to ask the same of the people i love the most the best proof of what ive just said is the fact that ive just made a major investment in a house in manchester even though i didnt have to i did it not just for my own comfort but also for those closest to me the people at manchester united particularly the manager understood my reasons but we all eventually concluded that i should continue to wear that number seven united shirt its no sacrifice for me its a great honour i have important things to win in england i will give everything i have to manchester united i want to defend the european title and help united become world champion not forgetting the premier league and other competitions
1890793 no to be honest its possible but i hope it doesnt happen i know im a good professional i know that no ones harder on me than myself and thats never going to change under any circumstances the high point of my career was winning the champions league no one will ever erase that from my memory in the same way that no one will ever erase the fact that i did it in a manchester united shirt what i said publicly which was maybe a little naive i take total responsibility for people have to understand one thing at the age of eighteen i arrived at a dream club like manchester united it was a dream come true but even at that moment i was thinking about playing in england for some years and then going to play in spain even at that time i was thinking that way and i always gave 100 everything why lie im not going to be a hypocrite and say the opposite of what i think like some others do i said exactly what i thought i have a dream of playing at real and i thought it was time to move on people cant be upset about me fulfilling a childhood dream
1890794 im very aware of what this club has done for me ill be forever grateful manchester united and its fans can be sure that ill never forget them no matter what happens theyre special and theyll always have a place here puts hand on heart in fact i confess that one of the reasons i had the courage to say what i did was the fact that manchester united would be fairly compensated the figure mentioned which would be a world record would serve as some compensation for the debt of gratitude that i owe the club as least in material terms im going to say something here that ive never told anybody if we hadnt been european champions i probably wouldnt have even thought about going to madrid and there something else that should be mentioned i never wanted to leave against manchester uniteds will when they turned down the offer the people at united made it very clear how much they wanted me i didnt fully understand it at the time but now i can really appreciate it
1890795 that makes no sense nor do i believe thats what he meant as he himself has already stated my comment was about something else i was saying that players should be where they feel happy nothing more
1890796 believe me it makes me proud to know how much he thinks of me and he knows i feel exactly the same way about him he has been one of the most important people in my playing career not only because of what ive learnt and continue to learn from him in sporting terms but also in human ones as well i love the passion he has for football if it were humanly possible i would like to have him always by my side of course its not possible but it shows how much affection admiration and respect i have for him he has always been like a second father to me at manchester united ill never forget that it was him that explained the significance of the number seven united shirt which will always be my shirt when i was at sporting i had a number of offers some of them very lucrative one of them offered eight million euros just as a signing on fee and meant that i would play for sporting for one more year and then leave as a free agent but money isnt everything barcelona real madrid inter milan juventus valencia and practically all the big clubs were also interested at the time jorge mendes explained that manchester united also wanted me and that had told him that he would be very careful with my playing career so i would play at least fifty per cent of the games in the first season which is what happened this shows that i also chose manchester united and that money wasnt the deciding factor alongside my agent jorge mendes sir alex ferguson has been the most important person ive ever known in my career because of this because of the special relationship that exists between us i know that hell understand that there are times when a father has to worry only about whats best for his child
1890797 theres no point in making predictions its not worth speculating because nothing is set in stone and things change all the time in football today there are opportunities that no one knows if they will come round again in the future there are only two certainties ill be playing at manchester united a club im proud to represent real madrid will continue to be a great club without me and i will continue to admire the spanish club as i have done since i was a boy im saying what i think and i hope that all the speculation will stop the press has written some terrible things about me and about this whole thing theyve invented a thousand and one things and thats one of the reasons why i decided to talk about this now and people can be sure of one thing everything ive said comes from the bottom of my heart and is the only truth
1890798 im 100 professional and ive always given my heart and soul to this club i even played a major part of the season injured which was verified by my operation i played in excruciating pain while taking anti inflammatory medication every day and id do it again if necessary this club deserves it because the united staff and the fans are fantastic not forgetting the affection and respect i have for sir alex ferguson if one day i leave the club i want to do it knowing that i did everything i could to help the club win as much as possible if that happens ill leave with the feeling of having done my duty to the maximum
1890799 a great coach left and another took his place ive known carlos queiroz for five years i know what hes like and how he works and i have absolutely no doubt hes one of the best coaches in the world hes the ideal coach for the national team and hell do a great job
1890800 the national team has great players good facilities and a top coach so portugal will have a team to beat any other and fight for the top places in europe and the world

1890829 if the now deceased ivins really was the culprit behind the attacks
1890830 then that means that the anthrax came from a u s government lab sent by a top u s army scientist at ft detrick without resort to any speculation or inferences at all it is hard to overstate the significance of that fact from the beginning there was a clear intent on the part of the anthrax attacker to create a link between the anthrax attacks and both islamic radicals and the 9 11 attacks
1890831 much more important than the general attempt to link the anthrax to islamic terrorists there was a specific intent indispensably aided by abc news to link the anthrax attacks to iraq and saddam hussein
1890832 that means that abc news four well placed and separate sources fed them information that was completely false
1890833 the same government lab where the anthrax attacks themselves came from was the same place where the false reports originated that blamed those attacks on iraq surely the question of who generated those false iraq anthrax reports is one of the most significant and explosive stories of the last decade

1890844 even before superbad came out i think the studio was trying to get seth rogen and evan goldberg to write a sequel but they really didnt want to write a sequel and so an answer to that was to do a superbad pineapple express crossover an unprecedented crossover movie with two directors greg motolla and pineapple express director david gordon green each directing half of the movie and somehow these characters get together which doesnt make sense at all but could work
1890845 my character saul could sell the characters from superbad something but i think wed want some action so you know somehow the kids get in trouble somehow and we have to get them out of it
1890846 and seth plays characters in both movies so somehow wed have to kill one of them off

1890877 i was told i could come back here in november but that petitioning was not allowed in beijing during the olympics
1890878 many petitioners have been sent home already the olympics were originally going to be a good thing but the government has used it to create fear and further violate peoples human rights
1890879 i feel theres been a change in my own personal safety i can tell from what the police told me youre an old friend of president bushs they said youre entitled to vip treatment so they deal with different people in different ways
1890880 since the protest and demonstration law was passed in 1989 theyve only approved two protests in all of china and theyve limited them to fewer than 20 people its really a joke
1890881 their aim is to display the power of the one party dictatorship
1890882 its to say a dictatorship can be prosperous and stable
1890883 chinas original aim in hosting the olympics was to break out of its isolation
1890884 china does not hope for the international community to welcome it it hopes that the international community will acknowledge it

1890889 the american side bears an unshirkable responsibility for this incident
1890890 we were here to do something nonviolent and now this
1890891 the chinese government puts people first and is dedicated to maintaining and promoting its citizens basic rights and freedom
1890892 chinese citizens have freedom of religion these are indisputable facts
1890893 we firmly oppose any words or acts that interfere in other countries internal affairs using human rights and religion and other issues
1890894 change in china will arrive on its own terms and in keeping with its own history and its own traditions
1890895 with this speech bush is trying to address two polar issues easing the controversy created by those who oppose his visit during the games and simultaneously maintaining americas strategy with china
1890896 remember it was not all that long ago they were in the middle of the cultural revolution with people getting put up against a wall and basically knocked off
1890897 the united states will continue to insist that the regime in pyongyang end its harsh rule and respect the dignity and human rights of the north korean people
1890898 as far as a connection its definitely too early in the investigation to tell
1890899 when working as a community organizer with other churches helping to build struggling neighborhoods i let jesus christ into my life i learned that my sins could be redeemed
1890900 then with his sandal the guard drew a cross in the dirt
1890901 we stood wordlessly there for a minute or two venerating the cross until the guard rubbed it out and walked away to me that was faith a faith that unites and never divides a faith that bridges unbridgeable gaps in humanity it is the faith that we are all equal and endowed by our creator with inalienable rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness it is the faith i would die to defend
1890902 their efforts to show obama to be a religious man are not subtle
1890903 if obama can show himself to be a person of faith it also helps him combat the idea that hes an elitist that hes not a mainstream american because if he shows that he prays and hes a churchgoing guy and hes a religious guy thats a very mainstream characteristic
1890904 let me just point out all the things that when republicans do them your colleagues in the media are all over them for exploiting religion and yet when obama does it its considered refreshing and hes competitive
1890905 i didnt attend their church for 20 years and im not a member of their church i received their endorsement which did not mean that i endorsed their views but the comments made most recently by pastor hagee are just too much
1890906 were not only divisive and destructive but i believe that they end up giving comfort to those who prey on hate
1890907 what i hear a lot from southern baptist pastors and lay people is a variation of this sort of theme john mccain was not my first choice john mccain was not my second choice but ill take a third class fireman over a first class arsonist and when it comes to the issue of life when it comes to the issue of marriage they perceive barack obama as a first class arsonist
1890908 ive noticed in the feedback from my own daily reports that if i go back three months ago there was a large number of people saying gary theres just no way i can do this and now people are saying weve got to elect him and how do i volunteer so that gap is going to close too but whether it closes quickly enough over the next hundred days remains to be seen
1890909 what the polls are showing in terms of evangelicals is that john mccain has lost a bunch of them compared to george bush but that barack obama has not yet gotten them he has an opportunity that democrats havent had in a long time but he has not yet succeeded in bringing them over
1890910 were pretty humble in this outreach we certainly dont plan on winning outright the evangelical vote but we do believe that more americans of faith including evangelicals and modern mainline protestants and modern conservative catholics will give senator obama a hard look and will end up supporting him
1890911 i wont bother arguing with you about the smoking either its all written on the packet nowadays
1890912 is it really my word whatever will they think of next
1890913 people with freedom of speech will do everything to express outreach for the struggle theyre facing
1890914 they teach us about who we are as a country

1890926 the u s border patrol recruiting through education and a little glitz
1890927 welcome to the interview really thanks for your time and i know youre a busy person but once again thank you for granting my request for blog interview on this myspace
1890928 oh your welcome im really glad to see people become curious about me i dont make them disappointed
1890929 well okay i dont have any problem after all im god isnt it
1890930 i dont know anything about religion but i would say ill agree with second group do you know how boring it is to sit somewhere and rule everything if you dont have fun then it is so boring about the first group if i like to control people and their wish then there is no way in hell i give them free will
1890931 so your saying your nothing like what most of the people believe or say if that is correct then why there is rules like do this and dont do that say this and dont say that most of the religious scriptures which claim given by you is full rule
1890932 who told you that i set the rule its always done by the humans based on their wish and they always changes rules due to changes in technology ideology etc early day some people believe masturbation is a sin now if you say that to a teenager then they will say get lost and everyone say he she is right because its completely natural
1890933 so your saying there is no rule in your books except for the ten commands
1890934 the reason for my ten commands at that time was very simple people were just crazy they where just mad i believe still they are they just on the edge of being animals that is why said okay take this command and follow this but i never thought they take it so seriously and the same time they break that everyday
1890935 again so what will happen to those who break those command are you going to send them to hell
1890936 haha let me ask you this what will happen if your driving a car in 220miles and there is sign saying speed limit is only 30miles of course its going to hit some where and you break your leg or you could die its nothing to do with me but its all have to do with you
1890937 yea that is a good point but the same time then why you kick out adam and eve from there
1890938 well that is good question in simple way to this question answer is simple im from a place where there is no time so you can call me infinite or something which never become old or young
1890939 so youre a kid or your teenager or youre an old man
1890940 so god why you created satan or why you created evil
1890941 simple answer without evil what is the fun having good and about satan i created just like you guys but as i said he just want to be different thats all and he got bored with heaven so i give him hell i think he is doing well
1890942 so you think death is funny and you do you like to see people suffering
1890943 this is the problem do i like it of course not but let me ask you did i told a suicide bomber to blow himself of course not its their choice its their will some times i think if i let them into heaven then they will blow me hahah so i never going to let them here i think in hell they like explosions and war so ill send them there hahah
1890944 oh i got a special talent i can hear them when someone pray in true heart sometimes i hear like thousand prayer a day
1890945 yea i know but my talent only allow me to hear those who pray with true heart rest is like spam im not interested
1890946 one final question when is this world is going to end
1890947 there are millions of people die every today for them today is the worlds end but for other who dont die today they have to wait till their last movement for the new born to day is the day the world is created
1890948 one personal question could you tell me my future how long i live
1890949 oh jerry i know you will ask that hahah your future uhmm no you have to find out by yourself it gonna be more fun if i say now then you always ask me why you said that about you life span believe me your alive now this very second is that not enough for you and one thing i can say you die just like this movement your now
1890950 okay thank you for your time one more thing is this okay to give your person address to my readers
1890951 well that okay and thank you for inviting me i really like that it was fun you can give the address to your readers take care bye for now
1890952 that missionary family in kenya who wrote in that bos parents were in kenya just before her due date that because she was so far along she was not allowed on the plane
1890953 if you dont know where it is you dont know where it isnt
1890954 i have expressed skepticism about that conclusion others have made about a forged birth certificate not because i question their skills but because i find it hard to fathom that obama as audacious as he is would publish a forged colb
1890955 but i have maintained that obama is hiding something about his birth record
1890956 yes barack obamas birth certificate indicates he was born in honolulu hawaii on august 4 1961 at 7 24 p m
1890957 and is this why if polarik and techdude are correct the colb published by obama has been altered
1890958 knowing what we now know about possible name changes what is your theory

1890960 carol marin is the real deal a while back she actually quit her 10 pm anchor position when new management gave jerry springer a commentary spot on that broadcast it was quite the big event in our town but she is one who can be trusted and one has a lengthy investigative resume at one time she contributed to 60 minutes i am a fan texas darlin if youre listening she might be someone who would look into the citizenship issue i have a personal theory that our gov in illinois knows something about bhos background and that he will sing like a canary when his own political life and freedom are at stake this is just a gut feeling based only on the rezko connection they share and a lifetime of seeing how things work around here
1890961 what were the effects of muslim influences on his heart and mind during this critical time period in his life
1890962 why is adopting a muslim name so important upon conversion two important reasons are given below but otherwise adopting a muslim name is not necessary
1890963 they are then given their student ktp kks like ktps are issued by the government and cross checked by the national police and immigration service it takes weeks to get one costs a lot of money and they dont ever get to contain as many errors as the journalists want to believe that barack obamas did and in 99 of cases they contain none at all
1890964 even if the school had simply taken a parents word for things as in the usa which so far as i can tell they dont and didnt the inspectors or the police would sooner or later have asked to see the kk and all of its supporting documents experience in other countries with similar systems would tend to indicate this would happen within two years at the outside
1890965 yes i am spartacus for all purposes of unity i am muslim too
1890966 i disagree with this assessment and ask the author to provide proof that this is the case
1890967 today they are routinely obtained via bribery such was the case in the 1960s
1890968 the number of 1000 is pure speculation based on what people who were living there at the time remember

1891438 seeking a declaratory judgment stating that no copyright infringement had taken place
1891439 contained a plot pacing and structure that were very similar to daughter of gods
1891440 the secret that drives the plot is the proof of the divinity of women in early christianity and in both books this truth has been alternately suppressed and protected since biblical times in both books clues hidden in artworks lead the protagonists on their frantic dangerous searches both books have two story lines that unfold simultaneously usually in alternating chapters in both books the main story line focuses on the action laden quest of the hero and the heroine while the secondary story line focuses on a shadowy group within the catholic church thats willing to commit murder in order to gain control of the secret

1891543 good they deported this guy who was depleting the system
1891544 repatriation is pretty much a death sentence in some of these cases
1891545 what that does for us it puts a strain on our system where were unable to provide adequate care for our own citizens
1891546 an alternative choice for the care of the unfunded latin american nationals
1891547 weve done flights to lithuania poland honduras guatemala and mexico
1891548 but out of about a dozen cases a year we probably fly only a couple back
1891549 i can think of three different scenarios that would have led to a fatal outcome if they had moved her
1891550 the good outcome today is due to the treatment that the hospital provided reluctantly and sadly enough only in response to legal and public pressure
1891551 he didnt talk he didnt understand anything he stayed curled up in a ball but he was alive

1891561 if a hospital in florida asks if we can take care of a guatemalan patient the tendency is to say yes
1891562 this case is not simply a case as some would try and paint it of money this is a case about care for a man in this country illegally who has reached maximum medical improvement at our hospital and is ready to be discharged and whose home government
1891563 your honor this is a case about a hospital that has failed to do its job properly
1891564 why are you sad when you have basically everything that could be offered to you
1891565 as aquinas once stated the good is not the enemy of the perfect
1891566 we went to see him at the hospital and his bed was empty

1891581 these wheel makers use a forged blank or center then use a cnc machine to cut out a pattern cutting the blank eliminates many of the strength benefits of forging our wheel is a true forged wheel and comes out of the forge already with renntechs signature 10 spoke design

1891859 a chance for wild and wide eyed liberals to buy racial reconciliation on the cheap
1891860 obviously not only was james earl ray a racist person that believed the freedom of blacks a dangerous thing sic he decided the only way to deal with the problem was to assassinate the source dr martin luther king however his death only served to fuel the fires since people across the nation saw him as a martyr
1891861 religious freedom involves both a freedom from and a freedom for freedom from efforts by either government or religious organizations to coerce religious beliefs or practices or to require support financial or otherwise of religious freedom for the practice of religious convictions without interference from government or religious organizations as long as the practice does not harm the well being of others such freedom has been bought with a terribly high price in human suffering and death
1891862 for mens religion to god is between god and themselves the king shall not answer for it neither may the king be judge between god and man

1891867 most of us were given a chance when some of the players were unavailable buyachi has potential to be a quality player
1891868 they added some technical details and added variety to attack and defence
1891869 we have to stamp our authority early in the match and sustain the pressure
1891870 there is no holding back and everybody given a chance to play must give their best
1891871 we played a very good build up match against kenya a on sunday every player is focused to achieve the vision of reaching the 2011 rugby world cup which is within our reach judging by the body language in training consistency seriousness and an initiative by the krfu to bring in coaches from south africa to beef us up technically the south african coaches helped us in the weak areas which was in the rucks and defence they also brought a lot of organization in ruck situations defence and simplified our attack so that we conserve energy and score when the chances come it is this edge that we need to move to the next level i do forsee us being a strong team and doubt that tunisia and uganda will be able to match us
1891872 defence lacked and every player must fall back to defend and love being with the ball for the duration of the match tunisians maybe big but rugby is not about size cameroon forwards were also bigger than our forwards but with the right technique size is relative there is a chance that tunisia will overpower us in the forwards but if we spread the game and raise the intensity in the first 20 minutes then we will have a better chance of winning it will be about endurance and who is much fitter tunisia will go for pound to pound and be physical but we can wear them down
1891873 some of us made their debut against cameroon in 2002 and without a doubt it has helped build our career the surprise player in the team maybe nakurus lawrence buyachi who has all that it takes to be a quality forward
1891874 we expect that for next year there will be more repossession orders given but it wont be a drastic increase

1891926 it was like he had to give it to me

1891948 his teeth were different his voice was different his ears were smaller

1892109 indeed it the sahoor is blessing that allah has given to you so do not leave it out
1892110 eating the sahoor is blessed do not neglect it even if you take a gulp of water because allah and his angels invoke blessings upon those who partake in the pre dawn meal
1892111 we ate the sahoor with the messenger then we got up to offer the salaah prayer in this case the fajr prayer
1892112 what was the time between the adhaan call to prayer and the sahoor
1892113 whoever wishes to fast then let him eat something for sahoor

1892115 what differentiates our fast from the fast of the people of the book is the sahoor meal

1892207 late bloomer is the story of sumida san a severely handicapped man and his downward spiral into hell
1892208 in the interview which accompanies this review director shibata talks about how late bloomer grew out of a desire to confound cultural misconceptions and prejudice against the handicap he himself admits that he was guilty of these cultural biases and claims that one of the most important things he had to overcome during the shooting of this film comprising the first year and a half of its total production time was the emotional and social distance that existed between sumida and himself this distance is reflected in the type of popular cinema that is produced featuring handicapped people a particularly safe brand of generic art

1892215 obviously i didnt follow in his footsteps but did learn a bit about music appreciation
1892216 i started singing and writing songs about about age 10 i didnt really play guitar till much later in my teens i would audition at coffee houses like the second of autumn and the edge
1892217 i never got a job but learned about acoustic music by hanging out at these places listening to eric andersen chris smither jimmy webb and other great song writers and poet guitar players
1892218 one night we were playing a little joint called j c dobbs on south street kurt loder was in town to review the opening of a world tour by another band called the rolling stones who were playing at jfk stadium that same night after the stones concert kurt stopped into dobbs for a beer i stayed up talking with him till 5 oclock in the morning the next month there was a two page spread in rolling stone magazine pictures and all raving about the band soon after that we were signed to rca records
1892219 the stripped down acoustic concerts i did with my buddy michael pilla i thought these were the most rewarding and the most appreciated by my audience
1892220 die ergebnisse der studie der organisation federation of american scientist fas sind alarmierend es ist ein skandal wenn die lagerung von us atomwaffen in europa nicht einmal minimalsten us amerikanischen standards entspricht
1892221 in the months now leading up to the olympic games we actually see things getting worse
1892222 there are more raids foreign christians are not having their visas renewed and are being forced to leave the country there are numerous circumstances where the churches are under attack by the government
1892223 christians who refuse to come under the communist control are subject to arrest imprisonment harassment by the police at any time
1892224 there are places where christians are facing very serious persecution
1892225 he possibly could be executed for what the government says is subversion of the national government what hes facing a penalty for in reality is hes a christian
1892226 i think there is an element of sort of keeping things under the rug until the olympics are over making sure theres no disturbances or embarrassment during the games
1892227 their job is to monitor information and keep in the information they want to keep in and keep out the information they want to keep out i think they do have a little bit of a na ve sense they can control the message and information
1892228 i think it has a large part to do that they could lose face on such a world stage
1892229 i think the manner of going about it is counterintuitive but they are trying to save face by imprisoning more and more
1892230 weve seen a huge increase in the numbers of house churches that are being raided especially the leaders of the house churches are being taken into custody
1892231 in early march there were 70 leaders taken at one time
1892232 from all measures we can find in terms of religious freedom freedom of the press freedom of assembly it all shows its becoming much worse
1892233 in the past two years we found more than 3 000 underground pastors were arrested detained some sentenced
1892234 we should call upon the democratic country leaders including president bush to withdraw from the opening ceremonies
1892235 were not calling for a boycott of the athletic events but for these political leaders to go there and be part of the chinese governments propaganda machine its simply wrong
1892236 alimujiang is neither a separatist nor a terrorist local sources say he has told officials many times during interrogation that as a christian he loves and supports the chinese government something many young uyghurs struggle with as han chinese culture becomes increasingly dominant in xinjiang as a loyal chinese citizen and business entrepreneur alimujiang has held to high standards paying his taxes faithfully and avoiding a common local custom of paying bribes for business favors he has also done his best to assimilate into chinese culture making the unusual decision to send his children to a chinese language school in a predominantly uyghur area
1892237 friends say alimujiang simply wants the freedom to quietly express his faith a right guaranteed to him in the chinese constitution currently however it is illegal for alimujiang to own a uyghur bible
1892238 chinese christians wary of state controlled religious organs have increasingly turned to the model of house churches which have helped spark a once unthinkable revival across the middle kingdom as estimates now number chinese believers at more than 100 million
1892239 their fingers bleed but they press on for if they dont make the days quota 5 000 bulbs they are beaten the christmas lights that decorate the trees of christian believers around the world are often made by inmates like these their crime preaching the gospel of jesus christ house church pastors are sent to work camps after their arrest and in some respects these are the lucky ones for they survived the standard interrogations that greet most christian leaders after they are detained several are killed or disappear never to be seen or heard from again
1892240 since we presume the president is as devoted to human rights as any world leader why has he failed to join the president of france the chancellor of germany and now the prime minister of canada in their announced refusal to appear at chinas olympic games

1892250 ok so what are you girls doing tonight after this party
1892251 im dubious of these hypotheses because they always smell of an agenda
1892252 youre not some club kid in new york in the nineties this shit is so hipster
1892253 if you dont give a damn we dont give a fuck
1892254 if only we carried rocks instead of cameras wed look like revolutionaries

1892256 we are excited and were actually rooting for the new kids because what they represent is what we represent which is good pop music that needs to come back and stick around
1892257 so were rooting for them and we want them to succeed
1892258 the hardest part was becoming acclimated to the fact that kevin was gone and becoming used to it
1892259 once we kind of got around that we realized that it was just as strong we could still hold the harmonies live we still have the drive and competitive spirit to continue on and we can still put on an amazing show
1892260 yeah theres more dancing and there actually could be more dancing there could be more choreography
1892261 but thats something we wanted to show people that were not frigging old if new kids on the block can do it we can definitely be doing it
1892262 weve always felt like as long as we put out good music and as long as we stay true to who we are people will check it out and always be there
1892263 i think we just cater to our fans and we cater to people who want to listen to our music
1892264 unbreakable is kind of a beginning marker of a new era for the group and a sign of what is to come we havent reached our second peak yet so its a good stepping stone
1892265 going to be a shocker and its going to be hot
1892266 im utilizing the backstreet boys discovery process musically to help myself as well because i feel that the two have to tie in together in order to make it something that our fans will enjoy and be able to relate to
1892267 not yet we walked around the city a little bit and its so cool
1892268 we changed it around a little bit we cut out some of the dragging parts and made it more of a fluent show
1892269 its just non stop in your face energy and fun
1892270 the energy and power and harmonies and singing are just as strong
1892271 people want to hear our hits and weve got to do that
1892272 people dont want to go see a bad movie so i think those are all the things we have to do
1892273 it can become difficult but being in this for so many years i think we can put together a good mixture of the new material and old material
1892274 i think whenever you have a group like this theres always going to be skepticism
1892275 youre always going to be stereotyped and youre always going to have to work even nowadays its hard for us to get respect but it is what it is

1892316 they will have a clear choice based on quality and trust australian extra virgin olive oil which is backed by the australian industry code of practice or imported olive oil of questionable origin and quality

1892319 in addition the australian olive industry has a good reputation for high quality extra virgin olive oil and we wanted to capture and enhance that reputation by adopting a code that underpinned quality production
1892320 the code of practice is received very positively by the industry as well as by food retailers

1892447 saya heran bahwa kita bisa menerima semak belukar terbakar yakni mengacu pada percakapan allah dengan nabi musa as yang menyatakan aku adalah allah serta meyakini bahwa kata kata itu adalah kata kata allah tapi kita tidak bisa menerima ucapan al hallaj akulah kebenaran padahal itu kata kata allah sendiri
1892448 kata kata akulah kebenaran adalah pancaran cahaya di bibir manshur sementara akulah tuhan yang berasal dari firaun adalah kezaliman
1892449 wahai kaum muslimin bantulah aku selamatkan aku dari allah wahai manusia allah telah menghalalkanmu untuk menumpahkan darahku bunuhlah aku kalian semua bakal memperoleh pahala dan aku akan datang dengan suka rela aku ingin si terkutuk ini menunjuk pada dirinya sendiri dibunuh

1892457 engkau bilang aku dan aku juga bilang aku mengapa gerangan engkau menerima rahmat abadi dari allah dan aku kutukan abadi
1892458 engkau bilang aku dan melihat dirimu sendiri sementara aku menjauhkan diri dari keakuan ku aku beroleh rahmat dan engkau kutukan memikirkan diri sendiri tidaklah benar dan memisahkan diri dari kedirian adalah amalan paling baik
1892459 engkau tidak merasa kesakitan dilempari batu tapi lembaran sekuntum bunga justru membuatmu kesakitan mengapa
1892460 orang orang yang jahil dan bodoh bisa dimaafkan sulit rasanya melihat syibli melempar lantaran ia tahu bahwa seharusnya ia tidak melakukannya
1892461 memang mudah memotong tangan seorang yang terbelenggu akan tetapi diperlukan seorang pahlawan untuk memotong tangan segenap sifat yang memisahkan seseorang dari allah

1892737 if iran wants to turn to the production of nuclear weapons it must leave the npt expel the iaea inspectors and then it would need at least considering the number of centrifuges and the quantity of uranium iran has
1892738 it would need at least six months to one year therefore iran will not be able to reach the point where we would wake up one morning to an iran with a nuclear weapon
1892739 excuse me i would like to clarify this for our viewers
1892740 it would need this period to produce a weapon and to obtain highly enriched uranium in sufficient quantities for a single nuclear weapon

1892818 that album title symbolizes nine lives another life after death ive had a lot of deaths in the music industry and theres still life after all that the religion the reason i subtitled it that is because i want this album to be something thats being studied or praised its like calling it a doctrine
1892819 it reminded me of an old tech n9ne like mitch bade
1892820 its like a 2006 mitch bade so i had to talk about the same thing jealous people stupid people kansas city is a place where hatred is at an all time high i thought it would capture that persona of the ghetto
1892821 after all these years of people telling me that my music was for white people that i needed to come with gangster stuff
1892822 music is supposed to inspire and evolve andre 3000 isnt still doing players ball he evolved that was always on my mind that people were always telling me to come gangster when it comes to it my one gangster song can demolish their whole cd i was inspired to write about the type of people that were telling me to come gangster
1892823 any man with a kid thats on the road a lot can relate to that whether youre a musician a doctor a director

1892826 i wrote that song in my bitter stage when i was saying whatever i wanted to say my wife dont like me my bitch gets hyphy my girl might knife me twice just to spite me thats how i had the balls to write it i didnt care anymore i just wanted to release it
1892827 at the time we were going through a lot of things
1892828 i wasnt able to go to hawaii because the promoters said my music incites riots at the same time this girl was trying to sue me for 100 000 for cracking her own skull at my show and i wasnt even in the building yet
1892829 a lot of people when they come up to me they say the reason why i like you tech is that you say what you feel and youre not afraid to say anything

1892835 i owe her a big thank you and i hope that i get to do that in person soon
1892836 i knew that naomi had been successfully treated and through a mutual friend naomi got me the referral to the saint louis university liver center if naomi had not been very public with her recovery from hepatitis c i would never have known where to look for help and i probably would not be cured
1892837 my hepatitis c diagnosis was a personal ground zero a life altering experience
1892838 from that moment on my life did a one eighty but i was also deeply committed to getting well as they say instead of cursing the darkness light a candle not only am i now free of this hideous virus that could have taken my life but i can also be a beacon of hope for others
1892839 dr bruce and his team at saint louis are compassionate healers on the cutting edge of medicine
1892840 to have a resource like them to tell people to go consult is a gift
1892841 i dont think people appreciate that this virus is projected to kill four times as many americans as aids
1892842 if you have any of the risk factors then get tested if you have been infected then get to a specialist who is knowledgeable about evaluation and treatment of patients with hepatitis c there is a lot of misinformation out there about hepatitis c and you have to get past it
1892843 there is a less than 3 chance that the virus can be transmitted through sexual intercourse
1892844 cdc doesnt make any recommendations to couples in a stable relationship to do anything differently than they did before meaning condom use
1892845 i worked as an icu nurse and i received a needle stick
1892846 that is how i was infected i think 80 000 healthcare workers are exposed to contamination on the job thats why i did a public service announcement to promote retractable needles so this transmission avenue can be eliminated or at least reduced
1892847 i was 18 years old and moved to san francisco in the late 60s and my ex husband was 10 years my senior and convinced me and my very dear friend that we should try intravenous drugs with him for her 19 th birthday
1892848 im not proud of it but thats how i got it turns out i had had hepatitis c for 34 years and did not know it
1892849 i had malaise and lethargy which means i was sick as a dog and tired
1892850 when naomi was treated seven or eight years ago we only had about a 15 chance of cure
1892851 fortunately naomi had a genotype or strain of the virus that was more successfully treated julia had a tougher one to treat but we have better medicine now for her
1892852 after six weeks the viral load was greatly reduced and by three months it was gone
1892853 but we continued the treatment for the full course i just had my blood work done and i am virus free
1892854 it was a neat way to show appreciation for their service to our country
1892855 it is difficult to say that there is a typical veteran they come from every walk of life and aspect of american culture
1892856 our competitors are not targeting vets as aggressively as we are
1892857 we get approached occasionally by the tobacco industry and beer bottlers but were downplaying those products because they do not provide the image we want to convey

1892859 we do not tell organizations how to spend the money

1892883 there was no light in her eye no response or recognition we saw a little girl who didnt even respond to hugs or affection even a child with the most severe autism responds to those
1892884 in the first five years of life 85 percent of the brain is developed
1892885 those early relationships more than anything else help wire the brain and provide children with the experience to trust to develop language to communicate they need that system to relate to the world
1892886 its mind boggling that in the 21st century we can still have a child whos just left in a room like a gerbil
1892887 no food no one talking to her or reading her a story she cant even use her hands how could this child be so invisible
1892888 my hope was that she would be able to sleep through the night to be out of diapers and to feed herself
1892889 we were so distraught over her condition we agonized over what to do
1892890 her behavior was different than any child id ever seen
1892891 if you put food anywhere near her shed grab it
1892892 she had a lot of episodes of great agitation yelling flailing her arms rolling into a fetal position shed curl up in a closet just to be away from everyone she didnt know how to climb a slide or swing on a swing she didnt want to be touched
1892893 in my entire career with the child welfare system i dont ever remember a child like danielle
1892894 it makes you think about what does quality of life mean whats the best we can hope for her after all shes been through is it just being safe
1892895 that one is dangerous she cant be with other children
1892896 i guess she wanted to make sure the food was still there
1892897 okay lets put your shoes on do you need to go potty again
1892898 i know my son will never stand on his own will never be able to climb onto a horse you have no idea what your daughter might be able to do
1892899 id like her to at least be able to master a sound board so she can communicate her choices even if she never finds her voice
1892900 i think she understands most of what we say its just that she doesnt always know how to or want to react
1892901 i drive her around in my jeep and she honks the horn
1892902 you got your wormie you ready to go to sleep
1892903 thats okay too for me its all about getting the kisses and the hugs
1892904 left unattended for days with a retarded older brother never seen wearing anything but a diaper
1892905 the home is filthy there are clothes everywhere there are feces on the childs seat and the counter is covered with trash
1892906 is still wearing a diaper and drinking from a baby bottle on going situation worse since last august mom leaves grant and danielle at home for several days in a row while she goes to work and spends the night with a new paramour danielle is never seen outside the home
1892907 its not automatic that because the home is dirty wed remove the child
1892908 and what they found in 2002 was not like the scene they walked into in 2005
1892909 im concerned though that no effort was made to interview the child
1892910 if you have a 4 year old who is unable to speak that would raise a red flag to me
1892911 im not going to tell you this was okay i dont know how it could have happened
1892912 i tried to potty train her she wouldnt train i tried to get her into schools no one would take her
1892913 was that she didnt speak much she talked in a soft tone shed say lets go eat but no one could hear her except me
1892914 miss polly had a dolly she was sick sick sick
1892915 id been sick and it got away from me but i never knew a dirty house was against the law
1892916 he said she was starving i told him me and my sisters were all skinny till we were 13
1892917 she tended to blame her difficulties on circumstances while rationalizing her own actions
1892918 she is more concerned with herself than most other adults and this could lead her to neglect paying adequate attention to people around her
1892919 they say i made her autistic but how do you make a kid autistic they say i didnt put clothes on her but she just tore them off
1892920 so do all the other splendid buildings in washington d c for you are a citizen of the united states

1892935 insurgency in iraq supplied arms to the taliban and hosted al qaeda terrorists
1892936 relentlessly pursu es nuclear weapons and thus is a particularly implacable and lethal regime
1892937 only a sustained unified international effort to isolate and sanction iran is likely to convince it to give up these dangerous activities
1892938 speaking from the heart as a true friend of israel when i visit with aipac i am among friends good friends who share my strong commitment that the bond between the united states and israel is unbreakable today tomorrow and forever
1892939 by israel in the face of all threats speak s up when israels security is at risk and voices concern that americas recent foreign policy hasnt made israel more secure hamas now controls gaza hizbollah has tightened its grip on southern lebanon and is flexing its muscles in beirut because of the war in iraq iran which always posed a greater threat to israel than iraq is emboldened and poses the greatest strategic challenge to the us and israel in the middle east in a generation we must isolate hamas syria continues its support for terror and meddling in lebanon and pursu es weapons of mass destruction there is no greater threat to israel or to the peace and stability of the region than iran it supports violent extremists pursues a nuclear capability and threatens to wipe israel off the map my goal will be to eliminate this threat
1892940 foremost in his mind is the threat posed by the regime in tehran the iranian president calls israel a stinking corpse it uses violence to undermine israel in the middle east peace process it supports extremists in iraq killing american soldiers remains the worlds chief sponsor of terrorism and its pursuit of nuclear weapons poses an unacceptable risk a danger we cannot allow
1892941 the most dangerous regime in the middle east characterized by its cruel despotism and fanatic militancy if this regime acquires nuclear weapons this would presage catastrophic consequences not only for my country not only for the middle east but for all of mankind the fact that iran is building nuclear weapons is beyond question and they may be the worlds first un deterable nuclear power so the danger is clear and the question is what do we do about it my message to you is divest iran
1892942 iran has not complied with the international communitys demand to stop enriching uranium so the security council has no choice but to increase the sanctions

1892947 when the president flatly asserts iran is seeking nuclear weapons hes overstating the facts we have very scant supportive evidence and after the iraq calamity he should be very careful about the veracity of his public assertions

1892951 not obey illegal and immoral orders to use weapons of mass destruction they cannot commit crimes against humanity
1892952 if sanctions and incentives cannot be made to work the voices for military action will only get louder no matter what aides may be telling mr bush and mr olmert or what they may be telling each other an attack on iran would be a disaster
1892953 israel will almost surely attack irans nuclear sites in the next four to seven months conventionally
1892954 assault fail to significantly harm or stall the iranian program a nuclear attack will most likely follow
1892955 only one option if it wishes to halt irans march toward nuclear weaponry the military
1892956 which leaves only israel the country threatened almost daily with destruction by irans leaders irans leaders would do well to rethink their gamble and suspend their nuclear program

1893011 we did well in the first half and held on in the forwards where they had a big advantage i am satisfied because the score does not reflect the real situation on the pitch there was a time we had two players out but those who remained covered well it is always hard to win away matches and we wish uganda well in the next round
1893012 it was tough and exposed us in the first half where they dominated our defence is still leaking and our kicks for touch fell short
1893013 i was surprised they were able to hold us in the forwards

1893017 in fact anthropologists often suggest that any development programs should be anchored on what the local people know what they consider important and what they consider as their needs and priorities
1893018 one danger with integrated development planning is raising high expectations among the peoples organizations given the extraordinary goals that can be achieved in integrated development and the resources that can be mobilized communities might be dazzled by the prospect of receiving huge amounts of external assistance so that local resources lose strategic significance it is always wise to level off expectations with the peoples organizations at a very early stage and involve their key members in the preparatory activities so they can assess for themselves what are the realistic stakes

1893055 change is never easy you fight to hold on you fight to let go
1893056 things never turn out exactly the way you planned i know they didnt with me still like my father used to say traffics traffic you go where life takes you and growing up happens in a heartbeat one day youre in diapers the next youre gone but the memories of childhood stay with you for the long haul i remember a time a place a particular fourth of july the things that happened in that decade of war and change i remember a house like a lot of houses a yard like a lot of yards on a street like a lot of other streets i remember how hard it was growing up among people and places i loved most of all i remember how hard it was to leave and the thing is after all these years i still look back in wonder
1893057 all of our young lives we search for someone to love someone that makes us complete we choose partners and change partners we dance to a song of heartbreak and hope all the while wondering if somewhere somehow theres someone perfect who might be searching for us

1893060 the tracks at watkins glen and sonoma are comparable in the same way as pocono and indy comparable the tracks are different but the same for people like me who dont have road course experience i think there are similarities because the driving style is very similar in some ways technically there is not a lot of information we use from one race to the other but from a driving standpoint its the same
1893061 watkins glen is one of the places we go to where its easy to get in to an incident last year harvick and montoya got together and we ended up being collected in it i think the situation brings out tempers it is a lot like short track racing because its hard to pass some people try to make things happen entering the turns because someone is trying to out brake the other and typically thats where incidents happen you cant lose sleep over those kinds of things theres nothing you can do about it at the same time this is the point in the season where everybody starts looking at the points and pressure starts to build when things dont go well the switch gets flipped easier this time of the year the reality of where you are in the points is right in front of you the track lends itself to emotion but the situation in the year is really the biggest factor
1893062 no i dont think one belongs in the chase i think the chase should have a fair representation of the race tracks we run the majority of the time im a proponent of the fact that we have 36 races a year and two of them are road courses which is a small percentage so the chase shouldnt have a road course in it because it would be unfairly represented in what we currently know the cup series to be

1893095 must consist of the male as well as the female
1893096 in order that there may be fatherhood there must be marriage
1893097 i think hed be better off by truly identifying who best protects children and their interests their fathers you damned fool and work from there
1893098 i got depressed today because i got the overwhelming feeling that girls will always be more important and mens feelings will never matter
1893099 rise to the level of concern about her ability as a parent
1893100 if i were you i would not worry about it children always come back to their father just be patient

1893109 i think its an honor to go to indy every year the history is unbelievable there is no where we go where you get the sense of people like you do at indy with the grandstands on both sides of the front straightaway when you walk out on sunday afternoon to start that race its like nothing else the drivers introductions there are pretty cool its amazing to see that many people and the excitement at indy is cool its an open wheel sacred ground race track and the fact that we can go there and race is truly an honor
1893110 im a fan of not testing at indy indy is indy there is no other place like it i think we should test at race tracks that provide us information for more than one track and indy is the smoothest and flattest track we go to i wasnt disappointed that we werent going to test there because it puts everybody in the same boat we dont get to test at a majority places that we run on indy is no different in my opinion because we didnt test there
1893111 i think the cot performs well on smooth race tracks and will run well at indy its a great place for the cot to shine our impala ss ran extremely well at pocono and loudon so our flat track program gives us a lot of optimism going into this weekend its the first week back after a weekend off and a lot of teams put a lot of effort into indy we try not to put any more effort into indy than we do any other race some teams try harder for indy but we overall try as hard as anybody and i think thats the right approach indy is one of those places where i feel we can be successful
1893112 momentum is everything at indy its all about carrying speed through the middle of the corner so that you can be fast off the corner indys corners are different from any other track we race on theyre shorter and theres less corner the track is perfectly smooth and you have to have really good grip to take advantage of that smoothness if you are a little bit slow in the middle of the corner it just carries that speed onto the exit of the corner so its very important to handle in all parts of the corners at indy you cant just handle well getting in or getting off it has to be good in all parts of the corners
1893113 dont ever try to convince yourself otherwise this event is absolutely completely your fault you created it you could have prevented it you encouraged it you found our pain funny if i have the opportunity to haunt you i will i pray you will see our faces in your minds eye and wonder what ryan could have been and what we could have had if you had only chosen love

1893131 this camp is definitely like 2005 or you could go all the way back to 2004 going into 2005
1893132 i just knew how good we were back then that was before the injuries it was a different mind frame
1893133 back then we were wondering and saying that we think we could do it even though we hadnt done it at the time
1893134 now this group has done it gone to the super bowl they got almost to that goal we know we can do it we know we can do it with the philosophy of how we do things the only difference now is the players know they can do it
1893135 we talked about the way we won football games and we won games with one of these two quarterbacks

1893141 we are now working nights and weekends to keep up with demand
1893142 over the last couple of years weve had more players calling us wanting to come here than ever before
1893143 thats kind of nice we wanted to rebuild this franchise and make it inviting for others to come and we are starting to get there but we arent where we want to be yet
1893144 we now have campbell and duncan keith on our defense and one of those guys is going to be on the ice a vast majority of the time
1893145 they can both log a lot of minutes that will help us in tight games
1893146 if they co exist and they can both be happy with the amount of minutes that they will both get we will stick with that
1893147 but if it becomes a disruption then we will have to think about making a move
1893148 with owner rocky wirtz announcing we were going to televise home games and kane and toews were a reality and fans really embraced the style we played

1893333 before i move onto something else id like to summarize
1893334 they are also the africa champions in the second tier
1893335 we have to get used to pressure and we will work hard towards achieving that
1893336 we have to sit and plan for this game it will be tough but we will not be traveling to nairobi to just play but convincingly win
1893337 that is a big game and we intend to stay focused
1893338 we have to start preparations for 2015 rwc now by investing in the players structure and conditioning these are some of the things which came to the fore in tunisia to have an edge kenya has to improve technically too
1893339 it was evident that some of our players were not spending enough time in the gymnasium
1893340 they had all their france based professionals which made a big difference we made a mistake by planning to play against a very heavy but immobile pack but were surprised that they were mobile solid and could pass the ball at pace tunisia s technical bench had done their homework well and defended well we were better in set pieces but need more power speed and skill they knew we would spread the ball wide and reacted quickly whenever they lost possession it was not easy playing catch up rugby after going down by two tries in the opening 10 minutes
1893341 it is a wake up call and a lot has to be changed for kenya to be competitive
1893342 we have been working on a system with the players who did not travel and that showed in tunisia the positive is that some of the players were exposed and we have widened the base
1893343 it was like going with a pen knife to a gun fight they were better conditioned and looked fitter and lacked nothing in all departments
1893344 its my favourite video weve ever done its a split screen video all about what happens at the beginning of a relationship and what happens at the end of a relationship and the cycles people go through when you see them happening side by side its very interesting the director marc webb did the video for harder to breathe the first video we ever did it was nice to return back to him he did a great job

1893347 concerts are so damned expensive its a chance to come together and see us for the same price
1893348 because weve always liked their music and theyve always been incredibly supportive of us
1893349 this is a really good pairing sometimes well open other times theyll open its no big deal its the music thats important
1893350 its not like we planned to have such a long stretch between cds it just happened that way
1893351 we didnt know what to expect from the first album then when it hit we toured for like three years straight we were overwhelmed and really fried it took a while for things to settle down when we got back in the studio we made a decision that we were going to take our time
1893352 we wanted something that would jump off the tape i think we succeeded
1893353 thats amazing youre the first person thats caught up with that

1893721 we requested five more ambulances three additional fire trucks from huntsville fire amp rescue and two from madison fire amp rescue as well as the volunteer huntsville madison county rescue squad
1893722 we spent so much time planning in the event of a plane crash but it worked for the situation we had
1893723 i cant think of a better reason to be back its fantastic
1893724 on every day at every event and at every turn the entire australian nation is behind you every man woman and child
1893725 you will breed fire and fear into the hearts of those we are up against go get em australia
1893726 i am obviously cheering for my country but also taking a keen interest in the australian team
1893727 to say i am delighted to receive this honour is a massive understatement
1893728 i have an incredible pride to carry the australian flag on behalf of the team and on behalf of all australia
1893729 you will experience a green olympics a high tech olympics and a peoples olympics
1893730 our promise was that journalists would be able to use the internet for their work during the olympic games so we have given them sufficient access to do that
1893731 it is perhaps self evident to say that where an mis is in financial difficulties we will want to focus management on liquidity and redemption practices
1893732 there have been questions raised as to the quality of the ratings process particularly where ratings agencies have a conflict of interest in terms of the connection of fees to ratings outcome or product issue success
1893733 there is a wider market issue about the extent to which investors rely on the ratings agencies for their investment decisions and whether the level of diligence and discussion undertaken by the agencies warrants this reliance
1893734 directors and responsible entities have a duty to act in the interests of all security holders
1893735 we will look closely to see how conflicts of interest are handled
1893736 the productivity commissioner appears not to understand that these reviews are not reviews of tariffs but are in fact much broader than that
1893737 as illustrated by the latest reviews of auto and tcf textile clothing and footwear ongoing pressures from globalisation and emerging exporters exacerbated by exchange rate appreciation caused by the mining boom have been prompting calls for new measures to provide relief against imports or other assistance
1893738 effectively set the course for industry policy and its contribution to australias economic future
1893739 listens closely to the productivity commissions views but at the end of the day we will take our decisions in the national interest
1893740 want to be the prime minister of a country that doesnt make things any more
1893741 manufacturing should not be seen as having any special place maintaining any particular industry should never be an end in itself
1893742 thomas kossmann was accorded every opportunity to respond to the findings and he chose to resign
1893743 it would be preferable if you did not mention that i have invited you to comment and that it appears that your desire to make comment is spontaneous
1893744 the soldiers guard over us we have to support them they correct things every time when we have problems
1893745 supervise the holding of presidential elections enabling the relaunch of the democratic process in the country and to reshape it on a perennial basis
1893746 these elections which will be held in the shortest possible period will be free and transparent and will bring for the future a continued and harmonious functioning of all the constitutional powers
1893747 assess the situation on the ground and assist in promoting a peaceful solution to the crisis
1893748 if there is anything in the allegation that such bodies are using the cloak of christianity to make profits without paying taxation it is about time that legislation was framed to check them
1893749 to separate for tax concession purposes the charitable activities of a religious body from its other activities
1893750 i believe there would be considerable practical difficulty in separating the charitable activities of a religious body from other activities legally the advancement of religion is a charitable activity
1893751 but the attempt to disentangle that would be too difficult
1893752 jesus came into the city on a simple donkey what are disciples of his doing flying in private jets
1893753 directors and responsible entities have a duty to act in the interests of all security holders
1893754 over the coming months well be working with retailers and consumer organisations to further enhance the website with additional information and applications to help consumers make more informed purchasing decisions
1893755 the website will provide a guide to consumers as to the cheaper supermarkets in their region consumers will then be able to make their choices based on customer service convenience and other factors
1893756 finally the government is also fulfilling its election commitment made by the then leader of the opposition on july 11 2007 to set up a dedicated website that gives consumers a snapshot of local grocery prices
1893757 deborah i have been doing mine i would say for the last 10 15 years when i go shopping if theres something in a 250g package or tin as opposed to 500g i would mentally quickly work out whether it was worth buying the two 250s or the one 500
1893758 youve got a very elastic brain more so than me
1893759 oh da sind ja die blinden die hatte ich fast vergessen

1893772 ok youve gotten past the worse part youre still a good mom and a caring person so now its time for you
1893773 perhaps sit down together and say look these guys have created this fantastic piece of software that lots of people use why not employ them or have a similar product on there that is licensed but use that to advertise your other products
1893774 the main feature with scrabulous for me is that i can play it in facebook i dont have to go to an external site and then search for all my friends all over again because i dont think that would work and i dont think many people would sign up for it
1893775 i turned around and my heart nearly stopped standing almost arms length in front of me were the early inhabitants of this town well to be more specific what was left of the inhabitants of the town
1893776 interesting how fans online have provided far more thoughtful analysis to transformers than the movies actual producers
1893777 ive had it i cant do this i dont care what it costs but you have to get a cab and come get me right now
1893778 if everyone sat around waiting for something to happen then nothing would ever happen
1893779 what is it that i want that im not getting
1893780 in the name of the gospel or of the will of god the forced separation of people on the grounds of race or color
1893781 also the defense needed to be rebuilt and we think were on the way to getting that done
1893782 but we think hes going to be good hell need a little more time his shot and his speed are two of his biggest strengths we like the package hes a pretty well rounded package at both ends of the ice
1893783 he was very impressive when he was in los angeles and had a good first pro season hell have a chance to make the roster this season
1893784 he had a tremendous first season coming out of college
1893785 hes got good size and good hands he has to get a little stronger but he should contend for a roster spot this year
1893786 he probably needs another year in juniors but he has the skill to compensate for his lack of size
1893787 he goes to the net and does the dirty work hes made himself into a prospect coming out of cornell he was impressive in his time with us last season and hell have a shot at a job in the fall
1893788 hes got to learn how to be a pro but it looks like he has the chance to be a really elite player we have spots available so we will see where hes at were not going to promise anything either way but hell have a chance to come in and earn a job
1893789 he moves the puck well theres no guarantee hell make the team but he has a chance we have some holes back there with thomas its just a matter of adding maturity to his game like most young guys he needs to get bigger and stronger but overall we really like the package he brings
1893790 he has to fill out a little bit but hell provide some toughness which is something we havent always had
1893791 hes not the biggest guy but he plays with a lot of heart
1893792 he can move the puck and generate offense he did ok when he was here and hes been really solid at manchester we want to see more of him
1893793 we dont want to rush him but we have high expectations for jonathan
1893794 hes got the skills to be an elite goaltender hes a very athletic goaltender with good quickness and hes very willing to learn
1893795 he was actually better in los angeles than he was in the minors
1893796 he came up at the end of the season when we werent really playing for anything and played well
1893797 we still think of him as a prospect though hes probably not ready yet
1893798 meglio na cazzo de fame ke na fame de cazzo
1893799 i learned a lot about racists when the lilly white kids at north scott spray painted die nigger on the high school and there was not a single black kid enrolled in the school
1893800 i tell the dumb fucking hill billies they only hate me half as much as they think they do even when theyre beatin me down cause i am half white but they dont get it
1893801 i hate the kinky haired stinking fuckers and ill tell them all that but i had a cell mate for a while a black guy good motherfucker of course he was a low life drug dealer but he was a really good guy
1893802 so i am a fucking flip flopper too since i used to be an unapologetic racist dumber than fuck
1893803 jimmy the only niggers i dont hate seem to be the ones i meet
1893804 it is strange thinking about it but brian poo and i came back to long grove in 72 and our friends wanted to know what black people were like and of course everyone wanted to hear about the tanks rolling through town on maneuvers which is really fucking cool when you are a seven year old boy but now i know why all those tanks were steered by white guys because the black soldiers were all in the jungle in vietnam
1893805 i got more respect for a shine i aint met then i do for most of you dumbfucks wed go to a white guys house sometimes its a mansion and its way past time for him to beg and hed be
1893806 god really does like putting things before a person that mimicks almost to a t
1893807 to motivate young people is what id really like to do
1893808 i think young people always need good role models in their life itd be awesome to help younger people and tell them where i came from i didnt really come from a lot just because you dont have a lot of things going for you doesnt mean you cant be successful you have to go out there work hard and make it happen for yourself
1893809 she does things at her height that you dont see many people do the ability to shoot outside go inside she can dribble rebound go coast to coast
1893810 even though she is probably going to be one of the youngest if not the youngest on the team shes still going to be one of the main contributors shes just that good that talented
1893811 and the thing that really sets her apart when youre young a lot of people dont want to listen but she listens and actually puts it to work when she gets advice
1893812 the first day you were before me i thought i made it clear to you that this court comes first in everything
1893813 i do understand that youre under pressure but i have to look at how the system should be run and perceived by the public
1893814 at the beginning of this case you were given every privilege that could be given to you with regard to travel
1893815 i dont believe that there is a person thats ever been through this process that respects it more than i do
1893816 last week was a tremendous wake up call to me
1893817 my life has been revolutionarily transformed and its transforming in front of the eye of these media people who dont know me at all
1893818 your honor i ask for your forgiveness it will never happen again
1893819 i apologize to the citizens as well but mostly to you it was never an affront to you
1893820 now that hes caught hes taking responsibility he thought he got away with it
1893821 the defendant left the state of michigan left the country without prior notice to the court
1893822 all you have to have him do is call me he has my cellphone he can call me anytime we would never say the mayor of detroit cannot travel for an emergency matter
1893823 at the very least we are going to ask the court to cut off all travel to the defendant for business or personal because he violated the very generous terms that this court has set up
1893824 its not serious to him that hes a criminal defendant
1893825 angelinos of ebony hue glimpses of african american participation in the founding and development of los angeles and beyond
1893826 before i formed you in the womb i knew and approved of you
1893827 ive made so many mistakes how can god approve of me
1893828 we have been assuming that the ways in which emotions are organized in the brain are essentially similar in men and women
1893829 im kind of hurt that you forgot i hate sushi
1893830 excel in being able to come up with appropriate words given cues
1893831 oh i havent done a frugal friday post yet oh well ill do it later since its only thursday
1893832 mo big brother said if you didnt wear your sandals there would be big trouble and you havent been wearing them its probably best if you put them on quick
1893833 i dont get how thats breaking the rules anyway saying me dale you and sara are targets
1893834 thats probably because the other groups more cliquey isnt it
1893835 im sorry about not showing up to the photo shoot i have no gas in my car or money or a job i hope you understand my phone been acting kind of funny thats why i couldnt answer if you know any jobs that are open i can do any kind of job
1893836 may you enter into the heart of jesus through the virgin mary
1893837 i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
1893838 the most beloved religious leader of our age has passed from this world to his much deserved eternal reward
1893839 neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved
1893840 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose
1893841 rejoice in the lord always again i will say rejoice
1893842 ive been living in an incredible state of pressure and scrutiny
1893843 what matters to me though is how the court overall is perceived and how if it was not kwame kilpatrick sitting in that seat if it was john six pack sitting in that seat what would i do and that answer is simple
1893844 the judge did what he thought was right we dont agree
1893845 its just doing the things were supposed to do when were supposed to be doing them
1893846 its not just beating ourselves theyre a great team and they did a nice job but we had penalties that hurt us bad in that game we turned the ball over a couple times you just cant do that against a team like that
1893847 theyre going to kick field goals and make their points and play tough defense and they run the ball well
1893848 i think he probably saw the super bowl and saw the giants defensive line win it for them it didnt matter what kind of offensive power new england was he just saw their defense win it
1893849 their punter just so happened to put a couple balls out of bounds inside the 10 yard line in that game and backed them up put them in the hole i dont know if that played into it but i mean he loves backing guys up getting safeties
1893850 i think every rookie made their squad and contributed in some form offense defense or special teams
1893851 its a great model for this league i dont know if they had all the talent of anybody in the league but they play good team football they play good defense they got up the field they ran the ball the quarterback when it counted the last seven or eight games didnt turn it over they had few penalties and they won and theyre very physical an extremely physical football team i thought that was just an awesome job of coaching football
1893852 would you take a look at psalm 90 and give me your assessment there must be something prophetic there but i cant seem to put my finger on it
1893853 for lo the kings were assembled they passed by together they saw it and so they marveled they were troubled and hasted away fear took hold upon them there and pain as of a woman in travail
1893854 doesnt that sound like the united nations giving birth to the state of israel
1893855 did you notice in which psalm that prophetic reference is made
1893856 in what year did the united nations give birth to the state of israel
1893857 doesnt it seem a bit more than just coincidence that the birth of israel in 1948 should be described in psalm 48
1893858 will you read a couple of verses in psalm 17
1893859 keep me as the apple of the eye hide me under the shadow of thy wings like as a lion that is greedy of his prey
1893860 sound like a description of the british general allenby taking jerusalem in 1917
1893861 am i trying to read into these verses something which is not there am i twisting scripture in order to make it fit into a mold of my own making
1893862 if i proceed past the psalm numbered according to the current year 1983 will i not be accused of setting dates
1893863 moreover david and the captains of the host separated to the service of the sons of asaph and of heman and of jeduthun ethan who should prophesy with harps with psalteries and with cymbals
1893864 all these were the sons of heman the kings seer in the words of god to lift up the horn
1893865 all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of moses and in the prophets and in the psalms concerning me
1893866 designates both the science and art of interpretation the greek verb hermeneuo means to interpret or explain the greek noun hermeneia means interpretation in both the greek counterpart and the contemporary technical term interpretation has to do with meaning
1893867 the early christian fathers had as their bible the old testament in greek translation this had been the bible of christ and the apostles judging from their citations of the old testament in the new one of the most basic convictions of the early church was that the old testament was a christian document
1893868 two things may be said for the allegorizing of the fathers i they were seeking to make the old testament a christian document ii they did emphasize the truths of the gospel in their fancies
1893869 for the word of god is quick alive and powerful and sharper than any twoedged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart
1893870 caught a glimpse of the ultimate triumph and redemption of his people he had the ability and genius to be stimulated and inspired so profoundly by events that he could soar above the boundaries of time and sing of past present and future in the same breath with the same words
1893871 i have often compared the view i had to what one might have of a line of coast lying in a fog points sticking out here and there sunny and attractive and you are sure there is connecting land between only you do not see it i longed for this fog to rise and took up the book to seek out more the connection of psalm with psalm and thus as i believed the place and power of each
1893872 here then is a new thought gained the structure of the psalm has impressed upon it a number in harmony with its spiritual meaning if this be a law of scripture how important to have reached this law
1893873 among the fathers writes delitzsch gregory of nyssa has attempted to show that the psalter in its five books leads upward as by five steps to moral perfection and down to the most recent times attempts have been made to trace in the five books a gradation of principal thoughts which run through the whole collection
1893874 the resemblance is fuller than delitzsch makes it but seeing so much is it not a wonder to find him stop and look no further into the matter he is on a track which would open the psalms to him from end to end what hinders him from pursuing it
1893875 i began to see that there was a methodical structure throughout and that this had to do with the meaning of what was there
1893876 therefore behold the days come saith the lord that it shall no more be said the lord liveth that brought up the children of israel out of the land of egypt
1893877 but so also in many another psalm in which not messiah but a saint of the latter days is put before us in an exactly similar manner so that the experiences feelings and exercises proper to the people of god then are found in the outpourings of the heart of an asaph a heman an ethan a son korah or even of david himself
1893878 the people so taken up is israel seen in sorrows which will come upon them in the great time of jacobs trouble out of which he will be delivered and brought into lasting blessing
1893879 the second book psalms 42 72 carries us on fully to the last days and shows us their deliverance by christ when in the sorrows of their final trial
1893880 but the second division 101 106 has a deeper secret yet to tell jehovah and this second man are one
1893881 thus the hundred and third psalm begins now its tale of grace and blessing the hundred and fourth celebrates jehovah the redeemer as the creator the hundred and fifth is his appeal to israel and the final psalm 106 their confession and repentance
1893882 and now the fifth book begins israel just ready to take possession of the land after their long dispersion
1893883 of psalm 107 at the beginning of the fifth book he delitzsch also says now just as in the book of deuteronomy israel stands on the threshold of the land of promise so at the beginning of this fifth book of the psalter we see israel restored to the soil of its fatherland
1893884 if israeli u s or european intelligence gets proof that iran has succeeded in developing nuclear weapons technology then israel will respond in a manner reflecting the existential threat posed by such a weapon
1893885 israel takes iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejads statements regarding its destruction seriously israel cannot risk another
1893886 nude men engaged in multiple instances of public sex on a municipal street while police officers on foot and bicycle congregated nearby making no attempt to enforce public indecency regulations according to a report on the latest homosexual fest in san francisco

1893901 sisters in crime goes to the movies selling your book to hollywood
1893902 i wanted to go out on messiah for a number of reasons
1893903 i have always felt that the chapel represented the heart and soul of the naval academy
1893904 and i wanted to go out on a program that involves our men
1893905 the messiah was sold out as it has been for many many years it sold out in about a week and yet we keep this concert a virtual secret
1893906 several years ago we became the recipients of a very generous grant that provides underwriting for our soloists such that we can attract the top soloists from the metropolitan opera in new york city
1893907 the social events held this december in honor of my retirement were two a small but star studded dinner hosted by the superintendent in buchanan house that included the chief of naval operations the secretary of the navy the navy inspector general the academic dean and other distinguished guests and following the sunday performance a very fancy banquet hosted by the naval academy with major league food and drink open bar always dangerous with our singers a string quartet for very civilized background music speeches by former mids the supe my old and dear friend professor david white with whom i did so many musicals monte maxwell my successor as chairman all spoke very emotionally
1893908 in spite of all the festivities for me the great moment s were as always the soaring of the spirit in the music of the messiah and this time it took on a little added passion with everyone really striving for the finest they could achieve you all know when that happens it transcends the ordinary there could be no finer more joyous or more noble way to take a last bow than with this great work sung by the great midshipmen choruses in the chapel what a way to go those who have sung it i know understand that performance can be a transforming event and none of us are quite the same after singing it together
1893909 ive been living in an incredible state of pressure and scrutiny
1893910 what matters to me though is how the court overall is perceived and how if it was not kwame kilpatrick sitting in that seat if it was john six pack sitting in that seat what would i do and that answer is simple
1893911 weve decided to go with someone else weve decided not to renew the retainer weve decided that we are too busy to work with you

1893916 with a lack of respect for the russian orthodox church and the feelings of millions of believers
1893917 once a drunk artist introduced us to bystanders as russias main radical group thats when i understood that we have to do something together
1893918 we always do things that violate rules we combine art and politics to achieve something new
1893919 in the 90s art fell under the influence of a society that was becoming more and more bourgeois artists happily turned into conformists
1893920 only in the last year a strain of protest art reappeared one that takes a critical line reflects takes a step back and sometimes cynically sometimes comically describes what is going on in our society
1893921 we invite you to celebrate with us the inauguration of the new president
1893922 we have to fix the sound you cant hear anything
1893923 if the authorities say we are building a strong state an artist should show that this is not the case if they say we are improving the lives of the people an artist should show that this is a lie
1893924 we hate cops but if we just attacked them like that they would jail us immediately so we hide our hatred behind art so they cant get us and we achieve our aim quicker
1893925 i hope that you have a great unproductive and shameful day
1893926 and just so you know this fat ass is smart successful and beautiful you should be so lucky
1893927 my answer will depend on how you behave what you provide and so on
1893928 the sooner we meet and you provide what is necessary the sooner your problems will disappear
1893929 i dont know who this mr browder is as you say why he cannot return to russia
1893930 there might have been some kind of complications there might have been some kind of conflicts conflicts with the authorities conflicts in the business world interpersonal conflicts but thats life its complicated and varied if a person thinks that his rights have been violated let him go to court we have a legal system that works thank god
1893931 if ever there was a definition of legal nihilism this is it
1893932 i was actually fighting to make russia a better place and fighting against corruption which is something that they should have given me a medal for

1894123 they tend to tell you what you want to hear
1894124 we know you are trying to protect us but the insurgents would cut off my head we are too frightened to do anything theyre everywhere theyre probably watching us right now
1894125 its tragic nobody has been able to conduct a full survey in a decade
1894126 it has always been the habituated gorillas that were most at risk of being killed

1894137 the farmers tell us sure wed rather send our kids to school but we dont have the means

1894158 there is a lack of trust confidence each side is waiting for the other to do something first

1894173 what matters to me though is how the court overall is perceived and how if it was not kwame kilpatrick sitting in that seat if it was john six pack sitting in that seat what would i do and that answer is simple
1894174 i started praying about whether or not the lord wanted me to run
1894175 and the more i prayed the more i felt he did and so here i am and im not the typical legislator the lord showed me right off the bat that im not supposed to be as a matter of fact my lord made it very clear to me that i am a cultural warrior and you know i tried to say no to that too cause thats pretty hard but anyway thats where i am

1894207 domestic violence is defined as a pattern of violent behavior committed by one intimate partner against another the violence doesnt have to be physical it can be sexual economic emotional and or psychological
1894208 the primary purpose is to control overpower manipulate and therefore abuse the partner often using humiliation and fear tactics
1894209 it is important that women recognize these more covert forms of abuse
1894210 one time a woman brought me her cat though she claimed it had fallen its wounds didnt seem consistent with that when i x rayed him i found signs that he had several old broken ribs and scars on his legs and head i confronted the woman and she broke down crying saying her husband often would torture her by beating her cat
1894211 women who are sexually abused are forced by their partners to have sex at times and in ways they dont want
1894212 often these women are made to feel bad about their sexual histories
1894213 he would tell me i was neurotic and nuts and i started believing it
1894214 spiritual abuse means not allowing the woman to have or maintain her own spiritual belief system an abusive husband may forbid his wife to attend church or religious gatherings
1894215 an abusive partner may ridicule the womans beliefs and keep her from her source of spiritual strength
1894216 i felt guilty that the relationship wasnt working i figured somehow i was to blame
1894217 one of the reasons i put up with so much was that i lost perspective on what abuse was
1894218 since things got worse little by little i couldnt see what was acceptable anymore in retrospect i put up with way too much and should have left sooner but i can only see that now that i am out of the relationship
1894219 you are not responsible for the abuse no matter what you do

1894232 urgent series of tests conducted at fort detrick maryland and elsewhere
1894233 so i asked how people should believe this given that theres no way to know where the information is coming from
1894234 his basic answer was that brian ross and abc news have reputations for being highly regarded journalistic outlets so we put our credibility behind the story and that should lead people to believe that this is credible
1894235 i dont know the answers to any of those questions
1894236 my main point is that we ought to know the answers to those questions and thats the only way we are going to know them through an investigation the striking fact about all this is that the anthrax attacker according to the government worked at the very same place the anonymous source came from which was fort detrick maybe it was a complete coincidence but it seems pretty significant to me that if a person from the same place where the perpetrator worked created a false story linking the attacks to something different its a very worthwhile reason for an investigation
1894237 i think first of all that this is a basic principal of journalism that if you get a story wrong you explain what happened that led to the bad reporting
1894238 thats what the new york times did to explain how they got those judy miller stories wrong when people get stories wrong the credibility of the journalistic outlet depends upon them explaining what happened if brian ross wants to say our sources acted in good faith they just got it wrong then he needs to explain the basis of that
1894239 at the very least abc should be working right now on some grand mea culpa along the lines of what the times did after the judith miller stories or even going back further to jayson blair
1894240 pretty much setting out not that we got this story wrong we know that but how we got it wrong what systemically allowed us to get this story so wrong and to flog it to the point that it was being used to embroil america in war i really think at the very least thats what they owe their viewers and themselves
1894241 now theres always a possibility that the sources were working in good faith that they were just supremely stupid or misinformed and got the story wrong
1894242 if thats the case it clouds the issue abc better be damn sure that these people were actually lying to them that they were specifically trying to mislead brian ross in the aims of furthering some sinister end before they can out them but i generally agree with the sentiment that investigative journalism is devoted to transparency and anonymity is a weapon for transparency it allows people with access to sensitive information to shield themselves from any backlash when a source uses that privilege of anonymity to push an agenda then i think a journalist is released from an obligation to protect that sources identity at all cost
1894243 its not a zero sum game where if i gave you bad information and therefore youre dead to me
1894244 i mean there can be a source that has given you five six seven things that have been reliable a trustworthy person youve gone to for info but if that person gives you bad intel one time does that negate everything else that that person gave you does that mean that they were acting maliciously here the trouble is that its very hard to prove intent its hard to show that youre being used
1894245 their initial conclusion based on microscopic examination was a brown substance that initially was reported as bentonite
1894246 we went back immediately after the white house told us it was not the case we were told after further chemical analysis it was determined it was a silica but not bentonite something they had never seen before but had a brownish color
1894247 if it was ivins i would report that in a second
1894248 was accurate at that point in their point of view

1894269 we are offering our retailers a 15 wedge floor display stand with a very small
1894270 while initially there has been some reluctance by golfers to try revolutionary or innovative products if the product helps improve their game they will become avid fans we saw this when we first introduced our 64 wedge back in the early 1990s some tour players were reluctant to use it but over time players began to see the unique benefits of having such a club in their bag and today many tour players carry them including some of the worlds very best
1894271 we are not the only believers of having more wedges in the bag
1894272 there have been a number of articles in major golf publications by well known short game experts now advocating the use of
1894273 having our wedges played by so many tour players worldwide over the past 20 years including major wins should let the average golfer know that we are serious in what we do and who we are we are pga professionals and ex players after all we know the game
1894274 our new 73 wedge for example was the result of collaboration with pga master and teaching professional charlie sorrell and lee miller our ceo aka
1894275 the desire was to create a wedge that would allow any player regardless of skill level to use their full swing which is the most repeatable swing any player has
1894276 for our retailers the patented 73 stands out first of all due to its head cover that comes included with the 73s in the
1894277 the greatest change to golf in the last 100 years

1894588 minggu ini kita atur perjalanan dinas lagi kamu siap siap yah
1894589 aku mengirimkan pesan ini kepada umatku di muka bumi karena sesungguhnya aku ada di surga
1894590 ricardo ricardo berhenti daripada kerja mu sebab ada suatu yang hendak aku laksanakan ke atas hidupmu dan juga gereja di bumi
1894591 kami terus berdoa sepanjang malam sehingga subuh ibu saya berkata supaya saya bersiap sedia untuk pergi kerja kami memohon tuhan berbicara kepada saya betulkah suara ini suara
1894592 saya mesti berhenti kerja di syarikat ini sebab tuhan mengarahkan saya berbuat demikian
1894593 apa yang kau mahu buat di mana lagi kau boleh jumpa kerja sebegini bagus
1894594 jika tuhan berkata kepada kamu maka dia berbuat sesuatu ke atas kehidupan kamu
1894595 ricardo sekarang kau telah berhenti kerja saya mahu kamu pergi ke gereja dan berdoa 7 jam setiap hari untuk diri mu dan gereja di bumi ini
1894596 dan saya pergi ke halaman rumah dan berseru seru kepada jiran sekitar ada orang yang
1894597 apa lagi yang harus saya doakan saya masih ada 4 jam lagi
1894598 berapa lama malaikat itu hendak membawa kamu keluar dari tubuhmu
1894599 saya beritahu bishop tentang hal ini lalu dia memutuskan supaya saya dibawa ke rumah pastor semasa saya dilantarkan di
1894600 malaikat itu tiba tiba berhenti dan ketika itu saya memerhati sekeliling tetapi tidak ada benda yang saya lihat saya tidak tahu di mana saya ketika itu saya hanya menyangka mungkin di syurga kedua saya mendakap
1894601 ricardo jangan takut yesus ada bersama kita angkat kepala mu dan lihatlah di atas
1894602 lihat kami akan memperlihatkan kau apa yang kau lihat di atas
1894603 dan satu dari malaikat itu menghayunkan tangannya dari sisi ke sisi maka
1894604 sebab inilah pula begitu banyak syaitan dan roh jahat dari sini datang ke bumi dan menimbulkan kemusnahan dan kesesatan bangsa bangsa manusia
1894605 kami akan pergi ke bumi dan membunuh semua kanak kanak
1894606 mari berbuat sesuatu yang berbeza mari masuk ke dalam gereja sebab banyak gereja adalah milik kita kita gunakan gereja ini dan sebarkan gossip supaya kita jatuh gereja gereja dengan gossip supaya roh kudus meninggalkan gereja kerana putus asa
1894607 dan saya melihat satu pertempuran yang dahsyat berlaku di mana
1894608 saya kemudian berjalan satu laluan menuju masuk ke kota itu ketika saya berjalan masuk malaikat malaikat itu terus memuji nama tuhan saya kemudian menangis apabila saya melangkah masuk dan melihat suasana kota surgawi itu
1894609 kudus kudus kuduslah anak domba allah dan bapa kepadanya empunya kemuliaan dan anugerah selamanya amen kuduskankanlah dirimu sebab aku kudus hanya mereka yang kudus akan masuk ke tempat ini mereka yang tidak kudus tidak akan melihat allah bapa
1894610 aku bukan allah yang dibuat daripada kayu atau kapur akulah allah yang hidup yang benar
1894611 beritahu gereja di bumi bahawa aku benar hidup dan wujud beritahu
1894612 tuhan yesus mula menangis dan dia berkata lagi tuhan yesus janganlah berkata begitu benar kami adalah gereja mu
1894613 tidak gereja milikku berjalan dengan kuasa mukjizat tanda tanda dan keajaiban gereja ku telah lemah walau bagaimanapun beritahu mereka aku akan kembali untuk menaikan mereka semula
1894614 ricardo semua ini telah disediakan untuk umatku meja itu adalah untuk persediaan di hari perkawinan anak domba allah
1894615 kenapa sister itu memperhatikan malaikat malaikat itu membuat kerja kerja di sini tetapi saya tidak nampak apa apapun disediakan
1894616 tuhan yesus bilakah engkau akan datang kembali jika persediaan semua sudah selesai berapa lama lagikah baru engkau kembali tunjukkan saya masa jamnya berapa lama lagi jika menurut jam surgawi
1894617 banyak yang telah bermimpi mengenai detiknya menunjukkan jam sudah tengah malam bila agaknya tuhan akan datang
1894618 bilakah detiknya jam akan berdentum untuk masa tibanya tengah malam satu minit dua minit
1894619 tuhan yesus mengangkat tangannya dan mempertunjukkan jari telunjuk dan ibu jarinya dan berkata
1894620 yesus akan datang bila bila masa saja lagi kita mesti mencari dia kemudian satu malaikat muncul di sebelah kanan kami dan menyahut
1894621 tetapi tidak seorang pun memperdulikan saya mereka semua asyik memuji
1894622 ricardo ini saya pertunjukkan bagaimana keadaanya sekiranya pengangkatan berlaku sekarang
1894623 memang betul kata mereka selama ini yesus telah mengambil mempelainya
1894624 kenapa kamu tidak berkhotbah yang sebenarnya kenapa tidak mengajarkan tentang kekudusan dan memberi amaran tentang semua ini kepadaku ini semua salah kamu menyebabkan saya tertinggal
1894625 pada ketika masa kesengsaraan itu akan berlaku kesusahan yang belum pernah terjadi
1894626 sebab saya tahu siapa mereka dan apa isi hati mereka
1894627 aku mahu tunjukan ini semua supaya kamu memberi amaran gerejaku tentang semua ini dan memberi mereka harapan beritahu mereka bertobat sekarang sebab aku akan melakukan sesuatu yang dahsyat ke atas bumi bukalah mata kamu gereja gereja penginjilan sedang bertumbuh di chile maka aku akan mengampuni dosa mereka
1894628 aku mengirimkan pesan ini kepada umatku di muka bumi karena sesungguhnya aku ada di surga
1894629 anak domba yang disembelih itu layak untuk menerima kuasa dan kekayaan dan hikmat dan kekuatan dan hormat dan kemuliaan dan puji pujian
1894630 ricardo ricardo keluarlah dari pekerjaanmu sekarang karena saya akan melakukan sesuatu dalam kehidupanmu dan gerejaku di atas bumi ini
1894631 jika tuhan yang sedang berbicara kepadamu dia akan memberikan pengertian kepadamu
1894632 dalam kesempatan yang lain orang orang lain mengatakan hal yang sama
1894633 saya harus meninggalkan perusahaan karena tuhan telah memerintahkan saya untuk berhenti kerja
1894634 saya mencoba meninggalkan kamar tidur saya tetapi seseorang yang tidak keliatan menghalangi saya untuk keluar dari pintu kamar tidur saya
1894635 ricardo kamu telah meninggalkan pekerjaanmu sekarang saya mau kamu pergi ke gereja dan berdoa 7 jam setiap hari doa yang harus kamu panjatkan adalah untuk kehidupanmu dan untuk gerejaku di bumi ini
1894636 dan kemudian keluar dari rumah saya dan mulai berteriak di luar rumah
1894637 ricardo ricardo berdoalah untuk gerejaku gerejaku tidak lagi sama di bandingkan dulu gerejaku di bumi ini telah berubah gerejaku telah kehilangan iman gerejaku tidak lagi percaya kepadaku atau keberadaanku beritakan kepada gerejaku bahwa aku ada berdoa syafaat untuk gerejaku karena gerejaku tidak lagi berdoa dan berpuasa
1894638 setelah berkata ini malaikat tuhan tersebut berhenti dan tidak lagi memberikan signal ke saya untuk meninggalkan tubuh saya anda lihat siapapun yang mempunyai otoritas hak di dalam yesus akan di hargai oleh malaikat tuhan
1894639 bagaimanapun juga mereka tidak bisa melihat tubuh saya karena tubuh saya adalah tubuh roh yang tidak fana jemaat jemaat tersebut mulai menutupi tubuh saya dengan selimut
1894640 setiap malaikat itu membawa saya dengan tangannya dan menangkat saya ke langit dan saya melewati jagat raya dengan kecepatan cahaya saya katakan kepada anda meskipun anda tidak percaya akan hal ini tuhan yesus yang saya sembah ada dan hidup selama lamanya
1894641 siapa gerangan yang akan percaya sama saya saya mohon supaya saya bisa tinggal di surga bersamamu tidak ada seorang pun yang akan percaya kepada kesaksian saya tidak ada yang akan percaya karena mereka tidak mempunyai iman di muka bumi kurangnya iman itu sangat besar siapa yang akan percaya kesaksian ini
1894642 mereka kemudian memegang saya secara erat dan menyilangkan salah satu kaki mereka ke kaki saya kemudian saya mulai membungkukan badan seperti posisi terkelungkup karena saya merasa takut malaikat malaikat tersebut berkata
1894643 kenapa anda berpikir bahwa anak anak membunuh anak anak lainnya
1894644 kemudian saya melihat suatu peperangan besar dan tidak bisa melihat setan setan lagi
1894645 kemudian di kejauhan dan dari kota tersebut saya melihat seorang sosok yang penuh wibawa dengan jubah putih sedang menunggangi kuda putih semakin sosok ini mendekat kepada saya malaikat malaikat tersebut tidak berhenti memuji dan meninggikan nama tuhan figur ini datang ke arah saya kira kira jaraknya 4 meter dan bentuknya sangat indah jauh lebih indah daripada malaikat malaikat lainnya saya mengharapkan dia untuk berkata kepada saya tetapi dia malah melihat saya untuk beberapa saat dan berkata
1894646 saya telah melihat malaikat michael muka dengan muka dan dia sangat indah dia membalikkan badan dan menunjukkan saya suatu jalan untuk masuk ke kota surga dia berkata
1894647 saya mendapat kekuatan dan berdiri saya kemudian menyentuh kakinya tangannya dan tubuhnya ketika saya melihat wajahnya mukanya tidak seperti artis artis di bumi mengambarkan mukanya banyak orang membuat dewa dewa dari kayu dan gambar gambar lainnya tetapi aku ingin memberitahukan kepadamu bahwa yesus tidak seperti gambaran gambaran tersebut dia sangat kuat dan perkasa dia bukan tuhan yang tidak ada apa apanya dia maha kuasa dia berkata
1894648 mari berjalanlah bersamaku dan aku akan menunjukkan kepadamu sesuatu yang luar biasa
1894649 tuhan tahu segala sesuatunya apa yang kita kerjakan dan saya bisa melihat banyak dari umatnya di surga
1894650 tetapi di gerejaku banyak sekali pencuri pencuri yang mencuri perpuluhan dan persembahan katakan kepada umatku bahwa tidak ada pencuri yang bisa masuk ke kerajaan surga
1894651 kenapa wanita ini melihat malaikat malaikat sibuk mempersiapkan perjamuan tetapi saya tidak melihat persiapannya sedang di kerjakan
1894652 di sana banyak mahkota untuk mereka yang bekerja dan taat kepada tuhan saya berkata
1894653 banyak orang telah mendapatkan mimpi mengenai jam menunjukkan hampir jam 12 malam ketika tuhan seharusnya datang kembali
1894654 tuhan mengamati muka saya untuk sementara waktu dan kemudian dia berkata
1894655 kalau begitu tuhan kalau jam nya sudah tidak ada lagi kenapa tuhan tidak datang kembali kedua kalinya
1894656 tuhan mengangkat kedua tangannya dan dengan menggunakan ibu jari dan jari telunjuk dia menunjukkan tanda yang sangat kecil dan berkata
1894657 dan tuhan pencipta segala makhluk belum kembali karena dia memberikan kita semua waktu yang sangat singkat untuk bertobat dan waktu ini di katakan
1894658 waktunya sudah selesai setiap persiapan sudah selesai yesus sedang menerima pengantin wanitanya tuhan sedang datang dan semua tanda tanda di firmannya sudah di genapi film film sedang menunjukkan bencana alam yang akan datang ilmuawan ilmuawan tahu bahwa sesuatu bencana alam yang besar akan terjadi tetapi mereka tidak tahu itu apa bagaimanapun kita sebagai gerejanya tahu bahwa tuhan akan datang kedua kalinya ketika malaikat selesai berteriak kemudian berjuta juta malaikat mulai melompat dan bersuka cita bahwa pengantin wanitanya gerejanya akhirnya kembali ke surga saya tetap bertanya
1894659 tetapi tidak ada seorangpun yang memperhatikan saya mereka semuanya sedang bersuka cita dengan berita yang baik
1894660 banyak anak anak telah pergi karena tuhan tidak meninggalkan mereka
1894661 setelah pimpinan paduan suara saya melihat pendeta pendeta jemaat dan penatua gereja semuanya menangis
1894662 banyak orang tua dan pasangan pasangan yang mencari orang orang yang mereka kasihi dan orang orang di gereja berteriak
1894663 banyak orang yang di tinggalkan karena mereka tidak hidup di dalam kekudusan kita perlu mengajarkan kekudusan dan mengajarkan orang untuk benar benar bertobat saya melihat orang orang memukul pendeta pendeta dan mencabut rambut mereka pendeta pendeta tersebut menangis dan memohon orang orang tersebut untuk tidak melukai mereka orang orang tersebut tidak berhenti melukai pendeta pendeta tersebut karena orang orang tersebut telah di rasuki setan ada juga gereja gereja yang seluruh jemaatnya di tinggalkan saya melihat seorang laki laki yang berusaha untuk mencongkel matanya karena kesedihannya orang orang berusaha membenturkan kepalanya ke lantai dan dinding karena mereka tidak bisa mengerti bahwa yesus hanya satu satunya jawaban karena orang orang ingin hidup di dalam dosa dan kejahatan dan hidup menurut kehendak mereka sendiri orang orang juga memotong diri mereka dan membenturkan kepala mereka sampai tengkorak mereka pecah dan mereka jatuh ke lantai saya melihat darah mengalir kemana mana dari orang orang yang berusaha melukai diri mereka kemudian saya melihat seorang anak muda menangis kepada tuhan
1894664 itu sudah telat yesus telah datang dan menerima gerejanya saya jatuh tersungkur karena saya telah melihat banyak hal hal yang sangat menyedihkan
1894665 saya kemudian melihat api bergerak dan mendatangi negara chile dan yesus berkata

1894727 that attempt at qualification makes no sense the south dakota law has produced national shockwaves precisely because it prohibits abortions even for victims of rape or incest

1894750 many fabric companies in the quilt market use cotton that is 60 by 60 or 68 by 68 meaning that many threads per inch going both ways crosswise and lengthwise p amp b often chooses cotton that measures 75 by 75
1894751 for savvy consumers who buy luxury sheets with thread counts in the hundreds it might seam puzzling that quilters cotton has a thread count so much lower in the sixties and seventies
1894752 one of the reasons that independent quilt shops have become such a force in the quilt world is that they emphasize top quality fabric quilters may be able to buy fabric cheaper at a discounter or chain store but the quailty could well be lower

1894857 ya allah zahirlah ramadan atas kami dengan keamanan dan keimanan dan dengan keselamatan dan keislaman tuhanku dan tuhan engkau allah

1894870 pada suatu ketika kota baghdad didatangi oleh seorang pendakyah yahudi bernama dahri
1894871 aku bermimpi ada sebuah dusun yang amat luas lagi indah di sana kulihat ada sepohon kayu yand rendanng dan lebat buahnya tiba tiba di situ keluar seekor khinzir dari hujung sebuah kampung lalu habis dimakannya buah buahan yang masak ranum dari pokok itu hingga ke daun dan dahan dahannya habis ditutuh yang tinggal cuma batangnya sahaja dalam pada itu juga keluar seekor harimau daripada umbi pohon rendang tadi lalu menerkam khinzir itu dengan gigi dan kukunya yang tajam lalu khinzir tadi mati disitu juga
1894872 apa yang tuan lihat dalam mimpi tuan sebagai dusun yang luas lagi indah itu adalah tamsilan kepada agama islam kita
1894873 hai dahri apalah yang digusarkan orang yang mengetahuinya pasti menjawabnya
1894874 siapa kamu hai anak muda berani sungguh menyahut cabaranku sedangkan ulama yang hebat hebat yang berserban dan berjubah labuh telah ku kalahkan
1894875 allah telah meninggikan darjat orang beriman dan berimul antara kamu beberapa darjat
1894876 hairan kau kata allah itu wujud tetapi tidak bertempat pula
1894877 bahkan memang aku ada nyawa dan memang setiap makhluk yang bernafas itu ada nyawa
1894878 tetapi adakah kau tahu di manakah letaknya nyawa atau rohmu itu dikepalakah diperutkah atau adakah dihujung tapak kakimu
1894879 kalau begitu dimanakah lemak itu berada di bahagian atasnyakah atau dibawahkah
1894880 untuk mencari dimanakah beradanya roh dalam jasad dan tersisip dimanakah kandungan lemak dalam air susu ini pun kita tidak upaya masakan pula kita dapat menjangkau dimanakah beradanya zat allah swt di alam maya ini zat yang telah mencipta dan mentadbir seluruh alam ini termasuk roh dan akal dangkal kita ini pun ciptaan nya yang tunduk dan patuh di bawah urusan tadbir kerajaan nya yang maha agung
1894881 wahai dahri tidak ada suatu pun yang wujud sebelum allah taala dan tidak ada sesuatu jua yang akan muncul selepas nya allah swt tetap qadim dan azali dialah yanng awal dan dialah yang akhir
1894882 pelik sungguh mana mungkin begitu tuhan wujud tanpa ada permulaan nya dan mana mungkin dia pula yang terakhir tanpa ada lagi yang selepas nya
1894883 ya dalilnya ada pada diri kamu sendiri cuba kau lihat pada ibu jari mu itu jari apakah yang kau nampak berada sebelum jari ini
1894884 dan pada jari manis kau itu ada lagikah jari yang selepasnya
1894885 jadi kalaulah pada jari kita yang kecil ini pun tidak mampu kita fikir apatah lagi allah swt zat yang maha agung itu yang tiada suatu pun yang mendahului nya dan tiada sesuatu yang kemudian selepas nya
1894886 allah itu ada kata mu ha apakah pekerjaan tuhan mu ketika ini
1894887 ini soalan yang sungguh menarik jadi kenalah dijawab dari tempat yang tinggi supaya dapat didengar oleh semua orang
1894888 wahai sekelian manusia ketahuilah bahawa kerja allah ketika ini ialah menggugurkan yang bathil sebagaimana dahri yang berada di atas mimbar diturunkan allah ke bawah mimbar dan allah juga telah menaikkan yang hak sebagaimana aku yang berada di sana telah dinaikkan ke atas mimbar masjid jamek ini

1894907 perhaps the greatest misconception about barack obama is that he is some sort of anti establishment revolutionary rather every stage of his political career has been marked by an eagerness to accommodate himself to existing institutions rather than tear them down or replace them like many politicians obama is paradoxical he is by nature an incrementalist yet he has laid out an ambitious first term agenda energy independence universal health care withdrawal from iraq he campaigns on reforming a broken political process yet he has always played politics by the rules as they exist not as he would like them to exist he runs as an outsider but he has succeeded by mastering the inside game he is ideologically a man of the left but at times he has been genuinely deferential to core philosophical insights of the right

1895094 brilliant but still fixated on the technology in this millenium technology is not what it does technology is one enabler to what it does process frameworks are another it does information engineering
1895095 ok when you find it fire it over and ill work it out and send back the results
1895096 only authorised staff should have access to protectively marked information
1895097 you know what that reminds me of our discussion the other day about network routing
1895098 the motorway is just like a cable and you are sitting there like little packets of data when a server goes down
1895099 enterprise software rarely gets critiqued the way even a us 30 piece of shareware will
1895100 there is a curious paradox about design simplicity it isnt that simple
1895101 the art and science of designing and constructing physical structures
1895102 a subjective mapping from a human perspective that of the user in the case of abstract or physical artifacts to the elements or components of some kind of structure or system which preserves the relationships among the elements or components
1895103 ive talked to many companies that have implemented stunningly beautiful soa infrastructures that support managed communications using virtualized proxies and dynamic bindings theyve deployed the best technology the industry has to offer including registries repositories soa management xml gateways and even the occasional esb many have set up knowledge bases best practices guidance frameworks and governance processes and yet these soa initiatives invariably stall out the techies just cant sell soa to the business they have yet to demonstrate how all this infrastructure yields any business value
1895104 the business side needs to be educated that soa is a goal worthy of shooting for and key performance indicators need to be tied into soa efforts but soa is a journey not a destination and organizations that expect overnight benefits to the business are bound to be disappointed
1895105 it is relatively easy to decouple from one service provider and move to another
1895106 i fear one of the first budgets to be cut will be soa
1895107 the no need to spend a bunch of money message may be getting drowned out in the very vocal soa tools market place
1895108 to write the code as close as possible to the way of thinking of the users with different words to align the code to the way of thinking of the business
1895109 designing a system where each system component provides access to its computational or business resources as a service to other components
1895110 it does what i want it to do and it does it quickly and easily
1895111 processing more than five million transactions a day and more than 300 bets a second peak load easily outdoing city institutions and stock exchanges 99 9 per cent of bets in less than one second
1895112 a new core betting engine that could demonstrate a throughput of almost 100 000 transactions per second while also reducing the cost per transaction by 200 times
1895113 customer trends are moving towards a high volume of small value bets which in turn produce small value commissions the only solution was to develop a system that could process exponentially more transactions for a lower cost than traditional betting engines
1895114 through interpreting the numerous readings taken at a single point in the plant rich information could be gleaned about how the product was flowing at that instant by expanding this single point into hundreds of thousands of points along the manufacturing process it was possible to see ripples in the data as the product rippled through the plant the flow of data became analogous to the flow of product
1895115 it wasnt a case of whether we needed to do this we have to do it its a question of survivability
1895116 global scale shared computer capable of hosting the entire internet as an application
1895117 s o the harsh winter was a critical factor that helped the russians begin to turn the tide
1895118 well i wouldnt say it was all hype exactly within the process control systems we had some dcs concerns over the y2k compliance of microchips in embedded systems which fed rs232 data through 4 20ma dacs and directly into the loops which ramped the set points so we had to establish inter company resource sharing across the industry to share information as and when it became available by manufacturers or by test programmes to

1895129 its been great for us so long as we dont want to change anything implementing erp is like pouring concrete on the whole organisation
1895130 is that by using them as a visualisation and communication tool the engineers and the business guys quickly see the big picture and can easily understand each other
1895131 so why has this never been done for it and business i mean isnt it the flow of data between assets
1895132 a full implementation can cost millions of dollars and take years to implement
1895133 the bmc atrium cmdb provides the following business value allows any it process users to launch a view into the bmc atrium cmdb to quickly view ci and relationship data relevant to their needs through graphical interfaces eliminates the fragmentation of it tools and data sources by providing both a common data model and service model to infuse business relevance into an industry standards approach to managing it data
1895134 for those not accustomed with the practice snagging is going through everything with a fine tooth comb and building up lists of problems for the builder to come back and fix
1895135 its just a shame that after years of writing about the need for integration between it and business alignment is still at the critical rather than the taken for granted stage whos fault is that the it department or the business

1895138 she even smoked standing on the threshold to the balcony but shed never actually go outside look here
1895139 these are a mans cigarettes ruslana only smoked thin ladys cigarettes why didnt the police pay attention to this
1895140 i think its possible ruslana was pulled over there and thrown off
1895141 i cant believe she just wanted to say goodbye when she came to see me the day before she died why didnt the police interrogate me they didnt interrogate mark either ruslanas boyfriend and he was the last person to speak with her
1895142 kaminskiys ex wife issued a restraining order against him in 2001 he was arrested for illegally possessing a firearm and marijuana in 2003 and 2005
1895143 komsomolskaya pravda if you print even one word about us well sue
1895144 call me maksim ive been in the modelling business for a long time and my wife is also a model this is just to let you know that i know my way around the business
1895145 kaminskiy is the right hand man of petr listerman a matchmaker who sets up wealthy men with models petr has a show on muz tv called beauties and the beast in one episode he and kaminskiy went to milan to find young models
1895146 you think ruslana may have fallen under the influence of these dubious characters
1895147 but here are some facts for you several years ago i held a casting session at a moscow club kaminskiy stood in the doorway listernman called me that evening and demanded i give him one of the models who had gone to the club he said we could make big money if we delivered her to the bed of an oligarch during his trip to kurshevel and there was real pressure with threats and promises to earn unheard of cash
1895148 im not saying anything but if some rich man paid for ruslana then listerman would have been on her like a bulldog they give a lot of money for that id guess the starting price would be around one million dollars mark is a professional pimp hes the macho who works in the girls and does the pre sale preparation
1895149 absolutely no one believes that ruslana could have done this
1895150 there were no adults who were closer to her than us here in new york we were something like her mother and father in the u s
1895151 this was really due to how ruslana was brought up
1895152 her mother was supposed to come visit from almaty the two lived together in an apartment but ruslana was a bit embarrassed because they were living together unmarried so she asked artem to move out
1895153 but there wasnt any way back although they always called and wrote each other they rarely met so in short they remained friends
1895154 my son had this tiny book ruslana had given him once they read the poems from there later he put the book in her coffin and his cross
1895155 in new york these escort services pay just as much as working the podium
1895156 i think its unlikely ruslana was involved in something like this
1895157 the reason why is korshunova was brought here omitting the moscow agencies her whole story was like straight out of a movie her friend convinced her to do a photo shoot for the cover of a local airline magazine the magazine wound up in the hands of the director of a leading modelling agency who was just leaving kazakhstan and at 15 she was already in new york conjectures about a moscow new york mafia using girls as escorts is out of place in her case
1895158 believe me she was fine in this regard the apartment she was renting in new york wasnt cheap ruslana had paid rent until the end of the year something like 40 000
1895159 she did have problems with her agent around one year ago
1895160 and ruslana asked us to help her out we called her agent and handled the negotiations but this had nothing to do with money ruslana simply wanted to change her agency but they wouldnt let her go but then everything solved itself
1895161 i confirm everything thats being said about the restaurants purchase by the italian press 3 5 million euro 5 5 million was paid
1895162 what good is living when your health keeps going downhill i dont want you to have to waste your time on me when i get around to ending it all the money is in my chest take it
1895163 eat when you get home from work theres soup waiting for you then go into the shed
1895164 i guess ill just have to go and drown myself in the river like nurka did not long ago
1895165 they wouldnt even let you and your cow of a mother work as toilet cleaners in israel
1895166 ruslana korshunova was part of the same agency as i am in moscow black model management
1895167 we have the same agent aleksey kalinin he has a lot of experience and huge connections abroad aleksey was her russia side agent until the very end his agency takes a cut from all our work done abroad something like 10 percent the agency that represents us abroad also takes a cut about 20 percent taxes are also deducted before we see any money and taxes are huge in the u s expenses for food and pocket money are also taken out of our salary as the foreign agency pays all these expenses in advance
1895168 im not in the plus yet either although ive already been working abroad two years
1895169 foreigners come up with all sorts of expenses and present models with astronomical bills
1895170 for example my agency made me make new photographs but they prohibited me from using any photographer but their own it turned out he charged me far more than the market price the agency also overcharged me for other services so they could deduct the costs later
1895171 nervous stress is part of the package for new models
1895172 i was first sent to tokyo at 15 i wound up in a strange country without knowing the language and without any moral support what happened to me occurs with all new models abroad i started going to night clubs to relax and get rid of my nervousness i drank smoked and tried to save myself from my depression and stress i started missing castings and went to some of them inebriated i couldnt sleep called home and yelled get me out of here i dont want anything anymore but my parents werent rich enough to go to japan to get me and the agency wouldnt let me go no one wanted to give me work after seeing how i looked i gained 8 pounds from going to all the night clubs i was really out of shape i remember my booker in japan called aleksey and complained he said i was too young and didnt know anything i was acting horribly and he didnt know what to do with me but luckily they gave me a second chance i went on a diet and lost weight and now im in paris ive talked to other models and learned we all go through depression its the school of life
1895173 sometimes i take sedatives and other times energizers my stomach is ruined from all these diets but i have to keep in shape i hope i achieve everything ive set out to accomplish
1895174 it can drive her to suicide in ruslanas case im just lucky nothing like that has happened to me
1895175 if the identity cards arent ready by the day after tomorrow well shoot these 10 men
1895176 people are more afraid now they used to take risks knowing they could lose or win a lot that doesnt happen anymore
1895177 things are better you used to need criminal protection but thats all past us now
1895178 the sociologists primarily spoke with businessmen small business owners or managers at large companies
1895179 this means experts with their own businessnes doctors lawyers and journalists they deal with corruption more than other professions as they have to solve problems with power structures they also travel abroad and have the opportunity to compare the level and quality of life here and there in one word they have something to lose that explains the decadent attitudes
1895180 do you feel safe from the whims of the authorities police or other power structures
1895181 what would you recommend to a relative businessman who is unlawfully accused of avoiding taxes
1895182 as a citizen i simply dont care i just need to know who my president is i need to earn a decent salary raise children and have everything i need
1895183 politics have their own life and the middle class has another
1895184 there are a lot of topics worth discussing we just dont have the time to get around to the subject of politics
1895185 the burgeoning middle class needs to be valued and protected
1895186 theyre buying real estate abroad and thats just the first step to emigration i think economic rehabilitation will help the situation all sectors need to flourish not only oil and gas ownership rights need to be protected and personal safety must be guaranteed combatting corruption and decreasing inflation is also important the prices are climbing and people have decided its pointless to have savings if it becomes possible to provide quality equal development then our middle class will remain patriotism is good but people want something more

1895189 we received dima in 2006 straight from the labor ward
1895190 his 18 year old mother signed a refusal of the child and disappeared its unclear where she is now she is a mentally disabled lonely young girl who was also raised in an orphanage
1895191 and although the boy was sweet it was likely this diagnose together with his background that frightened the russian couple but the harrisons agreed to adopt dima
1895192 i had a very good impression of the pair they were absolutely normal people who were ready to become parents and take care of their child
1895193 the boy was friendly calm and good natured and he wasnt capricious at all he was almost completely healthy when he was adopted

1895197 the idle speed is set by the isc idle speed control valve by the ecm non adjustable if that valve is not locked out during tbs it will compensate for the idle changes being made from the sync the isc valve has to move to its outer limits of function to keep the idle in spec along comes a really cold or hot day and that valve may bottom out before it can achieve the proper rpm also possibly damaging the valve you want to lock out the valve set the sync then turn both screws to get the desired rpm then unlock the valve with sds and the ecm centers it in its range now it can move fully either way the way it was supposed to im not sure how much small sync changes will affect the isc but we were able to run the valve out of range on a gixxer 1000 in class doing the sync without sds most people also dont realize that valve adjustment should technically be done before a sync depending on how tight or loose they are it alters the cam duration and lift of that cylinder creating a different vacuum reading

1895286 if this person is a director of a company this person is a big shot this person is running his own business this person must be filthy rich this person for sure have lots and lots of money
1895287 likewise the spirit helps us in our weakness for we do not know what to pray for as we ought but the spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words and he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the spirit because the spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of god
1895288 you have come to the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem and to innumerable angels in festal gathering and to the assembly of the firstborn
1895289 when we come into worship we enter into the heavenly sanctuary and join with the spirits of the righteous made perfect heb 12 22 24 though this reality is not apparent to our eyes our worship includes not only the members of our individual church but moses esther augustine calvin and every other believer from history are worshiping as well
1895290 what ministers announce and what is likely to happen are two very different things the targets are usually not backed by policies and funding that will deliver
1895291 well its one of these areas which is complicated by the fact that the majority of the responsibility for the area lies with the uk government
1895292 so what we can do as a welsh assembly government is relatively limited
1895293 in all governments you just get stuck in the morass of bureaucracy
1895294 and if you accept a dollar you have so many conditions its not worth it
1895295 there is no existing approval process for offshore wave energy installations
1895296 several years and millions of pounds may be ok for a 300 mw offshore wind farm but for a small wave developer whose device will only be in the water for a year or two the process is not proportional
1895297 harnessing the severn will produce a long term renewable energy source for wales and also the uk

1895303 el estado participar en los beneficios del aprovechamiento de estos recursos en un monto que no ser inferior a los de la empresa que los explota
1895304 los asamble stas analizaron y votaron por ese art culo m s all de las cuatro de la madrugada y no se dieron cuenta quiz s que esto es tra do de los cabellos

1895322 ive been living in an incredible state of pressure and scrutiny
1895323 ive been living in an incredible state of pressure and scrutiny
1895324 what matters to me though is how the court overall is perceived and how if it was not kwame kilpatrick sitting in that seat if it was john six pack sitting in that seat what would i do and that answer is simple
1895325 i think its the most extreme measure he can take i dont agree with him
1895326 what matters to me though is how the court overall is perceived and how if it was not sitting in that seat if it was john six pack sitting in that seat what would i do and that answer is simple
1895327 i think its the most extreme measure he can take i dont agree with him
1895328 mark made on skin by burning with a hot iron

1895331 he wanted her to come back on board and she decided to he had really poor management and wanted her back
1895332 with an artist like usher the bar is set really high whether it was management marketing or the music we achieved a number one single and a number one album it is a completely new day and time in music now in four years his audience demographic and musical direction has changed
1895333 r kelly was very instrumental in making a lot of decisions when it came to my records being played on the radio
1895334 he would make a call to the radio station or to the label and say hey this joe record is too hot right now
1895335 and joe who left jive to release his forthcoming lp new man through
1895336 im still very relevant in the game but yeah he did try to make some decisions when it came down to my records being on fire and climbing up the charts and on the radio stations
1895337 the climate in the industry high profile pds get put out to pasture when they open themselves up to the press downsizing is real in this business many urban programmers just dont want to stick out a lot of pds want to be stars and the company wants a pd
1895338 when youve got sites out there like the vent which is not policed and those people are brutally and viciously attacking urban programmers that adds even another element to the decision not to do press at all
1895339 it could but you have to find a middle ground
1895340 that can create a problem especially between the programmer and the on air staff i dont think its a good idea to have both jobs pds have to be careful with how they position themselves when they are also on air talent
1895341 younger pds in smaller to mid sized markets create this situation when they are on the air i dont think it happens as much to older pds younger pds often get confused with the roles
1895342 corporate specifically told us not to speak with media including industry trade media because as a company we dont have anything to gain and more to lose by doing so
1895343 of course you know theres no simple answer to this i think the climate has just changed
1895344 most programmers these days have lost touch with music and their listeners we really cant explore this except to say it is possible and perhaps the programmer doesnt want the company to know hes out of touch so he remains in the background to help secure his position
1895345 i personally try and keep a low profile so that my on air personalities can shine
1895346 perhaps were just so busy that keeping the radio station on a winning path supersedes anything else we have time for
1895347 surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the in the bible david was known as a man after gods own heart

1895349 its great to have ben one of our former members back in the band he knows the material fantastically and is perfect for the role we auditioned him and he nailed 11 songs taken from all our albums right off the bat so were really excited and looking forward to getting on stage for some shows asap
1895350 got in touch with ben almost out of the blue during the drum auditions period to gather some material for our upcoming release but one thing led to another and now were slaying the tracks in the rehearsal room
1895351 fate it seems has dealt a good card for us all it was really cool when mithras got back in touch again and as we have all evolved as musicians it seems to work better than ever now its good to be back

1895356 dont establish any criteria for whose computer can be searched
1895357 plenary authority to conduct routine searches and seizures at the border without probable cause or a warrant
1895358 the most dangerous contraband is often contained in laptop computers or other electronic devices
1895359 as a practical matter travelers only go to secondary for a more thorough examination when there is some level of suspicion
1895360 yet legislation locking in a particular standard for searches would have a dangerous chilling effect as officers often split second assessments are second guessed
1895361 where have you gone joe dimaggio a nation turns its lonely eyes to you whats that you say mrs robinson joltin joe has left and gone away
1895362 if only you will forsake this obsession regarding your father

1895376 this my friends is pure mercy on the part of god
1895377 now after john was arrested jesus came into galilee preaching the gospel of god and saying
1895378 justification is not only the remission of sins but also the sanctification and renewal of the interior man
1895379 clasping sinners to her bosom is at once holy and always in need of purification and follows constantly the path of penance and renewal
1895380 when you were slaves of sin you were free in regard to righteousness but then what return did you get from the things of which you are now ashamed the end of those things is death but now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of god the return you get is sanctification and its end eternal life for the wages of sin is death but the free gift of god is eternal life in christ jesus our lord
1895381 those whom i love i reprove and chasten so be zealous and repent

1895416 they benefited to some degree where a couple of their very important models in their second year on the market the es and the rx which together account for over two thirds of lexus sales both improved significantly
1895417 the lower score is largely due to vehicles that are no longer in the marketplace
1895418 the vehicles are still out there so the study is still relevant but obviously they had some problems
1895419 obviously were disappointed not to have been at the top but as a brand we consistently rank high in many many quality studies
1895420 improved quality is good for everybody its good for the consumer they dont have the annoyance of problems they dont have the costs associated
1895421 for the manufacturer its obviously good news because they dont have to pay so much in warranty repairs

1895504 all of the great live programming will be a perfect complement to our ever expanding line up of elite competition versus is the ideal home for indycar racing since we pride ourselves on super serving highly passionate fans and as the new exclusive cable home of the indy racing league we look forward to providing motorsports fans with the most in depth coverage they have ever seen
1895505 todays announcement continues the momentum shown since we announced unification in february and will be an immediate asset for indycar series drivers teams venues suppliers and sponsors
1895506 the immediate and long term beneficiaries are indycar series fans who will get more indycar series programming then ever before
1895507 so it will be good to put our past few performances behind us and make up some ground in the championship it is good to know that when hideki mutoh tested the indycar at kentucky last year he went on to win the indy lights race
1895508 i think we can go out and be strong right away

1895511 4 billion more in tax breaks to the biggest oil companies in america including 1 2 billion to exxon mobil a company that last quarter made the same amount of money in 30 seconds that a typical ohio worker makes in a year
1895512 when you hear me talk about people versus the powerful my populism is built most powerfully around the sense that government is nonresponsive to these folks
1895513 theyre probably less angry at wall street for making money and angrier at washington for not just setting up some basic rules of the road
1895514 im well aware of the argument about singling out oil companies rather than soda pop manufacturers
1895515 i think oil companies are amoral they want to make as much money as they can for their shareholders which is what corporations do
1895516 the difference is the nature of the kind of outsized profits they make that may have no relationship to their investments or their production the fact for example that the shortage of refinery capacity could actually increase their profits so the less they invest the more they make indicates that you are not dealing with someone making widgets out there
1895517 the background to owens argument at this juncture is the reformed rejection of the medieval notion of adam as created in puris naturalibus
1895518 i also set how soon before the event sandy will remind me 15 minutes a day a week etc shell also send me a daily log every morning if i need it or on request any time i ask

1895522 est bien definido el articulado en toda su extensi n no solo por lo de la seguridad social sino tambi n por el reconocimiento como trabajo no remunerado al cuidado de las personas con discapacidad de ni os y ni as menores de 5 a os que est n generalmente a cargo de las mam s
1895523 no creo que deba ser para todos hay personas que siendo amas de casa tienen solvencia econ mica para pagarse una buena atenci n m dica por ejemplo pero hay otras de menores recursos que no obtienen ning n beneficio
1895524 en este caso la actual ley de seguridad social pr cticamente en muchos de sus articulados quedar an en contradicci n con la nueva constituci n se tendr a que hacer una reforma integral a la legislaci n dictando una nueva ley org nica o un c digo de seguridad social como hay en otros pa ses as se incorporar n estos principios y reglamentar n las disposiciones de la carta magna
1895525 la idea de que me vayan a asegurar es una motivaci n planchar cocinar lavar limpiar la casa son cosas que hacemos todos los d as sin recibir un pago si un d a me enfermo por lo menos tendr a oportunidad de ir al seguro y hacerme atender as no le cargar a todo el gasto a mi esposo que gana poco
1895526 con este reconocimiento a la labor dom stica de las amas de casa se abre el paraguas del iess lo veo como el principio de lo que yo llamo una deslaboralizaci n de la seguridad social que consiste en que este beneficio no sea solo para los que trabajan con relaci n de dependencia con un contrato para una empresa o un negocio sino para todos los habitantes del pa s
1895527 a partir de la nueva constituci n habr mayor respeto al significado de ser ama de casa las mujeres damos cuidado en alimentaci n aseo inculcamos h bitos valores educaci n y afectos a todos los integrantes de la familia
1895528 se reconoce como labor productiva el trabajo no remunerado de autosustento y cuidado humano que se realiza en los hogares la protecci n de la seguridad social se extender de manera progresiva a las personas que tengan a su cargo el trabajo familiar no remunerado en el hogar conforme a las condiciones generales del sistema y la ley

1895537 we already know that coal is very cost efficient we know its very reliable we know theres tremendous security for production in the u s once its environmentally compliant we have all the aspects of coal to make it a continued preferred fuel source for power generation and also on a coal to liquids basis it will begin to open up the transportation markets as well so i think the long term outlook for coal is very positive and its very positive specifically because of the potential for commercial technologies
1895538 today has been good it was a difficult position we were a minute behind second place and a long way ahead of the driver in fourth place today was a day for checking the pace notes and not for taking big risks
1895539 i needed the points for the championship and weve done that the car has been very good it has been perfect with just the right set up for the whole event

1895552 when i began playing in denver i came to know the curse the curse happens to tackles that have an amazingly talented quarterback like john elway and you are responsible for protecting his blind side what happens is the night before the game you get little or no sleep because if you didnt do your job youll forever be known as the guy who lost our franchise i would also like to thank john it was worth every sleepless night
1895553 its been hard to sit back and think about the significance of what all this really means i realize that its more than a bust and wearing a gold jacket its about history and the game and those who made the game what it is today and its a privilege to be included in that group
1895554 queen pelosi why do you refuse to address the real issues americans are facing drill here and drill now
1895555 because of her refusal to accept accountability to abide by safety rules on the plane and because brown continues to suffer from depression and post traumatic stress disorder
1895556 its a sacrilege to compare what happened on this flight to 9 11 or post traumatic stress syndrome

1895564 we have decided not to return fire for a certain period of time this move is yet another attempt by us to convince the separatists that a military confrontation is pointless
1895565 military confrontation may lead to many casualties so we are ready to hold talks and defuse tensions
1895566 we are unilaterally ceasing fire but we are doing it not because we are afraid of anyone but because we want peace we hope that this message will be properly received by them the south ossetian side and that they will stop shelling our civilian population

1895573 may have a duty to disclose such information to avoid liability under consumer protection statutes
1895574 inform consumers of the actual fuel temperature or make adjustments to the price of fuel
1895575 address plaintiffs contention that they should adjust the price not volume of motor fuel to account for temperature
1895576 conceded that it might be permissible under state law to adjust the retail price of motor fuel based on temperatures
1895577 not shown that state regulation actually prohibits them from adjusting the size of a gallon of motor fuel to account for thermal expansion

1895597 i was of course never not once in my life independent not in the truest sense i had always lived in my fathers house with my mother and granny cly but
1895598 sorry my girl but you see i always believed myself independent much the same as you do
1895599 why make us all and then and then unmake us
1895600 a pamphlet arrived on the morning after your father proposed id told him no of course he was well a good enough sort but i was having none of it no marriage and family settling in for me i was adamant sure then the pamphlet came it was from denmark
1895601 sorry child it was celibacy insurance granny clys old neighbor in bristol massachusetts marta olsen had drawn an annuity from her celibacy policy for years you see marta olsen was a spinster not only in the physical sense of being unmarried and older but as she purchased turnips or a new parasol anywhere everywhere on paper you see in a contract between herself and the celibacy insurance company in a country on the other side of the world marta olsen had been an international spinster you see
1895602 i suppose a spinster is at least in some ways an independent woman i couldnt see that then though we had the most awful quarrel
1895603 no with granny cly over the pamphlet i thought she was meddling with my life by ordering such an insult
1895604 yes but i misunderstood she meant for me to have options you see i took the pamphlet quite differently and said yes to your fathers renewed proposal the very next day he was an impractical dreamer a romantic i am not now and never was i said yes out of anger you see and stubborn pig headedness nothing more
1895605 willfulness is a dangerous thing you get that from me i am sorry to say

1895621 how can alex be in the boat waiting for irene and at the cannon lighting the fuse
1895622 he used to run with a guy named mike the two of them would sooner find a fight than eat theyd go in and out of bars just itching for a brawl tore up some places those two he spent some nights in jail too cooling off i can tell you that

1895640 i do think we need to examine the issues of both gulf war syndrome and the anthrax vaccine and how they can be dealt with
1895641 it didnt bother me that rove referred to it as a political problem at the time because it meant that it would be properly dealt with finally the political problem became a problem to me when they dropped the ball and allowed the program to continue it was politics that motivated them to investigate and it was politics that motivated them to allow the program to continue now the political nature bothers me

1895645 adverse effects may include redness or swelling where the shot was given larger than the bottom of a soda can and or more than 24 hours of headaches muscle joint pains and or fatigue tiredness that interfered with your daily activities
1895646 bioport should not be able to keep that contract for years they never met any goals or objectives for years they got bonuses that equaled or exceeded their salaries and didnt accomplish their goals
1895647 the damage that was done to our tigers in the armed forces is incredible
1895648 hundreds of pilots have left the air force rather than take the shot 6 million to train one pilot thats a high price to pay right

1895664 the ministry of foreign relations reiterates that the importance of this case fundamentally stems from the respect to the right to consular access and protection provided by consulates of every state to each of its nationals abroad
1895665 we continue to seek a practical and timely way to carry out our nations international legal obligation
1895666 a goal that the united states needs the assistance of texas to achieve
1895667 with this action our nation has broken a commitment willingly made by our president and our senate

1895669 its concern for the precedent that the execution may create for the rights of mexican nationals
1895670 the majority opinion reads as if there wasnt any expectation that the u s would comply with the icjs judgment
1895671 it doesnt put the u s in a good light particularly because the executive branch tried to convey the opposite message
1895672 you all had better get obama in the white house after the last four years let me tell you what that guy has done he shipped his politics overseas and now theres a war and now its harder to get pot in canada so pretty soon well be like you

1895683 demi allah seandainya jenazah yang sedang kalian tangisi bisa berbicara sekejab lalu menceritakan pengalaman sakaratul mautnya pada kalian niscaya kalian akan melupakan jenazah tersebut dan mulai menangisi diri kalian sendiri
1895684 sekiranya kamu berada di rumahmu niscaya orang orang yang telah ditakdirkan akan mati terbunuh itu ke luar juga ke tempat mereka terbunuh
1895685 sesungguhnya kematian yang kamu lari daripadanya maka sesungguhnya kematian itu akan menemui kamu kemudian kamu akan dikembalikan kepada allah yang mengetahui yang gaib dan yang nyata lalu dia beritakan kepadamu apa yang telah kamu kerjakan
1895686 sakaratul maut itu sakitnya sama dengan tusukan tiga ratus pedang
1895687 kematian yang paling ringan ibarat sebatang pohon penuh duri yang menancap di selembar kain sutera apakah batang pohon duri itu dapat diambil tanpa membawa serta bagian kain sutera yang tersobek
1895688 sakaratul maut ibarat sebatang pohon berduri yang dimasukkan kedalam perut seseorang lalu seorang lelaki menariknya dengan sekuat kuatnya sehingga ranting itupun membawa semua bagian tubuh yang menyangkut padanya dan meninggalkan yang tersisa
1895689 rasa sakit yang dirasakan selama sakaratul maut menghujam jiwa dan menyebar ke seluruh anggota tubuh sehingga bagian orang yang sedang sekarat merasakan dirinya ditarik tarik dan dicerabut dari setiap urat nadi urat syaraf persendian dari setiap akar rambut dan kulit kepala hingga kaki
1895690 apa yang kalian kehendaki dariku limapuluh tahun yang lalu aku mengalami kematian namun hingga kini rasa perih bekas sakaratul maut itu belum juga hilang dariku

1895692 semoga allah tidak memberimu balasan yang baik engkaulah yang membuat kami terpaksa hadir kami ke tengah tengah perbuatan kejimu dan membuat kami hadir menyaksikan perbuatan burukmu memaksa kami mendengar ucapan ucapan burukmu
1895693 ketika itulah orang yang sekarat itu menatap lesu ke arah kedua malaikat itu
1895694 tak seorangpun diantara kalian yang akan meninggalkan dunia ini kecuali telah diberikan tempat kembalinya dan diperlihatkan padanya tempatnya di surga atau di neraka
1895695 wahai musuh allah itulah rumahmu kelak bersiaplah engkau merasakan siksa neraka
1895696 assalamu alaikum masuklah kamu ke dalam surga itu disebabkan apa yang telah kamu kerjakan
1895697 bergembiaralah wahai sahabat allah itulah rumahmu kelak bergembiralah dalam masa masa menunggumu

1895700 it seems that in western industrial societies like ours we have somehow managed to remove most of the closeness between mother and baby that comes naturally in simpler places weve invented plastic infant seat so that wen babies are moved about they dont have to be carried in the parents arms what a contrast between this and the frequent movements and warm contact when babies are held by slings against their mothers warm bodies if its true as the accumulated evidence seems to suggest that movement and bodily closeness are good for babies especially in the early weeks were been ingenious and consistent in depriving them of these sensations

1895741 irregardless 1 hr 20 min ago 0 0 technically there is such a word its usage is debatable
1895742 it takes an extra beat in there to emphasize the d at the end but its worth it
1895743 usage note although the variant pronunciation f by r is often censured because it doesnt reflect the spelling of the word it is quite common in educated speech and is generally considered acceptable the loss of the first r in this pronunciation can be accounted for by the phonological process known as dissimilation by which similar sounds in a word tend to become less similar in the case of february the loss of the first r is also owing to the influence of january which has only one r

1895766 the projections in the ocs access case indicate that access to the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030 leasing would begin no sooner than 2012 and production would not be expected to start before 2017 because oil prices are determined on the international market however any impact on average wellhead prices is expected to be insignificant
1895767 impacts of increased access to oil and natural gas resources in the lower 48 federal outer continental shelf
1895768 is the law of supply and demand no longer in effect
1895769 the runup in oil futures far outpaced supply and demand it was based on pure emotion and greed
1895770 this article also left out the important fact that todays oil prices are based on speculation when drilling is increased the speculation of future oil output supply foreign dependency improves causing the price to drop alot sooner than 2030
1895771 obviously if you do offshore drilling now its not going to give any short term help on the supply of oil thats far away
1895772 i have a problem linking the drilling to current gas prices for political reasons the reality is there is no correlation between todays prices and what gasoline will be discovered in the outer shelf
1895773 it wont make any difference whatsoever on gas prices because new oil that could be found and produced on the new outer continental shelf wont take place for at least eight to 10 years
1895774 drilling in the gulf starting today is not going to give us any relief this year next year or the year after
1895775 its absurd to argue that ending the moratorium on drilling off parts of the u s coasts would quickly bring down the high price of gasoline
1895776 would starting to drill now do anything for consumers in the near future the answer to this one is probably not since itll take so long for new oil or gas to come to market
1895777 opening off shore drilling would have no impact whatsoever on gas prices today
1895778 heres no problem with ensuring that we dont have supply problems in the future and that we dont have to rely primarily on foreign countries for the supply
1895779 everyone but people who think like me are wrong and evil
1895780 understands more more about economics than most of the politicians in this country
1895781 oops not enough oil there to make drilling worth it but how about over here

1895784 with great apprehension and humility academy award winning actor morgan freeman entered the court room where his wife of twenty four years awaited her chance to denigrate his reputation and take half his stuff with dignity and an air of apology to those poor souls whose job it was to hear the ravings of that mad beast he once called wife morgan freeman walked down a very different aisle from the one that began their odyssey together all those years ago funny how things tend to end where they began he thought

1895799 they benefited to some degree where a couple of their very important models in their second year on the market the es and the rx which together account for over two thirds of lexus sales both improved significantly
1895800 the lower score is largely due to vehicles that are no longer in the marketplace
1895801 the vehicles are still out there so the study is still relevant but obviously they had some problems
1895802 obviously were disappointed not to have been at the top but as a brand we consistently rank high in many many quality studies
1895803 improved quality is good for everybody its good for the consumer they dont have the annoyance of problems they dont have the costs associated
1895804 for the manufacturer its obviously good news because they dont have to pay so much in warranty repairs

1895998 31 it hath been said whosoever shall put away his wife let him give her a writing of divorcement 32 but i say unto you that whosoever shall put away his wife saving for the cause of fornication causeth her to commit adultery and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery
1895999 1 when a man hath taken a wife and married her and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes because he hath found some uncleanness in her then let him write her a bill of divorcement and give it in her hand and send her out of his house 2 and when she is departed out of his house she may go and be another mans wife 3 and if the latter husband hate her and write her a bill of divorcement and giveth it in her hand and sendeth her out of his house or if the latter husband die which took her to be his wife 4 her former husband which sent her away may not take her again to be his wife after that she is defiled for that is abomination before the lord and thou shalt not cause the land to sin which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance
1896000 1 when a man hath taken a wife and married her and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes because he hath found some uncleanness in her then let him write her a bill of divorcement and give it in her hand and send her out of his house
1896001 her former husband who divorced her must not take her back to be his wife after she has been defiled for that is an abomination to the lord
1896002 1 they say if a man put away his wife and she go from him and become another mans shall he return unto her again shall not that land be greatly polluted but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers yet return again to me saith the lord
1896003 1 know ye not brethren for i speak to them that know the law how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth 2 for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husband 3 so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man
1896004 whoever divorces his wife for any reason except sexual immorality causes her to commit adultery
1896005 32 but i say unto you that whosoever shall put away his wife saving for the cause of fornication causeth her to commit adultery and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery
1896006 4 her former husband which sent her away may not take her again to be his wife after that she is defiled for that is abomination before the lord and thou shalt not cause the land to sin which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance
1896007 1 they say if a man put away his wife and she go from him and become another mans shall he return unto her again shall not that land be greatly polluted but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers yet return again to me saith the lord
1896008 the second marriage of a woman who had been divorced is designated by moses a defilement of the woman a moral defilement i e blemishing desecration of the sexual communion which was sanctified by marriage in the same sense in which adultery is called a defilement in lev 18 20 and num 5 13 14
1896009 thus the second marriage of a divorced woman was placed implicit upon a par with adultery and some approach was made towards the teaching of christ concerning marriage mt 5 32
1896010 if the second marriage of a divorced woman was a moral defilement of course the wife could not marry the first again even after the death of her second husband because the defilement of the wife would be thereby repeated and even increased as the moral defilement which the divorced wife acquired through the second marriage was not removed by a divorce from the second husband nor yet by his death
1896011 the treachery of it hath been said whosoever shall put away his wife let him give her a writing of divorcement 32 but i say unto you that whosoever shall put away his wife saving for the cause of fornication causeth her to commit adultery and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery
1896012 13 and this have ye done again covering the altar of the lord with tears with weeping and with crying out insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more or receiveth it with good will at your hand 14 yet ye say wherefore because the lord hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth against whom thou hast dealt treacherously yet is she thy companion and the wife of thy covenant 15 and did not he make one yet had he the residue of the spirit and wherefore one that he might seek a godly seed therefore take heed to your spirit and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth 16 for the lord the god of israel saith that he hateth putting away for one covereth violence with his garment saith the lord of hosts therefore take heed to your spirit that ye deal not treacherously
1896013 14 yet ye say wherefore because the lord hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth against whom thou hast dealt treacherously yet is she thy companion and the wife of thy covenant
1896014 16 for the lord the god of israel saith that he hateth putting away for one covereth violence with his garment saith the lord of hosts therefore take heed to your spirit that ye deal not treacherously

1896048 we do give away significantly more free credit report disclosures than the reports that we charge for
1896049 accordingly congress needs to act to bring the appropriate level of transparency and fairness to credit scoring
1896050 people dont realize that the credit score they are buying isnt the score used by lenders
1896051 at a minimum fundamental fairness dictates that sellers of knock off scores clearly and conspicuously disclose that their scores are not used by lenders and may differ significantly from the ones that are

1896376 this is a very personal decision for sen obama and i have no inside information as to how he is proceeding with this decision
1896377 you know im not running for anything my highest and best use is trying to be a good governor and trying to help sen obama in virginia
1896378 well i would like to think that kind of thing wouldnt hurt his chances
1896379 the market is down small caps have been underperforming and healthcare stocks are struggling

1896385 he believes it was the right thing to do and on the spur of the moment he just went
1896386 i guess the problem im having is i dont think theres too much of anything you do alone
1896387 and even on that day its not that you got a telephone call jumped in your suv and drove across the bridge or the tunnel you go to the phone you made several telephone calls
1896388 you had to call security you had to contact the deputy mayor and executive assistant you had to make arrangements
1896389 you dont do anything without making arrangements and one of those arrangements has to be in relationship to this court
1896390 what matters to me is how the court is perceived
1896391 and if it was not kwame kilpatrick sitting in that seat if it was john six pack sitting in that seat what would i do and there the answer is simple so im going to go back to my original keep it simple anybody else sitting in that chair thats exactly what would happen

1896394 this is the first reduction for more than three years and is in response to easing inflationary pressures and an attempt to prevent further appreciation of the czech koruna
1896395 we believe the cut is mostly a reaction to what the czech national bank cnb perceives as excessive strengthening of the koruna
1896396 despite the outlook for lower inflation we do not see todays cut as a signal that the central bank has initiated an easing cycle
1896397 the outlook for monetary policy will depend largely on whether the cnb has been able to curb the korunas excessive appreciation
1896398 furthermore if the ecb european central bank turns more dovish in the coming months and commodity prices continue to decline then the door might be opened for further rate cuts later in the year
1896399 as another double header weekend theres no doubt that road americas going to be a crucial race meeting

1896405 for many years ive been interested in viewing still life from a landscape perspective forms in still life not only fulfill the objectivity of their own being but they also fulfill the narrative of the environment they occupy from my point of view objects normally perceived as traditional still life form themselves into landscape inanimate objects such as of discarded machines shards of broken glass and transistors take on a landscape characteristic as these bits and pieces become elements of a monumental landscape in these pieces everyday objects assume a sense of mystery that they never had in their original lifetimes from many perspectives these transformed objects reveal more than their individual histories in new combinations they take on second lives its a vivid reminder that even the most familiar things are ephemeral inevitably changing with time

1896410 i mean dont they ask apparently not according to the parker wayne amp kent survey it seems to be all about the permanence of print the fact you can hold it in your hand and turn the page maybe they never heard to the printer

1896679 a panel of six military officers convicted a former driver for osama bin laden of one of two war crimes charges on wednesday but acquitted him of the other completing the first military commission trial here and the first conducted by the united states since the aftermath of world war ii the panel rejected two specifications that would have supported a conviction for conspiracy one asserted that mr hamdan was part of the larger conspiracy with senior qaeda leaders and shared responsibility for terror attacks including the 2001 terror attack the second conspiracy specification rejected by the panel asserted that mr hamdan was part of a conspiracy to kill americans in afghanistan in 2001 with shoulder fired missiles but the panel voted to convict mr hamdan of five of eight specifications that made up the charge of providing material support for terrorism the specifications included accusations that he drove mr bin laden served as his bodyguard was a member of al qaeda and knew its goals

1896681 strikes me as a politically correct term for bigots frankly believing that affirmative action actively influences your economic prospects as a white person is only slightly more logical that believing that gay marriage will somehow affect marriage overall but i suspect that theyre both proxies for folks who have a long history of resenting blacks and gays which stretches way past the advent of affirmative action or gay marriage

1896714 it would be so much easier if one side didnt care so much and would just walk away but the love that we feel for a certain land or a particular set of principles or an understanding of god should not only move us to struggle for what we believe and hold sacred but soften our hearts for people who feel the same way we do even if they have reached different conclusions about to whom that land belongs which set of principles is the one that demands their commitment or which understanding of god is the one to which they give themselves over

1896728 for the most part these social networking sites should be viewed as complementary to your online presence think of it as a nice to have not a must have
1896729 when used properly it is something that can gain your business some attention however you need to realize it shouldnt be seen as a replacement to your traditional online presence
1896730 sites such as linkedin can be helpful in connecting with people you want to meet for one reason or another twitter and facebook can be helpful when youre trying to notify a group of people about something you want to promote or about a happening of some kind
1896731 the viral nature of social networking is quite extraordinary and something that can garner a lot of attention to your efforts in a hurry

1896773 in year three there was still nothing from the bamboo seed but i would not quit in year four again there was nothing from the bamboo seed not quit
1896774 then in the fifth year a tiny sprout emerged from the earth compared to the fern it was seemingly small and insignificant but just 6 months later the bamboo rose to over 100 feet tall it had spent the five years growing roots those roots made it strong and gave i t what it needed to survive i would not give any of my creations a challenge it could not handle
1896775 did you know my child that all this time you have been struggling you have actually been growing roots

1896861 i just hope i can build on it my first five outings it was hard to realize i was pitching in the big leagues today it was more of a feeling that it was just a baseball game it was the first time i felt like that
1896862 we knew with oswalt coming off the disabled list he would be on a limited pitch count

1896884 hes making positive strides every time out were seeing something a little bit different
1896885 we need to get a win here this isnt too fun weve got to pick it up when guys are in scoring position weve got to get a knock or get it done some way because this is a pretty frustrating time

1897393 in view of the lame duck status of prime minister olmert reports of his continued peace negotiations with the pa and syrian government are highly disturbing and grossly inappropriate israel will in the very near future have a new prime minister and very possibly an entirely new government it is inconceivable for the israeli population to have its future determined by the current government and mr olmert whose mind is no doubt fully occupied with defending himself against the numerous investigations of his alleged criminal activities and who may very well agree to wide ranging and dangerous concessions to the pa and syria which are not in israels best interests simply as a parting political ploy to ensure a living legacy
1897394 but getting it right is even more important mr olmert has already announced that he will be resigning as prime minister in the near future neither the pa nor syria wants to reach a deal with mr olmert which would only be countermanded by his successor that would be a disaster for the peace process and for the region as a whole it would be far better and certainly acceptable by the pa and syria to suspend any further peace negotiations at the present time so that they can be continued with appropriate seriousness by mr olmerts successor
1897395 the ever growing number of american citizens who have chosen to move to israel have done so with the reasonable expectation that their future would be determined by a government which has the broad support of the israeli population including holding a public referendum not one headed by a discredited prime minister and other members of his cabinet we urge that all appropriate steps be taken to temporarily suspend the entire negotiation process with the pa and syria until a new israeli government is in place

1897404 change in china will arrive on its own terms and in keeping with its own history and its own traditions
1897405 with this speech bush is trying to address two polar issues easing the controversy created by those who oppose his visit during the games and simultaneously maintaining americas strategy with china
1897406 remember it was not all that long ago they were in the middle of the cultural revolution with people getting put up against a wall and basically knocked off

1897414 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew

1897419 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
1897420 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
1897421 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
1897422 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
1897423 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
1897424 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
1897425 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
1897426 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
1897427 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
1897428 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking

1897434 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
1897435 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
1897436 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
1897437 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done

1897443 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
1897444 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30

1897455 the one supporting simon in wolverhampton cant remember his name was really baaad at warming up the crowd
1897456 i have to admit the support act wasnt particularly good but hey thats what support acts are about theyre the new guys trying their legs to see if they can run
1897457 in fact he can be just a touch too smooth with an approach that veers towards the characterless he does overstretch the gags sometimes especially in a trademark routine about the hamas terrorist group that attempts to get a hell of a lot of mileage out of one simple pun whether the hype about his potential is overplayed may be a moot point
1897458 but i am not pregnant at all how will you get a baby i havent even slept with a man

1897713 we may have a short face off with two sides of an issue
1897714 we believe it is a way of delivering content in a form like younger people are used to getting on the internet
1897715 they pick and choose what they want on their ipods what to tivo and watch whenever they want and so forth
1897716 therefore because we are targeting that niche audience we make story selections to really connect with them and we can do that because we are thinking about them all day
1897717 my sense is that newspapers in their traditional form are not going to be able to recapture this audience
1897718 whats happened over time is that we have become more of a viewing nation than a reading nation and the internet is a little of both my sense is that like it or not the future of news is going to be in the electronic media but we dont really know what that form is going to look like
1897719 you have been awarded a very special vote that can outweight the peoples choice and goes against the very democratic principle of one person one vote are you going to cast that vote wisely or are we going to be watching the elephant dancing in the streets again
1897720 first they ignore you then they ridicule you then they fight you then you win

1897723 preferensi masyarakat indonesia terhadap syariah cukup tinggi sekarang tinggal bagaimana hal ini dapat diwujudkan secara nyata dalam kehidupan bermasyarakat
1897724 kita harus tunjukkan bahwa islam adalah satu satunya jalan bagi penyelesaian seluruh masalah di negeri ini bukan yang katanya nasionalis tapi faktanya menjerumuskan bangsa dan negara ini pada kerusakan
1897725 problemnya terjadi ketika masyarakat sudah tidak percaya lagi pada partai islam masyarakat menganggap partai yang ada tidak dapat membawa aspirasinya sehingga mereka tidak memilih partai partai itu
1897726 adalah fitnah bencana jika sampai tidak ada seorang imam kholifah yang mengatur urusan rakyat

1897733 what i see is a major push globally by the chinese to suppress speech by any athletes anywhere
1897734 revoking my visa probably stands as an example to anyone in
1897735 one thing you cant do is confuse sports and politics
1897736 i think the political guys are going to do what they need to do thats their job
1897737 we are here to concentrate on a gold medal sports and politics just dont match
1897738 for certain when the olympics are over their opinions wont carry so much weight
1897739 at some point i said as great as it is that we have these programs for kids to play you know what would be really great is if their government stopped gunning them down
1897740 let me not say what anyone else should do because that is not my place
1897741 i think for everyone their first goal is to compete as well it should but freedom of speech is implicit in the olympic charter
1897742 people should understand that human rights and peoples lives are in jeopardy
1897743 were not talking about contracts here were not talking about money
1897744 im not a government official or politician ill let them do that
1897745 thats different than coming out here and speaking about it on a daily basis
1897746 if the politicians want to get paid to shoot jump shots then they can come and do that
1897747 if youre a competitor you have to be single minded in what youre doing its not about seeing the city or making political comments although they can say whatever they want
1897748 why would you ask them they are not the experts
1897749 i am talking about usa basketball right now its not about avoiding an issue its about concentrating on one i would hope people would be respectful of that
1897750 one of them making a comment about whats happening in tibet or darfur or two nights ago in shanghai when our players helped raise 430 000 for the earthquake relief program where 70 000 chinese died i think thats a little bit more important
1897751 if they chose to do that i dont have any issue with that
1897752 revoking my visa is just a small incident in a systematic effort anywhere that china has the authority over a country or an athlete to try to shut people up
1897753 right now when we are celebrating this whole peaceful event the reality is the whole world is not together

1897756 particularly during the sars epidemic xinhua has for last few months been putting out news reports embarrassing to the government but they are designed to fool the international community since they are not published in chinese
1897757 despite the fact that ive always spoken positively of the olympic ideal and never called for a boycott or asked an athlete to break an ioc rule my visa was revoked less than 24 hours before my scheduled departure
1897758 the denial of my visa is a part of a systemic effort by the chinese government to coerce and threaten athletes who are speaking out on behalf of the innocent people of darfur
1897759 visa is a sovereign affair of one country according to chinese laws and regulations and based on other host countries practice on previous olympics and other large scale events china has made appropriate arrangements for foreign entry visas during the olympic games

1897769 against settlement factoring the market in tort claims has arrived
1897770 i would love to be in the primary structured settlement business because the growth opportunities are so great
1897771 this post continues the discussion and highlights some of the important issues related to structured settlement market growth
1897772 if structured settlements is a transitional industry what are the most important changes do these changes represent risks or opportunities for growing the structured settlement market
1897773 what and on whose behalf should structured settlement professionals be advocating
1897774 it is not the strongest of the species that survives nor the most intelligent but the one most responsive to change
1897775 if you have always done it that way it is probably wrong
1897776 in times of change learners inherit the earth while the learned find themselves beautifully equipped to deal with a world that no longer exists
1897777 if you dont like change youre going to like irrelevance even less

1897800 the filmclips on the site treat young women as sex objects all delivered through a part owned government communications provider
1897801 any young woman viewing these clips gets the message that all theyre good for is to flaunt their bodies for boys
1897802 the new government should act immediately to remove this and another sexually objectifying material especially from the providers that it part owns
1897803 theyre deliberately sexualising young people in the most worrying way purely for commercial exploitation while this is happening our politicians have got their head in the sand and telstra basically see kids as a resource to be ripped out of the ground

1897814 in two separate rulings that address more than 100 transactions involving transfers of structured settlement payment rights courts in fresno county california have found that factoring companies have repeatedly failed to meet the requirements of the california structured settlement protection act and that the defects according to these courts would render void those prior court approved transfers
1897815 the courts criticized the practices of the factoring companies and their attorneys and indicated that the defects also meant that the factoring companies had violated other california statutes including that states consumer protection statute
1897816 the difference between void and voidable is significant a voidable transaction requires an act by a party to have it declared invalid where a transaction is void however it was never valid a void contract cannot be ratified by later conduct nor can one be estopped to deny its invalidity

1897823 ssi and medicaid do not prohibit the use of either deferred or balloon payments to fund exempt special needs trusts if the annuities comply with irc 130
1897824 the special needs trust should also be funded initially with a lump sum sufficient to provide immediate liquid funds for unexpected costs
1897825 oh this is wonderful even though i dont like it
1897826 i told you everything i was going to get was practical
1897827 the same amount of great information and inspiration you always have plus more time to read sew and experiment with the techniques presented
1897828 thanks for being honest i like the magazine so ill stay
1897829 being so close and not winning is still hard to digest
1897830 not closing the deal its hard not to think about it
1897831 i thought i was motivated before its definitely more now being that close and not being able to do it its just hard the quicker you can get back to win it the better
1897832 the perils of being a martyr trying to please everyone
1897833 you have a real problem with your thyroid i am going to order tests
1897834 nobodys perfect fans have this thing of building mythical gods out of men so maybe they dont see a lot of the mistakes that are being made im not going to say what those mistakes are im just hoping to expose them
1897835 i have a simple task ahead of me and thats all im focusing on and thats all i care about all the other stuff just accumulates over time on its own theres no need to worry about it or think about it or even have a conscious thought about it
1897836 theres excitement because i thrive to fight the best guys out there thats all i want to do thats all ive ever wanted to do so i dont see it as pressure i see it as a great opportunity and im excited for it
1897837 well you know hes been the underdog throughout the beginning of his ufc career and kinda looks forward to that again
1897838 and is actually probably a little hungrier than hes been in his last couple of fights so its actually a positive hes looking forward to the opportunity to test himself
1897839 definitely i mean you know its just natural to have that pressure if i said no then youd know that hes not really ready for this fight hes fighting gsp who basically most people arent giving him much of a chance to do anything against but you know thats the fans speaking not the experts the experts are prepared to make this fight a little closer than the fans are
1897840 i would say jons training is going the best so far since hes been here
1897841 for this one in particular hes better prepared for this fight than for any other fight previous
1897842 the more time invested in the game has improved him tremendously and the fact that its a five round fight has also improved him mentally hes a gamer hes always up for the challenge he knows exactly what he needs to do and he knows how to go about applying himself mentally and physically to get that job done every single one of us is very pleased with his progress very pleased
1897843 so theres a lot of additional training that goes along with a five round fight
1897844 theres also a little bit more focus going back to wrestling again because gsp is probably the best wrestler that ive faced in a while but other than that my training is pretty much the same i have a good system that i train with that ive had a lot of success with
1897845 all i can say is that its gonna be a fast paced fight and try not to have any space and just be in his face
1897846 you know his st pierres last several fights hes only been looking to take the fight to the ground it will be interesting to see whether hes looking to stand or take it to the ground again
1897847 jons preparing to fight him everywhere jons a good wrestler he just got his brazilian jiu jitsu black belt and hes been working hard on his jiu jitsu so it really doesnt matter where the fight takes place hes prepared to fight him everywhere
1897848 so our game plan is to be able to match every area where we need to
1897849 we have to fight this fight based on the fact that were fighting a guy that has skills in every aspect of the game and we have to be able to adjust to everything he does and lets see if he can adjust to us
1897850 and you know what anybody who thinks we dont have a chance at winning this fight or gives any kind of a fair chance of winning then they dont really understand jon fitch and they dont really understand mma and they havent been following jon fitch because jon fitch is 100 percent in this fight and definitely could turn this fight in his favor

1897873 the idea was to take the letter to habbush and have him transcribe it in his own neat handwriting on a piece of iraqi government stationery to make it look legitimate cia would then take the finished product to baghdad and have someone release it to the media
1897874 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from the cia ever involved in any such effort
1897875 the cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaeda connections that went beyond the evidence the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous

1897948 what the public demanded today was concrete evidence instead it was deluged with everything but
1897949 the government released search warrants investigative tools designed to discover evidence not to serve as evidence and treated these warrants as smoking guns the governments press conference was an orchestrated dance of carefully worded statements heaps of innuendo and a staggering lack of real evidence all contorted to create the illusion of guilt by dr ivins
1897950 the government would have the american people believe that after seven years and more than 15 million of taxpayer money they have found the individual responsible for the heinous attacks of the fall of 2001 nothing could be farther from the truth

1897960 the mission of beyond the pale is for us to honor the spirit and power of sound with people that we feel are kindred spirits we want to bring together a diverse group of people who push the envelope are truly original and have that unspeakable fire and inspiration flowing through their art
1897961 in our 23 years of existence we have had very few experiences that felt as right as our initial performance at roadburn in 2007 roadburn is a unique experience in the often disappointing and disingenuous world of music it is a festival organized and run by people with a true passion and dedication to sound in the spirit of this commitment we are proud to announce that the day of april 25 2009 at roadburn will be a rekindling of beyond the pale we will be performing as well as curating the entire days events
1897962 roadburn is very pleased to invite our spiritual brethren from neurosis to host a european version of their beyond the pale festival we couldnt imagine anyone being more attuned to the atmosphere and energy of roadburn than neurosis and offering them the opportunity to stage the first ever beyond the pale outside of the u s is our way of honoring their enormous contributions to underground music as well as their iconic style and sound
1897963 on saturday april 25 neurosis will have complete freedom to invite all the bands and set the lineups for each of the stages over the years neurosis has exhibited an amazing commitment and dedication to the art of underground music something that we at roadburn understand and appreciate completely we are looking forward to the new ideas that they will bring to the festival as we feel they are truly kindred spirits we look forward to uniting at roadburn 2009
1897964 it is a great honor and privilege to have asked to host our own beyond the pale event at roadburn 2009 since playing roadburn 2007 we could think of no better people to work with on this event than the organizers and promoters of roadburn and the wonderful staff at the 013 roadburn is a completely different experience than the traditional music festival it is a small intimate extremely well organized festival put together by people who love the bands and thrive on creating a unique social vibe where the lines between artist audience and staff are often completely blurred
1897965 2009 also marks the 10th anniversary of our own label neurot recordings what an amazing way to mark our first decade as a label i believe that roadburn and neurosis share a clarity of vision that will result in an amazing experience for us all

1897983 orang orang yahudi dan nasrani tidak akan ridha kepada kamu sehingga kamu mengikuti agama millah mereka

1897986 apakah kamu lebih mengetahui ataukah allah dan siapakah yang lebih zalim dari pada orang yang menyembunyikan syahadah dari allah yang ada padanya
1897987 dan sesungguhnya jika kamu mendatangkan kepada orang orang yahudi dan nasrani yang diberi al kitab taurat dan injil semua ayat keterangan mereka tidak akan mengikuti kiblatmu dan kamupun tidak akan mengikuti kiblat mereka dan sebahagian merekapun tidak akan mengikuti kiblat sebahagian yang lain dan sesungguhnya jika kamu mengikuti keinginan mereka setelah datang ilmu kepadamu sesungguhnya kamu kalau begitu termasuk golongan orang orang yang zalim
1897988 ibrahim bukan seorang yahudi dan bukan pula seorang nasrani akan tetapi dia adalah seorang yang lurus lagi berserah diri kepada allah dan sekali kali bukanlah dia termasuk golongan orang orang musyrik
1897989 hai orang orang yang beriman janganlah kamu mengambil orang orang yahudi dan nasrani menjadi pemimpin pemimpin mu sebahagian mereka adalah pemimpin bagi sebahagian yang lain barangsiapa diantara kamu mengambil mereka menjadi pemimpin maka sesungguhnya orang itu termasuk golongan mereka sesungguhnya allah tidak memberi petunjuk kepada orang orang yang zalim

1898106 es un intento de ciertas naciones occidentales de internacionalizar el problema de darfur para sus propios fines pol ticos
1898107 se sirve del ej rcito nacional y milicias armadas para atacar a grupos tnicos de su pa s esos pueblos fueron removidos de sus tierras y enviados al desierto donde est n albergados en campamentos de refugiados donde no hay agua ni comida y las milicias impiden que los grupos humanitarios les acerquen alimentos

1898117 algunas ong que trabajan en darfur hacen grandes negocios inflando el n mero de v ctimas y refugiados para obtener m s fondos de la comunidad internacional estas exageraciones tambi n sirven a los fines de las potencias extranjeras que quieren internacionalizar el problema con el prop sito de dividir a sud n

1898228 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me

1898230 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question

1898248 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really

1898322 i didnt hire rush limbaugh or put him on the air in new york to be a conservative talk show host
1898323 i brought him to be a talk show personality the fact that he was more conservative than liberal was not of interest to me other than the fact that i saw an opening there i realized if i was all liberal all day i was not reaching the vast total audience
1898324 limbaugh is just off the charts talented and after that there was a need for a real conservative and so conservatives rallied around him and liberals rallied to hate him
1898325 he is no longer just the populist mouthpiece he is not someone who takes talking points from the white house or newt gingrich
1898326 he is the center of gravity or at least close to it of conservatives but not the republican party
1898327 does he believe he has talent on loan from god no that was part of the shtick that he did
1898328 the part that he takes very seriously are his convictions about politics or about government or about society i did have people who were sort of pseudo conservatives who last week would have been liberals who would have done anything that you wanted them to do on the air i was convinced when i met limbaugh and his brother that they were the real deal

1898424 en mi comunidad vivir con vih es sin nimo de muerte
1898425 el virus de inmunodeficiencia humana vih causante de la enfermedad entr a mi comunidad hace 10 a os
1898426 primero viv un proceso de negaci n ocult la enfermedad pero luego decid buscar informaci n
1898427 cuando un ind gena cuna empieza a manifestar s ntomas en mi comarca se le llama boni que significa que tiene un esp ritu malo en el cuerpo
1898428 entonces nos dirigimos a los curanderos que nos dicen qu hierbas tomar para fortalecer nuestro sistema inmunol gico pero el vih es mucho m s fuerte m s resistente
1898429 para poder minimizar la presencia del vih hace falta informaci n pero para darle informaci n a comunidades ind genas hay que hacerlo de la mano de nuestras costumbres creencias y propia lengua
1898430 los pa ses que participamos en la pre conferencia nos hemos dado cuenta de que la epidemia ya est ruralizada que ya est en los cuerpos de las personas ind genas por lo que es necesario crear estrategias preventivas con pertinencia cultural
1898431 el principal problema que tienen los ind genas con vih es el acceso a atenci n y tratamiento por la pobreza marginalidad estigma y racismo
1898432 c mo romper las barreras de comunicaci n para el acceso a la informaci n y la prevenci n oportuna c mo hacer que haya un di logo intercultural entre la medicina tradicional y la occidental c mo garantizar que en la decisi n de las pol ticas p blicas en cada pa s haya voz y presencia de los pueblos ind genas
1898433 uno de los grandes retos que tenemos como pueblos ind genas porque hay que ser autocr ticos es el tema de los usos y costumbres es un tema que evidentemente vulnera en mayor forma a las mujeres
1898434 los ind genas decimos que afuera de nuestras comunidades nos discriminan pero hacia adentro no queremos reconocer la diversidad sexual las pr cticas homoer ticas por ejemplo
1898435 nuestro objetivo es construir una estrategia latinoamericana para crear indicadores epidemiol gicos que nos permitan saber cu ntos ind genas viven con el vih y hacer un mapeo de la respuesta espont nea que est surgiendo en las comunidades
1898436 vamos a crear un secretariado internacional de los pueblos ind genas
1898437 se tienen que hacer esfuerzos importantes para determinar cu l es la intensidad de la epidemia en las comunidades ind genas y afrodescendientes
1898438 para hacer esta abogac a esta defensa de los ind genas con vih debemos tener datos faltan datos concretos de prevalencia proporci n de la poblaci n con la enfermedad particularmente en la poblaci n ind gena
1898439 en los afrodescendientes hay m s informaci n particularmente en el norte de am rica central
1898440 la comunidad gar funa que vive en la costa de belice guatemala y honduras y que emigr hace m s de 200 desde las antillas menores ten a en 1998 una prevalencia promedio de vih de ocho por ciento muy alta para lo que es la regi n
1898441 es halag e o que se haya reducido un poco pero todav a no significa una reducci n importante
1898442 creemos que deben dise arse programas adecuados para las comunidades ind genas y afrodescendientes deben ser respuestas culturalmente adecuadas que integren a los curanderos por ejemplo
1898443 me compromet a elevar y visibilizar la pandemia en estas comunidades ya he comenzado a hablar con mis colegas del equipo regional de am rica latina de naciones unidas para ver de qu manera podemos identificar las avenidas que puedan fortalecer la informaci n disponible y las acciones de prevenci n que correspondan

1898451 cuando estoy pasando penurias no me preocupo porque se que dios esta luchando junto a mi contra el problema me preocupo cuando no tengo ning n problema porque lo que viene encima no se si lo voy a poder atacar por mi propia cuenta o si me dar tiempo de poder acordarme que dios no me abandona y que luchar por mi

1898463 heh now that im blogrolled on libertarian leanings ill really get the traffic
1898464 the americans talk about the warrior ethic and that peacekeeping is for wimps
1898465 maliki and the americans felt the british were morally impugned by the deal they had reached with the militia the british were accused of trying to find the line of least resistance in dealing with the shia militia
1898466 you can accuse the americans of many things such as hamfistedness but you cant accuse them of not addressing a situation when it arises while we had a strategy of evasion the americans just went in and addressed the problem
1898467 the bars and the floor are my two strongest events so im going to concentrate on them

1898481 desertification is potentially the most threatening ecosystem change impacting livelihoods of the poor
1898482 there is a whole campaign that will be going on throughout the olympics
1898483 we were treated very even handedly we were questioned but the police were kind to us we were treated fine
1898484 we were taken immediately to a police station and questioned one of the reasons that we were there was that tibetans couldnt be there in our place
1898485 they were refused visas and if anyone in tibet dared to protest they would certainly be treated much more harshly and would face torture and imprisonment

1898489 i no doubt deserved my enemies but i dont believe i deserved my friends
1898490 when friends stop being frank and useful to each other the whole world loses some of its radiance
1898491 this communicating of a mans self to his friend works two contrary effects for it redoubleth joy and cutteth griefs in half
1898492 life is partly what we make it and partly what is made by the friends whom we choose
1898493 there is no hope of joy except in human relations
1898494 the making of friends who are real friends is the best token we have of a mans success in life
1898495 except in cases of necessity which are rare leave your friend to learn unpleasant things from his enemies they are ready enough to tell them
1898496 the most i can do for my friend is simply to be his friend i have no wealth to bestow on him if he knows that i am happy in loving him he will want no other reward is not friendship divine in this
1898497 friendship that flows from the heart cannot be frozen by adversity as the water that flows from the spring cannogt congeal in winter
1898498 friendship without self interest is one of the rare and beautiful things in life

1898500 reload in 5 in my configuration in case i got locked out in the middle of my configuration but i had not issued a
1898501 before i sleep and after i wake up and all the hours in between you occupy my mind so practically every moment of the day you are in my thoughts i miss you
1898502 to me you are my rose every day when i see a beatiful rose i think of you and miss you and hope to hold you in my arms
1898503 if every drop of rain was a thought of you id have every storming cloud in the the world inside my head and id still miss you
1898504 when i miss you sometimes i listen to music or look at pictures of you not to remind me of you but to make me feel as if im with you it makes me forget the distance and capture you
1898505 missing someone is your hearts way of reminding you that you love them
1898506 it took a while to understand what love is but itll take forever to forget what it was like
1898507 missing you is like being lost in a black and white world everything seems so faded and lonely everything beautiful in the world is pointless without you
1898508 life had changed as i knew it and now its changed again love see i dont worry about you remembering me its that girl on the road you keep forgetting my business is to create it doesnt even matter what you do you told me that remember so go home go find it find that thing makes you like no one else ill help look for the sign
1898509 sebetulnya saya masih mempertimbangkan kebijakan aspirasi warga yang menolak dan warga lainnya yang mendukung keberadaan perusahaan pt tirta red itu agar satu sama lain tidak ada yang merasa dirugikan yang berakhir pada konflik horisontal
1898510 tetapi karena masyarakat padarincang terus mendesak saya untuk mencabut seluruh izin yang sudah dikeluarkan pencabutan itu akan saya lakukan
1898511 pencabutan izin investor tidak bisa dilakukan tanpa ada rekomendasi dari dprd karena itu kami akan melakukan pembahasan dulu untuk langkah penerbitan rekomendasi itu
1898512 beberapa masyarakat padarincang akan melakukan aksi unjuk rasa menyambut bupati serang saat menghadiri acara pengajian
1898513 tadinya kami akan melakukan aksi unjuk rasa besar besaran ke pemkab serang tapi karena bupati memberikan keputusan sesuai dengan keinginan kami niatan itu kami urungkan
1898514 jika bupati meminta dukungan dprd untuk mencabut izin pt tirta kami akan berikan rekomendasi itu selama dua yang lebih dulu melakukan eksploitasi air di padarincang juga dicabut
1898515 kalau memang masyarakat tidak ingin ada eksploitasi air di sana padarincang red semua perusahaan air yang ada di situ izinnya harus dicabut kalau tidak ada apa dengan pt tirta mengapa warga bersikukuh ingin izin pt tirta dicabut sementara yang lainnya tidak ini menjadi pertanyaan besar
1898516 kalau dicabut justru akan menjadi masalah lantaran berbenturan dengan aturan hukum

1898519 johnson was a man who certainly had to talk he was very garrulous in a sense and he also very self protective he always would say now you know thats off the record at the same time you also knew what he wanted you to write what you were seeing and hearing but not attribute it to him so we played the game
1898520 once you lie your credibility is shot and i really think if you lie too many times then its all over i believe the people have a right to know almost everything
1898521 gerald ford was gentle very kind his great aspiration was to be speaker of the house he never really aspired to be president but lightening struck he turned out to be a good president because he really restored confidence in the oval office and a sense of security in the country after the watergate scandal
1898522 jimmy carter is a very spiritual man i think he almost missed his calling he would have been a great minister i think his greatest contribution to the country is that he made human rights a centerpiece of his foreign policy
1898523 his advisors taught him to say this is not a press conference
1898524 i think at the tale end both he and mrs bush began to really think that we were the cause of all their troubles so the press was not liked at all
1898525 president clinton didnt understand that he was being denied his legitimacy as president by the ultra right in this country who never gave him one second one moment where he could prevail they were after him constantly investigating him constantly i dont understand how he possibly couldve taken what he took he was asked so many personal questions that ive never no president has ever been subjected to that kind of tyranny
1898526 who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the

1898560 i will definitely be watching the olympics im a huge fan of athletes who have dedicated their lives to being the best the dedication and commitment they put into their careers putting everything else aside to go for that ambition is something i really respect and can learn from i love watching the 100 metres and the javelin the 100 metres is always special you get to see the fastest men on the planet race each other they are incredibly quick ive tried it myself and even out of the blocks those guys would have 10 metres before id even got up i am so slow but you can see the power they have in the whole of their body getting all that energy out in less than 10 seconds is just awesome
1898561 for me the discipline wouldnt be of major importance its just about being a part of this fantastic event
1898562 i will be following all the sports where we have some good spanish contenders i think in tennis we have nadal in cycling we have some strong guys there as well no athletics because we are not very strong there
1898563 im supporting finland of course i really like athletics ive just watched the recent athletics grand prix in monte carlo for me the biggest highlight of that event was when yelena isinbayeve from russia broke the womens pole vault world record she must be a favourite for the gold medal in china for us finns there are a couple of strong medal hopefuls tero jarvenpaa in the mens javelin has a real chance of a gold in the olympics that would be great for our country
1898564 the number one event is the 100 metre sprint which is always spectacular im also interested in a lot of the other running events like the 200 metres 400 metres etc i was definitely a long distance runner i was not really a sprinter as i wasnt that fast but long distance i beat everything
1898565 im a sportsman and i love any kind of sport so i will definitely be watching the olympics its been a great year for spanish sport and sportsmen we won euro 2008 the tour de france and the wimbledon mens final so i hope we do well in the olympics spain has a particularly strong chance in the basketball ill be paying special attention to that and the tennis also i love watching the marathon just because i find it extraordinary what those guys go through ill also be watching the cycling i do a lot of cycling and i know we have a strong cycle team
1898566 i would say football and baseball are my favourite sports to watch
1898567 anything really as i like to watch sport baseball is very big in japan and it will be the last time its included as an olympic sport so itll be the last chance for the japanese team to get a good result i think japan will do well in maybe swimming judo and maybe gymnastics as well
1898568 no but im going to if you dont shut up
1898569 sorry im just mad at myself and youre kind of prodding at it

1898573 looked concerned but i didnt care my veins itched i needed my fix this time i needed the good stuff i needed the relief jackie used to dish out so coldly and relentlessly i remained in silence the rest of the ride gazing out from the darkness of s car into the sunny fall weather outside and something about the rays of sun breaking through the orange and yellow of the trees made me think of my brother as we drove up the winding road that led up to s grandparents cabin i extinguished the two cigarettes on my forearm and breathed in the foul stench of burning flesh looked up at me her eyes seemed like they were glazed over with some kind of dark film that fogged her gentle beauty sharon to the cabin as she carried the luggage milo honey youre acting funny again

1898638 join to knit in the round being careful not to twist
1898639 we paved our path ourselves as we went along learning the rules of the industry with every new turn it took about three months to create our first issue which was released in october 2001 those three months consisted of collating advertising as well as tracking down relevant content and suitable interviews
1898640 however as we progressed more of our personalities started to infiltrate the pages and it became apparent that if we wrote about more of the things that we were interested in other people would be too it was always intended to be the antithesis of those music magazines that exist too far up their own rear ends and whose opinions are formed from visions of grandeur we strived to be fair in the views we put across and to not to take ourselves too seriously
1898641 iain carnegie is our design stalwart and resident extreme sports mentalist responsible for the magazines cohesive and superlative layout jon paul kitching is not only our resident fashion guru and part time model he also has a hand in both advertising and marketing john orourke handles all the marketing and business development brian murnin heads our advertising division his passion for music means hes always contributing editorial suggestions and im the editor music geek controlling and sourcing the majority of the music content however we cant all be everywhere at once so we have a bank of freelancers around the country who write for us
1898642 as much as we had grown accustomed to our identity we realised the name would have to change it was a brave marketing decision to start again and remain fresh our new guise clash magazine will also see a change in size keeping our square format we are enlarging from 210mm x 210mm to 250mm x 250mm allowing us more space to play with there will be a change in design too an opportunity we gratefully embraced the content within the pages will be relatively unchanged just a few wee surprises up our sleeves
1898643 to sit alongside the big boys on the news stands of the world bands to clamour over each other to grace our covers the worlds biggest stars and their exclusive interviews passionate magazine buyers and music fans uttering our name in the same breath as our competition clash sponsored music events gigs festivals and parties the list is endless our options infinite
1898644 personally were i to die tomorrow i would be happy in the knowledge that working for vibe has offered me the opportunity to meet my heroes the red hot chili peppers as well as legends including the white stripes rem and robert plant bumping into supermodel helena christensen at her party was also an unforgettable moment for john jon paul and myself professionally i suppose the highlight so far would be the transition from a free scottish magazine to being a paid for uk publication the wider distribution instantly meant a greater awareness of the brand and suddenly brought interest from every corner of the country not to mention the globe however the success of our work is still on an upward trajectory so every day brings a new climax similarly there has never been a real low point sure there have been disappointments but what doesnt kill you makes you stronger
1898645 you have to have a passion for what you write about you must live breathe eat and drink that passion most of all be prepared for long hours and late nights to ensure that passion is presented exactly how you want it i get a lot of emails from people who want to contribute to the magazine we read all the emails along with the attached samples of work and those that impress us most go on to write articles so if you want to be a journalist litter some poor editor with emails about how much you love their publication how much you want to write for them and how great you really are ensure your attached work is what you think is your best and let your writing do the talking
1898646 the teaching methods did not suit me i prefer the personal touch and to be honest sitting in a class of five hundred people and then sitting in a library reading for hours on end didnt really give me that
1898647 there were only 27 people in my class in first year at the rsamd and everyone knew everyones names i found that a lot more satisfying everyone should study what they want to study and in a way that suits them
1898648 a strong sometimes fiery friendship that manifested itself after we worked together on projects but it wasnt until we worked on shows like the local boy in the photograph a two hander dealing with celebrity suicide and its effect on our culture in which we were the only performers that we realised we had something special we had a certain chemistry when we performed with each other that we enjoyed but also that the audience got a great deal of enjoyment out of watching and experiencing
1898649 a small but significant amount of funding from the cowgate arts trust it was this funding that made the idea of forming a theatre company a possibility instead of just a dream
1898650 most of the experience we had in theatre was that of it being laid out on a plate in front of us for the taking especially during our time at the rsamd i think at first we were quite na ve in that we thought we would just hire a theatre space and put on a show and it would be a resounding success
1898651 after one batch of unsuccessful applications which consisted of not much more than a covering letter we had a long hard think about what it was we wanted as a company and then very much reassessed our game plan this led to a much more professional approach in which we were very much trying to sell ourselves to the theatres that we contacted we were trying to tell them that we had something worthwhile for them to invest in rather than thinking that they had something we wanted to invest in
1898652 we were very lucky with the support that the arches theatre and in particular their programmer jean cameron were able to give us if it hadnt been for the arches we may not be where we are now it has certainly been through people like jean and forbes leslie from the cowgate arts trust that we were able to start up hypertension theatre and hopefully take it from strength to strength
1898653 we do not begin actually directing until very close to the performance it is by devising performance that our work is created we go through a process in which we research discuss and create by what ever means we find and in this way we create the material that ends up making up the content of the show
1898654 they are internationally renowned and recognised as being one of the best companies that do what they do which is make theatre and live art if we are as successful as they are in ten years then i would be extremely happy actually scrap that if we are still going in ten years at all then i would be extremely happy because that would be an achievement
1898655 you sometimes get a sense when a show is dead or needs to be put to rest but i dont feel that at all with this show
1898656 in a twisted way its been a blessing in disguise ive been playing george for a very long time
1898657 very personal about rosie or about the right of homosexuality to be shown on stage it has been a rollercoaster up down up down
1898658 rosie has been wonderful she did no more than anyone would who had invested 10m into a show
1898659 it has taken another direction become more realistic and taken out the heterosexual romance the mum the dad it deals more about questions of fame and mortality in fact i think the message is clearer in this version
1898660 things can go as quickly as they come on february 9 im out of work one minute flavour of the month next back to being a starving out of work actor
1898661 it was my dream as a kid i was in every school play as well as falkirk childrens theatre which did the televised panto on stv i always had an outlet
1898662 once i got there everything changed i had wanted to be a singer to do musical theatre but i realised i knew very little about the craft of acting so i pulled out of musical theatre i learnt so much about myself there
1898663 people still think im him even without the wig and make up i get people coming up to me and calling me george one woman came up to say shed given birth to my music and i tried to tell her that i was only five when she was giving birth
1898664 george is such an icon and i look like george so when it came to convincing the audience most of the work was already done ultimately i thought i had the easier role in the piece
1898665 taboo should have made more of a difference than it has i think once its gone theyll realise what theyre missing
1898666 taboo has changed my life allowed me to do things that i could have never done afforded me so many opportunities i owe a huge debt of gratitude to boy george i have been very lucky my life will never be the same again
1898667 would always feel like it needed something else i mostly use leather as a means of adding colour and an interesting textile element either using it as a flat background to a pierced out silver piece or using it scrunched up for a more three dimensional form
1898668 im hoping that through exhibitions such as chelsea crafts fair i can build up a client base so that my jewellery making will subsidise itself and become a regular income which is actually quite difficult to achieve ive just completed a years residency in the jewellery department at eca and im looking to apply for a setting up grant in the near future which will help me to buy my own tools and equipment
1898669 there are a lot of jewellery designer makers out there all trying to achieve the same thing many graduates dont continue with their own work but design for a company or do something completely different but im determined to persevere
1898670 in some ways it feels like its not something i chose it just happened i always loved art at school and wanted to go to art college but without any real idea of what i wanted to specialise in or what i would do as a career
1898671 one of the best in the country mainly thanks to the course leader dorothy hogg you get a real opportunity to experiment and develop your own ideas and style its very hard work as youre really pushed to achieve good results but its definitely worth it
1898672 most of the exhibitions ive been involved in have come as a direct result of galleries seeing my work at the degree show last year and then the new designers exhibition in london in july gallery owners always come to the graduate shows to spot new talent and ive been lucky enough to receive many offers to exhibit my work in some high profile galleries including the crafts council in london and the scottish gallery in edinburgh taking part in these exhibitions is essential to my career as its the main way that people see and buy my jewellery my current exhibitions from the first half of the year are all finishing around about now so my next major show will be at chelsea crafts fair in october where i will be sharing a stand with another eca jeweller grace girvan to take part in chelsea is a big step in my career as many top jewellers from the uk and abroad exhibit there are always thousands of visitors each year so im hoping that it will be really successful for me
1898673 batches or limited editions under my own brand name in exclusive stores and outlets
1898674 an excellent opportunity to bring a young persons perspective to the forefront of decision making
1898675 posts are regularly advertised in the papers on the radio or on job seeker websites just put yourself forward we cant complain that no one listens to young people if none of us are prepared to speak up in the first place
1898676 as well as learning it presentation and communication skills i learned to chair meetings and manage projects while gaining the confidence to speak up for issues concerning young people
1898677 it was fantastic to work on the people were excellent and taught me so much the highlands is a fantastic place to live and has a really vibrant arts sector there is so much going on thanks to really committed people
1898678 will bring a range of people to the highlands and improve arts in the in the region for all highlanders
1898679 people are usually a little taken aback as my age generally comes out after theyve been speaking to me i guess its difficult for them to understand why a 19 year old student would want to give up their free time to work for something they dont get paid for but i would certainly hope that once they get over this and hear what i have to contribute in meetings it no longer matters how old i am
1898680 seeing the difference that attending one arts event can make on a person
1898681 first time was to live with a girl i fell in love with didnt last and the second time for the ben neill tour
1898682 my strangest nyc story was when me and my pal rob a fellow singer went to a bar way down towards where the twin towers once were id heard it was a cool after hours club where rock and roll stars hang out
1898683 i have no idea thats nyc for ya but i love the place ive never had the visa job or money to stay there long enough so far well see what the future brings but i like to think im not done yet
1898684 the other three members came along when stuart and i realised the scope of our songs needed a full band sound things sound pretty epic nowadays so im glad we got the others in the band dave on drums julian on guitars and keyboards alix on bass
1898685 we chose the name for the new project for no particular reason other than the early music we wrote had a slightly american feel to it and the name just popped into my head of course there are connotations with the horror movie but once wed got over our initial doubts we all felt the name was memorable first and foremost
1898686 the gigs have gone really well its been three years since geneva broke up and i have been champing at the bit to play live weve come a long way very quickly in terms of our sound and our confidence and songwriting were very optimistic about the future compared with geneva amityville rocks out more my starsign is virgo with scorpio rising if geneva were virgo amityville are scorpio rising theres more abandon and less self consciousness at least on my behalf
1898687 theyre mostly flattering unless you count the reviewer who described my voice as minnie mouse on helium i mean mickey maybe
1898688 its always great to write songs no matter who with so long as theres a creative bond an understanding and a respect for each others ideas weve mostly played in london so far but touring is always a blast i was lucky enough to sing in a side project with a new york based dance music dj composer called ben neill last year we toured the us and canada and it was exhilarating im obsessed with travel and new experiences so to combine this with singing was unbelievable fun now for amityville bring it on i want more
1898689 i wish when geneva had signed our publishing and record deals wed taken more time to make sure we knew what it all meant had held out for more financial support in particular i wish wed not signed our publishing to the record companys sister label a classic mistake as they were able to mess about with our money but then we didnt even have a manager so that should have been sorted before then too we were very naive also bands have to stick together as the music biz is a pretty rum do all told
1898690 amityville want to get signed and beautifully pollute your mind we have a lot of music in us and we want as many people to hear it as possible please thank you
1898691 after reviewing the facts it was clear this request did not meet the criteria in the law

1898705 i have never supported the brutal expulsion of all palestinians i have said repeatedly that the expulsion of the palestinians is immoral and impracticable
1898706 under some circumstances expulsion is not a war crime i dont think that the expulsions of 1948 of nearly a million palestinians were war crimes you cant make an omelet without breaking eggs you have to dirty your hands moreover if he israeli prime minister ben gurion was already engaged in expulsion maybe he should have done a complete job i know that this stuns the arabs and the liberals and the politically correct types but my feeling is that this place would be quieter and know less suffering if the matter had been resolved once and for all if ben gurion had carried out a large expulsion and cleaned the whole country the whole land of israel as far as the jordan river it may yet turn out that this was his fatal mistake if he carried out a full expulsion rather than a partial one he would have stabilized the state of israel for generations
1898707 i am completely unaware that zionism ever aimed to rule the middle east zionism simply wanted to establish and maintain a miniscule jewish state in the land of israel palestine the patrimony of the jews conquered by savage muslim arab invaders

1899038 the internet has stopped people from going out and being with each other creating stuff people sit at home and make their own records which is sometimes ok but doesnt bode well for long term artistic vision
1899039 were talking about things that are going to change the world and change the way people listen to music and thats not going to happen with people blogging on the internet
1899040 i mean get out there and communicate lets get out in the streets and march and protest instead of sitting at home and blogging
1899041 i do think it would be an incredible experiment to shut down the whole internet for five years and see what sort of art is produced over that span
1899042 im sure as far as music goes it would be much more interesting than it is today

1899044 and here was a really horrible murder dumped on our doorstep
1899045 our mother died in a car accident when i was seven and danny was six
1899046 we were all just sort of farmed out after that going from relative to relative our upbringing was pretty rough
1899047 but the people we lived with moved the next day danny and i were both homeless then the last time i saw danny he was getting on a bus
1899048 he did most of the work on his own time
1899049 even after he transferred to the academy he kept at it it was kind of like a puzzle he couldnt stop worrying with
1899050 sex is better than weed if you have the right pusher
1899051 it appears that the manner in which he was tied the ropes around his neck connected to the ropes binding his hands and feet were designed to kill him
1899052 as he struggled it basically constricted on him and caused his death
1899053 i assume they sent the fingerprints out but they were never connected to anyone
1899054 but after those three it ended either the killer died or went to prison
1899055 i kind of thought from the beginning that the chances of me finding the party responsible was going to be limited
1899056 then i found out how he died and it became both relief and sadness i cant get the way he was tied up out of my mind the lonely way he died
1899057 i felt like i had gotten to know him during the time i was trying to identify him
1899058 it was moving to see him finally returned to them it was like sending him home
1899059 your pretty cool i think we can hang i choose you to build my life with
1899060 no matter how much your shit stinks i am here
1899061 at least my life was happy because i choose to see it that way
1899062 i love you baby i am so happy with you you mean everything to me
1899063 i didnt see the sincerity because i wasn t feeling loving toward him at the time i rejected his love though it was that love i wanted to get pretty twisted huh

1899071 here lies the american two party political system it died in the heat of battle from abuse closed mindedness and a bitterness that could not be negotiated with and a stubbornness that could not and would not compromise it had few friends many enemies and is not missed by most there were no survivors

1899075 choose a trouser made of a fine quality fabric that doesnt wrinkle
1899076 the hem should cover the back of the shoe with a full break in front the same rule applies to the suit pant when seated the leg must never show if the hem is too short the top of the sock and calf will be inappropriately visible

1899085 is this romantic dinner a prelude to sex or is this the great long term sex is the key then you can allude to sexual messages all throughout the meal subtle but suggestive if the long term match is in mind stay away from any sexual suggestion innuendo and jokes

1899091 this encounter provides a rite of passage for youths who can thereby discover their deeper purpose their meaning because in that great encounter with death and rebirth they are able to engage and experience directly in their bodies in their souls the powerful archetypal forces that permeate life and nature and every human being
1899092 humankind has entered into the most critical stages of a death rebirth mystery
1899093 it is a collective dark night of the soul a deep separation from the community of being from the cosmos itself we are undergoing this rite of passage with virtually no guidance from wise elders because the wise elders are caught up in the same crisis this initiation is too epochal for such confident guidance too global too unprecedented too all encompassing it is larger than all of us

1899117 friends are the kind of people that bring out the best in you
1899118 people are now getting out of their car lease early by finding someone else to take it over via the internet
1899119 the concept is simple if you lease a car for 48 months and want out in the middle of the lease you simply post your vehicle online and get matched up with someone shopping for a short term car lease
1899120 buyers get great deals because leased cars are generally kept in great condition the monthly price is lower than a purchased car and you only have to commit to the remaining portion of the lease its very common for people to find a 10 month mercedes lease for 350 a month for example
1899121 people love this form of car shopping because you certainly get more car for your money and in most cases the manufacturers warranty is still covered on the car
1899122 just make sure you check out what several area dealers are willing to sell the car for dont accept the first deal
1899123 if the dealer wont budge make sure to leave your contact information and walk out the door
1899124 most likely the dealer will be calling you later with better offers

1899153 it was kind of funny but kind of rude at the same time
1899154 ours was only a few pages and most people can make it out who the people are
1899155 certain things about it are funny but its kind of messed up

1899157 well call whatever we do however ineffective it is building relationships
1899158 that requires users patients t o consent before specific data can be released must be independent of all who hold the data o therwise you have the fox in charge of the henhouse
1899159 t he practice also illustrates how electronic data gathered for one purpose can be used and marketed for another often without consumers knowledge privacy advocates say and they argue that although consumers sign consent forms they effectively have to authorize the data release if they want insurance
1899160 as health care moves into the digital age there are more and more companies holding vast amounts of patients health information
1899161 most people dont even know these organizations exist unfortunately the federal health privacy rule does not cover many of them the lack of transparency with how all of this works is disturbing
1899162 f or instance if medpoint produces a report that an individual has been on the highest dose of the cholesterol reducing drug zocor for 18 monts sic the insurer would be able to know that you have a very high near intractable cholesterol problem
1899163 some health experts worry that insurance companies can make faulty assumptions by looking at prescription drug records because many drugs have multiple uses i had a patient on amitriptyline for migraines and they were denied life insurance because its also an antidepressant
1899164 ingenix and milliman officials stress that they provide data only with the patients consent as required by the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa a 1996 law that governs personal health records information but hipaa does not give the department of health and human services the ability to directly investigate or hold accountable entities such as pharmacy benefit managers or companies such as ingenix and milliman who are not covered by hipaa
1899165 in february the federal trade commission issued an order saying that medpoint and intelliscript are consumer reports under the fair credit reporting act so the companies must notify insurers that consumers denied insurance on the basis of these reports have the right to request a copy of the report and that errors be corrected the ftcs order followed a settlement of allegations that the companies violated the credit reporting law by failing to provide such notice to insurers
1899166 bob gellman an independent privacy consultant in washington said the ftcs decision not to fine the companies sends the message that it is okay to ignore the law
1899167 a health privacy proposal pending in congress would expand federal officials ability to regulate such downstream organizations audit their activities and impose civil fines the bill also includes a prohibition on the sale of electronic medical records
1899168 tim sparapani senior legislative counsel at the american civil liberties union said that the products that ingenix and milliman are marketing represent the commodification of electronic medical records by third parties weve got to stop these practices before the marketplace is fully developed and patients lose all control over their medical information he said

1899180 interactivity has at least two aspects one is broadly interpersonal for instance in that the user can write back to the producer of a text with no difficulty a potential achievable only with very great effort or not at all with the older media and it permits the use to enter into an entirely new relation with all other texts the notion of hypertextuality the one has an effect on social power directly the other has an effect on semiotic power and through that on social power less immediately
1899181 writing which is tied still to sound via the alphabet is different to writing which is not lined to sound as in those writing systems which use characters and are oriented much more to representing concepts through conventionalized images rather than through sounds transcribed imperfectly in letters
1899182 the book will have something to say about the stuff of writing its materiality and its relation to the stuff of speech this is a necessary step at the time when there threatens a new separation of the human body and technology
1899183 writing is undergoing changes of a profound kind in grammar and syntax particularly at the level of the sentence and at the level of the text message writing now plays one part in communicational ensembles and no longer the part where before all information was conveyed in writing now there is a decision to be made which information for this audience is best conveyed in image and which in writing

1899185 i think i first started doing this around 40 years ago and i learned a lot of new things this offseason so there are plenty of things that you certainly can be exposed to in your developmental process but theres also just a certain amount of things that you learn from on the job training and the more times you go around the block the more things you pick up

1899193 the more americans get used to barack obama the less they want him as president and the more democrats will soon regret not nominating hillary clinton
1899194 it could be true that donations were made but as a part of a deliberate set up to make obama look bad aaron klein reports from the israel for wnd again obviously if an actual illegal donation was actually made it should be returned but it would be interesting to find out who really made it and why

1899197 triclosan has been linked to cancer in lab animals has been targeted for removal from some stores in europe for its health and environmental risks and the american medical association recommends against its use in the home it is also linked to liver and inhalation toxicity and low levels of triclosan may disrupt the thyroid hormone system thyroid hormones are essential to proper growth and development particularly for brain growth in utero and during infancy triclosan breaks down into very toxic chemicals including a form of dioxin methyl triclosan which is acutely toxic to aquatic life and chloroform a carcinogen formed when triclosan mixes with tap water that has been treated with chlorine scientists surveyed 85 u s rivers and streams and found traces of triclosan in more than half
1899198 its clear that nothing was proved and you just dont send people to die without absolutes its very clear this president wanted to go to war
1899199 the april summit meeting was probably the last hurrah for the spp
1899200 the strategy of acting on technical issues in an incremental bureaucratic way and keeping the issues away from public view has generated more suspicion than accomplishments
1899201 from the right have come attacks based on cultural anxieties of being overrun by mexican immigrants and fears that cooperation with canada and mexico could lead down a slippery slope toward a north american union
1899202 from the left came attacks based on economic fears of jobs lost due to unfair trading practices
1899203 these two sets of fears came together in a perfect storm that was pushed forward by a surplus of hot air from talk show hosts on radio and television
1899204 in the face of this criticism the bush administration was silent and the democratic candidates competed for votes in the rust belt states where unions and many working people have come to see nafta and globalization much as commentator lou dobbs does
1899205 dobbs among others viewed a report by a 2005 council on foreign relations task force which i chaired building a north american community as the manifesto of a conspiracy to subvert american sovereignty
1899206 dobbs claimed that the cfr study proposed a north american union although it did not
1899207 i do not propose a north american union i propose a north american community
1899208 three sovereign governments that seek to strengthen bonds of cooperation
1899209 i dont think a political union of north america is an inherently bad idea nor do i think it is a good idea for right now
1899210 the three heads of state must also commit to building a new consciousness a new way of thinking about ones neighbors and about the continental agenda

1899214 contract that creates an additional paid holiday eid al fitr a muslim holiday that occurs toward the end of ramadan
1899215 union leadership did request and receive eid al fitr which is apparently spelled various ways including id al fitr and eid ul fitr as a paid holiday in place of labor day
1899216 since all team members will still have eight paid holidays the change will not affect production
1899217 if this holiday is that important to them make them take it off instead of christmas day and allow all workers to be off labor day most american families have some type of function on labor day
1899218 it says union leadership made this request makes you wonder who runs the union i guess they are already working on a plan to replace memorial day that means nothing to the muslims so why should we have the right to celebrate it labor day commemorates the plight of workers and the struggle of labor unions to improve working conditions for american workers the muslims will not stop until all of our rights and laws are changed to accommodate their beliefs this will be a new america but it will be their america
1899219 diversity is one of the strengths of our union we may come from different countries and speak different languages but what unites us is the belief that by standing together we can better advance our interests
1899220 the negotiating committee felt this was extremely crucial since this holiday is as important to muslims as christmas is to christians
1899221 two prayer rooms have been created to allow muslim workers to pray twice a day and return to work without leaving the plant
1899222 this is america founded by the blood of our forefathers and should not be challenged by somalians hispanics or any other immigrants if they come to america they need to learn our language and our ways they can practice their culture in private if they so please but not shove it down our throats would they let us go there and change there country i have banned tysons products from my home for years because of the illegals they were hiring i am sorry for the producers that are supplying them but tysons has once again crossed the line with the american people labor day was here long before tysons what holiday will be next to be taken away and replaced to accommodate an immigrant this stinks worse than the plant
1899223 disgusting appalling horrifying there just arent enough words to describe this situation there will never be another tyson product in my home ever bedford county and the rest of the nation needs to take notice is this what we are coming to

1899243 i think we could have avoided at least some of this if we had agreed to do the town hall meetings
1899244 is part of the politics of the past that we have to move beyond
1899245 the second vatican council presented the basic elements of the catholic faith in a more understandable pastoral language without changing the teachings of the church
1899246 in various discussions before the council actually convened pope john xxiii invited other christian churches to send observers to the council acceptances came from both protestant and orthodox churches
1899247 the sole church of christ which in the creed we profess to be one holy catholic and apostolic the pillar and mainstay of the truth
1899248 the document immediately adds nevertheless many elements of sanctification and of truth are found outside its visible confines
1899249 in the second chapter titled on the people of god the council teaches that all human beings are called to belong to the church not all are fully incorporated into the church
1899250 but the church knows that she is joined in many ways to the baptized who are honored by the name of christ
1899251 but who do not however profess the catholic faith in its entirety or have not preserved unity or communion under the successor of peter lumen gentium 15
1899252 and even with those who have not yet received the gospel among whom jews and muslims are explicitly mentioned lumen gentium 16
1899253 the chapter on mary was the subject of debate original plans had called for a separate document about the role of mary keeping the document on the church ecumenical in the sense of non offensive to protestant christians
1899254 however the council fathers insisted with the support of the pope that as marys place is within the church treatment of her should appear within the constitution on the church
1899255 benedict who attended vatican ii as a young theologian has long complained about what he considers the erroneous interpretation of the council by liberals saying it was not a break from the past but rather a renewal of church tradition
1899256 but as you know it is fundamental to any kind of dialogue that the participants are clear about their own identity that is dialogue cannot be an occasion to accommodate or soften what you actually understand yourself to be
1899257 his policies have weakened the federation and eroded the trust of the nation in national institutions
1899258 the coalition further decided that it will immediately initiate impeachment proceedings the coalition leadership will present a charge sheet against gen musharraf
1899259 we hope that 90 of the lawmakers will support us
1899260 we have backed him and voted for him so we are duty bound to support him we will oppose impeachment
1899261 as we have consistently said these are internal issues to be resolved by the pakistani people
1899262 and our expectation would be that this will be resolved in a manner consistent with the rule of law and the pakistani constitution
1899263 there is a strong likelihood but not certainty that the ruling coalition can impeach him
1899264 the army would be crazy for doing that the army needs to improve its reputation and image with the people of pakistan

1899386 in carrying out their mandate the members of the pfiab enjoy the confidence of the president and have access to all the information related to foreign intelligence that they need to fulfill their vital advisory role
1899387 their job is to advise the president about the efficiency of the intelligence systems and where things need to be changed

1899438 deviation from the truths of the blood begets neurotic restlessness and we have had about enough of that these days restlessness begets meaninglessness and the lack of meaning in life is a soul sickness whose full extent and full import our age has not yet begun to comprehend
1899439 a psychoneurosis must be understood ultimately as the suffering of a soul which has not discovered its meaning but all creativeness in the realm of the spirit as well as every psychic advance of man arises from the suffering of the soul and the cause of the suffering is spiritual stagnation or psychic sterility
1899440 suffering that is not understood is hard to bear while on the other hand it is often astounding to see how much a person can endure when he understands the why and the wherefore a philosophical or religious view of the world enables him to do this and such views prove to be and the very least psychic methods of healing if not of salvation
1899441 to be adapted is certainly an ideal but adaptations is not always possible there are situations where the only adaptation is patient endurance
1899442 man is never helped om his suffering by what he thinks of for himself only supra human revealed truth lifts him out of his distress

1899453 abandoned cars is tim lanes first collection of graphic short stories noir ish narratives that are united by their exploration of the great american mythological drama by way of the desperate and haunted characters that populate its pages lanes characters exist on the margins of society alienated floating in the void between hope and despair confused but introspective some of them are experiencing the aftermath of an existential car crash those surreal moments after a car accident when time slows down and youre trying to determine what just happened and how badly youre hurt others have gone off the deep end or were never anywhere but the deep end some are ridiculous others dignified in their efforts to struggle to make sense of and cope with the absurdities outrages ghosts and poisons in their lives the writing is straightforward the stories mainstream but told in a pulpy idiom with an existential edge often in the first person reminiscent of david goodiss or jim thompsons prose or of films like pick up on south street or out of the past visually lanes drawing is in a realistic mode reminiscent of charles burns that heightens the tension in stories that veer between naturalism on the one hand and the comical nightmarish and hallucinatory on the other here american culture is a thrift store and the characters are thrift store junkies living among the clutter its an america depicted as a subdued and haunted coney island made up of lost characters boozing brawling haplessly shooting themselves in the face and hopping freight trains in search of elvis abandoned cars is an impressive debut of a major young american cartoonist

1899539 concerns over currency appreciation and hot money have prompted chinas government to tighten controls over foreign exchange
1899540 these measures could reduce demand for the renminbi yuan from legitimate business needs

1899543 but there are a number of countervailing forces and there is a deep commitment by the government for gradual and smooth changes rather than lurches
1899544 the market has thus greatly reduced its expectations for appreciation

1899804 and thats really unfair theres an enormous amount that happens after 25 or after 30 or after 40 some of which cant happen any earlier
1899805 the kind of milestones that we have associated with adulthood are happening later in the 20s
1899806 that it could make the rest of the world dizzy
1899807 its purely a war about world domination in business politics defence and culture
1899808 in the short term this means being ready to lead military action without regard for diplomacy in the long term it means disarming saddam and his regime we believe that the us has the right under existing security council resolutions to take the necessary steps including war to secure our vital interests in the gulf in no circumstances should americas politics be crippled by the misguided insistence of the security council on unanimity
1899809 maintaining us pre eminence thwarting rival powers and shaping the global security system according to us interests
1899810 the us has sought for years to play an ongoing role in the security architecture of the gulf the unresolved conflict with iraq provides a clear basis for our presence but quite independent of the issue of the iraqi regime a substantial us presence in the gulf is needed
1899811 there can be no victory in the war on terror if saddam remains in power
1899812 i know saddam is a son of a bitch but he is our son of a bitch
1899813 was never a reformer never a democrat just a common criminal
1899814 will serve as a dramatic and shining exampled of freedom to other nations of the region
1899815 i cannot convince myself that after the fall of saddam something democratic could take shape
1899816 american occupation of iraq would secure us control not only of the extensive oil reserves of iraq but also the oil of the caspian sea and the gulf states with control of the supply of oil the us can stall the economies of germany france and japan at will just by manipulating the oil price a lower price would damage russia a higher one would shaft germany and japan thats why preventing this war is essential to europes interests apart from europeans deep desire for peace
1899817 washington has never been shy about its desire to tame europe
1899818 bush is prepared to spill immense quantities of blood so long as its not american blood
1899819 america will do as it pleases it will obey international law if it suits and break that law or ignore it if necessary the usa wants total freedom for itself to be the aristocrat of world politics
1899820 this is rubbish from right wing think tanks where bird brained war mongers huddle together people who have never experienced the horror of war but are infatuated with the idea of it
1899821 i am appalled that a labour pm would hop into bed with such a troop of moral pygmies
1899822 distortion of long standing concepts of the right of self defence
1899823 but in the meantime a group of conservatives worked to get approval for their long held ambitions under the mantle of the war on terror
1899824 although there is no threat to the us from baghdad
1899825 will increasingly isolate the us from those nations that we need in order to do battle with terrorism
1899826 we live in a world where the little things really do matter each encounter no matter how brief is a micro interaction which makes a deposit or withdrawal from our rational and emotional subconscious the sum of these interactions and encounters adds up to how we feel about a particular product brand or service little things feelings they influence our everyday behaviors more than we realize

1899867 for me working out gives me energy to deal with my son to deal with stress so for me its always been a part of my life for me not only are you healthier for your pregnancy youre healthier for you in general

1899879 all these days of intrusive remembrance harp so persistently on one aspect of human nature and entirely ignore the other that is why they become so perfunctory and artificial at christmas and new year you are emboldened and encouraged by convention to send gushing messages of optimistic goodwill and servile affection to people whom you would scarcely ask to lunch unless some one else had failed you at the last moment if you are supping at a restaurant on new years eve you are permitted and expected to join hands and sing for auld lang syne with strangers whom you have never seen before and never want to see again but no licence is allowed in the opposite direction
1899880 there is no outlet for demonstrating your feelings towards people whom you simply loathe that is really the crying need of our modern civilisation just think how jolly it would be if a recognised day were set apart for the paying off of old scores and grudges a day when one could lay oneself out to be gracefully vindictive to a carefully treasured list of people who must not be let off i remember when i was at a private school we had one day the last monday of the term i think it was consecrated to the settlement of feuds and grudges of course we did not appreciate it as much as it deserved because after all any day of the term could be used for that purpose still if one had chastised a smaller boy for being cheeky weeks before one was always permitted on that day to recall the episode to his memory by chastising him again that is what the french call reconstructing the crime
1899881 and anyhow i dont see how you could introduce a system of primitive schoolboy vengeance into civilised adult life we havent outgrown our passions but we are supposed to have learned how to keep them within strictly decorous limits
1899882 of course the thing would have to be done furtively and politely
1899883 the charm of it would be that it would never be perfunctory like the other thing now for instance you say to yourself i must show the webleys some attention at christmas they were kind to dear bertie at bournemouth and you send them a calendar and daily for six days after christmas the male webley asks the female webley if she has remembered to thank you for the calendar you sent them well transplant that idea to the other and more human side of your nature and say to yourself next thursday is nemesis day what on earth can i do to those odious people next door who made such an absurd fuss when ping yang bit their youngest child then youd get up awfully early on the allotted day and climb over into their garden and dig for truffles on their tennis court with a good gardening fork choosing of course that part of the court that was screened from observation by the laurel bushes you wouldnt find any truffles but you would find a great peace such as no amount of present giving could ever bestow

1899906 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew

1899912 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
1899913 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
1899914 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
1899915 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
1899916 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
1899917 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
1899918 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
1899919 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
1899920 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
1899921 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing

1899925 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
1899926 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
1899927 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
1899928 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise

1899932 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
1899933 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you

1899935 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
