8720001 has expressed limited support for the rights accorded couples in same sex civil unions
8720002 sen john mccain opposes gay marriage but also is against a constitutional amendment against it he has expressed limited support for the rights accorded couples in same sex civil unions
8720003 apart from opposing a constitutional amendment to ban abortion mccain is against most abortion rights and says he would favor overturning the supreme court decision affirming those rights
8720004 h e has expressed limited support for the rights accorded couples in same sex civil unions
8720005 i believe that states like mine and other states should amend our state constitutions and i will stick to that position until such time if ever a higher court says that my state or another state has to recognize the other stat another status of marriage
8720006 im committed to maintaining the unique status of marriage between man and woman i think it can best be accomplished and in keeping with my federalist philosophy that states should do as much as possible to have that done at the state level but if it is overturned by a superior court i will then obviously support the other path
8720007 a part from opposing a constitutional amendment to ban abortion mccain is against most abortion rights and says he would favor overturning the supreme court decision affirming those rights
8720008 youre for a constitutional amendment banning abortion with some exceptions for life and rape and incest
8720009 so is president bush yet that hasnt advanced in the six years hes been in office what are you going to do to advance a constitutional amendment that president bush hasnt done
8720010 i dont think a constitutional amendment is probably going to take place but i do believe that its very likely or possible that a supreme court should could overturn roe v wade which would then return these decisions to the states which i support im a federalist just as i believe that the issue of gay marriage should be decided by the states so do i believe that we would be better off by having roe v wade returned to the states
8720011 but when i do i would like it to be a bolivian sea
8720012 proving that we can directly measure amyloid beta in the human brain is an important step forward for both clinical and basic research and that may be true not just in alzheimers disease but also in other serious neurological disorders
8720013 we cant at this point rule out a very early spike in amyloid right after a brain injury
8720014 the results have potentially important clinical implications because the measurement of amyloid beta in the human brain may turn out to be a good indicator of how well brain cells are communicating with each other even in very sick patients
8720015 if the results are validated in further studies this may assist physicians in making important patient management decisions in patients with acute neurological disorders
8720016 the new data fit well with the previous results in mice because improved neurological status is likely to go along with increased communication between brain cells
8720017 we havent measured how brain injury affects amyloid beta inside cells nor have we determined whether brain injury affects the ability of amyloid beta to form small aggregates that may be especially harmful
8720018 our ultimate goal is to develop interventions that we can apply after a traumatic brain injury to improve outcomes and reduce the long term risk of alzheimers
8720019 we figured out how to get the mother of all blood stem cells with the right culture conditions
8720020 there is real hope that in the future we can grow billions of blood cells at will to treat blood related disorders and just as critically if not more so weve got ace as a new old marker to guide our work
8720021 but were very pleasantly surprised to discover it as a beacon for finding the earliest blood stem cells known as well as new ways to find and manipulate this marker to make them grow
8720022 we can make lots and lots of blood cells from human stem cells for transfusions regenerate new vascular trees for heart diseases as well as create test tube factories for making transplantable blood cells that treat diseases we are very far from treatment
8720023 corporate cartographers are demolishing thousands of years of history not to mention britains remarkable geography at a stroke by not including them on maps which millions of us now use every day
8720024 were in real danger of losing what makes maps so unique giving us a feel for a place even if weve never been there
8720025 students who are coming out of kelley are almost certainly going to be in supervisory capacities shortly after entering an organization if you have people who already know how to coach others give positive and negative feedback to their subordinates and help all of the people in their department maximize their skills that immediately adds value to an organization
8720026 theyll see the results of their own abilities to guide and motivate and understand what people need its not just learning its doing
8720027 other programs focus on you as an individual and your own leadership development rather than what you can do to develop others
8720028 these 30 students have already excelled they are leaders at kelley iu and in extracurricular activities but how do you make the people around you leaders as well thats what other programs dont do
8720029 many people can achieve a lot for themselves but to be able to externalize that and help other people succeed is a critical leadership skill
8720030 one of altrias core strategic focus areas is the development and recruitment of leaders we hope to attract develop and retain diverse employees at all levels our support for this program directly falls in line with our recruitment goals and our efforts to attract future leaders
8720031 by the end of the year well have a solid package of information about what works in this environment to help students accomplish leadership goals
8720032 there will be accountability were going to be keeping an eye on the process to make sure everyones getting what he or she really needs throughout the year
8720033 i want to share my experiences and help other students take advantage and succeed in this program
8720034 this is also a great opportunity for me to develop leadership skills that can be transferred into my career post graduation
8720035 i hope to not only pass along the advice and expertise i have gained from my studies at kelley but to also strengthen my own interpersonal skills through the interaction and activities
8720036 simply being surrounded by such people creates a challenge for me to learn from others and continue to expand my worldview to encompass the diverse perspectives of others
8720037 the culture at kelley thrives on the atmosphere of creativity and social skills during my time here i have learned much about the fundamentals and mechanics of business however i have learned even more on treating people well and leading them to perform thats a special education which cannot be placed into a book
8720038 irreparably harmed by senator mccains illegal and illegitimate presence on the ballot
8720039 the harm sustained by being forced to compete against and potentially be defeated by and illegal and illegitimate campaign cannot be monetarily remedied nor can it be remedied after the november general election in any manner
8720040 irreparably harmed by senator mccains illegal and illegitimate presence on the ballot
8720041 the harm sustained by being forced to compete against and potentially be defeated by and illegal and illegitimate campaign cannot be monetarily remedied nor can it be remedied after the november general election in any manner
8720042 if everyone else was jumping off a cliff would you join them
8720043 no law is going to prevent a woman from giving birth sic when shes raped or has incest no law ever its the same thing with the parental notification every bill has an abuse clause in it every bill has if youre afraid to tell your parents if theres incest if theres violence in your home you can go to the courts and theyll decide whether you can have the abortion not your parents ok every law says it
8720044 but the crazies the pro abortion people the people who worship at the altar of reproductive rights dont care they want abortion on demand any kind of abortion at any time
8720045 on the date that the states are recognized by the united states supreme court to have the authority to prohibit abortion at all stages of pregnancy
8720046 supreme court reverses in whole or in part roe v wade
8720047 p rohibits abortion except when necessary to save the life of the mother
8720048 i think theyre gonna look at the republican platform and see the opposite side of the zealotry and see that you know when youve got a platform telling women that they have no control over their bodies when theyre the victims of rape or incest that they have absolutely no choices even early on in their pregnancy i think that that is going to you know were one justice away from that potentially becoming the law
8720049 i just called about schecters comment about abortion and sort of your reaction to it when he mentioned rape and incest being a huge issue for women in the suburbs i find that to be a red herring issue that has absolutely nothing to do with abortion as an issue
8720050 you know the spectrum has gone too far to the left and im gonna readjust my opinion to try to get it under control
8720051 around these katrina scarred parts aug 29 is still and will be for some time a black armband kind of day
8720052 for lionsgate studios however aug 29 isnt quite as sacred for them the third anniversary of the day the levees were breached and new orleans slipped under is something on the order of perfect timing a ripped from the headlines release date
8720053 the film does not depict or parody any actual natural disaster and the release date of disaster movie is in no way a reference to or joke about the anniversary of hurricane katrina
8720054 thats a hard line to swallow tasteless humor and b movie comedies have their place but this confluence of dates isnt just a cheap laugh its a cheap shot to an entire region still digging out from an all too real disaster
8720055 the place that started siphoning film business from new orleans within weeks of the storm
8720056 neither friedberg nor seltzer can credibly plead ignorance to the significance of aug 29 or its continued impact on this part of the country they shot their previous spoof meet the spartans in new orleans last year during the july and august lead up to the second anniversary of katrina surely they ventured far enough from the coziness of their hotel rooms to witness the lingering devastation of one of the worst natural disasters in american history
8720057 transaction serves shareholders significantly better than allowing the distribution partnership to expire in 2012
8720058 the termination payment from pernod more than compensates for our higher costs of distribution over the remaining term of the joint venture agreement

8720060 significant upside potential over the long term from the cruzan rum brand
8720061 t he change of venue thursday night to invesco field and the huge open air obama acceptance speech is one of the biggest and possibly craziest gambles of this or any other presidential campaign of the modern era
8720062 everyone can define what can go wrong and no one can quite define what great move would look like it has every possibility of looking like a nuremberg rally it has too many variables to guarantee a good tv picture the set the athenian columns looks hokey big crowds can get in the way of subtle oratory

8720069 we do want to have forums for our users to communicate and support each other
8720070 it doesnt necessarily mean that theyre helping elevate the good questions and helping the conversation come through
8720071 weve thought about this as well and it would be really cool if we could start to group different events around you
8720072 a few projects on the way think 2009 realistically for some of this stuff
8720073 its really important to know what you guys are thinking it keeps us honest
8720074 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8720075 what sort of god was this getting so angry with the world and the people he created and then to calm himself down demanding the blood of his own son
8720076 and anyway why should god forgive us through punishing somebody else it was worse than illogical it was insane it made god sound like a psychopath if any human being behaved like this we would say they were a monster
8720077 well i havent changed my mind since that explanation of the cross just doesnt work but sadly its one thats still all too often preached
8720078 on the cross jesus died for our sins the price of our sin is paid but it is not paid to god but by god
8720079 what is at the heart of salvation punishment or love liberals like myself believe it is love
8720080 jeffrey john is saying that the cross is not about anger or wrath or sin or atonement but only about gods unconditional love
8720081 there is he says nothing to understand in the cross which is anything to do with sacrifice or jesus dying for our sins and we say no youve got it wrong
8720082 of course there are some very raw discussions amongst christians about quite how jesus died in our place and what that meant and how he suffered for our sins
8720083 but to ignore the entirety of the language about atonement and sacrifice and the cross is to nullify the message of what good friday and jesus dying for us is all about
8720084 jesus christ is sacrificed and he washes away the sins of the whole world and he completes the understanding of scripture and fulfils it in a completely new way
8720085 you cannot read the old testament and new testament and blank out an entirety of language and concept and understanding that means that we are guilty sinners we need our sins to be paid for and we need jesus christ to die for us
8720086 that is what the creeds say it is what the bible says and you cannot rewrite them you cannot understand jesus christ without understanding old testament atonement material
8720087 the truth that jesus died as our sin bearing substitute carrying the punishment for our sins on the cross is the glorious heart of the gospel it displays the love of god father son and spirit for us
8720088 to deny or vilify that is a tragic denial of the power and heart of the gospel i hope jeffrey john will speedily reconsider and repent of his attack on apostolic christianity
8720089 lent talks are short individual authored opinions in which the contributor is invited to reflect on a different part of christs passion
8720090 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8720091 marketing dangerous pesticides and thereby accepting the mass death of bees all over the world
8720092 according to egyptian website al mesryoon last two months there was a campaign in america to recruit egyptians as interpreters in the american forces and to be sent to iraq the americans offer green card to egyptians who sign a contract to work for at least six months and the recruiters can extend the period
8720093 the gas and the fuel for cars has always been a problem for iraqis inside iraq the irony that iraq has one of the worlds largest reservoirs of oil is not lost on iraqis
8720094 budget cuts and political shifts cost us our support system at the old place
8720095 when our a amp r guy lost his job we knew it was time for a change a few years ago that mightve been a scary thing but its a brand new world out there now for bands like us we no longer have to rely on a big record company to make things happen and thats exciting we made this record without the pressure of having to write four smash hit singles hanging over our heads and that was liberating of course
8720096 there are a few songs on the album that could do really well on radio
8720097 theres a sense of energy and excitement about us that we havent felt since we released our first album
8720098 just shows us where we need to direct our disaster preparedness effort
8720099 the findings in this report will aid public health and emergency preparedness efforts and may help reduce the mortality burden in future natural disasters

8720120 as far as our commitment is concerned obviously basketball was a key component to this
8720121 were going to triple our games that are available on espn and espn2 were going to add a regular game on espnu were going to have a regular season game on espn on abc the conference tournament semifinals and championship obviously on espn and abc as well
8720122 so were very excited about boosting distribution and exposure for sec basketball
8720123 i think it really speaks highly of the people in the conference office and their vision and diligence toward getting something done that obviously is monumental for our league
8720124 i am very excited and look forward to being part of the best tv package in college sports by far
8720125 i never worried about it some guys in our league the pac 10 complained about the tv deal
8720126 this thing is all based off recruiting you look at all of the first round picks out of the pac 10 this year those kids thought it was a pretty good league
8720127 to see the soldiers in that setting and gain some insight and understanding into what they go through makes our jobs seem like gravy we think we have problems with recruiting and scheduling and its nothing compared to what those guys go through and they keep such a positive attitude
8720128 im going to petition the ncaa to see if the five wins over there can count on my schedule
8720129 two of them were from texas and said they were going to try to come see my team play

8720233 overall these trends last a long period of time because consumers adjust their buying habits and they change their routine

8720375 vamos a realizar una reuni n permanente con el ministro vidal como interlocutor por parte del gobierno para de verdad construir iniciativas que permitan concretar esta tarea pendiente y en deuda no s lo con los familiares y las v ctimas sino que con chile

8720387 first there must be a representation omission or practice that is likely to mislead the consumer
8720388 practices that have been found misleading or deceptive in specific cases include false oral or written representations misleading price claims sales of hazardous or systematically defective products or services without adequate disclosure failure to disclose information regarding pyramid sales use of bait and switch techniques failure to perform promised services and failure to meet warranty obligations
8720389 second we examine the practice from the perspective of a consumer acting reasonably in the circumstances if the representation or practice affects or is directed primarily to a particular group the commission examines reasonableness from the perspective of that group
8720390 if so the practice is material and consumer injury is likely because consumers are likely to have chosen differently but for the deception in many instances materiality and hence injury can be presumed from the nature of the practice in other instances evidence of materiality may be necessary

8720412 the cooperation between the relevant oil companies from china and iraq is mutually beneficial
8720413 it will be conducive to the economic development of iraq and will meet chinas demands in the oil field as well and is also conducted according to market rules and will not harm any interests of any third parties
8720414 with oil prices surging the global contest for oil resources is becoming ever fiercer many governments have realised this and have become unwilling to sell their oil resources cheaply to the multinationals
8720415 since it has become more and more difficult to obtain equity and exploit rights in oil fields its good for china to participate in the development through a service contract it diversifies our oil sources and helps guarantee chinas oil supplies
8720416 the business environment is rapidly becoming more difficult things remain very uncertain not just in the united states but in emerging countries and resource rich nations as well

8720424 but given the strength and diversity of diageos business we believe we can deliver organic operating profit growth for the coming year within our range of 7 0 9 0 per cent
8720425 the main drivers of growth were international where scotch in latin america and beer in africa drove net sales growth of 16 per cent and north america where growth in the priority brands drove a 5 0 per cent increase in net sales
8720426 if it was going to have a major impact we would have seen it by now

8720454 stop and search is part of what were doing but were also sending a very visible message to young people that our aim is to keep them safe

8720460 swung it once or twice and said i dont want to do it any more
8720461 the danger of this case is that the ritual of self flagellation itself is demonised
8720462 there is nothing odd in the father of the household engaging in this particular practice
8720463 the point about the apparent extreme self violence is that extremism and violence in and of themselves are condemnable thus without the essential dramatic immediacy that the practice conveys to both participant as well as audience the rituals that comprise the passion of hussain would be rendered meaningless

8720498 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8720499 hillary has told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama
8720500 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8720501 conversations around the kitchen table once the kids have gone to bed
8720502 tonight weve seen the passing of control of the democratic party from the clintons to obama and biden
8720503 it was interesting that when obama came on stage he was applauded but the crowd didnt go as wild as it did for the clintons
8720504 mr obama has really put the pressure on himself for tomorrow night hes got to introduce himself to america
8720505 the presidents reaffirmed their commitment to the principles of respect for historic and cultural traditions of every country and efforts aimed at preserving the unity of a state and its territorial integrity
8720506 placing the emphasis exclusively on the use of force has no prospects and hinders a comprehensive settlement of local conflicts
8720507 serious signal for those who are trying to justify the aggression
8720508 the sight of russian tanks in a neighboring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the prague spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain
8720509 was not a step taken lightly or without full consideration of the consequences
8720510 those who protested 40 years ago often still congratulate themselves that their loud zeal alone brought needed change to america in civil rights the environment womens liberation and world peace maybe but critics counter that the larger culture that followed was the most self absorbed in memory
8720511 we are people of this generation bred in at least modest comfort housed now in universities looking uncomfortably to the world we inherit
8720512 when only one nuclear bomb could destroy a city like minneapolis denver we dont need 6 000
8720513 by maintaining thousands of highly accurate nuclear weapons on alert the united states perpetuates the only threat that could destroy it as a functioning society a large scale attack by russia launched either without authorization by accident or by mistake because of a false warning of an incoming u s attack
8720514 by giving nuclear weapons so large and visible a role in u s policy
8720515 the united states has increased the incentive for other nations to acquire nuclear weapons and reduced the political costs to them of doing so
8720516 by contributing to a climate in which possessing nuclear weapons is legitimate
8720517 the united states has also undermined the ability of the international community to prevent more states from acquiring them the united states can and should take the lead in promoting an effort to clear the path to a world free of nuclear weapons
8720518 eventually we want to live in a world free of nuclear weapons

8720563 wuxis proximity to shanghai offers an advantage for achievos japanese customers as shanghai is an important hub for japanese business interests in china
8720564 achievos japan business group already enjoys a significant operation in shanghai furthermore establishing operations beyond chinas large urban centers such as shenzhen beijing and shanghai is an important part of our overall business strategy and a key differentiator between achievo and its indian counterparts the large indian based it companies are limited to specific regions that offer the necessary urban infrastructure china by contrast has many urban as well as suburban centers with infrastructures already in place we believe establishing r amp d centers in these cities shields us from the rapid inflation seen in larger metropolitan centers and allows achievo to offer additional value to our customers as a result
8720565 wuxi is a beautiful city and its importance to chinas high technology industry is growing especially for our japanese customers
8720566 our hope is that establishing operations in the yangtze river delta will further ensure our ability to attract hire and retain the best engineering talent available to deliver products and services with the highest possible quality while simultaneously giving achievo customers expanded regional choices

8720570 bloggers who normally provide worthwhile insight into conflict provided curiously generic analysis or links to the same
8720571 were still linking to the same narrow set of news sources sources that offered little more than thin quotes from government officials
8720572 when you have people who have never been to that region whove probably maybe been to moscow once in their life who god knows have never been to georgia or south ossetia or north ossetia never have experienced this and never studied the history of these conflicts and so they reach for the first set of adjectives in the thesaurus thundering tanks and all the rest and the first set of historical analogies that they can possibly reach
8720573 it would be sublimely naive and condescending to expect south ossetians or georgians to respond to intense shellfire by taking a crash course in podcasting even if they did have electricity and and an internet connection
8720574 most were of poor quality and many appeared on blogs with no reputation no previous blogging history some had been registered only a few days before the war and carried no identification of a real person with a real name who could claim responsibility for or ownership of them
8720575 the few blogging accounts i did find enlightening were almost exclusively those written by people i had met on earlier trips to georgia and whom i trusted

8720584 i do not want to prejudge the issue before the eu summit on georgia has taken place
8720585 but we will work hard with our 26 partners to draft a strong statement that signifies our refusal to accept the situation in georgia france does not support breaking off relations with russia this will have to be sorted out through negotiation this will take time we are not deluding ourselves
8720586 my friend kouchner also said that we will soon attack moldova and ukraine and the crimea but that is a sick imagination and probably that applies to sanctions as well
8720587 the sco states express grave concern in connection with the recent tensions around the south ossetian issue and urge the sides to solve existing problems peacefully through dialogue and to make efforts facilitating reconciliation and talks
8720588 we condemn the action of our fellow g8 member russias recognition of the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia violates the territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia and is contrary to un security council resolutions supported by russia
8720589 lets hope we do not see any direct confrontation in that
8720590 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aid using battleships
8720591 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8720592 down the road we will be looking at what may be required to rebuild the georgian military right now the mission of the united states military is to provide humanitarian assistance

8720597 while the system has been extremely effective in combating this trend we quickly discovered that the value of the pips solution went far beyond stolen vehicle recovery
8720598 almost 7 5 million plates have been checked since we adopted the system in addition to recovering over 1 000 stolen vehicles and making almost 200 arrests the system has helped us to improve the parking situation within the city by enabling us to better enforce the rules people are less likely to break the law when they know they will get caught in the past twelve months we have begun using the system to enforce our parking regulations downtown over 700 vehicles with almost 350 000 in outstanding parking citations have been identified and towed using the pips solution this revenue helps us to justify purchase of additional equipment to improve the safety of our city
8720599 the pips solution from federal signal has been a great investment for long beach in many ways it has proven itself time and again and the pips team has been very responsive to our needs and receptive to our ideas as they continue to innovate their product were very pleased with our decision and would strongly recommend the technology to other agencies
8720600 leading law enforcement agencies like the long beach police department continue to turn to pips first for proven alpr solutions

8720611 what is needed from the devolved administration at stormont is a set of policies to take account of the different population profiles in the catholic and protestant communities to answer their different needs and stop following the outdated nio mindset of trying to pretend that everything here would be ok if everyone started behaving as if they lived in england

8720613 is a matter the government has to consider in due course but we are not at that point in our discussions at all yet the point of discussion we are at at the moment is examining the outcome of the referendum and obviously there will be a lot meetings with eu colleagues between now and the end of the year where it will be discussed further with them so its not just a matter for our own personal consideration or national consideration it is a matter we have to discuss with colleagues as well

8720616 even in these times when all the talk is of putting history behind us the easiest way to tell the difference between the irish and the english is to utter the word
8720617 i was myself assaulted and received death threats the depth of hatred that still exists in ireland is matched only by unawareness in non catholic english circles of what cromwell did in ireland i am reminded of gk chestertons remark that the tragedy of the english conquest of ireland in the 17th century is that the irish can never forget it and the english can never remember it
8720618 it was in accordance with the laws of war but it went far beyond what any general had done in england
8720619 this was ethnic cleansing on a scale undreamt of by slobodan milosevic
8720620 reverence for cromwell was one of the few socialist traditions that survived the transition from old to new labour
8720621 he was on the right side in the civil war and because of him the right side won he changed the course of english history and changed it for the better
8720622 until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved
8720623 it is increasingly a manifestation of republican frustration at the failure of sinn f in to deliver what it promised to its own movement
8720624 nationalists and republicans will once again be disappointed by the attitude being displayed by the sdlp
8720625 any commitments that were given by the government to sinn f in are a matter for the government but the dup made the situation perfectly clear before we left st andrews that we had not agreed to any dates for the transfer of powers
8720626 i say again that until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved it should not be taking on more especially a portfolio as contentious as justice
8720627 i was outside the family home when the raid began and i was inside immediately afterwards speaking with the family who are close friends of mine the reality of the ruc psni was here for all to see in broad daylight and the residents of this estate remain justifiably suspicious of the force
8720628 most accounts agree that it was south ossetian separatists who committed the first act of escalation when they blew up a georgian military vehicle on august 1 wounding five georgian peacekeeping troops georgia responded in kind killing six south ossetian militiamen
8720629 capt ivanov and eduard kokoity the pro moscow president of south ossetia say they held a meeting that day between marat kulakhmetov commander of the russian peacekeeping forces and temur yakobashvili the georgian minister for re integration whose job is to deal with the breakaway regions
8720630 i would like to address those who are now shooting at georgian policemen i want to say with full responsibility that several hours ago i reached a very difficult decision not to respond with fire this was no use however and the fighting escalated
8720631 georgian president sakashvilis biggest lie was his attempt to airbrush the fact that he created the crisis by launching an artillery barrage on the south ossetian capital which killed scores of civilians and 15 russian peacekeepers it was absurd to think russia would not retaliate so the next lie was to claim russias leaders had prepared a trap in fact they were taken by surprise as much as the ossetians nevertheless russia should pull back completely now it should also have restrained south ossetian militias from running amok against georgian villages

8720635 in the observer alan ruddock begins his account with the morning of september 11 the day of the terrorist attack on the world trade centre in new york as the us special envoy to ireland richard haas was preparing for a meeting with sinn fein leader gerry adams
8720636 after a few minutes of talking about inching forward towards the peace process haas finally snapped
8720637 yet there were indications that no 10 had more room for manoeuvre than it realised in july 2005 the ira had finally agreed to decommission all its weapons at the last minute adams called no 10 to demand that some of the weapons not be destroyed so that the ira could arm itself against possible attacks from dissident members unless this was allowed he threatened decommissioning would not proceed the blair government conceded but wanted to check with dublin irish justice minister michael mcdowell refused to acquiesce in the backsliding despite enormous pressure powell told adams of the problem and adams gave way decommissioning took place as planned

8720640 trends differ for the four countries of the uk the population of england is projected to increase by 8 per cent by 2016 that of northern ireland by 7 per cent big year that and wales by 5 per cent the projected increase for scotland where fertility and life expectancy levels are assumed to remain lower than in the rest of the uk is 3 per cent across the united kingdom northern ireland recorded the highest rate of growth with a one per cent population rise last year to 1 8 million people the population of england rose by 0 6 per cent to 51 1 million scotland and wales rose by 0 5 per cent

8720646 discussions on the devolution of policing and justice have progressed well in the preparation for government committee the governments have requested the parties to continue these discussions so as to agree the necessary administrative arrangements to create a new policing and justice department it is our view i e the view of the two governments that the implementation of the agreement published today should be sufficient to build the community confidence necessary for the assembly to request the devolution of criminal justice and policing from the british government by may 2008
8720647 there is no definitive date for the devolution of policing and justice powers we remain of the unshakable view that those powers can only be transferred whenever there is the required community confidence

8720650 this charge of fiddling while rome burns was a problem which heaney discusses in his essay the interesting case of nero chekhovs cognac and a knocker where he recalls how he and david hammond felt unable to record a tape of songs against the immediate backdrop of explosions in belfast

8720652 davy is in that well worn phrase a man of many parts but the whole is greater than the sum of the parts and the uniqueness of david hammond is his midas touch the way he can discern art and poetry in the commonplace and above all the way in which he effortlessly explores i would almost say creates a common ground on which irishmen and women of every tradition and disposition no matter how cantankerous or self regarding we may be in other areas can meet each other and re discover a vital part of ourselves in all of this his wife eileen has played a quiet but essential part their home in belfast has for years been a magnet for cultural waifs and strays of every description an embassy of song its warmth and hospitality a standing rebuke to the image of the dour wee north that is most prevalent among people who have never crossed the border

8720658 my wife and i really miss the maryland section it was a self contained and separate section of news from this area it was the first thing i read every morning while my wife read the a section then we would switch sections i am really struggling with this very large first section
8720659 i now understand that the maryland news is now placed at the front of the first section but with all the advertising separating it its difficult to follow and of course my wife and i can no longer share sections in the morning which is very frustrating
8720660 my husband and i have been subscribers for many years
8720661 having several sections is our preference now one of us reads the paper while the other goes to the internet i know that change takes some getting used to so i am not being critical of that however at this point i am still trying to get used to it
8720662 the new format is confusing and so visually distracting that i cant concentrate enough to read it the sun was better when the first section had mostly world and national news and editorials the maryland section should be a separate entity the obituaries should not be casually mixed in with the national news what i really want is my local newspaper back

8720673 shupe is my number one forward she knows how to score and is a very intelligent player
8720674 has a great one versus one ability and she can shoot from a distance

8720709 web 2 0 refers to the sharing collaboration and interactivity typical in many of the most successful online services that have launched in recent years
8720710 we didnt use the wikipedia software which is also open source because any users can post information
8720711 we check contributors manually using our panel of experts around europe to establish that the contributor has a sufficient level of expertise to write an article on internet law
8720712 most of the contributors come from universities or law firms who want to raise their profile
8720713 the choice of contributors was deliberate because were hoping to keep the service as low cost as possible so it will remain sustainable
8720714 we are building a critical mass of users and contributors around the world and we hope the service will continue to track the rapid change in online law
8720715 i think the key point to be made here is that every one of these people signed contracts acknowledging they were independent contractors

8720875 money is not a protection from anything other than creditors

8720881 she stopped just inside the doorway and turned round and said well i can stick something in you at that point there was a short jab
8720882 i couldnt say it was an attempted stab but it was certainly showing a motion
8720883 i could see a length of what i remember being orange and white plastic and what looked like an orange stopper it was a syringe
8720884 she was pointing the syringe upwards then whipped it behind her back
8720885 yesterdays sec action paving the way for certain u s based multinationals to adopt ifrs represents the latest step forward in a global trend toward a single accounting standard it is critical that companies evaluate the broader impact of ifrs to global tax planning
8720886 for multinational companies ifrs is a beneficial global trend with significant momentum
8720887 tax departments must successfully integrate this new set of standards into their global tax planning methodology in a way that maximizes the tax benefits of this transition but mitigates the risks that can arise from the differences between tax reporting rules and ifrs
8720888 to be recognized by our peers and to be in the company of such successful stores as hustler and castle is an honor in itself
8720889 adam amp eve has been around for nearly 40 years

8720926 this reduction in force will improve our flexibility as an organization and ensure that we continue to provide excellent customer service
8720927 you look back at some nights and you could say it happened at the university of florida or you could say it happened at harvard business school
8720928 a lot of these people are 26 27 have half a million dollars in the bank and are completely burned out from all the 90 hour workweeks they really just want to have a good time
8720929 als gro e ehre aber auch als gro e verpflichtung
8720930 es gibt werte des anstands die geh ren dazu wie das gesetzbuch
8720931 der erfolgreiche abschluss des verkaufs gibt der ikb als mittelstandsbank in deutschland eine zweite chance
8720932 ghana ist ein beispiel daf r dass demokratische mechanismen stabilit t bringen
8720933 es hat schon au enminister geben die wahlkampf gemacht haben
8720934 den tag seines eigenen gro en auftritts h tte obama
8720935 am 45 jahrestag der ansprache von martin luther king wird er sich seiner partei als kandidat pr sentieren
8720936 er hat es wirklich geschafft ganz nach oben zu kommen er hat seinen traum umgesetzt und sein weg war als sohn eines afrikanischen moslems sicherlich nicht immer einfach obama kann den amerikanern egal welcher hautfarbe und welcher herkunft neues selbstbewusstsein geben
8720937 kurzerhand nderte clinton die parteitags regie sie lie die delegierten per akklamation also per beifall zustimmen und verhinderte so eine formelle abstimmung das war trickreich aber legitim und taktisch klug
8720938 mit ihrer hilfe haben die demokraten in einer schwierigen phase alles richtig gemacht um das rennen ums wei e haus offen zu halten
8720939 ob nun tats chlich alle entt uschten hillary w hler geschlossen zu obama berlaufen bleibt zweifelhaft
8720940 zu tief sitzt bei manchen von ihnen noch die verbitterung ber die niederlage
8720941 der vor allem die karte seiner au enpolitischen erfahrungen spielen wird
8720942 dass f r viele amerikaner gestandener patriotismus sicherheit und berechenbarkeit wichtiger sein k nnten als ein change oder yes we can eines zwar charismatischen aber noch unberechenbaren obama hat die chancen des 71 j hrigen vietnam veteranen j ngst wieder steigen lassen
8720943 glaubt man den umfragen hat obama in den letzten wochen
8720944 und je mehr die angst vor einem neuen kalten krieg w chst
8720945 desto schwerer wird es dem au enpolitisch unerfahrenen obama fallen seine landsleute von sich zu berzeugen
8720946 als handicap k nnten sich f r obama die eskalierenden ost west spannungen erweisen in zeiten der konfrontation mit russland erweckt ein alter au enpolitischer haudegen wie mccain eher vertrauen als ein neuling der den kalten krieg nur aus jugenderinnerungen kennt
8720947 ive had certain putts i had in real life competition break the same way and by the same amount
8720948 after eight or 11 miles it reverts to being a completely normal gasoline electric hybrid which means you get about a 25 30 percent fuel savings but the point is they do burn fuel
8720949 a plug in hybrid with a limited range is a very nice thing to have
8720950 its wonderful that toyota is working on this if they have some test fleets out next year thats great but its not the same thing as a chevy volt which is not a plug in hybrid
8720951 the 2 percent increase in total u s store sales was also more than entirely due to higher spending by customers from other countries
8720952 sales to new yorkers were below last year which should not be too surprising to anyone
8720953 even though the u s was weaker than expected i think a lot of investors thought that could happen
8720954 we have grown our canadian store base where we are achieving much higher returns on capital and the economy is much healthier than we currently find in the u s
8720955 doc can you write a note to the shelter saying i get to sleep there all day instead of going outside
8720956 i got this back today and i do not intend on paying to mail it again
8720957 it probably got messed up in the machines it was too thick you will have to pay if you want to send it again
8720958 if it was too think why wasnt i told that when i came in monday to pay the extra postage
8720959 it will have to go flat so it wont go through the machines it will be a dollar
8720960 this is ridiclous i am not happy about paying again

8720963 en algunos momentos de la historia uruguay fue considerado como la suiza de am rica nosotros estamos trabajando para recuperar esa denominaci n
8720964 a que nuestro pa s sea el polo cient fico de nuestra regi n
8720965 de una era de cooperaci n e intercambio entre los dos pa ses
8720966 hay que evitar dos escenarios una interrupci n demasiado larga del proceso y que se vuelvan a renegociar todos los temas
8720967 nosotros hemos dejado claro que apoyamos el paquete que present lamy en julio y que lo sustentamos en su trabajo

8720970 as these unions work together to provide the necessary skilled labour with an absolute commitment to safety quality and environmental excellence our confidence in successful project execution is stronger than ever
8720971 the tight construction market has been a concern for the kitimat modernization project and this agreement directly addresses that key issue as we go forward for final board approval
8720972 this agreement contains all the fundamentals for sound site operations and excellent relations with our all important construction labour force i couldnt be more thrilled about this achievement that brings us one step closer to project realization
8720973 we have discussed these matters and together concluded that prudence dictates protection of financial resources and options deferral of pay increase is a logical next step

8720976 think back to the 2004 convention when the democrats nominated their weakest candidate in a half century
8720977 who delivered an electrifying address that catapulted him onto the national stage an unknown illinois politician with thin credentials and a far left background named barack obama thats who is there any reason to think that 2012 wont see history repeat itself
8720978 donna reed meets cinderella meets mr smith goes to washington
8720979 four more years of seasoning and accomplishments will definitely put her on the short list for 2012 after all a dream deferred is still a dream right
8720980 to come this far and almost grab the brass ring really shows you how far this countrys advanced
8720981 theres no shame to losing out to two political heavyweights like barack obama and joe biden thats for sure she can be proud of what she did

8720987 this company is perceived to have exhibited outstanding management superior market growth exceptional customer service and the ability to combine technology and successful strategic initiatives
8720988 we commend the westchester county board of legislatures for taking this important step in helping to combat underage drinking
8720989 sadly two thirds of kids who illegally drink underage are getting the alcohol from adults who knowingly provide it so its incredibly important that legislators address the adults who are the real source of alcohol to kids diageo supports social host laws and we hope to work with lawmakers in new york state and across the country on this important issue because the bottom line is that alcohol and minors do not mix
8720990 ocho millones de euros son mil doscientos y pico para ser exactos
8720991 i got a call that if i want the tickets i have to volunteer two shifts of three hours apiece for one ticket if i want two tickets then its four shifts of two hours apiece
8720992 i received a call monday saying i could qualify for the tickets if i do 12 hours of volunteer work for the obama campaign between now and friday the 15th
8720993 to work 40 hours at my job get to and from work get to and from the campaign office and complete the 12 hours in three days would be next to impossible
8720994 there has only been two lanes of traffic open since spring of 2006
8720995 so this is pretty big deal now that drivers can benefit from the full capacity of three lanes
8720996 produts for all ages who enjoy winter sports and life high quality original and functional
8720997 the fact is that u s citizens were indeed in the area of conflict during the hostilities
8720998 it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their supervisors
8720999 therefore they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their supervisors

8721002 in a region where abortion is highly restricted the supreme court has taken a huge leap forward in protecting womens basic human rights todays ruling opens the door for women across the country to demand that their local governments follow mexico citys example

8721021 gone are the days when people are debating whether the phenomenon exists and there is significant motivation and increasing momentum at the state level to address climate change
8721022 the reefs of the world are at risk and hawaiis isolated reefs are especially vulnerable to stresses of any kind particularly to the rapidly emerging stress brought on by climate change
8721023 ocean acidification is creeping progressive and insidious likened by one workshop participant to osteoporosis of the reef a weakening of the reef structure that makes corals more vulnerable to breakage from waves and human use
8721024 because it is difficult to detect unlike mass coral bleaching we dont know whether we have reached or surpassed the critical thresholds for any coral species such as we have for temperature thresholds
8721025 coral reefs are the lifeblood of our oceans and we depend on them for survival
8721026 without urgent action to limit carbon dioxide emissions and improve management of marine protected areas even vast treasured reefs like the great barrier reef and northwestern hawaiian islands will become wastelands of dead coral
8721027 the honolulu declaration offers tangible and practical steps we can take now to prevent further ocean acidification and ensure the survival of our vitally important and irreplaceable rainforests of the sea
8721028 we could see a doubling of atmospheric co2 in a little as 50 years and ocean acidification will continue to an extent and at rates that have not occurred for tens of millions of years
8721029 it is clear that seawater chemistry will change in coming decades and centuries in ways that will dramatically alter marine life
8721030 we are only beginning to understand the complex interactions between large scale chemistry changes and marine ecology it is vital to develop research strategies to better understand the long term vulnerabilities of sensitive marine organisms to these changes
8721031 is leading to the most dramatic changes in marine chemistry in at least the past 650 000 years
8721032 while the consequences of inaction are too depressing to contemplate there is good news
8721033 our workshop showed that there are some practical steps we can take to buy time for coral reefs while co2 levels are stabilized that there is hope for coral reefs if we act now
8721034 we listened to comments and suggestions from jobbers and shops and incorporated them into the new site
8721035 we could very well be in that quick slide downward in terms of passing a tipping point
8721036 it also means that climate warming is also coming larger and faster than the models are predicting and nobodys really taken into account that change yet

8721155 our society is teaching young people to avoid a direct experience in nature either by turning summer camps into weight loss camps computer camps and various other renamed camps that have little to do with nature
8721156 as the young spend less of their lives in natural surroundings their senses narrow physiologically and psychologically and this reduces the richness of human experience we need contact with nature
8721157 countless communities have virtually outlawed unstructured outdoor play often because of the threat of lawsuits
8721158 some kids dont want to be organized all the time they want to let their imaginations run they want to see where a stream of water takes them

8721162 nature deficit disorder and describes the human costs of alienation from nature as diminished use of senses attention difficulties and higher rates of physical and emotional illnesses

8721172 we need more housing that much is clear housing prices continue to rise even as the number of sales has stagnated over the past several months something needs to be done we need to encourage middle class people to stay and actually to move into boston the only way to do that is to increase the number of moderately priced condos and single family homes for sale
8721173 there is nothing wrong with building luxury condos per se but we need to increase the housing stock overall so that everyone who wants to can afford to live in boston a rising tide lifts all boats they say and it is true in this case the more housing we have the greater options there will be for all potential homeowners
8721174 we all benefit by having a more diverse resident population and of course the city benefits through increased property tax and other tax revenues
8721175 well see you in the state house because of this tom
8721176 we have a responsibility to take care of the residents who cant afford to live in our city without our help however the city should not be a landlord
8721177 we do a shitty job of it the public housing properties are in disrepair and the areas have become unsafe for anyone living there more importantly housing projects have the unintended result of segregating the poor from the rest of the citys population by closing several of the projects these residents will become more integrated into the city and become a part of the community
8721178 we will insist on bold vision and world class architecture

8721182 i was thinking id have to move out of boston a couple years from now because of the high cost of housing but i wont have to now i know as well as a professor at harvard that building more housing can reduce the cost as well as improve the quality of our housing stock at the same time
8721183 ive seen the city through its good times and bad times i was born on the tough streets of south boston i lived in the north end back when jane jacobs called it the worst slum in america and i have lived in the south end since before anyone thought to move here back before mel king held a protest at tent city to demand better cheaper housing for the citys residents this proposal is the first time ive heard of something that actually might work
8721184 i love new buildings new architecture and new design and im living off a trust fund as are most of the people i know our parents will be so happy they can fund our fantasies just a little bit longer
8721185 the idea is horrible i am totally against it totally
8721186 more housing for our city and none of it deemed affordable how can that help anyone im going to be against this and do everything i can to make sure nothing is every built in this city any time any place any where

8721259 i look at blu ray being the obvious short term differentiator but if everything goes to digital download and over time it will then the blu ray device no longer has the same competitive advantage or the benefit is not as strong as the feature is
8721260 perhaps maybe five years maybe seven years i think the challenge with digital distribution is more because of piped to the home bandwidth than the technology within the systems
8721261 digital copyright issues have been resolved largely the cable companies have certainly shown that you can digitally encrypt and prevent theft of intellectual property over broadband if they can do it certainly our industry can do it
8721262 the ps3 has a nice upscaling chipset that really does make a standard definition dvd look a little bit crisper and better
8721263 is that enough to get you to buy one console versus the other as opposed to someone who is buying it for a game franchise

8721269 we believe that we presented the best case possible against sean fitzpatrick and that he alone is solely responsible for these murders we are fully prepared once again to present that compelling evidence along with further developed evidence to a jury on behalf of victims in this case

8721278 in terms of specific things it hasnt made much difference the original game fit on a 360 disk so it wasnt like we were in need of room weve tried to do what we can to make sure that the ps3 looks just as great as the 360 but in terms of necessarily utilising something specific about blu ray to my knowledge blu ray hasnt necessarily made a huge difference
8721279 right now we are supporting the ps3 launch we are really excited to be bringing the bioshock experience to a whole new set of fans weve been concentrating on ways to make this game special the things that weve added theyre not changing the original experience that the 360 fans and the pc fans got but are things that compliment nicely that experience
8721280 the answer is no right now this is a ps3 exclusive
8721281 the major difference lies in the fact that nintendo makes money with the hardware alone which may be a superior business model
8721282 but the wii is not succeeding at our expense it is not hurting us we decided years ago to build a game console that offers much greater functionality the playstation 3 has an enormous processor it is gradually emerging as the central server in our users homes

8721306 en principe liverpool est favori mais latletico madrid est aussi fort que liverpool eindhoven ils sont chaque fois l ils ont une grande exp rience aussi et ont de nouveau une tr s bonne quipe ils vont mon avis de nouveau facilement gagner le championnat cest une quipe quil ne faut certainement pas sous estimer si on se qualifie on sera encore plus dans leuphorie ce nest pas impossible mais ce sera dur que tu sois dans nimporte quel groupe tu sais davance que ce sera dur cest peut tre un peu plus dur maintenant ndlr que lon conna t notre groupe mais si on se qualifie on va se r galer
8721307 le tirage cest le tirage il ny a rien faire
8721308 cest un groupe relev pour les quatre quipes pour nous cest un plaisir de retrouver la ligue des champions avec un clasico contre le real madrid mais il y a aussi le zenit qui repr sente la progression des clubs de lest nos joueurs auront en tout cas coeur de d montrer quils sont au plus haut niveau et que la juve est de retour
8721309 cest un tirage homog ne dans un groupe relev on ne pr sente plus le bayern munich alors que le steaua bucarest repr sente un football roumain qui a beaucoup progress et qui est de plus en plus op rationnel la fiorentina a t demi finaliste de la derni re coupe de luefa et sort dune belle saison en italie cest galement tr s costaud il faudra tre r actif et prendre des points un peu de partout
8721310 ce nest pas du tout facile on a d j rencontr le bayern le steaua aussi mais jamais la fiorentina cest une premi re on recevra le bayern en dernier a peut tre d cisif lobjectif cest bien s r de passer ce premier tour cest le plus difficile dans le pass on avait d j battu stuttgart champion dallemagne on esp re en faire de m me avec le bayern m fions nous de la fiorentina car ils sont plus forts que ne lindique leur classement
8721311 en 2001 lyon nous avait battu 3 0 mais on avait gagn la ligue des champions apr s rires alors jesp re que cela se r p tera
8721312 il me semble que cest un beau groupe s rement int ressant a propos de chelsea cette quipe a quelque chose en plus mais nous avons pour nous la qualit atteinte ces derni res ann es jesp re que cest un patrimoine que les joueurs voudront conserver comme un tr sor
8721313 quand on se qualifie pour la phase de groupes de la ligue des champions on sait que ce qui nous attend ne sera pas facile nous connaissons liverpool pour les avoir affront s lan pass ca peut tre un avantage pour nous mais a peut tre aussi un avantage pour eux cela va tre compliqu pour toutes les quipes nous nous sommes renforc s cette saison mais sans que cela fasse pour autant de nous un favori dans ce groupe en championnat de france nous nous sommes fix s un objectif pr cis en ligue des champions il y a plein de param tres qui peuvent entrer en ligne de compte
8721314 je sentais que nous allions nous retrouver avec luca toni lancien attaquant de la fiorentina aujourdhui au bayern ndlr le destin la en quelque sorte voulu cest un groupe difficile mais pas impossible il y a des quipes expertes comme le bayern et dautres tout aussi importantes comme lyon qui ont une mentalit similaire la n tre en tout cas on jouera notre chance fond
8721315 cest un groupe tr s difficile parce quil y a la meilleure quipe du monde apr s les autres quipes vont lutter avec nous pour terminer deuxi me cest tr s dangereux de croire que nous sommes favoris pour la deuxi me place si nous pensons cela nous serons limin s il faut respecter tous les adversaires
8721316 on est dans un groupe o mon avis chaque quipe peut terminer la premi re ou quatri me place aucune des quipes ne peut gagner ghencea stade du steaua je ne crains aucun adversaire peut tre un peu le bayern munich lyon nest plus ce quil tait on va tous les d truire la venue de mutu avec la fiorentina va mettre de lambiance
8721317 on na pas t g t par le tirage avec trois grands adversaires on va essayer de faire bonne figure on esp re tous terminer au troisi me rang limportant est que nous soyons dans cette comp tition parmi l lite je serais satisfait si nous totalisions au moins trois points

8721436 y si no es electoral pues c mo va a ser la salida
8721437 es lo que no s y eso es grave porque la democracia es certeza y lo peor es que aunque parezca dif cil imaginarlo todav a pueden suceder cosas peores que ch vez y a todo esto se llega porque si tienes un gobierno que destroza al pa s y avanza menoscabando las libertades p blicas y del otro lado una oposici n que no enamora y que es torpe y sin ideas el c rculo est cerrado y la inercia que mantiene al gobierno es de poca duraci n es decir puede pasar cualquier cosa

8721448 we provide domestic and industrial customers with long term stable gas supply from the north west shelf venture at very competitive prices and to think we can absorb this extra cost into our business is unrealistic

8721457 the powder is fda approved and is already being used for hernia repairs and other applications
8721458 but it has never been used for this reason in people
8721459 this is a topic the army and department of defense are interested in because when injuries happen in war most of them are extremity injuries
8721460 with burns in particular we commonly end up with loss of digits
8721461 since the powder was fda approved and safe for use we figured we would try it
8721462 the idea was out there that it might work for this application but it had never been tried on humans
8721463 when put onto open wound it seems the body starts to regrow normal tissue
8721464 you pull a tail off a salamander and it regrows
8721465 the end of the tail forms what is called a blastema and that blastema elongates we think thats what happens when we put this powder on
8721466 this process of growing your fingers has happened to you before in your mothers womb
8721467 the code is there the dna is there what were trying to do is trick your body into doing that again
8721468 thats why were testing it on fingers vs legs if we apply it to a leg amputee the downside is the soldier wont be able to walk for several months and it may not work
8721469 the first time we saw an increase in length of the finger but the wound closed before further growth could occur
8721470 but were not sure how long it will take or if it will even work
8721471 if we have a soldier who was blown up by an ied and missing fingers and we have a chance to give him his fingers back increase his function how can we not try
8721472 you represent the thousands of shipmates who couldnt be here i want to express my our gratitude for everything you do out here

8721481 singing and writing music calms me down and is just something i do that gets my mind off of the everyday stresses of being deployed
8721482 when i was told cole was going to sing the national anthem at the induction ceremony i was concerned
8721483 i had never heard him sing a note and the significance of the national anthem sung in a cappella was strategic
8721484 until i heard him sing a few notes in rehearsal all it took for me to hear were a few notes after hearing coles melodic clear and rich voice my worries were belayed
8721485 i plan to attend the 2009 american idol competition when i return from my iraq tour
8721486 when i was younger singing was just something i did because i loved doing it
8721487 now it is completely different i want to make a career out of it
8721488 but ive always wanted to be a singer i had the chance to go overseas on assignment but i changed that to stay in the states so i could audition for american idol
8721489 my biggest accomplishment in the army is getting promoted to the rank of sergeant
8721490 i joined the army in my junior year of high school in order to support my now 3 year old daughter
8721491 music is what drives me to continue as well as the passion that i have to provide a good life for my daughter

8721618 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

8721655 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8721656 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8721657 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8721658 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8721659 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8721660 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8721661 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8721662 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

8721675 the strong sequential revenue growth in our fiscal fourth quarter was driven by increased demand from existing customers and a record number of new customer additions during the period we added over 700 new customers and now have over 5 000 cumulative customers the quarter was notable for the strong performance of our education vertical and broad demand from a very wide range of other customers importantly we have also won new contracts in our retail and government verticals which gives us increased momentum in these challenging areas as we enter our new fiscal year
8721676 revenues increased by 13 on a sequential basis and total deferred revenue was up 18 over the same period
8721677 total operating expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues on sequential basis and non gaap gross margins remained strong at 68 7 above our long term target range we ended the quarter with 101 7 million in cash and investments representing a 3 9 million increase on a sequential basis
8721678 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
8721679 third quarter results were stronger than we expected principally due to strong performance from our european operations during the month of july

8721683 investment in new product development remains essential to our delivering the value our customers have come to expect
8721684 in late 2007 we commenced a strategic review of our operations and explored all options available to us with a goal to maximize shareholder value
8721685 this included analysing our existing lines of business exploring the feasibility of bringing in new lines of business such as voice over the internet and in addition we assessed various merger and acquisition opportunities we believe this process has allowed us to identify the best outcome for our company and all our shareholders which is the acceptance of the offer to acquire our company by globalive communications corp as we announced on july 23rd globalive is continuing with its due diligence review of the company and we are confident that definitive terms of the merger may be settled by the end of q3 2008 i would like to thank all shareholders for their support as we work through the due diligence phase with globalive and at the same time we will continue to refine and execute on the rest of our strategic direction to help ensure the value of our company is maintained
8721686 as we move into the third quarter our plan is to come out with new and innovative marketing programs aimed at retaining and adding new customers for our casual calling lines of business this should have the quickest positive impact on revenue
8721687 we are also monitoring our expenses very closely and have made a number of cost reductions these two initiatives should help us reduce our loss our working capital position remains strong at 2 7m

8721691 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8721692 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8721693 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8721694 were delighted our hard work is being recognized this way

8721698 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8721699 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8721700 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8721701 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8721702 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8721703 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8721704 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8721705 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8721706 who are open to doing something on the production side
8721707 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8721708 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8721709 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8721710 the immediate takeover of absolut distribution in the us by pernod ricard usa is excellent news for the group we will now market and distribute the leading imported spirit and premium vodka in the u s which greatly enhances our position through both our size and the quality of our portfolio we are now the clear number two in the north american spirits market these factors will allow us to strengthen our growth in this key market i also wish all the best and a continued success in the future for the cruzan rum brand and the cruzan teams within fortune brands

8721716 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8721717 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

8721745 i absolutely think her anger is partly at her son and at her situation her frustration is being that she cant slow down with her son i think her rooted anger is with everybody who comes to advise her and say she cant do this or that and she would like to tell them all to fuck themselves and go away
8721746 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8721747 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8721748 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8721749 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8721750 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8721752 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8721753 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8721754 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8721755 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8721756 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8721757 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8721758 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8721759 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8721760 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

8721764 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8721765 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8721766 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8721767 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8721768 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8721769 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8721770 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8721771 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8721772 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8721773 no matter how many justifications folks find for misusing illegal immigrants this is a bad deal all the way around
8721774 anyone who helps flood america with an exploitable underclass labor pool side steps the rule of law burdens our hospitals schools social service system and the tax payers who pay the bills and otherwise enables illegal immigration is crying for some attention we are in a postion to help
8721775 ice and other government agencies cannot be relied upon to get serious and consistent with disrupting the flow of illegal immigrants being seduced into this country

8721846 hunken and i wanted to make wine but we needed help
8721847 so we did what you do which is send out letters to everyone you know the people we were sure would invest didnt but peter did

8721885 it was difficult for us but weve got through so it has been a positive day all round
8721886 we kept on knocking on the door they were in the box seat and could afford to get people behind the ball and play the counter attack
8721887 we always had to be mindful of that but in the end we got our rewards
8721888 after an hours play i thought we upped our energy levels and our play was more progressive
8721889 from that point onwards through extra time there was only one team that looked like they were going to nick it
8721890 we had a couple of chances michael johnson could very well have won it before the end of play
8721891 but well take the result it doesnt matter how we go through
8721892 its a bit of a lottery with penalties but were delighted weve overcome this hurdle
8721893 youre always relieved there are no easy games its a cliche but in

8721899 i know that everton are a big club who have a history of playing in important competitions like the uefa cup
8721900 i hope i can do my best for the team
8721901 the draw is the draw theres nothing to do about it
8721902 even after seeing the teams we will play you dont know if it will be an easy or difficult first phase
8721903 our first objective is to get to the next phase the second is to try to do so as group b winners
8721904 of course were really motivated and confident we want to start playing the champions league as soon as possible
8721905 for us its great to be welcomed back to the champions league with a classic encounter against real madrid
8721906 but theres also zenit who represent the progression of east european teams our players need to remember that theyre playing at the highest level and that juve are back

8721912 how many teams will beat manchester united and chelsea this year
8721913 i dont think theyll lose more than three games each
8721914 without being a silly optimist how many points would you expect us to get from these opening three games
8721915 we took one point from them last season and that point was against manchester united when we got absolutely battered in the second half we played better against them this season and lost 1 0
8721916 it would be nice to get a point or three points up at everton but if youve got any brains how many points did people expect us to get from our first three games nine i dont think so unless youre an idiot
8721917 look at tottenham theres every chance theyll have no points after three games they play at on sunday but no one will say theyll get relegated
8721918 our owner has been fantastic with what weve spent especially when you consider weve got the smallest capacity in the premier league but we have to balance the books and thats how it should be
8721919 ill be happy to get in a couple of good loan players from abroad ive got a couple in mind i would love to take people who can do something a bit different the right hand side is an area where we need someone with a bit of pace
8721920 i am temporarily leaving the club that i always dreamed of playing for since i was a child and the team that has given me the chance to win the most important trophies
8721921 it was a difficult choice but i thought about it and there was total agreement between the club and myself and i want to thank the directors for that
8721922 i will go and tackle this new and fascinating challenge and hope to improve for it
8721923 i wish my teammates a million successes until i get back
8721924 when you are in hat three you know what is going to come you cannot avoid two big clubs
8721925 roma and chelsea are two of europes biggest clubs the romanian team deserve respect too
8721926 personally i was most impatient for the drawing of the final team because i would rather have avoided fiorentina atletico madrid shakhtar donetsk and dynamo kiev
8721927 if we manage to play well and we are lucky enough to have a chance going into the final match it would be an exploit for the club
8721928 im absolutely delighted to be here as everyone knows it has been drawn out for a few weeks between the clubs agreeing the fee and what have you but obviously im delighted to be here and to finally get it sorted i cant wait to crack on now
8721929 i did everything in my power to get here i was pleading with the chairman at mk dons to get the deal done and the chance to work with the gaffer once again was obviously a key factor
8721930 ive no idea whats going on its very hard to get communication with some people in life
8721931 clearly theres not long to go youll have to wait with bated breath
8721932 fiorentina have got their attraction with luca toni lyon will be a tough nut to crack and steau have a very strong team this group is tough but we are looking forward to the games in the champions league
8721933 it is a group that should not be underestimated lyon bucharest and fiorentina are hard to ply against and are big clubs in their own countries
8721934 its a gem for luca toni and lots of football fans in germany and italy to meet fiorentina im looking forward to all these games and am convinced that we will achieve our goal of qualifying from the group
8721935 i would have rather have drawn another larger team such as chelsea manchester united or arsenal but not lyon

8721937 were all in good spirits and well prepared i think well give a good account of ourselves its an important match and were hoping to play well
8721938 all my friends loved ones relatives even acquaintances will come to the game and the support will be great the stadium is not capable of holding everyone but those fans will be in the ground and those outside will provide great support
8721939 we hope most of them get to see the match and well try to get a positive result
8721940 our fans are the best and well show what we can do for them
8721941 we have a friendly team were very close and new players dont feel any discomfort they settle in very quickly
8721942 hes a good player and proved that at dinamo moskva im glad he has joined the competition has got stronger those who think he can play only in midfield are mistaken because hes versatile he can play in attack so that means theres more competition up front as well
8721943 its a competitive game for us and im really looking forward to it

8721952 the americans know very well that such people were brought up and trained in iranian intelligence system

8721986 it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff
8721987 even as late as lunchtime today thursday we believed we had secured a new investment package to ensure future operations but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying
8721988 having been unable to complete the investment package the directors of zoom had no option but to instigate insolvency administration proceedings
8721989 these are things that were going to work through and if we find passengers in difficult circumstances everybodys going to have to work together to deal with that

8722029 that due to climate change their own water consumption could lead within days to the deaths of millions of people
8722030 before this century is over billions of us will die and the few breeding pairs of people that survive will be in the arctic where the climate remains tolerable
8722031 average annual temperature will rise by up to 3 5 degrees by 2070 placing greater stress on elderly residents and those living in older homes with inadequate insulation
8722032 the increased incidence of extreme heat days and heat waves in conjunction with a growing and ageing population in the peninsula has the potential to contribute to significant mortality in future decades
8722033 potential impacts ability to affect entire population especially elderly and infants 27 000 elderly 8000 infants and young people increased mortality and morbidity in vulnerable groups
8722034 death rates were around 50 80 per 100 000 in june july and august winter while they were around 30 50 per 100 000 in the rest of the year
8722035 it is understandable that more deaths would occur in winters in cold or temperate regions but even in a subtropical region a decrease in temperatures in winters may increase human mortality
8722036 from 1980 2000 around 1600 excess winter deaths occurred each year with winter mortality rates 18 per cent higher than expected from non winter rates
8722037 all regions showed more annual cold related mortality than heat related mortality
8722038 some of those who died in the heat may not have lived long if a heatwave had not occurred mortality often falls below baseline for several days after the end of a heatwave indicating that some of the people dying during the heatwave were already close to death
8722039 falls in temperature in winter are closely followed by increased mortality suggesting that most excess winter deaths are due to relatively direct effects of cold on the population
8722040 our data suggest that any increases in mortality due to increased temperatures would be outweighed by much larger short term declines in cold related mortalities
8722041 the rise in temperature of 3 6f expected over the next 50 years would increase heat related deaths in britain by about 2000 but reduce cold related deaths by about 20 000
8722042 given the scenarios of regional warming during the next three decades the expected changes in mortality due to direct climatic effects in these major coastal australian cities are minor

8722095 id like to play george clooneys part in a musical version of
8722096 hes much larger than life a very big character and thats always tough to pull off onscreen and make you believe you can only be that big with an element of unselfconsciousness because if anyone was that self conscious theyd realize they were acting in a slightly stupid way so we had to sort of give that to him to make him genuine in terms of believing the things he says and being passionate about it its entertaining to do a big character but if theres no truthfulness in it its only like doing sketch comedy it can last for about half an hour but if you really want people to invest in a movie and see it all the way through then you really have to have heart and soul so that people will somehow empathize with him at the end of his journey the most important thing about marschz is that he is uncynical for all his foolishness and his naivete hes not cynical thats a key to why i think it works
8722097 i dont think americans like looking at ugly people onscreen and the british love looking at ugly people because they think well im more beautiful than he is so that makes me feel better about myself whereas americans want to aspire to something they want to be i can look that beautiful i just need to work out and get some plastic surgery americans generally like people who are successful whereas british people are very schadenfreude about taking pleasure in anothers misfortune you can never be too successful in america in britain you can be too successful
8722098 well id ask him what he thought of our stuff id like to know what his favorite films were id like to ask how he made his plays work for a popular audience because one of the things that i think is forgotten about shakespeare people see him as very rarefied and his work being high art and although it is that is very illuminating and sheds light on the human condition what people forget it that it was performed in front of the equivalent of blue collar people in those days he had to perform for royalty but he also had to make illiterate people laugh and some of his references are lost in translation if he was alive today hed be making references to american idol things like that would be on his radar as much as all the great questions of state but id be interested to see what he would do
8722099 he is more than any other contemporary political figure a creature of these times

8722118 quello di sapere ispirare la gente infondere la speranza guidarla verso un orizzonte pi alto ha lintelligenza e la curiosit che non possono mancare in un presidente ha mostrato di avere una chiara comprensione della politica estera delle sfide sul fronte della sicurezza nazionale e una ferma determinazione a rimettere in sesto le nostre forze armate

8722126 rogers communications inc is revamping its data rate plans and extending a limited time offer on the iphone in order to spur sales of smartphones
8722127 the toronto based company canadas largest cellphone provider on thursday said it will extend the 30 a month data plan
8722128 liz hamilton spokesperson for rogers said the plan is being extended so that buyers of the blackberry bold which was released last week can take advantage of it
8722129 rogers will introduce a 25 a month data plan for the iphone and other smartphones on oct 1 that will allow 500 megabytes of downloading per month which will be bundled with a three month promotion of unlimited usage
8722130 another plan will allow one gigabyte of usage for 30
8722131 hamilton said just over one per cent of iphone owners used more than one gigabyte of data in their first month while about 95 per cent of owners used less than 500mb
8722132 unlike other cellphone carriers rogers is allowing customers to tether their smartphones or connect them to a computer and use them as a modem
8722133 in this back to school season college kids are buying macs in numbers never seen before a recent survey by student monitor a new jersey outfit that tracks the buying habits of college students found that 13 of all undergrads expect to buy a new notebook this fall of those 43 say they plan to get a macbook or macbook pro nearly double those who said they expected to get a dell notebook and seven times as many as those who plan to buy from hp says eric weil the firms managing partner while students prefer dell for desktop computers thats small consolation students favor notebooks over desktops by a factor of nearly 5 to 1
8722134 back to school time has always been important for apple in 2007 the company sold nearly 2 2 million macs in its fourth quarter ended sept 30 up 34 from the year earlier period those computers brought in 3 1 billion during the 2007 quarter half of all the companys revenue
8722135 another blowout quarter is in the offing analyst gene munster of piper jaffray pjc wrote in a research note on aug 25 that the latest numbers from market researcher npd suggest apple could sell as many as 2 9 million macs this quarter that would mean a surge of 34 from the same quarter a year ago on the ipod and iphone front npd data munster says suggest sales in the ballpark of 11 million and 4 million units respectively add it all up and you have the makings of a quarter where apple could beat wall street consensus numbers by 8 and report earnings per share as high as 1 19
8722136 moreover apple has of late been defying trends in the computer industry it has been winning share of the personal computer market reaching 8 5 in the u s behind dell and hp according to the most recent gartner it report in the second quarter it saw its year on year growth rate in unit shipments hit 38 thats three times the rate of growth at dell seven times faster than hp and nine times faster than the pc industry as a whole
8722137 students want to buy products that are cool and the perception about windows at the moment is anything but the ipod tends to entice people from windows over to the mac and the iphone will only add to that trend
8722138 next thing you know theyll be voting outside the 2 party system

8722182 journalists novelists artists businesspeople now anyone can talk to the world on the web
8722183 these are civilians not computer experts and looking at the history of the web we know that both groups can succeed
8722184 have become more or less equally popular to the professional journalists on television and radio this is a real change in the world
8722185 but many have found it satisfying to address a smaller audience
8722186 mina trott of six apart said that its perfectly okay to blog to an audience of fifteen people if they are the right fifteen people size does not equal success if youre addressing the right people
8722187 so you have an equal opportunity to become a contributor
8722188 and a definite barrier to entry thats changed now the new tools that are web oriented
8722189 look at how many popular web 2 0 sites are not built in java google ebay amazon use java but many are not huge numbers of sites are built with rails and php for us in the java community this is a pretty big change java has always been very central livejournal these were obviously not built by professional programmers we should not disrespect them
8722190 we look at the orielly book sales to see whats coming
8722191 rubys a little trickier to understand rails is a web framework based on ruby and its the reason the sales of ruby books are growing
8722192 the security story is very bad as its very susceptible to sql injection attacks
8722193 youve got complex sql code inside complex php code inside complex html
8722194 if you want performance you need to use java but if time to market is the most important thing then maybe youll want to use another application
8722195 for twenty years sun has been saying the network is the computer and it is
8722196 the network is heterogeneous and thats not going to change we have to deal with it our job is to live in this world so we have to figure out how to get all these things talking to each other this has been the biggest problems in our profession for years now
8722197 integration is probably the number one problem we face and rest is probably the solution
8722198 the financial industry in particular and government are all about information they dont manufacture anything they just get the information repackage it aggregate it deliver it support it
8722199 if you do that you really need to figure out this web 2 0 stuff
8722200 my component needs a resource script stylesheet image it needs to be in the head or body or form but im not in the head or body or correct form can you please just do the right thing for me
8722201 dieser client steht ohne eingabe eines vorbestellercodes jedem zur verf gung

8722203 this decision is acknowledging what is common sense to many if you are paying government militia to do your dirty work then you are responsible for their conduct
8722204 would be advised to reconsider their positions that payment to sections of the indonesian military linked to extrajudicial killings murder and torture of papuan citizens is an acceptable business practice
8722205 omaru they say you are dead your people want to hear you
8722206 the rationale is unique to the kpe in view of the safety concerns and is not applied to arterial roads or other expressways on the surface
8722207 the script bowl a rapid fire comparison of scripting languages
8722208 weve re dedicated ourselves to work in this area performance in windows 7 and ie 8
8722209 this is a major initiative across each of our feature teams as well as the primary mission of one of our feature teams
8722210 im somewhat skeptical how much improvement theyre going to make at this point
8722211 anyone checking any code into windows 7 not only has to make sure its the most secure code and the most reliable code but theyd better be addressing the performance of the code as well
8722212 keep the cpu utilization low as that improves multi user scenarios as well as reduces power consumption
8722213 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8722214 showed that being young is not necessarily being inexperienced or not being ready to lead
8722215 there is just no comparison between clintons first run and obama clinton was a governor executive position for 8 years obama hasnt even completed his first term as senator dont forget hes spent most of it campaigning rather than legislating spin it all you want hes just not ready for the most important job in the world
8722216 in 1992 when i ran they called me young and inexperienced sound familiar
8722217 i love google calendar but i wish i could set a reminder for a month in advance instead of a measly 2 weeks that is the only thing holding calendar back from being truly awesome
8722218 whenever i see you wearing a respirator i know to stay a long way away
8722219 i dont want to be in love dance floor anthem
8722220 hold on sos thats just the way we roll when you look me in the eyes remix
8722221 wat hebben jullie veel fietsen hier jullie zijn vast wereldkampioen
8722222 5 things that should not be on your church home page
8722223 territory will be better equipped to develop waste management policies without undermining its fiscal duties
8722224 originally it was intended that the wma would work toward self sufficiency but that has not happened nor does it appear that it will occur
8722225 the authoritys operating budget is derived from the general fund and its capital requirements will be served through bonds of the government in the same fashion as all executive branch agencies
8722226 however the fiscal policies of the central government cannot be imposed upon the authority due to its status as a semi autonomous agency
8722227 presently the authoritys policies are set by an independent board which may conflict with the policies of the central government this lack of coordination can only serve to undermine the cohesive development of solid waste policies with other policies established for the territory
8722228 without impairment of civil service status and seniority and without reduction in compensation notwithstanding any changes in job titles or duties and without loss of accrued rights to holidays sick leave vacation and other benefits
8722229 although these duties were placed in the hands of the authority the personnel and other infrastructure were not transferred to the authority and therefore it was unable to implement septic system programs
8722230 the agency will be able develop its fees and charges through rules and regulations but public hearings are required so that the community may have input during the process and not at the end
8722231 we are encouraging firms to improve their management of liquidity risk and to reduce over time their reliance on tri party repos for overnight financing of less liquid forms of collateral
8722232 blaming tri party repo is like blaming a car for speeding
8722233 it is the driver or in this case dealers who were the cause of the problem
8722234 might be facilitated by the introduction of a central counterparty but may also be achievable under the current framework for clearing and settlement
8722235 the fed has taken a measured approach to understanding the market associated with tri party repo
8722236 i feel it is the answer to our social economic and political situation in the virgin islands i feel the more closely aligned we are to national politics the more aligned we are with the mainstream the more we will be recognized by america at large
8722237 oh i will go to my grave with some of those things
8722238 the candidate had already gotten the votes so the people did not want to stay we would be waiting there like sheep the convention would be almost empty and we were still waiting to vote
8722239 weve got virginia west virginia wisconsin washington wyoming people will stay
8722240 i think i want to accomplish a couple more things but in two to four years ill probably step aside
8722241 so in just this scenario were seeing a spread of about 30
8722242 theres a legal way to do things and an illegal way to do things and the way its being done is illegal
8722243 we realize we have some internal issues and were working on them
8722244 its not our goal to put you out of business but we need to take care of this community and not gouge the people
8722245 the things im asking you to do are not outrageous get a receipt book get a digital camera follow the rules
8722246 please note that this request is all inclusive specifically the newspaper is requesting photocopies of current contracts and expired contracts wherever applicable to show each officials full employment profile of salary position job description benefits and bonuses
8722247 met the established goals and objectives associated with your incentive pay out
8722248 during the course of the audit those documents were not provided to the auditors although on numerous occasions we requested all documents relating to payments all documents related to contracts
8722249 a lot of the stuff that is coming to light during the course of the investigation a lot of documents we never got during the course of the audit
8722250 we said that we couldnt meet all of our objectives because we knew everything wasnt given to us
8722251 the teenager is unharmed and is staying away from home due to personal reasons

8722310 what barack obama has accomplished is the single most extraordinary event that has occurred in the 232 years of the nations political history the event itself is so extraordinary that another chapter could be added to the bible to chronicle its significance
8722311 biblical hope is similar like obamian hope it speaks to the matter of the future being pulled into the present in the kingdom of god
8722312 the obama campaign uses a religious calling as its central rhetorical trope im asking you to believe reads the banner across the top of barackobama
8722313 baracks appeal is actually messianic its something about his aura his spirit his soul that exudes enlightenment in the making he is one of those individuals who communicates god like energy metaphorically speaking in whom you can feel god hes a lot closer to a jesus type than the other candidates
8722314 he appeals to all that is innate and created in us in a longing for that better country that is a heavenly one discussed in hebrews 11 thus he offers a messianic hope with the full weight and force of the u s government to back him up heaven on earth is indeed appealing rather than having to wait

8722347 that doesnt mean the weakness couldnt last longer but such additional weakness would have to be forecast then based on the sentiment readings that prevailed at that time

8722349 in the last five years the situation has reversed itself dramatically
8722350 reviewing the relationship over the last three months between bullion and the sentiment among gold timers id have to say that the big surprise to me was how short lived were bullions reactions to sentiment extremes

8722373 unless howard industries had violated the provisions of senate bill 2988 after its enactment date of july 1 the state legislation would not be implicated
8722374 the possible penalties facing howard appear to be federal in nature
8722375 the raid conducted monday on howard industries was a result of an independent federal investigation
8722376 any comment on potential state investigations charges or penalties is premature
8722377 its important to realize that people want to point fingers at the immigrants but the businesses are taking advantage of that situation

8722384 but this year the hero that will eventually save the world will emerge and it doesnt happen just by accident
8722385 i think we feel a little bit more confident this year because weve established ourselves as our own entity

8722398 traditionally integrators have had to purchase displays set up pass through systems for control and purchase and set up control processors that could handle each of the displays individually
8722399 this complex process can add substantial cost to an installation and add time and complexity
8722400 now nuvision provides a complete custom video install solution from the display back to the source
8722401 the ncmvir46 is part of making things easier for our dealers as it simplifies installation by delivering hd component video over cat 5 with built in control for all nuvision displays and can control four high definition source devices

8722403 the ncmvir46 will allow ir to be passed through from the front of any nuvision display to control any high definition source up to 1 000 feet away and any other ir controlled device including lighting or motorized window treatment simply connect the cat 5 cable from the ncmvir46 to any nuvision display with a nuwire rj45 connection for plug n play hd distribution and control

8722414 its unfortunate because howard is one of the largest employers in this area and they have to hire workers to run the plant
8722415 i think that this is going to have a huge economic impact on the county and the state as well as the humanitarian aspect the families involved i can see all sides of this it is a very complex issue
8722416 the way to gauge what damage this is going to do to the county is to look at sales tax numbers
8722417 we probably wont know until the numbers become available in two months what consequences this ripple effect will have on the county
8722418 if a major hurricane hits like with gustav churning out in the gulf howard provides transformers that rebuild our electric system
8722419 if the plant is down for a day that affects production which will affect supply that affects you and me and every home in the county

8722439 i think its one of the better pieces of news in a while in a long while for the stroke survivor

8722441 some of these people were actually in a wheelchair when they started and a lot were using canes and walkers

8722461 coach adler has worked extremely hard over the past four years to help us build the program he has great relationships with the all of our student athlete and he understands everything that we need to do to be successful at la salle

8722466 you still have mold and mildew issues you still have wet floors saturated sheetrock and insulation possibly electrical
8722467 it can actually be even worse mold starts to grow within 72 hours once they think everything is dried up about 3 days they can start having other damage they re not even aware of
8722468 y ou are aware that my chronic back condition is increasingly limiting my ability to work and travel
8722469 the inevitable day has come when i must tell you i am no longer physically able to do my job i cannot give abp the performance that it expects of its chief executive or i require of myself
8722470 for more than 10 years i have continued to do my job despite degenerative disc disease and failed back syndrome
8722471 chronic intractable pain now prevents me from sitting or standing for more than a few minutes at a time for the past year and a half your encouragement and cooperation has allowed me to continue in this role while working from home despite those accommodations my health has continued to decline now resulting in cognitive impairments and depression that only amplify the effects of chronic pain
8722472 the surgery i face may temporarily slow the degeneration of my spine but my doctors tell me the natural course of this disease will produce only worse symptoms and more limitations so i am making the tough decisions now that will put me in the best position to manage the pain and give me the best chance to reclaim a healthy lifestyle
8722473 the associated baptist press board of directors is deeply saddened by gregs health issues that are forcing him to seek full disability
8722474 greg has provided the leadership to give abp a solid foundation and to prepare the organization to move forward in the ever changing world of journalism and religious media we know he will continue to support our work and someday we hope he can again write for abp
8722475 saying greg is a respected colleague is only the start of it for almost our whole adult lives hes been a traveling companion confidant soulmate and fellow baseball fan i cant imagine doing this work especially going to big baptist meetings without him i just love the guy
8722476 hes always been after the stories that explain faith and life and doing church
8722477 whether its covering baptists initial response to aids one of his early ground breaking news packages or church architecture the baptist battles or the impact of changing worship styles greg has helped all of us understand the context in which we share our faith we cant repay the debt we owe him
8722478 helped abp to emerge at a time when the southern baptist conventions news service was no longer willing or able to provide the kind of reliable news that baptists expected
8722479 greg shaped a press organization that has achieved excellence in detail and thoroughness
8722480 he exercised great courage in guiding a new organization out of the fragmentation of denominational controversy and schism
8722481 he is aggressive fair and above all honest he defines christian journalism he showed a baptist can report about baptist affairs with credibility his leadership gave abp a large national following he is the reason that abp has survived and succeeded for all these years
8722482 greg warner has played a historic role within the baptist family as the founding editor of associated baptist press
8722483 his commitment to a free baptist press and to journalistic integrity has been a valuable and valued contribution
8722484 from the time i first started on the religion beat greg was a great source and informative guide to the world of southern baptists
8722485 in his soft spoken way he provided insight and humor to what was often a rancorous story over time he became my friend as well
8722486 i consider greg to be a paragon of ethical enterprising and courageous journalism he is one of the people who has really stood up for the free flow and fearless flow of information about religious affairs in this country at a time when that is oh so necessary as it will continue to be
8722487 i believe he has made a great contribution to journalism in establishing associated baptist press and that will be an institution that i think will define him for many of us who have had the good good fortune to know him
8722488 i have learned from his stories and appreciated his professional presence in the newsroom of the annual southern baptist convention
8722489 i admire his ability to meet the demands and necessary diligence of journalism as he dealt with a most difficult condition and am sorry he has reached a point where he feels that is not currently possible

8722544 he looks to be in great shape he looks ready to go
8722545 theres no reason to believe he wont be 100 percent for training camp
8722546 i wanted to see him run unencumbered go through agility drills jumping drills the things players do you hope they dont limp or favor a leg he did not that was number one
8722547 on top of that i was impressed by what he did with his body to get in shape and get stronger it was obvious to me he had been in the weight room
8722548 he hasnt been in a game since january so obviously training camp will be very important

8722553 while i truly regret to see him leave our organization my first thought is to thank craig for his major contributions to delhaize group over the past seven years and wish him the best in this new job
8722554 craig has provided exemplary leadership in the companys drive to build strong finance strategy and it organisations and those organizations will continue to support our performance and growth going forward very capable professionals are in place in each of the functional areas under craigs responsibility we have begun a process that will be diligently pursued to choose a new cfo
8722555 although i am looking forward to this new professional opportunity it is a difficult decision to leave delhaize group where i have enjoyed the chance to work with such a capable management team in a company with its well deserved reputation for industry leadership

8722665 they were starting to leave and to move towards the door
8722666 she stopped just inside the doorway and turned round and said well i can stick something in you at that point there was a short jab
8722667 i couldnt say it was an attempted stab but it was certainly showing a motion
8722668 i could see a length of what i remember being orange and white plastic and what looked like an orange stopper it was a syringe
8722669 she was pointing the syringe upwards then whipped it behind her back

8722672 it does not matter that you do not want to buy a tie and that you hate me i will show you that i am bigger than that if you continue over that hill to the east for about two miles you will find a lovely restaurant it has all the ice cold water you need shalom
8722673 most of the advisers i meet really dont understand the bond market and some of them are really open about it
8722674 a basic canadian domestic bond fund is not all that sexy it doesnt have the sex appeal
8722675 people trust the banks and theyre in love with their gics
8722676 we believe that once people understand what bonds are and what theyre getting theyll be very happy because its a lot more flexible than a gic
8722677 bonds are the one asset class that do wonderfully well when the world is fairly grim
8722678 at this point in time when as we think the world is not looking all that bright it makes sense to be long in bonds and take advantage of the negative things that are happening
8722679 the beauty of bonds is that theyre the precise opposite of the stock market
8722680 if you buy stocks and the economy does well you do great but you do horribly if the economy does poorly when you buy bonds youre basically hedging your exposure to that because bonds do well in the exact opposite situation
8722681 where things get a little bit complicated is if the prevailing interest rate in the market changes over those five years other people may be willing to pay you more of less for that bond
8722682 if you get a five per cent bond and the prevailing interest rate falls to four per cent you still get your five per cent
8722683 if youre truly worried about the world government bonds are the place to be theyre the safest place simply because governments as a general rule dont go under
8722684 the downside is that youre not going to get a great rate of return because the uncertainty is so low

8722687 sometimes it just takes a lack of horrendous news to allow something to fall back up if you push a spring down hard enough it will snap back at you almost every time even one thats pretty rusty and old
8722688 weighing together likely slowdowns in export growth and consumer spending and the continued troubles in the banking and housing sectors forecasters expect gdp growth to slow to about 1 5 per cent in the third quarter and to near zero in the fourth
8722689 i said last year that the greens were awful and something needed to be done
8722690 im not a bad putter and i cant remember the last time i three putted from 18 inches
8722691 at the end of the week unfortunately the tournament could be won or lost by luck on the greens
8722692 they are the people i feel really sorry for there is a lot riding on that
8722693 they are going to be feeling pressure as it is and you dont want to be standing over a three footer with so much doubt in your mind not knowing if the ball is going to run straight
8722694 you cant bring the ryder cup onto greens like this hopefully they will rip them up and re do them
8722695 the greens are not overly smooth but i felt i was a little bit unlucky every time i hit it in the rough i got a bad lie i dont think ive blown myself out of it i could have done but i didnt
8722696 even if someone has to cart me into the car on sunday and ive done all i can i can be pleased and proud of myself

8722705 we have had discussions with the sec filip said in the press conference
8722706 can make up their own minds were hopeful and encouraged that theyll follow us in this direction
8722707 the new guidelines expressly encourage corporations to comply with the waiver and disclosure programs of other agencies including the sec and epa
8722708 legislation of course would bind all federal agencies and could not be changed except by an act of congress
8722709 the justice departments track record of five different policies in ten years cries out for a permanent legislative solution that cannot be revised at the whim of each new deputy attorney general
8722710 the new doj policy does not address similar offending policies on privilege at other federal ageincies including the securities and exchange commission

8722728 international financial reporting standards represents the best opportunity to achieve the goal of a single set of high quality because of its current widespread use outside of the u s
8722729 we realize significant work lies ahead in preparing for a transition but believe ifrs has proven to be a reputable set of standards for preparing transparent information

8722827 the slanderous allegations that are being made by mr ford in an attempt to clear his name i think are unfortunate
8722828 first our money the pound or the euro is very strong and because of that the turnover from those countries is heavier than they used to be
8722829 so for ubisoft turnover europe is actually more important than the us now and by more than 5 per cent its become a very strong market for us
8722830 because of the volumes its becoming more and more important to localise and not only to localise the language but also to make sure that the product will be closer to the mentality of that country
8722831 we feel that it is a wake up call to companies that have web sites that are selling goods and services

8722836 in our understanding of the business model we are actually giving away the rights to play and if you just pass it on pass it on pass it on that is not comparable to second hand sales in the normal physical goods area where you have physical wear out second hand cars second hand clothes second hand books theyre all physically wearing out so you have an inferior quality product but digital goods is not actually becoming inferior in quality so people passing that on is actually very challenging for us

8722844 the goal of the videogames defense is to both shift blame and to explain to a judge and jury why this good kid is suddenly acting like a terrorist
8722845 portraying your client as the victim of outside forces be they child abuse coercion by peers or an ultra violent videogame industry humanizes the client and shifts the culpability while i dont believe that violent videogames tend to have any negative effects on otherwise healthy people my job is to present any theory to a jury that would explain why my client did the things he did
8722846 an unsophisticated typically older somewhat more rural jury pool or judge
8722847 to an extent the defendant is playing on the prejudices that these members of society already have towards videogames

8722887 we might see oil prices spike us 5 to us 8 if it really rips into platforms
8722888 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8722889 there are a lot of good people in that line
8722890 but there are about two dozen who think they have the run of the line theyre running dope or carrying out drug abuse with impunity

8723167 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
8723168 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
8723169 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8723170 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8723171 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8723172 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8723173 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8723174 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8723175 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8723176 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8723177 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8723178 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8723179 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8723180 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8723181 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8723182 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8723183 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8723184 i see a generation rising up to take their place with selfless faith i see a new revival staring as we pray and seek were on our knees were on our knees
8723185 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8723186 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8723187 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8723188 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8723189 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8723190 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8723191 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8723192 no one works for someone we all just work together
8723193 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8723194 dit is niet hoe ik het bedoeld heb dit is niet hoe ik het wil
8723195 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8723196 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8723197 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8723198 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8723199 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8723200 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8723201 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8723202 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8723203 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8723204 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8723205 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8723206 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8723207 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8723208 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8723209 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8723210 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8723211 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8723212 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8723213 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8723214 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8723215 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8723216 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8723217 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8723218 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8723219 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8723220 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8723221 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8723222 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8723223 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8723224 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
8723225 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8723226 this is an exciting day for hockey fans in alberta and throughout canada
8723227 the bid group from alberta put forward a great plan and the site selection committee was particularly impressed with the bids focus on making tickets affordable for all hockey fans we had two outstanding bids to consider and both groups would have been great hosts of the 2012 iihf world junior championship today after completing the selection process we feel that alberta will present an event that will make all canadians proud
8723228 a joint calgary edmonton bid is a natural choice when it comes to the world junior championship
8723229 both markets are home to model junior franchises and some of the best junior hockey fans in the country
8723230 we are thrilled to have partnered with edmonton and won the bid to host this prestigious event
8723231 the world junior hockey championship is truly a canadian tradition and a tremendous event that we anticipate will bring significant benefit to the province of alberta the tourism industry and the hockey community
8723232 calgary and edmonton have outstanding reputations for hosting international sport events and we expect the 2012 world junior championship to enjoy tremendous success
8723233 this is a premier international event and will be a great opportunity for all of alberta to see the best young hockey players in the world compete for their countries

8723242 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno
8723243 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro l orizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso
8723244 ogni santa notte ogni volta che chiudo gli occhi lei li ogni volta che la mia mente vuota lei la occupa oh wiliam quando tu non ci sei io mi sento cos inutile cos debole e lei mi logora dallinterno mi sento come se fossi divisa in miliardi di coriandoli tutti senza senso e tu non so come riesci a dargli quel senso riesci a farmi sentire che esisto quando invece io non so pi chi sono non lo so pi
8723245 ho visto te fra lei sue braccia ho sentito il male che ti ha fatto dalla prima volta che sei entrato in questa stanza penso che questa sia colpa tua
8723246 tu hai risvegliato la parte peggiore di me quella che mi faceva male ho rivisto frammenti del suo e del tuo passato ho visto come la guardavi ed anche se non volevo credere che fossi tu quel ragazzo inconsciamente io invidiavo natalie perch so che non potrai mai guardarmi come guardavi lei
8723247 ho sentito la sua perfidia lei mi perseguita mi dice che non sono niente e che tu gli apparterrai per leternit
8723248 ero gi un vampiro allepoca lei non lo sapeva o almeno io non glielo avevo confessato me ne innamorai perdutamente nellistante i cui la vidi
8723249 era bellissima fui superficiale a limitarmi allapparenza cominciai a frequentare il suo castello ogni giorno ogni notte sorgeva proprio qui questa era la sua stanza
8723250 decisi di dirle la verit ero stupidamente sicuro che lei mi amasse solo ora so quanto mi stessi sbagliando non so come ma venne a conoscenza della mia natura da sola allepoca circolavano strane dicerie sui vampiri si diceva che mangiando le nostre carni si poteva ottenere limmortalit senza linconveniente della dannazione
8723251 ma io non volevo vedere non volevo sentire volevo solo lei lultima sera che la vidi nella sua stanza fui attaccato da un esercito di vampiri allora non potevo pi sfuggire dalla realt
8723252 ero forte ma non cos forte per sfuggire ad un esercito lei era li di fronte a me mentre gli altri mi tenevano in modo che non potessi sfuggire non so come riusc a farsi ubbidire da quei vampiri non so nemmeno cosa promise loro in cambio mi disse il suo desiderio ed il suo intento mi aveva venduto ad una nobile famiglia del tempo in cambio di qualche trancio della mia carne lei voleva limmortalit la bellezza eterna lunica cosa importante per lei mi disse che avrebbe mangiato le miei carni che in questo modo avrebbe esaudito anche il mio desiderio essere parte di lei per sempre capii che era pazza che ero stato uno stupido a cercare qualcosa di cos profondo come lamore in una come lei ale era cos fredda cos vuota
8723253 mi fece rinchiudere nelle segrete del suo palazzo quello fu il suo unico errore piegai le sbarre di quella prigione avevo un solo desiderio ucciderla
8723254 rotornai nelle sue stanze alla mia vista i suoi occhi si riempirono di paura di terrore e ne fui felice perch in qualche modo ero riuscito a fargliprovare almeno unemozione alla fine non fui in grado di ucciderla
8723255 la baciai unultima volta cercando di trasmetterle tutto lodio che avevo tutto il ribrezzo me ne andai e non la rividi mai pi ora so cosa le accadde
8723256 lunica cosa che seppi dopo essermene andato che il suo esercito fin col distruggersi da solo soltanto uno si salv a quello scempio gli augur di subire tutte le pene dellinferno gli promise che lavrebbe perseguitata ovunque in ongi vita qualunque forma avesse assunto lui lavrebbe perseguitata sarebbe stato la sua paura pi grande
8723257 poi mi allontanai cos tanto da quel luogo da questo luogo che lei per me non divenne altro che un amaro ricordo un ricordo nitido del mio orgoglio ferito del mio cuore infranto un ricordo che mi perseguitava ed al quale non potevo sottrarmi la mia punizione per aver assaggiato il frutto proibito poi decisi di tornare ed te che ho incontrato tu risvegliasti tutto quel dolore che mi sembrava di tenere sepolto tu eri identica a lei to odiai per questo ti odiai con tutte le mie forze inizialmente pensavo addirittura che tu fossi lei che in qualche modo era riuscita a restare in vita io lo speravo
8723258 gi non sei nemmeno lontanamente paragonabile a lei per fortuna
8723259 e tu mi portasti qui qui dove tutto era cominciato decisi allora che qui anche tutto sarebbe finito ma tu non eri una normale ragazza di questa epoca
8723260 avvertisti subito la mia presenza e questo mi spavent ma ormai avevo deciso tu mi avresti liberato da tutte le mie pene poi a tutto questo si aggiunse il tuo profumo cos dolce cos intenso e la ciliegina sulla torta pensai sarebbe stato tutto pi semplice naturale io ero il vampiro tu la preda ma i tuoi occhi il tuo modo di fare il dubbio cominci a d insinuarsi nei miei pensieri tu non eri lei mi sentii un mostro eppure capii immediatamente di non essere pi capace di allontanarmi da te tu eri una perfida illusione per me lillusione che natalie fosse ancora li per me che fosse diversa
8723261 avanti avanti fa quello per cui sei venuto quella dannata sera mettiamo fine a questo stupido gioco
8723262 ti sto solo chiedendo di rendere concreto ci che in realt hai gi fatto
8723263 va bene se ci che vuoi far ci per cui venni quella sera
8723264 era per questo che ero venuto quella sera non ti avrei mai morsa
8723265 no resister perch ora tu sei pi importante del mio istinto tu sei pi importante di tutto
8723266 voglio che tu lo sappia non sei come lei tu sei tutto ci che ho sempre desiderato tu sei lamore della mia eternit
8723267 the vampire and me 2 quando passato e presente si mescolano
8723268 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno
8723269 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro l orizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso
8723270 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno
8723271 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro l orizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso
8723272 il tempo passa anche quando sembra impossibile anche qundo il rintocco di ogni secondo fa male come il sangue che pulsa nelle ferite passa in maniera disuguale tra strani scatti e bonacce prolungate ma passa
8723273 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te non me ne vergogno
8723274 jasper cosa fanno i vampiri per i party di addio al celibato non lo starai portando ad uno strip club vero
8723275 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8723276 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8723277 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8723278 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8723279 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8723280 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8723281 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8723282 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8723283 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8723284 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8723285 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8723286 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8723287 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8723288 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8723289 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8723290 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8723291 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8723292 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8723293 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8723294 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8723295 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8723296 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8723297 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8723298 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8723299 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8723300 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8723301 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8723302 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8723303 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8723304 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8723305 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8723306 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8723307 voor de rest was het best wel een toffe stage
8723308 het was een kutbedrijf en ze lieten me elke dag het toilet schrobben met een tandenborstel als ik ongeluk had was die kleine dwerg van een pie er ook en dan moest ik sexuele handelingen met hem doen
8723309 i have spent long periods of time with him in the past two years hes been alert hes been steady
8723310 the late prime minister bhutto or her husband or it was a joint account
8723311 i think hes better than many of the others out there plus he was the husband of benazir bhutto who dreamed of a prosperous pakistan hell live out her dream or at least hell try
8723312 he may be an expert in darwinian politics but people perceive a sheer lack of leadership qualities
8723313 25 year old high school educated married catholic jazz fan who earns 10 000 a year and who smokes and drinks regularly
8723314 right now we are supporting the ps3 launch we are really excited to be bringing the bioshock experience to a whole new set of fans weve been concentrating on ways to make this game special the things that weve added theyre not changing the original experience that the 360 fans and the pc fans got but are things that compliment nicely that experience
8723315 first of all the crimes in the war in the former yugoslavia occurred in europes backyard which had a significant effect on european countries and on the united states
8723316 the second thing is that photos from the war were strikingly reminiscent of photos from internment camps in world war ii so during the summer of 1992 there were photos of camps internment camps detention camps in bosnia with prisoners emaciated prisoners that made people think again about war crimes that had been committed in world war ii and had been prosecuted at nuremberg
8723317 there have been ugandan kenyan british dutch any number of judges from different nationalities and different countries the prosecutors are from all over the globe there has been a south african a canadian a swiss prosecutor
8723318 so this tribunal is a genuine united nations tribunal and does represent all of the countries or nearly all of the countries that are member states of the u n
8723319 theres no doubt that the death of milosevic before the verdict was a tremendous blow because it was the signature case of the tribunal he was obviously the most important person indicted by the tribunal and he was the face of the war and it would have been an incredible achievement for the court to have completed that case
8723320 he is charged with the ethnic cleansing of non serbs from large areas of bosnia herzegovina he is charged with a campaign of shelling and sniping to terrorize the civilian population in sarajevo he is charged with genocide committed in srebrenica in july 1995 when close to eight thousand muslim bosnian men and boys were killed
8723321 there are a number of crimes such as torture murder rape destruction of property which if they are done in a widespread and systematic manner constitute a crime against humanity you do not need to prove intent you simply need to prove these acts occurred they were widespread they were systematic and these individuals were responsible for them or carried them out
8723322 in the case of genocide its a little more tricky because you must prove that there was an intent to destroy a group of people in whole or in part you can almost always prove intent only by circumstantial evidence and thatll be the tricky part here
8723323 the strategy which some of these prominent serb war crimes indictees have pursued is not to take the trial seriously in the legal sense but to turn it into a kind of propaganda circus so to use the courtroom as an opportunity to make propaganda this is what slobodan milosevic did and this is what vojislav seselj the serbian far right leader is also doing and i suppose they feel that they cant really win or be acquitted and therefore they want to try and use the opportunity to maximize their case at the propaganda level it doesnt make any sense in purely legal terms if you want to try and be acquitted or at least reduce your sentence it would make more sense to behave more professionally and to hire a professional lawyer
8723324 what does it mean to you to be an american
8723325 in 2001 you voted for the patriot act in hindsight do you regret this
8723326 this is being treated as arson and until we can determine whether the family was inside it will remain arson
8723327 im the one getting married so everyone has to listen to me
8723328 much so very much has been written about the fashion worlds repulsive obsession with thinness
8723329 but the predictable truth is that when it comes to skinny models nothing has changed nothing the belief in the industry remains that thinness is symbolic of wealth and aspiration thus the more luxurious the label the thinner the models
8723330 corinne just wanted to bring out everything that i hated when i was 15
8723331 i never had an aspiration to look like a doll which is fortunate
8723332 red carpet dressing sounds like something that would take you out of your own instincts but havent gotten there yet i will wear what i want to wear
8723333 the motion academy of doo da what was it called
8723334 a lot of people really want one really really want one and im embarrassed because i never did and i feel a little ashamed that i was given one when i didnt really want one
8723335 there is a possibility for our generation point being that one doesnt necessarily have to give it all up one can actually stand up and be counted
8723336 whatever i get told i have a heavenly pussy all the fucking time
8723337 i wanted to address the issue of voting for mccain because it doesnt make sense to many of you and i can only speak for myself i dont like mccain but i will vote for him in protest of the democratic party for not running a woman at all because it is my revolt against them i know that mccains policies are worse for women but that is the sacrifice that i am willing to make sometimes things have to get worse before they get better if i can survive bush for 8 years i can survive mccain i want the democratic party to realize that they are nothing without the womans vote and not just roll over and be happy with what they give us and continue to treat women like second class citizens
8723338 national football league greats and their mothers calling them inside for dinner and serving them soup
8723339 the companys target consumers men in their 30s are finally achieving soup independence
8723340 ladainian tomlinson doesnt need his mom to tell him which products have protein and which products dont hes learned that for himself and weve learned our consumers want to do that for themselves as well
8723341 if you are the type who doesnt notice crumbs on the table skip to the next post because crumbs are a deal breaker i have all sorts of theories on how to stack my dishwasher and if you are judgmental about ritalin for adhd or think such things are caused by too much sugar again deal break city
8723342 more inclined than women to exhibit a range of risk taking behaviours while on the road more inclined to speed show aggression fall asleep behind the wheel and to identify themselves as impatient
8723343 joanna really trusts my driving and most of the time i trust hers
8723344 the amount of thc present in commercially available hemp products is significantly less in products available today
8723345 should not be considered as a realistic cause for a positive urine analysis result
8723346 there will be heavy sledding for the u s economy during the next couple of quarters
8723347 were ready were well organized and were determined to win this election
8723348 have tabled an economic agenda that stands diametrically opposed to everything this government stands for
8723349 you can continue to hate and blame but thats not constructive
8723350 you have to get past it at some point at the time all the dead bodies i saw in the media reports were african americans and when its just black body after black body you start to wonder if all those people who died were white if their lives were considered more valid by the people in charge maybe you would have seen a quicker response honestly i still wonder if more people would have been saved

8723362 today as a user we have no visibility or control over how that information is shared and recorded
8723363 i wouldnt put microsoft as being the arbiter of what should and shouldnt be tracked
8723364 non ho mai corso pensando ai numeri ha commentato rossi per senza dubbio un grande onore raggiungere agostini in questa singolare classifica certo ago ha vinto in totale 122 gare e sinceramente non penso di riuscire a strappargli anche questo primato
8723365 praticamente conosco pi brno di misano perch lo scorso anno ho fatto solo tre giri prima di essere fermato dal motore poi anche se la pista dove ho provato per la prima volta nella vita una moto da corsa il senso di marcia cambiato da allora e questanno stata modificata anche la curva numero due comunque quella del 2007 stata una delusione cocente voglio dimenticarla al pi presto con un buon risultato
8723366 certo 50 punti di vantaggio sono un buon margine ma ha detto il pesarese non sono cos tranquillo di sicuro non far il ragioniere non mi piacerebbe affatto vincere il mondiale limitandomi ad arrivare dietro a stoner ad ogni gara voglio lottare con lui e cercare di fare il massimo di batterlo non bisogna poi dimenticare che casey un avversario tosto uno che non molla mai la presa
8723367 qui vicino c la mia casa qui ho tanti amici qui ho dovuto distribuire quasi cento pass per laccesso al paddock e c ancora gente che mi chiama per avere un biglietto per me pi di casa anche se il mugello resta il gp ditalia la gara in cui tirare fuori lorgoglio
8723368 ringrazio tutti sindaco anche per un solo giorno non male
8723369 per vincere bisogna rischiare oltre un certo limite ora ho altri valori e altri obiettivi sono fidanzato e aspetto un figlio non posso rischiare cos tanto per vincere e quindi mi dedicher ad altro
8723370 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8723371 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8723372 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8723373 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8723374 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8723375 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8723376 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8723377 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8723378 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8723379 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8723380 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8723381 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8723382 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8723383 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8723384 this is a startling amount of change in a major area of peoples lives over a very short period
8723385 the nature of our operations doesnt require that we carry both
8723386 transport canada was satisfied that we met the regulation and they approved the change
8723387 a lot of these airlines say well our passengers are our main concern thats a bit of a misnomer
8723388 it was extra above and beyond what was required under the canadian aviation regulations
8723389 if you are an airline and you fly an airplane over a body of water you have to have a life preserver or an approved floatation means
8723390 i am very grateful for this opportunity and i understand my responsibilities to the dallas cowboys and the national football league right now i just want to keep working hard so i can accomplish the goals that i have set for myself both on and off the field
8723391 theres no sure thing in life its nice to finally get the affirmation for all the hard work hes put in
8723392 the rest is up to him its time to play football hes a very motivated player
8723393 he has a good head on his shoulders he should be fine
8723394 adam has worked hard to get to this point but he also knows that there is still a lot of work ahead of him
8723395 he is fully aware of the opportunity that he has been given and he knows that this is an ongoing process
8723396 i think from the beginning there were a lot of critics saying that this couldnt be done that he couldnt turn his life around
8723397 im very happy for adam hes proven everyone wrong hes got a very bright personal and professional future
8723398 i see patients looking for the g spot and they come to see the doctor because they are so upset they cannot find it
8723399 vaginal innervation was somewhat regular with no site consistently demonstrating the highest nerve density nerves were located throughout the vagina
8723400 as long as she is maintaining her muscle strength with kegel exercises
8723401 then she should be just fine and may even increase the sensation she has with penetration
8723402 a persistent erection not accompanied by sexual desire or stimulation
8723403 thats what we are expecting and we are planning to give passage a safe area for them to come out of that
8723404 ni siquiera s si lo que realmente importa es que gane o no
8723405 because we are your friends youll never be alone again
8723406 i won i had to use an orange ball nanny had a green and granddad granddad had a red one
8723407 samantha is certainly telling friends shes planning to write a book its supposed to be about her allegedly but come on you know lindsay will be all over that book
8723408 ive shut up about this long enough samantha is using my daughter people never even knew who samantha ronson was until she met lindsay she was just some los angeles dj
8723409 and now shes writing a book i am at my wits end with this stuff this is not in lindsays best interest
8723410 lets just say i hope lindsay starts opening her eyes and realises who the people using her are
8723411 samantha drinks and passes the drinks under the table to lindsay and behind the scenes it gets worse and worse
8723412 there were no seats the crowd was so huge many of the people who poured into carriages got off just as quickly when they saw there were no seats
8723413 in otaki we have no choice the capital connection is our only commuter train
8723414 people may decide to go and sit on a loo normally if people sit on a toilet they shut the door the night before as people were looking for seats passengers were told to remove suitcases from seats and we made staff stand
8723415 i did not see masses of people standing but there were eight to 10 standing in the door wells between corridors

8723417 secretul indelungatei noastre colaborari cu ford consta in seriozitatea cu care am abordat aceasta relatie de afaceri in toti acesti 40 de ani parteneriatul nostru cu ford s a bazat pe corectitudine si transparenta
8723418 din datele analizate reiese ca piata se indreapta catre o structura de piata matura
8723419 anul acesta cred ca vor acoperi in proportie de 80 90 din spatiul de publicitate
8723420 in contextul conflictului dintre rusia si georgia o reactie ostila din partea rusiei nu poate fi exclusa chiar daca o actiune militara este putin probabila guvernul rus ar putea sanctiona importurile din cehia sau majora pretul gazelor daca nu chiar opri livrarile catre cehia
8723421 pe fondul mai multor plecari din randul middle managementului redactiei si a unor neintelegeri cu sefii surse din cadrul redactiei ne au confirmat ca horia ghibutiu este in concediu de cateva saptamani bune situatie despre care i a informat oficial si pe colegi
8723422 sa trateze cu prioritate si sa sustina aceste initiative legislative ale guvernului deoarece adoptarea lor este necesara pentru realizarea unei legislatii unitare si coerente
8723423 avem o piata restransa nu prea exista vanzatori iar problema numarul unu este aceasta concentrare a obligatiunilor in portofoliile catorva societati
8723424 cred ca in special fondurile lansate re cent care au la dispozitie sase luni pentru a se incadra in cerintele de diversificare a portofoliului au fost atrase de nivelul foarte ridicat al dobanzilor la depozitele bancare
8723425 certinvest si cred ca si alti administratori au cautat achizitii pe alte piete unde exista emisiuni in lei precum luxemburg sau frankfurt am avut plasamente si in euro evident cu rezerva riscului de curs de schimb volumele sunt insa in scadere pe toate pietele lipsesc banii pentru plasamente in aceasta perioada si nu cred ca vor fi schimbari majore pana la sfarsitul anului
8723426 este o afacere de proportii care urmareste umplerea conturilor baietilor cu papion din spatele pnl absenta dezbaterii necesare pentru un proiect de asemenea anvergura graba cu care discutia a fost strecurata la si altele lipsa totala de transparenta sunt ingredientele acestei inginerii guvernamentale
8723427 ozn electoral al carui principal scop practic este sa creeze impresia ca guvernul se preocupa de educatie se estimeaza o afacere uriasa in care tot ce trebuie facut este ca cineva sa cumpere si apoi sa revanda terenuri in zonele unde guvernul preconizeaza proiectul asta fara a pune la socoteala terenurile universitatilor ce vor fi stramutate pe final de mandat pnl a inceput sa faca operatii imobiliare clasa adriean videanu dovada cea mai buna ca spiritul aliantei da a ramas neatins in pofida controverselor din acesti patru ani
8723428 avem zeci de scoli care stau sa cada pe elevi la inceput de an scolar avem localitati in care copiii se duc kilometri pe jos la scoala pentru ca nu exista mijloace de transport iar ministrul educatiei a stabilit ca cel mai important lucru acum este sa stramutam universitatile si sa eliberam terenurile bine plasate actiunea da masura completa a mandatului lui cristian adomnitei un habarnist in educatie dar mare specialist in tunuri imobiliare
8723429 i wasnt thinking right he told me he was going to kill me it wouldnt look very good if i got pulled over ive got a dead woman in the car i got her child too i got an active warrant
8723430 and then i heard a scream and then i heard a popping sound
8723431 i see him raise his hand and i see him shoot his wife
8723432 ill kill you ill kill everybody involved with this youre gonna help me get away with this
8723433 he asked if i know anybody that could take care of his wife
8723434 he said he had 983 he would pay someone to take care of his wife
8723435 i had bruised ribs bruised lungs a spleen injury multiple contusions and abrasions
8723436 she had a crushed vertebrae they had to fuse together shes in a lot of pain
8723437 ill be by her side every day i told her i was going to be her new training partner
8723438 nobody deserves anything like this and you say how can we help what can we do
8723439 the pinsons zijn 3 broers met hun hart op de juiste plaats ze zouden voor elkaar door het vuur gaan en hebben samen een enorm leuk en catchy nummer geschreven ze zijn ook superschattig en op het songfestival is al vaak gebleken dat dat een niet te onderschatten troef is
8723440 expectations for instantaneous results i think are probably a little bit too high
8723441 i came away from the meeting very encouraged that the focus is where it needs to be
8723442 were trying to figure out how that fits into bringing pressure onto that border to minimize the cross border operations from pakistan
8723443 this is a triumph of the recognition of womens fundamental rights
8723444 it will surely establish a precedent for mexico for the other states and for the region of latin america
8723445 no court can contradict the supreme law of god that orders us thou shalt not kill
8723446 100 of peer reviewed scientist say mankind is causing global warming
8723447 this could lead into open fighting with different militia groups just as the drug networks do if that happens the level of violence is going to rise dramatically
8723448 its the same thing just worse because the drug gangs dont charge you
8723449 the international community also has the responsibility to seek agreement on the equal importance of peace and justice in trying to meet the needs of the people in darfur
8723450 is an independent institution and the united nations respects the independence of the judicial process
8723451 altered the political landscape although it is too early to assess the impact it will have on the peace process
8723452 the international community should continue its engagement and support of the parties efforts towards resolving the crisis
8723453 if the lafourche corridor takes a severe hit everyone in this country will feel the impact
8723454 there are gaps in the system but the system is stronger and better than ever
8723455 there are those high level risk areas such as the lower 9th ward gentilly st bernard new orleans east and the west bank still
8723456 weve all worked very very hard over the last two years in planning and training and assessing and exercising and being ready for the next big hurricane and gustav is going to be it
8723457 we made a real effort to find out and they were entirely uncommunicative
8723458 weve been telling them to think very carefully before acting and move very cautiously and whatever you do make sure that its multilateral not unilateral
8723459 it is pretty evident that the european government and our own government are weighing options right now
8723460 the situation is clearly at a serious level and theyre trying to find the right way to respond to this
8723461 russia has about 10 billion invested in the united states in the manufacturing sector and we about the same amount invested there theres really a very substantial economic exchange
8723462 into account the fragile state of the young countries between the black and caspian seas
8723463 if they decide they dont want to pursue wto accession we cant make them if they pull out of something im not sure that qualifies as a sanction
8723464 an innovative program to prevent and treat child abuse which is the mission of family resources
8723465 when we see a child having a meltdown or a child standing dangerously in a shopping cart we dont know what to do
8723466 we are all kind of helpless and freeze when we see others in this situation what we want to do is enable people to assist these parents
8723467 the video showed how people could assist parents with their children through gentle intervention
8723468 i came aboard the project in the fall of 2002 when my boys were almost 3 and 5
8723469 we knew it was a great concept but we asked ourselves how can we get everyday people to understand and use this concept
8723470 lets just say that my younger son has always been an intense and loud child i was living it
8723471 i never got to meet him and i wanted to know his thoughts and plans for the program
8723472 what is the first thing you see on the show
8723473 we want people to stop and recognize when they may be able to help a parent or child take a moment to pause think and get ready to assist and three try one kind word to assist
8723474 getting involved may be as simple as standing closer to a shopping cart where a child is standing and in a dangerous situation while the parent is busy with another child
8723475 that was a lot of fun we filmed the video at the giant eagle in the waterworks from midnight to 6 a m here we are filming a video about child abuse and we had children there in the middle of the night
8723476 we had to get all sorts of waivers and special permission to make it
8723477 based on our feedback we can say that we can really impact how people can help parents in difficult situations
8723478 we want it to be a regional showpiece we want to put the message out in our region that one kind word can make a difference to someone
8723479 we have been talking with a major grocery store chain and other places such as museums and amusement parks we feel that anywhere large groups of families with children gather will be the ideal sites for the program
8723480 anoles are highly visual species so in that sense its not surprising that they would use visual displays to mark territory
8723481 still the finding is surprising because these are the first animals known to use non acoustic signaling at dawn and dusk
8723482 as in humans if an anole can do many of these push ups it shows that he is in prime physical condition
8723483 these displays of strength help avert actual physical confrontations between male lizards which can be very fierce and destructive
8723484 these patterns have remarkable parallels with the dawn and dusk choruses reported for many acoustically communicating animals
8723485 these animals display a lot even when no other lizards seems to be around but in my experience theres probably another lizard over your shoulder somewhere that you dont see and thats who they are displaying at
8723486 hey buddy the element of surprise is gone im fit and i will escape if you try anything
8723487 no man is an island entire of itself every man is a piece of the continent a part of the main
8723488 any mans death diminishes me because i am involved in mankind therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls it tolls for thee
8723489 an astute study and a significant contribution to orality literacy scholarship
8723490 this intellectual yet immensely readable book demonstrates new and exciting insights into both irish history and the history of technology and is a must read for scholars and laymen alike
8723491 fallon is a first rate story teller in that his fluid narrative which is further refined with fascinating historical details and reasoning draws the reader in page by page this is an important and useful text
8723492 mainly we are trying to understand the magnetic fields around the pulsar and the emission mechanisms that are making the pulsars pulse
8723493 the gamma rays we found are being produced by this cloud of high speed particles circling around the pulsar
8723494 yielding insights into the processes and mechanisms involved in making a dead star so active
8723495 the high degree and direction of polarization at high energies reported by dean et al provide valuable information on the site of acceleration of the particles and on the structure of the magnetic field associated with the pulsar
8723496 the important thing we were trying to do in the first place is actually measure polarization because people havent been able to measure polarization to a good degree of accuracy before
8723497 trainingpeaks benefits me twofold the first of which is speed of communication with the athlete by having all their data in a central location where i can change their training plans at a moments notice if needed i e desktop companion the second is the ease of use which cuts down the amount of time i spend building the athletes training program compared to say using spreadsheets or a word doc like some coaches do which as we all know isnt a very professional way of presenting a training plan to a client
8723498 technically the post held by rhodri morgan is leader of the assembly labour group only ams can stand for that role
8723499 while mr hain won a healthy majority of more than 12 000 in neath at the last general election in 2005 the margin of mrs thomass victory over the plaid cymru candidate in last years assembly election was less than 2 000 the speculation about mr hain follows his resignation as welsh secretary and work and pensions secretary earlier this year even if he is not prosecuted for failing to declare donations to his unsuccessful labour deputy leadership campaign on time it is thought unlikely that he will be reappointed to gordon browns cabinet according to a suggested theory he would rather end his political career as first minister of wales than as a backbencher at westminster

8723502 these changes will affect any federal project that affects any endangered species
8723503 if these changes had come into place fema would have been able to make that decision
8723504 to ensure that decisions arent being made for political reasons
8723505 what were looking to do is remove some of the bureaucratic red tape on common sense projects
8723506 what this doesnt do is offer a federal agency a sort of get out of jail free card
8723507 they have an expertise that is unrivaled by any other agency
8723508 dartmouth has a strong naval tradition and our welcome here is always warm and friendly
8723509 when we open a bin we never know exactly what were going to find it could be anything
8723510 what were actually saying is that if you take things like the foul nappies out and present it correctly then well collect it free of charge
8723511 however if youre not prepared to do that and you want your bin emptied you will pay us a fee for a special collection
8723512 the conditions were atrocious we got to the eddystone after the first 12 miles and we were running into the wind and swell as well

8723522 i do believe that as time goes on consolidation in the emerging markets to achieve meaningful economies of scale will increasingly become a business imperative
8723523 within reason we will leverage the group again if we think it gives us a meaningful strategic advantage going forward
8723524 to the extent somebody decided to approach the shareholders with an attractive offer they as shareholders in a public company will take a considered view there is nothing either in the companys laws or the countrys laws that prohibits that

8723529 the rapid spread of infectious disease whether naturally occurring or due to terrorist activities is a critical national concern
8723530 we will be developing models that can predict the extent of future disease outbreaks an essential step for developing pro active monitoring and control strategies
8723531 today we can only collect data after the fact when something such as a pandemic flu outbreak occurs
8723532 trying to track how a disease spreads is very difficult because people move constantly
8723533 people easily travel from town to town state to state and country to country we hope to develop models that will include geographic environmental and demographic information on population groups that will help explain the interaction of populations which will be a major part of predicting how a disease will spread

8723612 in my job as a dive guide i have seen many things from being right in the middle of a feeding frenzy with silky sharks to watching orcas eating hammerhead sharks
8723613 but nothing compared to what i saw that afternoon last august
8723614 it was 4 30pm and i and six guests were at darwins island set to make the fourth dive of the day
8723615 as we were on the boat checking our equipment i saw a big white thing by the surface of the water
8723616 at the beginning i could not tell what it was i had never seen anything like it before
8723617 so i decided to put my mask on and put my face over into the water
8723618 right after this i explained to my guests that it looked like a white whale shark and we were going to all jump in the water and try to follow it
8723619 i told everyone to keep a distance and not disturb it so we all jumped in the water and followed it for five minutes
8723620 i kept up swimming with it and i got very close even the eye was white
8723621 then we all went back on the boat and we spotted the shark again and we all jumped into the water again this time only with snorkelling gear
8723622 i free dove 50 feet down and is when i finally managed to get some pictures of it
8723623 it was difficult because i did not want to frighten it away so i stayed a few metres away
8723624 after a few minutes the albino disappeared and nobody has ever seen it again

8723732 not to swat at the flys starting position but rather to aim a bit forward of that to anticipate where the fly is going to jump when it first sees your swatter
8723733 when the fly makes planning movements prior to takeoff it takes into account its body position at the time it first sees the threat
8723734 the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small postural changes to reach the correct preflight posture
8723735 these movements are made very rapidly within about 200 milliseconds
8723736 but within that time the animal determines where the threat is coming from and activates an appropriate set of movements to position its legs and wings

8723743 it is disgraceful that border patrol agents are put in harms way and our government doesnt do everything reasonably within its power to protect us from marauding mexican soldiers and others
8723744 without a forceful response to these illegal incursions an agent will eventually be seriously wounded or killed it is only a matter of time
8723745 the incursions will not stop until the mexican military units and their commanders are held accountable for their actions
8723746 it is a documented fact that the mexican military is corrupt and is involved in protecting drug cartels smugglers and other criminals
8723747 there is an international boundary for a reason and they are to be respected by both governments
8723748 we take very seriously our role in working with our international neighbors to address and resolve these situations
8723749 the fact that the mexican military is operating in such close proximity to the border without any identifiable purpose calls into question its activities and raises concerns about the vulnerability of our southern land border
8723750 when considering the frequency of incursions and the threat these encounters pose to our border patrol agents it is critical that we take the necessary steps to ensure that mexican military and law enforcement personnel do not cross into the u s without our knowledge or consent
8723751 will result in a clearer delineation of the international border
8723752 a reasonable person would conclude that the soldiers knew exactly at whom they were pointing their rifles
8723753 had the agent panicked and fired a shot or attempted to flee in his vehicle there is little doubt the mexican soldiers would have opened fire
8723754 during past incursions the mexican government has denied it had soldiers in the area they have blamed impostors even when military humvees were involved

8723770 http blog newsweek com blogs stumper archive 2008 08 28 the dems finally change the subject aspx askplus august 28 2008 at 4 50 pm i think most democrats pondered why mr obama only performed intermittent defense of his character i think that the subject has changed to mr mccain and his inherent and inherited faults mr obama was the better man for not going to far down the same path just like mr clinton in 1992 and not make a joke of his campaign brittanicus august 28 2008 at 3 44 pm before the new president even thinks of contemplating any form of guest worker program he had better realize that their will not be a path to citizenship in the package deal it will be a straight working visa and return home afterwards if any person wants to apply for legal residents they had better understand that they must return home first there must not be any short cuts because thousands of bona fide immigrants wait patiently for years to enter america get rid of the open borders criminals including the governors mayors city administrators and all those who out to appease the illegal immigrant advocates 80 percent of the american population are not easily going to be swayed by either obama mccain to give the 13 to 20 million illegal aliens any kind of amnesty by any name they want to call it it has to be voted by house senate and the people and that will have major hurdles if not impossible everybody who doesnt have the right papers know they are intentionally breaking the law their is no malice by the agents just a duty to the american people and those who came here legally the rule of law

8723849 today it is essential that the eu speaks with one voice that is strong and firm on georgia
8723850 the hope that this crisis will simply pass and that we can go back to business as usual is very naive
8723851 it is utopian to think of a partnership agreement with russia now if georgias territorial integrity is not guaranteed then were thrown back 40 years
8723852 i highly doubt it might ever happen it imposing sanctions would be more to the detriment of the eu than to russia
8723853 i am not a fan of sanctions now is the time for talks but we should have concrete moves in our pocket
8723854 poland will want the eu summit to make the commitment to ukraine and the caucasus states as tangible as possible
8723855 they will think it is the only guarantee against the potential threat posed by russia

8723892 not because anyone is asking us and not because we want to look good in someones eyes

8723921 ill probably take side streets whenever possible when driving to work to avoid as much construction as possible
8723922 that might use a little extra gas but it will be worth it not to have to deal with the aggravation
8723923 i watch people turn left out of our parking lot every day and most people cut it very close
8723924 if they cant turn left there wont be as many accidents
8723925 trying to turn across traffic from a lane or trying to get across traffic from any of the plazas is a bit nerve wracking
8723926 i think the medians and the u turn lanes will be helpful
8723927 the construction was not the main cause for the store closing but it was certainly a factor
8723928 it had a substantial impact on the number of customers that wanted to deal with the construction and come to our store i am nervous that the same thing will happen again
8723929 we are trying to make this a public process by working with businesses that will be affected by the construction
8723930 we hope that they will see the overall picture with the end result being easier access to their stores for customers
8723931 even though the end result of the construction might mean less accidents and possibly more customers trying to survive two years in this economy is going to be very difficult

8723940 the rest is up to him its time to play football hes a very motivated player
8723941 he has a good head on his shoulders he should be fine
8723942 adam has worked hard to get to this point but he also knows that there is still a lot of work ahead of him
8723943 he is fully aware of the opportunity that he has been given and he knows that this is an ongoing process
8723944 i think from the beginning there were a lot of critics saying that this couldnt be done that he couldnt turn his life around
8723945 im very happy for adam hes proven everyone wrong hes got a very bright personal and professional future

8723950 if the movie script is popular jason will write the tv series too he is already coming up with ideas for it
8723951 ah ugas only 1 because they beat the crap out of that shitty hawaii team in their bowl last year
8723952 seems like you live in pennsylvania i do as well i love pa and the gettysburg festival is one of the best events in the state glad to hear you got to get out of town
8723953 kudos for your courage to attend the perry county fair and
8723954 i also agree with you this would ce essential to toursist who would be planning a
8723955 have to agree with you and internet revies you are spot on we live in a critical culture where people feel like they are experts just because they can post a review bayou is great try their brunch and all of these fair weather bon vivant wannabes are just unable to be satisfied
8723956 the tier 1 ratio has improved thats the good news of the report
8723957 we better understand it today were determined to manage the situation
8723958 ah ugas only 1 because they beat the crap out of that shitty hawaii team in their bowl last year
8723959 rational pursuit of our well being and safety would become impossible
8723960 this is a really strong group that we return on both the mens and womens side
8723961 and as far as the freshmen go weve had good recruiting classes in the past but this is by far the deepest class weve put together in terms of talent
8723962 donnie returns to the team after qualifying for the ncaa national championships in the steeplechase last year
8723963 one of his goals is to get back to being all conference in cross country and he certainly has the ability to do that this year he should come in and be one of if not the top guy this fall
8723964 felix and ermin were really getting adjusted to collegiate cross country last season and we saw the kind of success that they were able to achieve
8723965 were really looking forward to what they can do this season as sophomores
8723966 matt sagar had a strong year last year and were looking for him to build on that this season
8723967 he just missed qualifying for the ncaas in the steeplechase and he has the ability to contend for all conference in cross country this season matt satterwhite could be a surprised for us this year he has done the work needed to be in our top five and hell have the opportunity to show that early in the schedule
8723968 marshall noah and ray came in and turned in strong times for our time trial
8723969 they each ran better times as freshmen than donnie cowart and anthony harris did and we see what those guys have done in their careers then two of our top recruits joakim kiprotich didnt run the time trial and neither did junior andrew rademaker each of those guys has a chance to be in our top five by the end of the year as well
8723970 our minimum goal is to be in the top three in the conference this season
8723971 our advantage is having a lot of depth now if we have a good season and if we improve the way that we should then well have a chance to get into the top two as a team bringing home a trophy is our main goal for 2008 and we have the guys to do it on this team
8723972 they each ran the fastest times that theyve ever run which is a product of the training they put in over the summer they both could be all conference this season and thats their goal entering the year
8723973 both carrie and jenna reported in great shape after a great summer regimen
8723974 they turned in times at our time trial that were close to what kelsey ran her freshmen year in which she was all conference 10th so that gives you an idea that theyll be pretty good
8723975 our top four girls are the strongest that i believe weve ever had
8723976 the key to this teams success will be finding that fifth runner weve got to have someone step it up while also keeping everyone healthy whereas depth is a strength for the mens team its just not there for our womens team entering the year
8723977 our goal is once again for our women to be fifth in the conference
8723978 thats where we finished last year when we tied our 2005 showing for the best conference finish by a womens sport at vmi now with two more teams added into the mix the competition between us winthrop radford and unc asheville for those fourth through seventh spots could be very close we have a strong enough team that if we have a good season we could be up into fourth place but if someone gets hurt we could go down to seventh place it should be an interesting year and im excited to get started
8723979 theres a lot of rumor and speculation about the kindle one thing i can tell you for sure is that there will be no new version of the kindle this year a new version is possible sometime next year at the earliest
8723980 i am very grateful for this opportunity and i understand my responsibilities to the dallas cowboys and the national football league right now i just want to keep working hard so i can accomplish the goals that i have set for myself both on and off the field
8723981 adam has worked hard to get to this point but he also knows that there is still a lot of work ahead of him
8723982 he is fully aware of the opportunity that he has been given and he knows that this is an ongoing process
8723983 i didnt do them to influence the commissioner i did them to better myself as a person

8724041 therefore the study does not show that either aspirin plus extended release dipyridamole or clopidogrel is superior to the other in the prevention of stroke

8724043 how we choose between the two agents is still going to be up to clinicians
8724044 for those patients with more cardiac disease some of us may choose clopidogrel more often and for others we still have extended release dipyridamole as an option

8724114 olive oil is in general a very nutritious choice another is canola oil unsaturated oils are less tolerant of heat than saturated oils however when unsaturated oils are heated some trans fat can form this is the basis for claims that unsaturated oils such as olive oil which is predominantly monounsaturated are unsafe to cook with
8724115 the degradation of oils occurs mostly at the smoke point literally the temperature above which the oil gives off smoke this temperature is reached in deep fryers but is rarely reached with home cooking with home cooking there will still be some degradation of olive oil but the effect is minimal population studies indicate that use of olive oil is associated with net health benefit and that certainly includes use in cooking
8724116 stearic acid for instance appears innocuous it does not raise serum cholesterol or increase the risk of heart disease this is one of the reasons why dark chocolate is as heart healthy as it is
8724117 most of the demonization of saturated fat is based on the belief that it always raises cholesterol an argument that has two huge holes in it
8724118 we now know that there are many more types of cholesterol than just the commonly understood ldl bad and hdl good ldl alone has at least five different subtypes and some of them ldl a are absolutely harmless while others like ldl b are not saturated fat tends to raise ldl but it sometimes raises the harmless subtype not the bad subtype it also raises hdl frequently more than it does ldl leaving an overall better blood lipid profile than before even though the total cholesterol number may have gone up
8724119 cholesterol is turning out to be a very poor predictor of cardiovascular disease and death as we saw in those trials of the cholesterol drug that lowered cholesterol more than any before but did nothing for heart disease plaque or mortality if you take the fear of cholesterol raising out of the equation whats the problem with saturated fat not too much
8724120 some saturated fatty acids are still very much implicated in particular palmitic and myristic acid so red meat is still a concern choosing meats that are lean with relatively low saturated fat content is the way to go
8724121 there are no naturally occurring fats that are high in saturated fats that do not raise ldl c low density lipoprotein cholesterol because they contain palmitic myristic and lauric acids the three saturated fatty acids proven to raise ldl c and promote atherosclerosis
8724122 eggs butter grass fed meat and the like may not be as bad as we once thought especially when intake is balanced with plenty of anti inflammatory omega 3s and phytonutrients from vegetables and fruits
8724123 there is evidence that the mix of saturated fatty acids in coconut oil may not be as harmful as once believed but there is evidence to the contrary too it is likely that coconut oil will prove to be less harmful atherogenic than once believed but very unlikely that it will emerge as competition for olive oil or canola oil as one of the most healthful options it may however make a good alternative to trans fat in commercial foods
8724124 coconut oil is extremely high in the three saturated fatty acids proven to raise ldl c and promote atherosclerosis
8724125 coconut oil provided its 100 percent organic and extra virgin like barleans coconut oil for example is a superfood it suffered from a bad rap due to two concerns one its high in saturated fat and two the early coconut oil sold in the 70s was an inferior product high in trans fats and highly processed definitely an unhealthy oil
8724126 the fat in coconut oil is largely lauric acid a particularly healthy fatty acid that has anti viral and anti microbial properties and is helpful for the immune system it also contains the fatty acid caprylic acid which is well known as a yeast fighter
8724127 the more coconut oil you eat the higher your total and ldl c levels will go and the more atherosclerosis you will develop if americans eat more butter and or coconut oil buy stock in the drug companies making cholesterol lowering statin drugs
8724128 monounsaturated fats help lower total and ldl cholesterol levels while increasing the artery protective hdl cholesterol monounsaturated fats may also help lower levels of inflammation in the body foods rich in monos include olive oil and tree nuts such as walnuts
8724129 omega 3s are known for lowering triglycerides blood fats and decreasing total cholesterol they are also helpful for lowering inflammation and maintaining a healthy brain although omega 6s are essential for your diet too much may lead to more inflammation corn safflower soybean sesame and sunflower oils and nuts or seeds are all good sources of polyunsaturated fats the omega 3 type is found in greatest amounts in fatty fish like salmon and tuna walnuts and ground flax seed are also sources of omega 3s

8724139 good health is the bedrock on which social progress is built a nation of healthy people can do those things that make life worthwhile and as the level of health increases so does the potential for happiness
8724140 the health care system however is only one of many ways of maintaining and improving health for these environmental and behavioural threats to health environmental pollution city living habits of indolence the abuse of alcohol tobacco and drugs and eating patterns which put the pleasing of the senses above the needs of the human body the organized health care system can do little more than serve as a catchment net for the victims

8724249 we are at the beginning of the end of the sacramento housing crash
8724250 there are more house price declines to come but the worst of the free fall in prices is at hand
8724251 there remain some serious threats to the outlook including the ongoing credit crunch and weak job market but with a bit of luck including stable oil prices and good policymaking the sacramento housing market will find its footing by this time next year

8724301 i look at blu ray being the obvious short term differentiator but if everything goes to digital download and over time it will then the blu ray device no longer has the same competitive advantage or the benefit is not as strong as the feature is

8724305 id actually make the point that for us second hand sales is a very critical situation because people are selling multiple times intellectual property
8724306 what were trying to do is build business models that are more and more online supported with additional services and additional content that you get online so people will see the value in not just getting that physical disc to play at home alone but actually playing those games online and paying for them
8724307 the major difference lies in the fact that nintendo makes money with the hardware alone which may be a superior business model
8724308 but the wii is not succeeding at our expense it is not hurting us we decided years ago to build a game console that offers much greater functionality the playstation 3 has an enormous processor it is gradually emerging as the central server in our users homes
8724309 we are delighted that the volkswagen group has made it to the global automobile industrys top three for the first time this shows that we are on the right track with our ever stronger international presence and above all our product program
8724310 yes it was very critically acclaimed but it wasnt advertised or marketed because electronic arts couldnt get its playstation 2 port of our xbox original to run and if ea isnt on all skus it just wont promote the game

8724312 our data seems to point toward the inherent decision that is made when the tumor is formed whether it is highly malignant or not moreover since the characteristic might be dependent on the normal cell status one might imagine that they might be different between individuals
8724313 this does suggest that cells can sit for a long time then be activated
8724314 but these cells were injected into the circulation normal breast cells are not supposed to be in the circulation
8724315 the study suggests that the critical ingredient in smoking that may be causing emphysema is cadmium a well known contaminant of cigarette smoke the worry is if you are exposed to this cadmium through other sources you can also be at risk for emphysema
8724316 with a larger population we will be able to better disentangle the independent effects of cadmium and smoking and whether dietary cadmium or other non cigarette sources may also influence lung function
8724317 we cant at this point rule out a very early spike in amyloid right after a brain injury
8724318 while beta 1 was for developers we think that anyone who browses or works on the web will enjoy ie8 beta 2
8724319 we looked very hard at how people really browse the web
8724320 and tried a lot of different designs in front of many kinds of people not just technologists
8724321 for beta 2 weve worked with a lot of great partners to deliver a bunch of choices for users
8724322 theyre much faster and easier than the select copy new tab navigate paste repeat process in todays other browsers we hope that web sites and enthusiasts write more of them and give us feedback
8724323 crashes are more contained and affect fewer tabs than before

8724325 some decisions are still being made but at a minimum you can expect support for free unpaid applications
8724326 similar to youtube content can debut in the marketplace after only three simple steps register as a merchant upload and describe your content and publish it
8724327 we also intend to provide developers with a useful dashboard and analytics to help drive their business and ultimately improve their offerings
8724328 because we feel that developers should have an open and unobstructed environment to make their content available
8724329 the concept is simple leverage googles expertise in infrastructure search and relevance to connect users with content created by developers like you

8724399 y si no es electoral pues c mo va a ser la salida
8724400 es lo que no s y eso es grave porque la democracia es certeza y lo peor es que aunque parezca dif cil imaginarlo todav a pueden suceder cosas peores que ch vez y a todo esto se llega porque si tienes un gobierno que destroza al pa s y avanza menoscabando las libertades p blicas y del otro lado una oposici n que no enamora y que es torpe y sin ideas el c rculo est cerrado y la inercia que mantiene al gobierno es de poca duraci n es decir puede pasar cualquier cosa

8724509 these changes will affect any federal project that affects any endangered species
8724510 if these changes had come into place fema would have been able to make that decision
8724511 to ensure that decisions arent being made for political reasons
8724512 what were looking to do is remove some of the bureaucratic red tape on common sense projects
8724513 what this doesnt do is offer a federal agency a sort of get out of jail free card

8724536 if you dont have an allergy youre just going to see a little bit of redness temporary and thatll be the end of it but if youre a highly allergic person youre going to get something called a wheal
8724537 so the take home message is if youre allergic stress and anxiety are a bad combination

8724540 the council decided that because we had seven screws to prevent it from blowing away it was in breach of planning permission
8724541 they know how many pubs are closing down at the moment i cant understand why they are pressing on something so petty as this
8724542 if you did this in your own back garden there would be no pressure whatsoever we pay all our council rates the council seem to see it as a way to make more money out of businesses
8724543 the structure requires planning permission because it is fixed to the ground

8724563 most of it was things said by tony and even his father don they hit our soft spots and we took some of the things kind of personal it was obvious we didnt care for each other much
8724564 i look back at those days when we didnt get along and wonder if there was malicious intent in the things they said
8724565 the more i know tony and don the more i realize they sometimes say things without thinking about the impact of those words on others
8724566 one thing ive tried to drill into tonys head since ive been here is that you never want to give your rivals more motivation to beat you just let the car do the talking
8724567 alan and gary were so much better than everyone else
8724568 hes a better driver now because the car gives him confidence
8724569 he knows hell win most races if he just does his job so the focus is there
8724570 hes a great crew chief one of the best ever so to hear him say anything complimentary is a big deal to me
8724571 we had a team meeting the other day to address the rumors about him leaving the team he said were part of something very special that this is a truly great team he told us hes excited to come to the track every day
8724572 i mean were not gonna go out and have beers and hang out we joke around but when the race is over we go our own way

8724584 most people agree that a playoff system adds a great level of excitement late in the year
8724585 it definitely gets more media attention and it keeps many more racers and sponsors involved in the process
8724586 we thought the two tiered system would add a second level of excitement but given the nature of drag racing the racers themselves ended up being a little uncomfortable with it we said wed tweak this deal so thats what we did
8724587 having six races to decide it all will allow for a little back and forth amongst the teams and the luck factor is minimized
8724588 itll be easier to follow because its more consistent with what you see in other sports
8724589 you can have one or two not so great races out of six and still survive
8724590 its fairer this way it wont be one person just lucking out and winning it all at the end

8724592 i cant thank roger enough for bringing this race back and making some great improvements it was a fantastic event last year and i expect it to only improve
8724593 i started walking today i brushed my own teeth today sat up in a chair today fed myself today
8724594 i am very grateful for this opportunity and i understand my responsibilities to the dallas cowboys and the national football league right now i just want to keep working hard so i can accomplish the goals that i have set for myself both on and off the field
8724595 theres no sure thing in life its nice to finally get the affirmation for all the hard work hes put in
8724596 the rest is up to him its time to play football hes a very motivated player
8724597 he has a good head on his shoulders he should be fine
8724598 adam has worked hard to get to this point but he also knows that there is still a lot of work ahead of him
8724599 he is fully aware of the opportunity that he has been given and he knows that this is an ongoing process
8724600 i think from the beginning there were a lot of critics saying that this couldnt be done that he couldnt turn his life around
8724601 im very happy for adam hes proven everyone wrong hes got a very bright personal and professional future
8724602 being human it changed him a lot it was a very difficult process to go through
8724603 without a transfer agreement you have no certainty so theres more speculation when it comes to drafting a european player specifically a russian player
8724604 if youre going to make that kind of commitment you really have to have an intimate knowledge of the player what his commitment is to come over what his contractual status is because youre taking a chance
8724605 there are still a lot of barriers for the russians that come over here especially the obvious ones like getting used to the language and getting used to the customs
8724606 i always found that the russians were just a different breed
8724607 i dont know if youd call it pride or what but i found when i was coaching that if you piqued that pride theyd get a little upset i dont think the skins of russians are as thick as other guys
8724608 its not because theyre not good players because most russian players have tremendous skills
8724609 but the way things are set up right now i just dont think a lot of teams are willing to take the chance on them
8724610 it certainly would make it very difficult to have contraflow and a football game
8724611 i dont think anyone would want us to play in that scenario
8724612 i wouldnt want to try and play in that situation but well know a lot more over the next couple of days
8724613 once that order is given its a huge impact on everything particularly if you have 120 000 people around tiger stadium and 92 000 in tiger stadium
8724614 well make a recommendation to lsu well be watching the storm very closely contraflow usually is not ordered unless a storm hits level three or higher
8724615 the storm could still change paths but we want to prepare for the worst and hope for the best
8724616 in reality time and date of landfall is subject to change and that time largely dictates when we order contraflow and that will largely dictate events like the football game and other events to see what might and might not be affected by contraflow
8724617 the general rule is to order start contraflow 30 hours before landfall
8724618 one of the elements in this is its heavily dependent on where it makes landfall so were going to look at it when we order contraflow when we order evacuations based on the latest information of where the storm is
8724619 it changed yesterday tuesday to today wednesday as late as tuesday they were predicting it would be here tuesday morning now theyre projecting monday morning landfall
8724620 we are absolutely keeping an eye on that when we get a better estimate on when landfall is when we get a better estimate of when were going to order contraflow we will look at that
8724621 we moved 1 5 million people before katrina beginning at 3 p m on that saturday aug 27 2005
8724622 contraflow impacts so many things and so many lives i dont want to speculate on what wed do with the football game well make a recommendation to lsu when the time comes
8724623 weve done more than any other track in the country to address sound
8724624 its absolutely gorgeous the most beautiful thing youve ever seen
8724625 its almost like bruton said im not worried about making money i just want everyone to have a good time its going to go over like gangbusters
8724626 its got so much buzz and everyone is so excited the position on the calendar isnt going to hurt thatll add a lot of drama and make it such a big spectacle
8724627 weve built this to the specs of our nicest nascar facilities from the restrooms to the skyboxes to the concourses the finish work is amazing bruton felt it was that important to move drag racing to the next level
8724628 you can bring sponsors and they can walk outside to hear feel and smell the cars
8724629 operationally we have a lot to learn and trying to go four lanes out of the box would be difficult
8724630 weve agreed to reconvene after the national event and figure out a way to run them theres too much upside
8724631 my focus is on my training and my next fight i am not going to talk about retirement
8724632 i am going to give 100 percent of my focus to this fight and then we will see after the fight
8724633 lets just say my foot got caught in the door
8724634 en bleu ce sont les parents qui ne c dent pas aux demandes de lenfant il va se mettre en col re puis sera frustr que les parents ne c dent mais gr ce cela il va progresser sans barri res lenfant ne progresse pas
8724635 are you acting with integrity and compassion kindness and caring to all involved if you make mistakes are you owning up to them and making amends
8724636 these people come near to me with their mouth and honor me with their lips but their hearts are far from me their worship of me is made up only of rules taught by men therefore once more i will astound these people with wonder upon wonder the wisdom of the wise will perish the intelligence of the intelligent will vanish
8724637 it is this continual focus upon obedience and faithfulness that most clearly distinguishes christian meditation from its eastern and secular counterparts 15 16 emphasis mine
8724638 just the way hanh opens the door and enters a room demonstrates his understanding he is
8724639 the only way beyond the traps of catholicism is buddhism
8724640 i am going to become the best buddhist i can so i can become a good catholic
8724641 a meditation on the monastic life by one who knows that life from the inside
8724642 he is essentially and exclusively dedicated to seeking god rather than seeking souls for god
8724643 we have defined a monk as a man who leaves everything else in order to seek god
8724644 as you sent me into the world i have sent them into the world
8724645 as the father has sent me i am sending you
8724646 true contemplation meditation is not a psychological trick but a theological grace
8724647 a good tree cannot bear bad fruit and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit
8724648 we just take the good in his teaching and use discernment to ignore the bad
8724649 a man who has been called by the holy spirit
8724650 you must not do as they do in egypt where you used to live and you must not do as they do in the land of canaan where i am bringing you do not follow their practices
8724651 anyone who does these things is detestable to the lord and because of these detestable practices the lord your god will drive out those nations before you
8724652 but thats for the nation of israel and has nothing to do with today

8724659 stepped out of her political role and completely misrepresented the teaching of the catholic church in regard to abortion
8724660 god has given us each of us a free will and a responsibility to answer for our actions
8724661 views of saint augustine who said the law does not provide that the act abortion pertains to homicide for there cannot yet be said to be a live soul in a body that lacks sensation
8724662 direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8724663 saint augustine wondered about the stages of human development before birth how this related to the question of ensoulment and what it meant for life in the kingdom of god
8724664 quite clear on the immorality of abortion as evil violence destructive of the very fabric of human bonds and society
8724665 e n o vos embriagueis com vinho em que h contenda mas enchei vos do esp rito

8724668 gun shops are allowed to advertise the massachusetts state lottery is allowed to have a website we want to be treated like any other business
8724669 i have a plan a moratorium on foreclosures for 90 days and freezing interest rates for five years which i think we should do immediately
8724670 it certainly would not speed the recovery of the housing market
8724671 the problem now is that investors are already worried about what the risks are and a rate freeze would only widen risk premiums more
8724672 kay hagan is trying to run a campaign in north carolina that casts her as a moderate but the money thats paying for it is coming from the left wing fringe of political thought
8724673 you can tell a lot about a person by their friends and these are friends most north carolinians would not be comfortable having over for dinner
8724674 elizabeth dole respects all north carolinians but what were saying is kay hagan is going to some interesting places to raise money
8724675 mccain frequently forgets key elements of policies gets countries names wrong forgets things hes said only hours or days before and is frequently just confused
8724676 when i started walking down the convention hall i felt the spirit
8724677 they didnt want to take a day off from work even black folks nobody believed i was going to be able to do it
8724678 every time the landlord put somebody out in the community we put them back in
8724679 i saw kids throwing rocks at cars i was angry at what was happening and i was hurt because i saw those little children being exposed to all that violence
8724680 to come here now and see a young black man who at one time couldnt even look at a white woman couldnt walk in the front door couldnt eat in the same restaurant to see obama be nominated as president
8724681 we knew that on every transaction we were making money
8724682 this was existing consumer behavior it wasnt like we were trying to create a new behavior we were just trying to provide an easier and safer way to do it
8724683 if par value of stock were treated like face value we wouldnt have a stock market
8724684 people put a lot of faith in face value but theres a big difference between face value and market value the market value of a product really varies over time the real demand is highly variable highly dynamic
8724685 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
8724686 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8724687 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8724688 mi s a parut straniu ca m a tot sunat si mi a cerut sa ne intalnim sub pretextul ca ar aranja ca eu sa prezint festivalul callatis apoi cu doar cateva zile inainte m a anuntat ca totul a picat stiam insa ca prezentatoarea festivalului alina sorescu fusese aleasa cu multa vreme inainte sincer mi e groaza sa cred ca sunt oameni care recurg la chestii de genul asta pentru a convinge o femeie sa aiba relatii sexuale cu ei

8724690 id say a super bowl ring is worth another 3 million to 5 million in national spots
8724691 i think that will certainly become more a serious consideration for many sponsors
8724692 what would certainly help is if eli took the off season taking some charisma lessons from peyton
8724693 he clearly wouldnt be this highly ranked if not for the manning name
8724694 just as asu is expanding access to its academic programs with asu online we are using the green jazz series to expand the benefits of green concepts to low income households through the green survival initiative using the music of jazz as the vehicle to spread the idea and to generate support for the green survival initiative
8724695 the gsi recognizes that there is a cost to convert to a green lifestyle and those who need it most might not be able to make that conversion
8724696 we believe that once these conversions are made each household could save anywhere from 300 to 500 annually
8724697 water is such a hot statewide issue people keep saying water is the new gold its the new oil
8724698 the baby boomer professionals came forward and said we wish we had this when we started but we want the new public managers to be ready
8724699 were helping to develop public service professionals as they move up in their career and have to deal with a larger range of issues
8724700 we prepare people to take on new responsibilities and to be strong ethical professionals so they can best represent the people they serve
8724701 the community you represent is important but also links you to the greater community you cant work in a vacuum
8724702 i was one of the voices that asked ramsey executive education to help develop my management team and to specifically prepare water managers
8724703 they have the real world experience to make a difference
8724704 its like having a big brother stand behind you in the schoolyard
8724705 thats something which needs to be debated and decided in public if youre putting taxpayer funds on the line

8724709 theres a reason sports programming is expensive people watch it
8724710 obviously not everyone wants to watch sports but not everyone has children and theyre getting the disney channel and nickelodeon
8724711 you can always make the case that there are avid fans in sports thats easy to do
8724712 if you dont believe that 10 percent of our communities will pay extra for this programming then why are you requiring all cable households to pay for it
8724713 directv has paid an enormous premium for the exclusivity of that product were hoping very much the baseball channel will be terrific but no question it was part and parcel of the extra innings package
8724714 we need some sort of fair negotiation mechanism to get our channel to the fans who want it
8724715 were just suggesting that the system is broken when after four years a fair negotiation cant take place because you havent give them rights to the product on the terms they wanted or an ownership stake
8724716 there is one thing that all of us up here agree on we dont view some form of governmental intervention as the best way to get to a deal
8724717 were all in the business of doing deals weve been through these skirmishes before and well go through them again and eventually well all figure something out that works for everybody

8724719 when i read roses poem out loud to her and her cohorts in nurse care her wrinkled face lit up with joy as she relived this remembering
8724720 if you are the son of god command this stone to be bread if you are the son of god cast yourself down from this mountain
8724721 and you shall remember all the ways which the lord your god has led you these forty years in the wilderness that god might humble you testing you to know what was in your heart whether you would keep gods commandments or not
8724722 smiles rather than from real accomplishments her experience with children in school have convinced her that while children certainly need positive attention they learn self esteem primarily from work done well

8724741 sometimes the government initiates educational policies without consulting the teachers we are on the ground and know more about what pertains in the system
8724742 the children do not have time to learn as the internet cafes increases the bad attitude of parents increases the situation only becomes worse
8724743 some of the teachers do not teach us well some do not teach us the right thing and because we dont know we assume it is right thing
8724744 some of the teachers teach us but when another teacher takes over the same subject he teaches another thing and we become confused when you ask for explanation they ignore us

8724746 at the accra conference we will be seeking to have some division of labour among donor countries and organisations to ensure that donor funds are fairly spread to benefit all the sectors needing aid
8724747 corruption and poor governance in recipient countries is a concern but not an excuse for donor countries to put unfavourable conditions on aid money
8724748 in ireland where i come from some government officials were recently caught up in huge corruption scandals but that does not warrant a vote of no confidence in the whole government in the governance system
8724749 at the accra conference we will be seeking more untied aid and less conditionalities to ensure we evolve with accra agenda for action and not inaction
8724750 we have also passed the procurement law equity tender board put in place and a proper public finance administration system to engender donor confidence

8724788 im not going to give away many more details but suffice to say its going to be a very exciting ad and i think its going to get a lot of attention
8724789 i had my sermon all prepared for today but i feel like god wants me to talk about blank instead
8724790 man is not a balloon going up into the sky nor a mole burrowing merely in the earth but rather a thing like a tree whose roots are fed from the earth while its highest branches seem to rise almost to the stars
8724791 theyre constantly undergoing inspections and parts are being changed almost everything is time limited when it gets so much time on it it is replaced or overhauled its not like your car you run your car until it breaks we dont do that with these
8724792 we were hoping to replace our aircraft when they reached 10 000 hours but through various reasons that gets delayed
8724793 these helicopters dont normally get flown as much as we fly them
8724794 we fly a lot of hours with the limited number of aircraft we have most agencies that fly as many hours as we do have probably twice as many aircraft
8724795 anybody who flies as many hours as we do probably has double the manpower and double the equipment
8724796 i lit em up with the searchlight to make sure i had the right car
8724797 and immediately they pulled over to the side all four doors opened up four kids get out and put their hands up the nearest police car was like several miles south
8724798 in pursuits now we go into a covert situation climb to a higher altitude position the aircraft so these guys cant see us and then we back off all the ground units hopefully the suspect will slow down and we can see where he stopped so far its worked out real well
8724799 we have in ground fuel tanks out here we buy in bulk 8 000 gallons at a time so were paying just under 4 a gallon right now
8724800 i was like alright this guy needs to come down here one way or the other
8724801 it was actually almost too easy to get him down here

8724807 one of the things i try to focus on is the world of ideas
8724808 i try to raise as many features of our reality as possible i try to keep a search for ideas and enlightenment i represent it with colors so even though there are many layers of possible thoughts there are few that really pop out
8724809 as i became more involved in art painter craft i started realizing that art was more than that i had to get into the discipline of figuring out what was the meaning of art by learning from those who have made a difference in the world of art
8724810 if i wanted to pursue a more direct illustration of ideas
8724811 they would become illustrations not paintings i try to separate illustration from painting that way viewers can interpret in their own way instead of my giving them everything all at once
8724812 im more into the traditional form of art working hours on the canvas and thinking and redoing
8724813 fotografiile pentru cartea de identitate se fac doar femeilor care au umerii acoperiti

8724859 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8724860 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8724861 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8724862 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8724863 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8724864 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8724865 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes

8724918 from time to time lawyers and judges have tried to define what constitutes fairness like defining an elephant it is not easy to do although fairness in practice has the elephantine quality of being easy to recognise as a result of these efforts a word in common usage has acquired the trappings of legalism acting fairly has become acting in accordance with the rules of natural justice and on occasion has been dressed up with latin tags this phrase in my opinion serves no useful purpose and in recent years it has encouraged lawyers to try to put those who hold inquiries into legal straitjackets for the purposes of my judgment i intend to ask myself this simple question did the decision maker act fairly towards the plaintiff

8725008 i think we have a much better car this year from race to race certainly last year we had a very good car at detroit id say overall the difference from 2007 to 2008 is that we have a car now that when we roll it off the truck every weekend we have a reasonable idea of where we are going to be and that is a great way to start the weekend so i think based on last years race and where we stand this year we should be in a good position at detroit
8725009 personally for me last year in detroit was one of my best races i thoroughly enjoyed the circuit i thought that penske put on a great event it was well organized well managed and a beautiful setting hopefully it will be just as nice this year and again looking forward to another good race
8725010 you probably couldnt get two more different courses because mosport is extremely flowing a traditional race course with the grass burns detroit is a street course a very beautiful street course they have done an excellent job there last year was my first time there i think it was a lot of peoples first time there and i think everyone was impressed with the facility it wasnt what a lot of us expected really the course is extremely challenging and extremely difficult with street courses you are always afraid that it is going to be just a bunch of second gear right angle turns this has some really challenging sweeping turns the first turn at detroit actually is kind of a decreasing radius fourth gear turn i actually spun there last year which was interesting but it makes for a real challenge for engineers to completely change the car around from what they had at mosport to detroit
8725011 i really enjoyed it it was somewhere that my brother dario had raced before so he had talked about it a little bit roger penske put on a fantastic show getting up early in the morning and going out for a session roger was already there organizing stuff right down to the final detail as he does and late at night going back to the bus he was still there and that is why it was a success because roger put his mark on it to me we have many great events ive been here a long time for a first year event like that there were no negatives at all i felt it was 100 percent a great event

8725041 the real danger for the government is that with the 10p rebellion in which you kindly said i led the leading was merely putting on to the circuit an email and the response was automatic and overwhelming by labour mps
8725042 now the lesson the government ought to draw from that is that when it comes to protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our community while the government obviously shares backbenchers concerns about this they do now have a group of backbenchers who are prepared to take the government right to the line to ensure that a package is delivered
8725043 we deeply regret the fact that we have been forced to suspend all zoom operations

8725050 i have a brace that helps me with my posture and i was wearing it and he was looking at me like i was crazy
8725051 and i was like no youve got to do all these steps with me
8725052 so i was doing my full dance in front of him but its hard because i kind of have to teach him and im just learning myself so i couldnt confuse him
8725053 hes coming in town for one day and hes going to spend the day rehearsing with me and see what its like
8725054 shes tough and i think shes gonna surprise people a lot
8725055 mark kirk accuses me of supporting the obama agenda well you bet i do
8725056 if you agree that more of the same is unacceptable please join our campaign for change
8725057 its a great party but its not a slam dunk that its worth spending four days outside your district
8725058 the major difference between a thing that might go wrong and a thing that cannot possibly go wrong is that when a thing that cannot possibly go wrong goes wrong it usually turns out to be impossible to get at or repair
8725059 a common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools
8725060 i went to new orleans a few days ago just for the night
8725061 i have a brace that helps me with my posture and i was wearing it and he was looking at me like i was crazy
8725062 i was doing my full dance in front of him but its hard because i kind of have to teach him and im just learning myself so i couldnt confuse him he gets so excited

8725071 in 2001 you voted for the patriot act in hindsight do you regret this
8725072 maybe if youre so shallow that the only thing you can about is money then yeah i guess
8725073 you may think im rich but i dont think im rich
8725074 anybody who tells you money is the root of all evil doesnt have any
8725075 for the love of money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows

8725083 no mention of how the keys were stolen or where from
8725084 sans internet storm center handler john bambenek in a blog post said that the weak key vulnerability identified in debian based systems a few months ago could be one source of compromised ssh keys
8725085 i do not believe that they ship with ssh key support enabled by default
8725086 the storm poses a serious threat to lives and property next week along the gulf coast all interests from the florida panhandle to south texas should closely monitor the storm prepare an emergency plan and stock up on supplies
8725087 senator mccain has always been sensitive to national crises in the 2000 race he postponed his announcement because of the situation in the balkans and we are monitoring the situation very closely
8725088 hes the one individual speaking monday night who might actually have some responsibility with regard to this
8725089 the republicans cant seem to get a break when it comes to august and when it comes to the weather

8725130 you dont really have to have substantial breasts to twirl tassels its all about the bouncing motion
8725131 they work on that sort of scale i wanted to get it out as soon as possible because im an impatient pop star
8725132 i was so passionate about that movie i still am its such an unusual character for a woman to be able to play its the only role ive played so far that has no love interest well i guess weed
8725133 its a princess bride romeo and juliet type story with monsters and pirates with big beards its very jellyfish and jon brion harry nilssons popeye soundtrack that type of music with a michel gondry look to it

8725135 mom would come up and say so what are you writing id play her a song and shed go wow go to therapy but it really is therapy for me
8725136 einen eigenen stil ist sehr gepflegt und immer zeitgem gekleidet
8725137 lafontaine scheint es v llig egal zu sein was er tr gt
8725138 i dont even know if it really matters whether she wins or not
8725139 with a capital c it is what it is we are who we are
8725140 we need to put our foot on the throats of our opponents and put it there the whole game we lacked that last year we got a big lead and we got satisfied this year we dont want to get satisfied we have to play full force every minute
8725141 the players dont like each other they went to oregon we came to washington they wish they could have come to washington
8725142 hes had a couple good days under his belt his knee is still a little bit swollen and kind of black and blue but hes not in any serious pain at all hes managed very well
8725143 coach told us we cant wait to open the gates this year were going to kick down the gates
8725144 i can understand why the fans and the media wouldnt know what to expect because in some respects the coaches dont either
8725145 we would know a lot more because weve been around practice i dont want to say were going into this thing totally blind because were not weve been practicing for several weeks now
8725146 but until you put them in a game situation youre not certain how guys are going to react particularly the guys that have not played not just the freshmen but there are some sophomores and upperclassmen that are just now getting their first opportunity to play significant amounts
8725147 i would think both have gotten to the point where we feel comfortable we could win with both of them
8725148 he has an instinct to run to daylight fast thats a good running back instinct so it makes him a little bit like a running back because hes able to get up to speed fast hes an explosive runner for a guy who is 6 6 like the guys weve seen in the olympics
8725149 you got to deal with the cards youre dealt weve had one year starters at other positions its just the quarterback obviously gets a lot of attention allan evridge has done the most to earn this right to start and thats where hes going to be
8725150 this is the last go around for many of us many of us werent part of a bowl game and weve not won a bowl game around here since 1949 so we the seniors are pulling from the top and getting guys to go in the same direction were going to win a lot of games this year
8725151 at this point i dont think spikes is going to play
8725152 he wasnt able to go today at this point i dont think harvin is going to play
8725153 if youre not invested then theres nothing to respond to because youre not invested so my guess would be the reason were still so positive very positive were going to have a great year is because there is a lot of invested football players in this program theyre older and more mature its not the same as last season which is real positive
8725154 one thing about those guys is theyre tough and they love the game of football
8725155 they should be one of the strongest units on the team if not the strongest
8725156 theyre very similar players hes always there hes one of those guys that work his tail off he starts on punt team which tells you a little bit about how much i think of him hes a very accountable guy that does the right thing all the time
8725157 hes doing very well am i surprised a little bit but he loves the game of football and goes a million miles an hour
8725158 thats why people say why would you even think about playing ryan bass
8725159 the bad thing is dewittys hurt keegans hurt the good thing is we have a lot of depth there with dmitri and jarrell woods is running good i feel bad for them not having the opportunity to play but i feel like we have a lot of depth
8725160 id like to see him play but thats why we have depth
8725161 that position we went through it last year where we had guys hurt all the time its the nature of the position thats why you try to recruit a lot of them hopefully keegan can play he might play im not going to put him out there where he can end up missing five or six games
8725162 sam cunningham did more to integrate alabama in 60 minutes than martin luther king jr accomplished in 20 years
8725163 matthews leadership has evolved hes doing what all good leaders do when you know youre the older guy and its your turn to take over that role
8725164 hes had a lot of great players to learn from the first year he doesnt attempt that because its his first year and hes learning what to do the second year hes perfecting his trade and now that hes in that role of leadership hes more comfortable
8725165 its never been my goal to be a leader like somebody else im just trying to be me i think everybody has different styles of leading and i just wanted to be here for a while put in a lot of hard work and have guys respect me that way
8725166 the verbal part comes and ive had a great bunch of seniors who have been here before me
8725167 ive been really pleased this camp because hes taken it upon himself to be really focused every day he really knew the goal coming in of wanting to be more efficient offensively and started with himself
8725168 i really felt if he played better our receivers would play better theres no doubt that our receivers are better because theyve got another year of experience weve had some injuries and been somewhat limited but hes still been extremely accurate and everybodys play has picked up around him because of it
8725169 id let them know if they messed up and they know that im not getting on them just to get on them
8725170 its kind of crazy we probably rotate more than a lot of teams do in the country and you never know how its going to be
8725171 but i get reps with a ton of different receivers every day so its not a problem
8725172 this is his team and hes the face of this program
8725173 hes earned the right to be that person hes definitely a guy who leads by example and he does that a lot more than with spoken words
8725174 we felt like a year ago at this time missouri was a great football team but it might be later in the year before everyone else realized how good they were
8725175 anytime you have a great quarterback like we knew he potentially was a great player but he didnt even come onto the scene until our game
8725176 i said after the game last year what a great team illinois was and they ended up in the rose bowl
8725177 the first game you want to start to see the personality of your team i like what ive seen but until youre in competition out on the field by yourself into the moment and having to deal with three and a half hours of football until you see it you dont really know how do you come out of halftime whats your attitude throughout the game what kind of toughness to you play with you want to see what kind of makeup they have
8725178 i have a few more gray hairs than when i started
8725179 its an opportunity to showcase the talent we have in our conference
8725180 whenever you have that opportunity i think its important you do well hopefully we can all play well
8725181 with the expectations through the roof for this football team i think theres a little bit of pressure
8725182 i hope we handle it better than we did last year when they started 0 2
8725183 you know what i actually ran into alabama freshman receiver julio jones in the spring recruiting i said hello to him and said i guess ill be seeing you at the end of august then he got out and got in his escalade and drove off thats being serious and then i went over and watched alabama freshman receiver burton scott at vigor ala high school at the track over there and burton scott was running around he went and got in his escalade out at track practice and drove off
8725184 i cant say strongly enough that i went back to make sure everyone that was there knew i was just kidding around i tried to make the effort to make sure that this didnt get the legs that you talked about i hope it doesnt cause any ill feelings with those kids thats the last thing you want i shouldnt have been kidding around
8725185 thats their strength and thats our strength its going to be a great matchup for us and them
8725186 it was a decision that me and my family had to make the coaches thought it would be best for me to redshirt than to play part time and get a year under my belt so i can be better physically and mentally it was hard at first but at the same time it was for the best
8725187 people are saying this is the kid who had all of the chances in the world and he blew it theyre right i wasnt doing what i was supposed to be doing people have this image of me that ive created and its up to me to change it
8725188 everybody in the country knows the history of fresno state
8725189 from people i know who are more familiar with west coast football they say this is pats best team in 10 years
8725190 its not exactly what i was looking to do right out of the gate because i knew he had a very good football team
8725191 we were trying to find a division i a opponent and there werent many out there and one thing led to another and we ended up with a game
8725192 its a good chance to see how good we are
8725193 im the same guy as a head coach as i was an assistant im not going to get all hyped up and charge out of that helmet and trip and fall and embarrass myself
8725194 hes probably our most valuable player outside of hes a backup running back the starting slot hes a kick returner he has a great head on shoulders he could probably go in there and play quarterback were going to do more than throw bubble screens to him were going to try to get the ball to him downfield were going to get the ball to somehow hes going to be exciting
8725195 that wasnt a very good night thats for sure that was a long night
8725196 right out of the box the guys understand the importance of it theyve talked about it all year long and theyve talked about it in training camp im sure its the same situation over in lexington right now i like opening up with this game
8725197 the new xyz phone from abc has this and that feature
8725198 do i really need the gps in my advantage do i need gps in a mobile device
8725199 vcs will give you just enough money to get the ball barely rolling but then repeatedly force your hand in later funding rounds if you even make it that far theyll have you by the cojones and youll have no choice but to give up more and more of what youve built through your blood and sweat and whats worse vcs typically bet on a large group of startups with the expectations that one will hit big the 1 in 10 guideline so what about the ones that dont make it well the founders may very well care about their creations deeply but the vcs will be quick to amputate and cauterize theyll cut their losses in a heartbeat no matter how this would affect the people whove poured their souls into their babies
8725200 plain and simple the more you work at it the more youll learn and the more likely your chances for success down the line theres almost nothing better than the freedom of not having to answer to some suits breathing down your neck and assing up everything youve worked so hard for but what about startup costs sophia and i started up tap tap tap for a few thousand dollars each out of our personal savings and were not any kind of exception theres no reason why youd need more if youre dedicated to your dream
8725201 its about time advertisers were taught to use correct terminology simply because others have gotten
8725202 as with the shortfall of gmail sans any reasonable featureset to compete with outlook contact manager is
8725203 i would not be surprised if all three played at certain times
8725204 the great thing about our new quarterback is that we have a veteran offense around him with receivers who know where theyre supposed to be a veteran offensive line that can give him some protection and guidance and veteran backs that can carry the football were going to ask him to do the things that we need from the quarterback spot but not to do anything that theyre not capable of doing
8725205 what im looking for is leadership a guy that can control the football team and who guys will look up to
8725206 and if thats both of them then itll be both of them
8725207 theres more chemistry and i guess unselfishness this year than there was even two years ago when we won the national championship we might not have the talent that we had two years ago but well be much more unselfish close and together thats whats going to bring us over the hump thats where we werent last year not enough guys had played there wasnt the experience we didnt have the same camaraderie as we do now
8725208 the fans expect us to win the national championship now but i think thats a little unrealistic at this point
8725209 michigan made a lot of mistakes on offense that threw off the whole offense but at one point they were rolling then they kind of let up off of them and appalachian state never stopped their motors never stopped they were hungry so if we get up by a touchdown or five touchdowns weve got to keep pounding them
8725210 we didnt have many guys last year but those guys stayed together from spring camp through the season this year weve juggled them around more than we did all last year put together
8725211 you have to be able to adjust our game plan has a lot of adjustment in it were going to try and be as flexible as we can without confusing our kids there are a lot of unknowns youve got a quarterback starting that you have to go back and look at san diego state film or junior college film to see him you have to look at several different teams to see what you think theyre going to be doing offensively and then you have to look at ucla film to see the personnel its a little bit different but regardless of what the situation is you have to be ready to play
8725212 wgn radio is giving right wing hatchet man stanley kurtz a forum to air his baseless fear mongering terrorist smears
8725213 hes currently scheduled to spend a solid two hour block from 9 00 to 11 00 p m pushing lies distortions and manipulations about barack and university of illinois professor william ayers
8725214 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse
8725215 it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves
8725216 at the very least they should offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies
8725217 i would say this is the biggest response weve ever got from a campaign or a candidate
8725218 this is really unprecedented with the show the way that people are flooding the calls and our email boxes
8725219 the employee free choice act is the number 1 priority for the american labor movement because workers have lost any effective right to form unions and bargain collectively
8725220 we are in a deep economic crisis and it is directly related to the assault on workers rights and the fact that we have had stagnant and declining wages for thirty years the answer to our economic crisis is not a one time stimulus check of 300 a person it is to return power to workers so they can bargain effectively with their employers for entry way into the middle class

8725448 until i heard him sing a few notes in rehearsal all it took for me to hear were a few notes after hearing coles melodic clear and rich voice my worries were belayed
8725449 i plan to attend the 2009 american idol competition when i return from my iraq tour
8725450 when i was younger singing was just something i did because i loved doing it
8725451 now it is completely different i want to make a career out of it
8725452 but ive always wanted to be a singer i had the chance to go overseas on assignment but i changed that to stay in the states so i could audition for american idol
8725453 music is what drives me to continue as well as the passion that i have to provide a good life for my daughter

8725493 ma lhai vista mi guardava come se avessi come se avessi usurpato il suo trono
8725494 e solo il suo modo di conoscere la gente si comporta in modo odioso per entrare pi facilmente nella psicologia della gente quando poi capisce di che pasta fatta una persona quali sono i suoi punti deboli eccetera la fa arrabbiare secondo lei far arrabbiare una persona il miglior modo per conoscerla fino in fondo
8725495 mi scuso da parte sua se ti ha messo a disagio
8725496 lascia perdere sono costretta a crederti sulla parola dopotutto la conosci meglio di me
8725497 sono cose che vorrei sapere sai per tenermi a distanza nei casi in cui tu possa apparire stranamente lunatico
8725498 quella di prima quella che jim ha voluto cantare a tutti i costi con sharon ti ho lanciato uno sguardo di tanto in tanto e ho notato che avevi quasi le lacrime agli occhi
8725499 a differenza di sharon preferisco domandarle le cose invece di strappargliele in un litigio
8725500 mi piace perch parla di un sogno un sogno che tiene unite due persone distanti un sogno che diventa lunico mezzo affinch queste due persone si incontrino si amino e poi quando ci riescono quando riescono finalmente ad abbattere le barriere della distanza quando riescono a toccarsi in quel loro magnifico sogno con larrivo dellalba che tutto si spezza non c pi nessun sogno e tutto finito
8725501 non ha importanza chi dio preghi n quanto a lungo
8725502 trovo per che alla fine ognuno riesce ad ottenere quello che vuole un po come una specie di premio di buona condotta
8725503 ma non credo che tu sia una persona del genere credo piuttosto che ti piacciano questo genere di cose ti piacciono le sfide questo lho capito subito
8725504 credo che ci sono persone che si incontrano si conoscono parlano un po e capiscono che possono stare insieme
8725505 come sospettavo sei uno di quelli che sa credere e sa sperare ma quando si tratta di cose illogiche o impossibili si tengono a distanza come per evitare guai ho indovinato

8725516 there seems to be a slight improvement in spirits in malaysia
8725517 we are happy he is now in parliament with the other opposition members hell bring life to parliament again beside laws can no longer be passed according to the whims and fancies of the powers that be
8725518 the altantuya shariibuu case hangs over him he has a lot to explain moreover he does not inspire others the way anwar can attract people najib does not speak well and cannot command respect from others
8725519 these characters do not have any credibility one seems to have amassed lots of wealth from his prime minister father in law the other two are great betrayers of friendships to which the malays frown upon
8725520 i dont think khairy can enter permatang pauh again he did not only criticised anwar but slandered him

8725527 oh will there be trouble if anwar takes over the federal government are the frogs really jumping
8725528 er i dont know for sure everything now is merely speculative
8725529 if anything bad happens it might happen to anwar or his family not really to us
8725530 who wants to fight with them if no one wants to fight with them can a fight happen
8725531 whatever it is we are now prepared if something like that may 13 happens again last time we were taken by surprise
8725532 and now using olympic badminton player lee chong wei to win chinese votes in permatang pauh does he deserve a datukship so soon
8725533 whatever it is we are now prepared if something like that may 13 happens again last time we were taken by surprise
8725534 gathering and colluding to commit a crime against national security
8725535 we are forced to hold our meetings trainings and seminars in our homes but the security forces have worked hard to prevent us from even holding meetings in our own homes meetings have been broken up and members have been arrested

8725897 istjs are people of their word intent on preserving social and family values at home and at work inspectors reliably examine the people and products that fall under their responsibility unobtrusively ensuring uniform quality and demanding that certain standards of conduct are maintained
8725898 in both their professional and personal lives individuals of this type are rather quiet and serious istjs are extraordinarily persevering and dependable the thought of dishonoring a contract would appall a person of this type when they give their word they give their honor istjs can be counted on to conserve the resources of the institution they serve and bring to their work a practical point of view they perform their duties without flourish or fanfare therefore the dedication they bring to their work can go unnoticed and unappreciated they may take on the burden of trying to correct the perceived faults in the system themselves resulting in overwork and burnout
8725899 while not directly seeking leadership positions istjs are often placed in such roles they build a reputation for reliable stable and consistent performance that causes others to select them to lead istjs use their past experience and their factual knowledge in their decision making
8725900 for the istj love means commitment steadiness and consistency istjs expect themselves and their mates to be responsible practical and dependable when in a relationship they behave appropriately for what the situation or their role demands for example if the relationship is in the courting stage the istj will exhibit courting behaviors such as giving boxes of candy red roses and presents
8725901 in forming relationships intjs tend to seek out others with similar character traits and ideologies

8725955 georgia chose the least human way to achieve its goal to absorb south ossetia by eliminating a whole nation

8725958 russias recognition of the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia is a necessary condition to ensure security for these nations we are obliged to support the aspiration of the people of south ossetia and abkhazia to stability peace and independence
8725959 the presidents decision is a response to those political speculators who claimed that russia needed new lands and who referred to russia as an invader and who said that russia was going to annex abkhazia and south ossetia the recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia as independent states is a refusal from annexation

8726031 o impacto ser maior no segmento p s pago pois existem pacotes que geralmente duram um ano ou seja o usu rio tem de passar mais tempo com a operadora no pr pago pode trocar toda hora o n mero porque est pagando apenas o valor do chip isso vai impactar principalmente nas ofertas das operadoras que tentar o atrair novos usu rios do seus concorrentes lembro ainda que as novas operadoras que est o entrando no mercado v o tentar conseguir clientes das operadoras que atuam
8726032 todas as operadoras t m de estar preparadas para a portabilidade num rica pois a anatel confirmou que a lei vai entrar em vigor aquelas que ainda n o est o preparadas t m alguns dias para se adequarem uma regra que vale para todas e evidentemente aquela que estiver melhor preparada se sair melhor

8726050 in a feat of biological prestidigitation likely to turn the field of regenerative medicine on its head harvard stem cell institute hsci co director doug melton and post doctoral fellow qiao joe zhou report having achieved what has long been a dream and ultimate goal of developmental biologists directly turning one type of fully formed adult cell into another type of adult cell
8726051 we decided that of the 200 we only cared about the ones that are expressed in the key part of the pancreas where the beta cells are and that got us down to about 28 then we did some lineage studies
8726052 and we got it down to nine joe said my best guess is its these nine and he were right it was a messy experiment mixing all nine and injecting them into the pancreas then we found out that it got better and better as we removed one gene at a time from the nine and eventually we found that it actually works best with three transcription factors that six of them arent that important and thats the fun of science
8726053 the ile is full of wild fowls and when the fowls has their birds ripe men out of the parish of ness in lewis sail and tarry there seven or eight days and to fetch with them home their boatfull of dry wild fowls with wild fowl feathers
8726054 we dont see the guga hunt as a tradition or a sport the birds are only taken for human consumption its always been a part of our life for me its about being away from the ordinary work you are out there in the good and bad times with the men last year was the worst ever there was a horrendous gale there was spray flying right over the island and the roof of the shelters blew off but its good to do the job even in 1974 the old folk used to say that it was dying out but its not at all it will be the same crew this year as last there will be two builders an oil man a weaver a bt worker and a few others the youngest will be in his mid 20s and the oldest will be 57 no one is ever asked to go but we say that if you go one year you can go the next its always 10 men and its always very hard work
8726055 it was an essential survival strategy and food source for communities
8726056 i used to run home from school when i heard that the guga boat had returned we used to have a great feast the tradition is still strong in ness with the young people still wanting to go in the past it was much harder they use to row out in boats without even a compass the annual seal hunt was even more dangerous but that has stopped
8726057 there are 8 000 pairs of gannets on the island and we take 2 000 chicks the birds live for about 20 years but their survival rate as fledglings is very low only about 6 live to adulthood otherwise there would be a population explosion
8726058 we use the ropes to get to the ledges although most of the birds are on the top of the cliffs it takes three seconds thats all the birds are not afraid you hardly disturb them its not cruel at all
8726059 the smell is disgusting and the taste somewhere between rotten leather and fishy beef
8726060 its like strong duck stewed in cod liver oil and salt the taste is bad enough but my god the smell as its boiled it smells awful truly really really bad like the worst thing you have ever smelt times 100 000

8726091 men already dwell in this society of the three blessed persons of the trinity their minds and wills already go straight out to god unbroken in their course by the intervention of measures made by human authority their faith rests on the first truth of god not directly on any articulate dogma or the teaching authority of the church these are the theological virtues directly related to god and not modulated by the reason their effect is not to produce a good citizen or even a reasonable fellow but to make men move at ease in the extravagances of divine friendship christianity offers more than a superior sort of civic philosophy the philosophers may counsel it but they cannot plan for this adventure beyond the severely rational country of the good life where the political virtues are displayed of men sensibly and justly comporting themselves reason may go far but not into a higher and more mysterious region at least not alone for it is not a place of things clad in meanings and forms but of naked existents here is no justice content with accommodations to the present city but rather a soaring off to god and less mysterious the insistence that no man should suppress his own sincere conscience in the name of an obedience to an extrinsic code

8726253 subjects systematically favoured the prosocial option provided their partner was a familiar b visible and c receiving rewards of equal value
8726254 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them

8726299 public administration was the militias partner in crime says cpi president
8726300 if the public administration had simply looked the other way the militias would not have grown as powerful the city government had its eyes wide open the militias served its interests they helped to elect persons who occupied posts in the public security bureaucracy the government encouraged them i am talking about concrete actions such as budgetary allocations to social centers controlled by militias permission for militias chieftains to run for public office using the political partys name and organization
8726301 many politicians were benefited by the militias it is enough to note that the campaigns of former public security secretaries were welcomed into rio da pedras we know that only those who have a deal with the militia can campaign their the militias have not been confronted there was never any plan to confront the militias on the contrary they were often treated as a solution a lesser evil
8726302 for a long time the mayor of rio de janeiro referred to them as community self defense groups that is not shutting ones eyes to the problem that is going in with your eyes wide open looking to present the militias in a positive light
8726303 now the state is going up against these groups it took them a long long time to do it these militias have grown a lot in getting to this point but only this year have we managed to coordinate the work of the legislature the prosecutors office and the state judicial police finally the public administration no longer perceives the militias as a lesser evil
8726304 there has been a change in policy in his testimony to the cpi he said so he said the militias are not a lesser evil
8726305 in his testimony to the cpi neves said i was wrong i thought at first it was the lesser evil i no longer think so i was wrong
8726306 much more so than the disorganized drug trade which is violent and brutal but which is clearly disorganized which has not political wing
8726307 in this way the state gives up its monopoly on the use of force you have parallel justice you have state power put up for sale to the highest bidder
8726308 palace guard and militiaman pimped child sex slaves on upscale beach
8726309 the residents complained that they had received a veiled threat from the sergeant
8726310 because of events like this the militia has not made it to the southern zone could it take root there it could but it is important to underscore that the more conscious residents are of their rights and duties and the greater a voice the community has the more difficult it is for the militia to take root
8726311 the alem o complex for example is a community ripe for mililtia takeovers because the state has completely abandoned it this is a place with 200 000 residents and just one state school just three public schools in all there is no security policy that is working there is no way for order to be negotiated it has to be imposed it has to be violent there the state disputes control of the area currently controlled by the drug trade with criminals
8726312 this is a militia that acts like a big monopoly with massive use of force and with mafia characteristics given that it is family controlled
8726313 in jacarepagu you have not just one militia but several
8726314 this definition helps us avoid confusing militias with for example private security or death squads if we do not define clearly what a militia is then everything becomes a militia in which case nothing is a militia
8726315 people are free to hire and pay for that service it sets up a gate and posts guards there is a contract between the service provider and the customer with militias people are forced to pay for the service
8726316 rare are the militias who do not have a political tie with some elected official if a given politician gets all of the votes in one neighborhood and no votes anyway else that is a sign the politician needs investigating another sign is when the politician exercises some business activity with known ties to militia schemes we have not yet totaled up how many candidates have militia ties but we know who the strongest militia candidates are and we are going to call them to testify

8726331 i was heartbroken when my ring vanished and justin was not best pleased either
8726332 i left it on the bathroom window ledge when i took a shower but it wasnt there when i returned
8726333 i thought it must have fallen in the bathroom or even fell out of the window but it was a complete mystery
8726334 when justin got home i told him what had happened and the pair of us searched everywhere
8726335 we ripped up the bathroom lino pulled up floorboards and even took the panel off the bath thinking it must have somehow slipped through but still it was nowhere to be found
8726336 i tormented myself for months looking all over the house for it thinking that my mind must have been playing tricks on me
8726337 i repeatedly rummaged through drawers and lifted carpets and turned the car inside out
8726338 i even accused the window cleaner of swiping it as the window was open but he swore blind that he knew nothing and i no proof
8726339 a few years later we had to put the wedding off as i gave birth to our son luis
8726340 needing more space we found ourselves putting the house up for sale so i made justin tidy up the garden and cut the trees back
8726341 he started to prune our big oak tree and noticed an old nest in the branches so he nipped up a ladder to have a look inside and found my missing ring
8726342 the bird must have swooped down and nabbed it from the open window
8726343 its amazing the ring was still there but im so glad to get it back

8726347 patients can benefit from mis hip procedures and in the hands of experienced well trained surgeons they get a predictable excellent surgical outcome
8726348 when considering mis hip replacements patients should also be aware of potential risks other institutions have published reports of increased mis associated complications including femur fracture nerve injury and mis placement of components possibly requiring additional surgery and affecting the longevity of the hip reconstruction a joint replacement needs to last nearly 20 years and no long term data is currently available with mis thorough comparative studies of the longevity and risks of newer approaches are required

8726356 i believe i will wake up because i have the accumulated experience of having done it many other times

8726400 under a government which imprisons unjustly the true place for a just man is also a prison where the state places those who are not with her but against her the only house in a slave state in which a free man can abide with honor cast your whole vote not a strip of paper merely but your whole influence a minority is powerless while it conforms to the majority it is not even a minority then but it is irresistible when it clogs by its whole weight if the alternative is to keep all just men in prison or give up war and slavery the state will not hesitate which to choose if a thousand men were not to pay their tax bills this year that would not be a violent and bloody measure as it would be to pay them and enable the state to commit violence and shed innocent blood this is in fact the definition of a peaceable revolution if any such is possible
8726401 the progress from an absolute to a limited monarchy from a limited monarchy to a democracy is a progress toward a true respect for the individual is a democracy such as we know it the last improvement possible in government is it not possible to take a step further towards recognizing and organizing the rights of man there will never be a really free and enlightened state until the state comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent power from which all its own power and authority are derived and treats him accordingly

8726450 we must make the rescue of the environment the central organizing principle for civilization
8726451 al is a radical environmentalist who wants to change the very fabric of america
8726452 he gore criticizes america for being america a place where people enjoy the benefits of an advanced standard of living
8726453 he gore has no sense of proportion he equates the failure to recycle aluminum cans with the holocaust
8726454 he gore believes that our civilization itself is evil because it is in his words addicted to the consumption of the earth
8726455 there is not a single passage in that book that i disagree with or would change
8726456 it ought to be possible to establish a coordinated global program to accomplish the strategic goal of completely eliminating the internal combustion engine by government fiat over say a 25 year period
8726457 i wrote in this book earth in the balance that we should set as a strategic goal the phasing out of the internal combustion engine over a 25 year period i accept now that was a mistake twenty five years is far too long for a goal like that i think we can do it quicker
8726458 the united states could start by gradually imposing a higher gasoline tax hiking it by one or two cents per month until gasoline costs 2 50 to 3 00 per gallon comparable to prices in europe and japan
8726459 the time for action is due and past due ehrlich has written the prescription
8726460 higher taxes on fossil fuels is one of the logical first steps in changing our policies in a manner consistent with a more responsible approach to the environment
8726461 the meeting quickly turned to the gasoline tax vice president gore a strong environmentalist who advocated energy taxes as a way to reduce pollution argued that the tax should be retained president clinton could be attacked on character if he dropped the gasoline tax now gore said emphatically and emotionally
8726462 the agenda inside the clinton white house part 3 of 4
8726463 gore was the chief advocate of the energy tax arguing that it was good for both the economy and the environment
8726464 pushed up production prices and created a patchwork of contradictory gasoline formulas in various parts of the country
8726465 in the speech in which i declared my candidacy i focused on global warming ozone depletion and the ailing global environment and declared that these issues along with nuclear arms control would be the principal focus of my campaign
8726466 no one knows what will happen as a result of ozone depletion the greenhouse effect and other environmental problems that cannot yet be foreseen and as nuclear proliferation has shown new technology cannot be kept out of the hands of dictators and irresponsible third world leaders
8726467 artificial needs have been created advertising and marketing techniques have been developed that make many people feel they need things that their grandparents never desired or even dreamed of it seems for many people maybe the majority these artificial forms are insufficient a theme that appears repeatedly in the writings of the social critics of the second half of the 20th century is the sense of purposelessness that afflicts many people in modern society
8726468 whenever any technology is used to mediate our experience of the world we gain power but we also lose something in the process the increased productivity of assembly lines in factories for examples requires many employees to repeat the identical task over and over until they lose any feeling of connection to the creative process and with it their sense of purpose
8726469 like the sorcerers apprentice who learned how to command inanimate objects to serve his whims we too have set in motion forces more powerful than we anticipated and that are harder to stop than start
8726470 technological progress marches in only one direction it can never be reversed once a technological innovation has been introduced people usually become dependent on it so that they can never again do without it unless it is replaced by some still more advanced innovation
8726471 oh say the technophiles science is going to fix all that we will conquer famine eliminate psychological suffering make everybody healthy and happy
8726472 some argue that a new ultimate technology whether nuclear energy or genetic engineering will solve the problem we have also fallen victim to a kind of technological hubris which tempts us to believe that our new powers may be unlimited we dare to imagine that we will find technological solutions for every technologically induced problem technological hubris tempts us to lose sight of our place in the natural order and believe that we can achieve whatever we want
8726473 very widespread in modern society is the search for fulfillment yet for the majority of people whose main goal is fulfillment technology does not bring completely satisfactory fulfillment

8726560 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8726561 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8726562 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8726563 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8726564 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8726565 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8726566 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8726567 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8726573 es cierto que los osos de la cordillera comen poco ganado y son m s aficionados a los colmenares pero afortunadamente los ataques a colmenares se evitan pr cticamente con el uso de pastores el ctricos
8726574 lo m s probable es que el lazo haya sido puesto por alguien que intentase quitar los jabal es de en medio o que busca trofeos de corzos o ciervos
8726575 de las 10 reses muertas en estos meses cinco fueron atacadas antes de que los reba os se reagruparan bajo la vigilancia del pastor y las otras cinco pertenecen a ganaderos que no han participado en la iniciativa
8726576 porque en oto o antes de volver a hibernar el animal tiene que acumular reservas y suele aumentar los ataques
8726577 estamos ensayando distintos sistemas para evitar que el oso se acerque a las zonas donde est n instaladas las colmenas como la colocaci n de vallas electrificadas o de luces que emiten destellos como las que sirven para se alizar carreteras u obras p blicas por ejemplo
8726578 mi metto il gggel e faccio finta di avere i capelli
8726579 confiamos en acercarnos aunque hay que actuar con gran sigilo puesto que es oso es un animal fuerte con buena vista y excelente olfato
8726580 la reciente aparici n de un oso con un cable de acero incrustado en su cuerpo pone de manifiesto que la colocaci n de trampas es un hecho constante al que la junta de castilla y le n no pone freno
8726581 hoy mismo hemos tenido noticia de otros puntos de colocaci n de venenos y del hallazgo de un zorro muerto previsiblemente por envenenamiento en el norte de palencia
8726582 en asturias se pagan los da os a colmenares en 30 a 40 d as en castilla y le n la burocracia hace interminable el proceso es cuesti n de a os eso provoca una situaci n de enfrentamiento que detectamos sobre todo en el mbito osero oriental donde tan solo quedan 25 o 30 osos
8726583 el lobo dijo es una especie que estaba de forma permanente en la cordillera cant brica pero que ha avanzado recuperando territorios que hab a dejado como la cara norte de los picos de europa o la sierra de cuera ya muy pr xima a la costa de llanes en asturias
8726584 est creando un profundo malestar entre los apicultores de las zonas oseras de castilla y le n
8726585 hist ricamente dice la nota las mayores muertes de osos siempre se han producido en los colmenares ya que el h bito de los osos a volver a comer de las colmenas una vez que han entrado en un colmenar propicia la muerte de estos animales

8726609 people are confused and lethargic not simply because they are tired of hearing the gospel or because they have never really been emotionally gripped by it but also because they are confused they have not heard the gospel in a way that provokes a thoughtful basement to attic reappraisal of themselves and their world

8726616 meaningful to speak of theory in the study of social phenomena at least not in the sense that theory is used in natural science
8726617 the hermeneutic phenomenological argument takes its point of departure in a critical difference between natural and social sciences the former studies physical objects while the latter studies self reflecting humans and must therefore take account of changes in the interpretations of the objects of study stated in another way in social science the object is a subject
8726618 the problem in the study of human activity is that every attempt at a context free definition of an action that is a definition based on abstract rules or laws will not necessarily accord with the pragmatic way an action is defined by the actors in a concrete social situation
8726619 episteme scientific knowledge universal invariable context independent based on general analytical rationality the original concept is known today from the terms epistemology and epistemic
8726620 techne craft art pragmatic variable context dependent oriented toward production based on practical instrumental rationality governed by a conscious goal the original concept appears today in terms such as technique technical and technology
8726621 phronesis ethics deliberation about values with reference to praxis pragmatic variable context dependent oriented toward action based on practical value rationality the original concept has no analogous contemporary term
8726622 let me reiterate that the evaluation of the case study as a research method and the revision of the five misunderstandings described above should not be interpreted as a rejection of research which focuses on large random samples or entire poluations for example questionnaire surveys this type of research is essential for the development of social sciences for example in understanding the degree to which certain phenomena are present in a give group or how they vary across cases the advantage of large samples is breadth while their problems is one of depth for the case study the situation is the reverse both approaches are necessary for a sound development of social science this being said it should nevertheless be added that the balance between case studies and large samples is currently biased in favor of the latter in social science so biased that it puts case studies at a disadvantage within most disciplines
8726623 p ower relations do not stand in an external relationship to other forms of relations
8726624 both the dominant and dominated enter into relations of power which none of them control in a simple absolute way
8726625 power cannot be acquired taken or shared nor can it be retained or allowed to slip away
8726626 foucalt sees discourses not simply as surface projections of power mechanisms via discourse and interpretation rationality and power become interwoven
8726627 the phronetic researcher is forced to face the question of foundationalism versus relativism that is the view that central values exist that can be rationally and universally grounded versus the view that one set of values is just as good as another phronetic researchers reject both of these isms and replace them by contextualism that is by situational ethics phroentic researchers realize that our sociality and history is the only foundation we have the only solid ground under our feet
8726628 to develop theory but to contribute to societys practical rationality in elucidating where we are where we want to go and what is desirable according to diverse sets of values and interests
8726629 the goal of phronetic research is to produce input to the ongoing social dialogue and praxis in a society rather than to generate ultimate unequivocally verified knowledge

8726684 in a region where abortion is highly restricted the supreme court has taken a huge leap forward in protecting womens basic human rights todays ruling opens the door for women across the country to demand that their local governments follow mexico citys example
8726685 the ministers that voted against his proposal say there is no place explicitly in the mexican constitution or in international law that says life should be protected from the moment of conception

8726694 porque hay personas que van a dejar de tributar o van a tributar menos aunque en el total de la recaudaci n se ve diluido el impacto negativo sobre las cuentas p blicas por la mayor recaudaci n en seguridad social
8726695 el pago retroactivo va a generar una masa de dinero importante en octubre en ingresos que normalmente tienen una alta propensi n al consumo que se destinar an al mercado y generar an presiones sobre los precios aunque marginalmente a diferencia de otras ocasiones por efecto de la alta inflaci n
8726696 la medida est llevada a cabo en un momento no muy positivo ya que lo fiscal comenz a ser un tema de incertidumbre m s all de que los rumores son bastante exagerados por el momento
8726697 eso implica que si se mantiene el mismo m nimo no imponible del a o pasado se estar a gravando algo que no ser an ganancias realmente sino que es una suba del costo de vida
8726698 es razonable que el gobierno aumente el m nimo no imponible sin embargo esto tiene algunos costos fiscales aunque ya se vio el a o pasado que fueron bastante menores de lo que se esperaba porque si bien se reduce la recaudaci n del impuesto a las ganancias aumenta la recaudaci n de otros impuestos como el iva m s vinculados al consumo
8726699 est indicando el cortoplacismo que caracteriza a la pol tica oficial seguimos en materia impositiva con la pol tica del parche renunciando a encarar lo que es impostergable que es la puesta en marcha de una reforma impositiva capaz de gravar rentas extraordinarias y consumo superior
8726700 tendr a que combinar una estrategia m ltiple que se asentara en una fuerte y dr stica reforma impositiva de signo progresivo
8726701 la medida no hace m s que reflejar lo perdido que est el gobierno en la materia e incluso puede tener por ser una medida aislada efectos negativos por tratarse de ingresos medios y medios altos uno no puede suponer que todo lo que se desgrave vaya a consumo una parte puede ir a ahorro y puede haber p rdida en t rminos de recaudaci n
8726702 la medida puede tener efectos negativos en t rminos fiscales y de precios

8726713 my old self has been crucified with christ it is no longer i who live but christ lives in me
8726714 because the god who loves me tells me that the fulfilling life he has in store for me will be robbed by things which pull my attention away from him it may look really good now but later ill feel discontent and disconnected from god and its just not worth it to me

8726808 i only wish we had a documentary crew with us throughout the past three years
8726809 readers know my personal disdain for bill clinton but longtime readers will also know i have always defended his solid centrist smart record in office and defended him against his most over reaching enemies tonight i think was one of the best speeches he has ever given

8726811 a tobacco advertising and promotion are causally related to increased tobacco use and b exposure to depictions of smoking in movies is causally related to youth smoking initiation
8726812 cultural derision or at least marginalization of religious beliefs with the campaign in different european countries and cities against the religious symbols of christmas
8726813 the reason often given for this is the desire to not offend persons of other religions among us especially the muslims
8726814 but it is a pretext an excuse in reality it is not the muslims who do not want these symbols but a certain non believing group in society muslims have nothing against the christian celebration of christmas indeed they honor it
8726815 we have arrived at a rather absurd juncture on the one hand many muslims celebrate the birth of jesus and want a cr che in their home and say that those who do not believe in the miraculous birth of jesus are not muslim
8726816 and on the other hand there are many who call themselves christians who want to make christmas a winter festival populated only by reindeer and teddy bears

8726841 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8726842 my champions my sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits you never gave in you never gave up and together we made history
8726843 i am still looking for the obama experience thursday night
8726844 did it bring closure no we need to save some tears for tomorrow
8726845 there would be no end to it you would have the whole campus covered with them in no time

8726862 several kids and babies died in the fields because parents were fearful of sending them to head start
8726863 since early 2007 many of our programs started to notice that border patrol of immigration and customs enforcement ice vehicles were parked outside their centers and some were following buses picking up children
8726864 it could have happened if we believe there was an immigration violation afoot but its not our policy or practice i believe
8726865 all u s immigration and customs enforcement operations are targeted based on leads received and subsequent investigations generally our operations avoid actions at school settings however we will take into custody during these targeted operations anyone encountered who may be in the country illegally
8726866 we are dedicated to providing prompt fair and equitable services to everyone in our community and know that this initiative will make it easier for people to come forward
8726867 the hotline for lgbts is an expression of the fact that the police extend assistance and protection to all people in our diverse community
8726868 this shows that peel region is ahead of the game when it comes to inclusion the hate crime hotline shows a true commitment to safeguarding all citizens in the community
8726869 the consequence of the extreme severity of this penalty and of the absolute impossibility of avoiding it is that the night watches of the roman army are faultlessly kept
8726870 men who have been posted to a covering force are often doomed to certain death this is because they will remain at their posts even when they are overwhelmingly outnumbered on account of their dread of the punishment that awaits them
8726871 those who have lost a shield or a sword or any weapon on the battlefield often hurl themselves upon the enemy hoping that they will either recover the weapon they have lost or else escape by death from the inevitable disgrace and the humiliations they would suffer at home
8726872 now i want each of you to choose a number
8726873 but it isnt only your severe punishments that produce right conduct
8726874 that alone wouldnt make men brave you encourage them to act heroically by holding out all kinds of rewards and incentives
8726875 and the comrade whose life he had saved revered him for the rest of his life and treated him as his own father
8726876 i sure have thats another good example of how you inspire everyone to earn himself a good reputation
8726877 globalization especially the increasing connections of our economy with others around the world
8726878 these findings run counter to the widespread assumption that people in the muslim world are anxious and hostile about the prospect of integration into the global economy
8726879 do you think that countries that are part of international trade agreements should or should not be required to maintain minimum standards for protection of the environment
8726880 that which is on earth we have made but as a glittering show for the earth in order that we may test them as to which of them are best in conduct
8726881 o mankind we created you from a single pair of a male and a female and made you into nations and tribes that ye may know each other not that ye may despise each other verily the most honored of you in the sight of allah is he who is the most righteous of you and allah has full knowledge and is well acquainted with all things
8726882 those who believe in the quran and those who follow the jewish scriptures and the christians and the sabians and who believe in allah and the last day and work righteousness shall have their reward with their lord on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve
8726883 if anyone slays a human being unless it be in punishment for murder or for spreading corruption on earth it shall be as though he had slain all mankind whereas if anyone saves a life it shall be as though he had saved the lives of all mankind
8726884 only four people worked directly for the municipality everyone else was a contractor
8726885 we presented the best case we could with what we had
8726886 certainly we thought it was enough to convict him of the crime and the jury in dade county chose to ignore it
8726887 they came to the right conclusion all prosecutors had was an uncorroborated post traumatic recollection of the victim they had no dna no gun no confession no gunshot residue
8726888 this works by using the bodys natural processes the reason the tattoo stays there is that a coating is put around the link to protect it from the bodys immune response
8726889 but this cream makes the ink identifiable to the body so that it realises the ink is there and starts rejecting it and healing itself
8726890 it is uncomfortable rather than painful but it is less painful than having the tattoo itself and certainly a lot less painful than having laser treatment
8726891 has gone the way of the dodo the typewriter and the eight track tape
8726892 particularly during the sars epidemic xinhua has for last few months been putting out news reports embarrassing to the government but they are designed to fool the international community since they are not published in chinese
8726893 it was unlikely that equality considerations could outweigh the enormous impact of failing to give churches an exemption in relation to their spiritual leaders
8726894 things and people i am annoying you didnt tell me about long ago
8726895 you bastards spoiled this book for me in your stupid blurb

8726898 yo its about that time to bring forth the rhythm and the rhyme
8726899 i was like yes this is the sh t i need to be doing
8726900 this is like my character from the departed fear four brothers all mixed into one times ten
8726901 take off the suit and if you want to go one on one two on one and put a couple of you guys together they all like to put the comic book characters together come at me
8726902 im not talking about financial box office im talking about one on one with these puts up fists
8726903 we are the only people who tru ly understand the heart of jesus the anguish of jesus and the hope of jesus
8726904 we believe the bible to be the word of god in so far as it is translated correctly
8726905 they draw near to me with their lips but their hearts are far from me they teach for doc trines the commandments of men having a form of godliness but they deny the power thereof
8726906 there is no authority in the word of god for the doctrine of the trinity of the godhead
8726907 the plain truth is that this is another of satans attempts to keep the god fearing person from learn ing the truth of jehovah and his son christ jesus
8726908 now other prophecies reveal we are to soon have probably in about four years such drought and famine that disease epidemics will follow taking millions of lives well we have been get ting foretastes of them
8726909 the full establishment of the kingdom of god in the earth at a d 1914
8726910 before the end of a d 1914 the last member of the body of christ will be glorified with the head

8726915 there is no difference between the present communist party and the past nationalist party

8726921 you can expect us to continue to offer athlon branded processors in the future
8726922 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us deliberately created this conflict in order to worsen the situation and create an advantage for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states
8726923 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate it sounds not rational
8726924 we expected the u s to intervene in the conflict and stop the aggressive actions of the georgian leadership
8726925 go home al jazeera voices for al qaeda and bin laden
8726926 al jazeera is the no 1 propaganda machine for the enemies we fight
8726927 they think im bringing in terrorists to launch a jihad in the little town of golden
8726928 i guess you could call it a mild jihad for the truth

8726932 comprises around 200 top elitists in government banking business media and academia who meet annually in semi secrecy and manipulate the world yet are subject to little or no mainstream media scrutiny
8726933 the unelected if indisputable chairman of the american establishment one of the most powerful influential and richest men in america the hub of a vast network of financiers industrialists and politicians whose reach encircles the globe
8726934 a world system of financial control in private hands to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole
8726935 if a nation expects to be ignorant and free it expects what never was and never will be
8726936 unfortunately we have to state that attempts are being made to secure certain interests using force not the principles of strict observance of international law and denial of confrontational bloc thinking
8726937 a fine example of such irresponsible criminal actions is georgias aggression against south ossetia it is well known who connived with the georgian authorities and even incited them pursuing their own profit such behavior is unacceptable and should be stopped in such an extreme situation we remained reserved and continued our responsible and predictable policy
8726938 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aid using battleships
8726939 i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
8726940 its because of all of you that michelle and i have this great honor of helping to lead the party and win back this white house
8726941 senator obamas speech tonight will be as he himself has characterized it more workmanlike a very direct conversation with the american people about the choice we face in this election about the risk of staying on the same path were on the risk of just more of the same versus the change we need
8726942 i am scheduled to be in minnesota tomorrow to be at the state fair
8726943 hes a great american and a great and dear friend and i rely on him and i have for many years
8726944 doing the speech at mile high is an important point for our campaign its symbolic of how sen obama won the nomination it will show how obama wants to involve people who are not usually involved in the political process
8726945 this roman like facade a facade with roman columns is a perfect metaphor or icon for the point that its an interesting production but behind it theres not much there
8726946 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8726947 sua madre al pi indiavolato dei suoi figli aveva comprato quand era fanciullo un tamburo e una sciabola di legno il bambino con il primo passava ore a suonare la cadenza delle marce militari e con il secondo attrezzo si improvvisava condottiero non avendo seguaci disegnava sui muri file di soldati schierati per la battaglia suonava il tamburo e poi con la sciabola partiva alla carica

8727020 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8727021 it was in a set place all night and it would move to the left and then very quickly back to the right
8727022 we are used to jets flying overhead but they are quickly gone sometimes there are events with lights at east kirkby aviation heritage centre but there was nothing on that night
8727023 they were cutting corn in a field nearby and at first we wondered if their lights were being reflected in some way but they stopped at midnight
8727024 so i dont know what it could have been i kept getting up in the night to check and the light was still there sometimes still and then suddenly moving from left to right very quickly in a way that no aeroplane or helicopter can move

8727450 proprio come limperatore tiberio la cui isola capri si trova di fronte alla mia finestra non sapeva in che modo cominciare il proprio messaggio al senato cos io agitato da sentimenti contrastanti in mezzo alle preoccupazioni e alle distrazioni tra le visioni e le spese in mezzo allincessante vociare della gente che riempie il lungomare al suono delle catene dei forzati al canto dei pulcinella dei lazzaroni e delle lavandaie non sono capace non so da cosa incominciare la mia lettera ogni giorno il popolo si riversa a ondate

8727486 i am not anti pharma not even close i have significant investments in device and drug companies being against fda preemption is from my perspective one way to try to protect those investments and to protect legal rights and public health as well
8727487 previous administrations and the fda considered tort litigation to be an important part of an overall regulatory framework for drugs and devices product liability litigation by consumers was believed to complement the fdas regulatory actions and enhance patient safety in stripping patients of their right to seek redress through due process of law preemption of common law tort actions is not only unjust but will also result in the reduced safety of drugs and medical devices for the american people

8727496 i went around screaming my head about this about ten or twelve years ago we described this to intelligence agencies and to the national security council in detail
8727497 theres no vulnerabilities no protocol errors there are no software problems the problem arises from the level of interconnectivity thats needed to maintain this mess to keep it all working
8727498 everyone has assumed until now that you have to break something for a hijack to be useful
8727499 but what we showed here is that you dont have to break anything and if nothing breaks who notices
8727500 the rate of bgp path updates goes up by a factor of 200 to 400
8727501 they simply dont because it takes work and to do sufficient filtering to prevent these kinds of attacks on a global scale is cost prohibitive
8727502 that means that nobody could put themselves into the chain into the path unless they had been authorized to do so by the preceding as router in the path
8727503 we havent seen the attacks and so a lot of times people dont start working on things and trying to fix them until they get attacked
8727504 but the youtube case is the perfect example of an attack where somebody could have done much worse than what they did
8727505 the only thing that can force them to fix bgp is if their customers start to demand security solutions

8727518 the trailers give us more payload reducing the number of trucks required on each job actually eliminating a truck movement on most jobs undertaken
8727519 we deliver asphalt and aggregate and the trailers give an even flow on discharge which increases productivity on every job and aids the crews on each job site
8727520 we like what we see and the trailers are highly efficient in a host of applications for our company in recent times we have leaned more towards eight wheelers but this is the next step in the product delivery process
8727521 trailers are getting bigger and better and the hamelex white units are delivering better payloads coupled with a high level of efficiency particularly where weight is an issue turnaround times are excellent which is a plus for us again increasing efficiency and productivity
8727522 technology is going ahead in leaps and bounds and as we are constantly seeking improvements across the board the trailers are definitely on the right track for our business efficiency is such that the trailers provide increased service levels contributing to speedy delivery on full consignment loads
8727523 one aspect of the trailers is that the risk of rollover at job sites has been eliminated taken out of the equation and the concept is ideally suited to the delivery application with easy unloading in line with site crew requirements and a high level of manoeuvrability in the tightest areas
8727524 what does stand out is the trailers are very structurally sound and that is vital in our business as reliability and dependability is what we have based our business on we anticipate a long and trouble free life and to date that has been the case

8727532 the american dream is under siege at home and americas leadership in the world has been weakened middle class and low income americans are hurting with incomes declining job losses poverty and inequality rising mortgage foreclosures and credit card debt increasing health care coverage disappearing and a very big spike in the cost of food utilities and gasoline
8727533 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power look at the example the republicans have set in this decade american workers have consistently given us rising productivity that means year after year they work harder and produce more now what did they get in return declining wages less than one fourth as many new jobs as in the previous eight years smaller health care and pension benefits rising poverty and the biggest increase in income inequality since the 1920s american families by the millions are struggling with soaring health care costs and declining coverage
8727534 to those who still believe in the myth of a maverick instead of the reality of a politician i say lets compare senator mccain to candidate mccain
8727535 now we owe more on the house than its worth how are we going to send the kids to college how are we gonna be able to retire thats the america that george bush has left us and thats the future john mccain will give us these are not isolated discussions among families down on their luck these are common stories among middle class people who worked hard and played by the rules on the promise that their tomorrows would be better than their yesterdays that promise is the bedrock of america it defines who we are as a people and now its in jeopardy i know it you know it but john mccain doesnt get it
8727536 when john mccain proposes 200 billion in new tax breaks for corporate america 1 billion alone for just eight of the largest companies but no relief for 100 million american families thats not change thats more of the same even today as oil companies post the biggest profits in history a half trillion dollars in the last five years he wants to give them another 4 billion in tax breaks but he voted time and again against incentives for renewable energy solar wind biofuels thats not change thats more of the same

8727547 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8727548 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8727549 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8727550 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8727551 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8727552 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8727553 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8727570 transformed with greek like columns and something the republicans yes wasted no time in pointing out
8727571 republicans who are mocking obamas appearance havent mentioned it but george w bush accepted his own nomination in 2004 on a set with a similar neoclassical theme with columns rising on either side of him
8727572 the mccain campaign calls the look at invesco field the temple of obama
8727573 ridicule from republicans because its setting up obama on this stage with these columns around him

8727593 rick rubin ci ha fatto capire che sarebbe stato interessante rivisitare molte delle cose che abbiamo fatto negli anni 80 dopo and justice siamo corsi il pi lontano possibile da quelle proposte perch terrorizzati dal ripeterci ultimamente abbiamo risuonato master of puppets nella sua interezza per tutta lestate ed stato divertente ci ha riportato in confidenza col nostro passato dal quale possiamo essere influenzati senza averne paura lalbum che abbiamo registrato ora ispirato dallo stesso modo di pensare e di registrare che avevamo negli anni 80
8727594 james ha detto che il nuovo lavoro pu essere collocato tra master e and justice ma allo stesso tempo questalbum ha una individualit non suona come killem all e nemmeno come ride the lightning ogni album dei metallica ha una identit propria
8727595 non so dove abbiamo trovato il coraggio in realt il processo di composizione di death magnetic stato davvero tranquillo tutti potevano prendersi una pausa quando volevano non cera uno psicologo a rompere le scatole nemmeno un produttore col quale lavorare a fianco rick si presentava una volta ogni tanto tutto ci che accaduto con st anger doveva accadere prima o poi era necessario se non ci fosse stato st anger questalbum avrebbe suonato in maniera completamente diversa
8727596 rob verr a casa vostra a pulire e a sistemarvi il tappeto risate ndr lidea dietro mission metallica quella di portare i fan dentro il processo di composizione dellalbum un concetto semplice ed efficace di solito le altre band e anche noi in passato non vanno oltre a un conto alla rovescia sui vari siti ufficiali il progetto stato apprezzato moltissimo dal pubblico ed una finestra interessante su quello che accade negli studi di registrazione a met tra il caos e il predeterminato
8727597 no e stato tutto un brutto sogno non ho nulla contro internet una questione di controllo io faccio musica e decido di regalarla nessun problema tu decidi di fare musica e di regalarla nessun problema se io per faccio musica e tu decidi di darla via a gratis capite che unaltra cosa ci stato tolto quel potere decisionale ed una cosa che non ci piace affatto se ti piacciono i metallica devi anche volere che siano i metallica a prendere le decisioni sono passati otto anni oramai da quello scandalo ora non avrei nemmeno lenergia per intraprendere una lotta del genere preferisco giocare coi miei figli oggi in ogni caso abbiamo i migliori siti internet su live metallica potete scaricare i concerti poco tempo dopo che sono stati suonati poi abbiamo mission metallica e abbiamo un sito ufficiale sono molto fiero di tutto questo
8727598 bob rock un musicista rick non sa suonare uno strumento
8727599 rick come un dottore per le canzoni e un uomo molto intelligente che sa come suggestionare ci ha fatto rialzare laccordatura e ha riportato james a cantare su tonalit pi alte visto che ancora in grado solo questo ha contribuito a ridare quellenergia che la gente non sperimentava da parecchio tempo
8727600 non saprei cosa risponderti la mia band preferita sta suonando ora the sword amo i mastodon i machine head non seguo la scena thrash attuale in maniera abbastanza attenta da poterti dare una risposta di sicuro ai tempi suonavamo pi alti ora una gara a chi suona pi ribassato non dico che sia meglio o peggio ma sicuramente una differenza che si nota immediatamente anche le vocals sono sempre pi aspre e lontane dalla melodia tutti cantano come mostri

8727623 these were probably made as part of a very elaborate ritual
8727624 there are stones huge columns and sculptures of priests in the caves
8727625 caves are natural portals to other realms which could have inspired the mayan myth they are related to darkness to fright and to monsters

8727627 u s citizens were indeed in the area in conflict

8727630 for the russians to say they are not responsible for what happened in georgia is ludicrous russia is to blame for this crisis and the world is responding to what russia has done
8727631 the presidents reaffirmed their commitment to the principles of respect for historic and cultural traditions of every country and efforts aimed at preserving the unity of a state and its territorial integrity
8727632 placing the emphasis exclusively on the use of force has no prospects and hinders a comprehensive settlement of local conflicts

8727634 irans suggestion is to use the currencies of the sco states in transactions between members of the organization

8727642 i dont think there has ever been more need for education because were living in a society which is far more sexualised than when alex comfort was writing
8727643 at the same time i know people in their thirties who still dont know about the importance of the clitoris
8727644 i think what a lot of the other material out there misses is how powerful sex is people die for it literally one of the ways weve gone wrong in the past is that we havent recognised this emotional power sex isnt a game its not pink and black and fluffy so i think there still is a need for a book that takes sex seriously
8727645 remember this the freedom to choose anything does not inspire creativity it inspires panic boundaries inspire creativity limiataions inspire creativity guildelines inspire creativity boundaries and limitations are fuel for hte fire of the imagination the freedom to choose within those limiatations is air a good fire needs both
8727646 if the nato ships continue to stay in the black sea after the expiration of 21 day period then i would like to remind you that turkey would be responsible
8727647 turkey is our nato ally and as a friend of georgia in my view should have been more supportive of their georgian neighbors and of their american allies
8727648 and this brings back the bad taste of turkey for example barring american troops from going into iraq through turkish ports and turkish territory in 2003 a step that vastly damaged the turkish american relations id hoped we were putting that behind us
8727649 turkey is refusing us naval ships access to georgia via the black sea

8728068 el decreto es solamente para la modalidad de cajas donde se deba pagar cobrar o hacer alg n dep sito por lo tanto esto no rige por ejemplo para el registro de las personas
8728069 se dio un paso trascendental para que la gente no est esperando como vemos en el banco naci n o como vemos en otras entidades financieras que hay largas colas en pleno frio o calor
8728070 esto va a ser de f cil implementaci on el tema es que hay casos emblem ticos como el del banco naci n donde se desborda totalmente la capacidad operativa principalmente en los d as que la gente cobra y las colas dan vuelta la manzana para que esta norma sea efectiva la entidad debe hacer inversi n en nuevas infraestructurasy otros factores operativos
8728071 las internas dejan secuelas si no hay un proceso maduro de participaci n
8728072 deber a finalizar en el 2008 porque sino no vamos a tener tiempo para consolidarnos de cara a las elecciones del a o que viene
8728073 pasaron tantas cosas y van seguir pasando otras tantas en su momento hab amos manifestado que era necesario conversar con todos los sectores y a partir de ah definir cual era el proceso para la normalizaci n del pj en acuerdo concenso o ir a las internas
8728074 lo que siempre se dej translucir desde la intervenci n es que iba a ver un acuerdo a traves de un consenso mi postura es que hay que seguir dialogando y en funci n de eso definir cual es el mejor camino para la normalizaci n con un l mite que los distintos sectores que conforman el pj se consoliden y normalicen por lo menos ese es el esfuerzo que se deberia hacer

8728082 el objetivo del proyecto es posibilitar la comercializaci n de leche en las ferias francas debido a que muchos colonos quieren vender sus excedentes de materia prima pero debido a que esta no est en las condiciones higi nicas adecuadas no lo pueden hacer
8728083 el sistema es discontinuo porque la pasteurizaci n no se hace en una sola etapa como suele hacerse en la industria sino que se debe realizar en tres pasos a n as la leche sale en optimas condiciones para el consumo
8728084 ya hablamos con varios dirigentes de la actividad y la idea es seguir desarrollando el mecanismos para despu s hacerlo extensivo a los colonos que est n interesados
8728085 queremos concientizar a la gente de lo importante de pasteurizar la leche remarcando que no es un proceso qu mico tan solo consiste en calentar y enfriar
8728086 el tratamiento t rmico tradicional de la leche consiste en pasteurizarla y luego envasarla con nuestro sistema primero se envasa la leche y luego se la pasteuriza con lo que tambi n el empaque es sometido al tratamiento t rmico disminuyendo la carga inicial de microorganismos incrementando as la duraci n del producto en refrigeraci n adem s no se eliminan ninguna de las propiedades y nutrientes esenciales

8728093 wgn radio is giving right wing hatchet man stanley kurtz a forum to air his baseless fear mongering terrorist smears
8728094 pushing lies distortions and manipulations about barack and university of illinois professor william ayers
8728095 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse
8728096 it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves at the very least they should offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies
8728097 i would say this is the biggest response weve ever got from a campaign or a candidate
8728098 this is really unprecedented with the show the way that people are flooding the calls and our e mail boxes
8728099 obama supporters risibly complain that shining a light on the obama ayers relationship is a smear and smacks of guilt by association a presidential candidates choice to associate himself with an unrepentant terrorist would be highly relevant in any event does anyone think the obamedia would keep mum if john mccain had a long standing relationship with david duke or an abortion clinic bomber
8728100 the contractors weve been negotiating with have refused to give a serious response to the proposals we have put forth in improving the quality of jobs and security at the airport
8728101 its going to cause some chaos and confusion and its definitely going to be disruptive
8728102 this is the kind of strike thats meant to be a nuisance and exert maximum disruption to everyone involved but its difficult to say what the overall economic impact will be it just depends on how long they strike

8728109 the bottom line is i dont condone the lifestyle and what they were asking me to do in my official capacity as mayor was to issue a proclamation which in essence endorsed the gay lifestyle
8728110 if i had issued such a proclamation i would in essence be saying that gods position is wrong and i wouldnt dare take a position against god so as opposed to suing me they need to be suing god and the last time i checked he can defend himself end of story

8728119 bush daddy has kept pestering me about the issue of living dismemberment probably thinking that this is what it means when psalm 53 5 says that god will scatter the bones of those camping against you bush daddy says this means that the limbs of the designated target will be duct taped and cut off each time the person revives another limb will be cut off and or shortened until he or she succumbs

8728158 her husband was distraught about the divorce and wanting to reconcile but that she was insisting on the divorce
8728159 i will talk to the prime minister about this matter later today with the concrete evidence that she will know these allegations are vile malevolent malicious and wrong
8728160 the serious nature of the probe makes it impossible for him to hold a government role as crucial as minister of foreign affairs
8728161 i have sufficient information that gives me reason to suspect that an investigation may reveal serious and complex fraud
8728162 the allegations concern important matters relating to the funding of a political party which go to the heart of the democratic process and involve a minister in the government

8728169 and when i read that i thought to myself shawn ryan will never get this ending on the air
8728170 i think one thing that helped me was frankly my ignorance
8728171 i had not done a lot of tv producing at that point i had written for a couple of shows angel nash bridges but i wasnt involved in a lot of production decisions i didnt have any kind of preconceived notions about how these things were supposed to be done
8728172 we didnt want the show to be 85 percent of a network show even though we had 85 percent of the budget
8728173 a lot of other shows have a tendency to try to glamorize the characters
8728174 working on this show they like it if you have circles under your eyes
8728175 it wasnt solely because of the creative success of the shield and fxs nip tuck but a lot of it was the economic success of the shield it inspired people to get into this original series business because we were making the show for a price that made sense
8728176 but thats the nature of tv and film its not the same as copying a test in school
8728177 i cant say i was lying in the weeds waiting to change television i just took the circumstances i was in and did the best i could with them and i think other people in my same position would have found similar ways to do things i do like the fact that we were sort of the first to do it
8728178 he and i had both been on police ride alongs him as research for being an actor on homicide me when i was a writer on nash bridges
8728179 i just said to clark i just want the viewer to feel like theyre on a police ride along and thats what he brought to it
8728180 we were able to make the pilot in such a go for it style that we eventually won the day i think on execution i think our director out directed their director i think we out cast their show they had jason priestly playing a drug addict and that seemed like a casting coup at the time because nobody wanted to put themselves in an fx show
8728181 some roles are exhausting physically some are exhausting mentally some are really devastating psychologically vic is all of that
8728182 you ever take a face cloth and soak it and wring it out thats me at the end of the day im a wrung out washcloth an overcooked noodle
8728183 an inordinate amount of focus is required to do our work on this job and its not just the words its not just the density and the complexities of the story its the traffic its the noises on the street
8728184 really it harkens back to that jack nicholson speech in a few good men
8728185 he is the embodiment of that argument i am the man on the wall you people who sit in your suburban households can look at what i do from a distance and go
8728186 one thing i learned from joss whedon that i blatantly stole was the idea of approaching the stories first from character
8728187 the cop stories were always the last thing wed figure out on a shield episode
8728188 you just start from the premise of what do you want to happen to vic and shane this week what do you want to happen to fellow cops dutch and claudette or danny and julien or vics ex wife corrine what hoops do you want them to jump through and then you figure out what are the best stories that allow you to do that

8728200 it is a chance for me to get some games and i think that is something i definitely have to do at this stage of my career
8728201 with the new players who have come to rangers my chances will probably be a bit more limited and this is the best option for me to pursue just now
8728202 my main aim in the long term is still to play at ibrox
8728203 that hasnt changed and if this is what i need to do to take the next step im happy to do that

8728207 one is a very serious bid and that has been accompanied by interest in the same player by two other football clubs something might happen
8728208 we are trying to improve and the players know we are trying to improve their situation
8728209 we are working quite hard behind the scenes to get players in but you can only do your own bit as highlighted by the man united tottenham berbatov scenario
8728210 you can only do as much as you can then you need someone to say yes
8728211 we have got bids on the table for a number of players and if players become available at the other end hopefully they will become hull city players eventually
8728212 they will be very very pleased that they dont have to travel far
8728213 i think they will be delighted that theyve not got a lot of travelling to do
8728214 villarreal will not bring up any surprises for them aalborg is the team they will have to be careful of and they will come back to bite you if you disrespect them
8728215 against villarreal i know its a very tough game but people will be looking at the aalborg game and be thinking theres six points for you but i can guarantee that will not be the case for any of the teams facing aalborg
8728216 it will not be an easy six points to pick up so they will be very pleased they dont have to travel but it could have been a lot tougher but how can you say that when youre playing against manchester united and villarreal
8728217 well celtic have already beaten them and they were very unlucky in the first game as well when they played down in manchester the first time they met
8728218 it will be like a home game for them and they will have a big support and manchester united are everybodys favourite not just for the group but probably for the tournament again and rightly so
8728219 someones going to die and its going to be real sad when thats a family then whats going to happen theyre going to start handing out tickets
8728220 everybody is in danger because of this when they pull out not enough room is left into the lane
8728221 we are trying to improve the situation there because we are aware of the problem
8728222 the true answer is going to be when theres a tragedy there because of these trucks pulling out thats when the answer is going to come and action is going to be taken
8728223 this cat showed up one day just showed up and we fed it and it stuck around

8728247 back here theres a set screw area where its threaded where you can actually drop in any kind of a bolt and secure it
8728248 basically you would drill through the cabinets and put a locking nut or locking washer on the other end
8728249 i guess it would be smoking pot or the alcohol one
8728250 smoking pot and drinking beer just because they dont know how to control it at that age
8728251 i think they have prepared themselves to some extent that their 17 year old is probably going to experiment with those other things and they did too
8728252 and that is a more familiar risk to them these video games we still dont know what the risks are
8728253 ive played the game its not a good game to play just period
8728254 friday morning the phone started ringing with constituents telling me they didnt want the 12 year two billion dollar plan
8728255 some of them i sat down with and explained the 12 year plan where it was actually cheaper in the long run to do that but they just werent buying that

8728295 when i work in those places i come in with a lot of publicity and everybody is very aware of who i am
8728296 in orange county i could have been wearing a mask nobody cared who i was they only cared about the music people in orange county go out to have fun and dance thats it its a real nice vibe down there
8728297 a lot of club djs are just showing off but not samantha she lets the music speak for itself although she puts a lot of her own personality into it
8728298 the judge just looked at the paper and said 115 hand your license to the bailiff

8728301 its cheaper than gas these days and i can bring my laptop and work the entire time and avoid sitting in traffic and stressing myself out
8728302 we were doing the shows but we werent changing anything
8728303 we wanted it to be a day where people could stop and think about the earth but it was almost met with this attitude like who cares it didnt force anyone to make any changes in their life routines
8728304 there will definitely be a lot of people there just to see the show
8728305 but as long as they are aware of why these bands are doing this if they just think about it for that one day then i think it will be a good thing
8728306 but its about stopping from time to time and actually making an effort it doesnt have to be about totally going green but making some small changes first
8728307 if 10 people out of the expected 5 000 to 7 000 at this festival actually start taking the train because of this then it was worth it
8728308 for me it took losing my license before i actually got it that i could actually use public transportation it took something that drastic to get me out of my car and into this

8728316 desde el espacio nos est n llegando todo el tiempo protones que se conocen como rayos c smicos hemos estado siendo bombardeando por rayos c smicos y son los mismos protones que se acelerar n en cern y estos han estado chocando desde que la tierra se form si se producen agujeros negros debi pasarnos algo desde entonces y como no ha pasado nada quiere decir que stos efectivamente se evaporan

8728322 creemos que existe la masa por la presencia de una simple part cula que se llama part cula de higgs y si se encuentra queremos estudiar sus propiedades y explicar por qu tenemos masa
8728323 la mayor parte del tiempo haremos colisionar protones pero tambi n un mes al a o haremos colisionar n cleos de tomos m s pesados y el choque producir una concentraci n muy alta de part culas subat micas que esperemos que formen una sopa de quarks y gluones ingredientes primordiales de la materia y ese estado de la materia que t cnicamente se llama plasma de quarks y gluones que es lo que ocurri en las mil simas de segundos despu s del big bang

8728360 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8728361 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8728362 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8728363 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8728364 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8728445 this is a momentous decision compelling the british government to release information that can prove mr mohameds innocence is one obvious step towards making up for the years of torture that he has suffered the next step is for the british government to demand an end to the charade against him in guant namo bay and return him home to britain
8728446 it is a long standing principle of the common law that confessions obtained by torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment cannot be used as evidence in any trial
8728447 hugely dependent in a number of areas on us intelligence
8728448 any disclosure however limited would seriously undermine this principle to the point that future cooperation between the uk and its most valuable intelligence partner the us would be severely jeopardised
8728449 it was accepted on behalf of the foreign secretary that bm binyam mohamed had established an arguable case i that over the period april 2002 to may 2004 he was first held by the united states incommunicado and without access to a lawyer or a court or tribunal in pakistan and then detained there or elsewhere by the united states until his arrival in guant namo bay in september 2004 ii that he was subject to cruel inhuman and degrading treatment by or on behalf of the united states during such detention and iii that he was subject to torture during such detention by or on behalf of the united states
8728450 the relationship between the united kingdom government and the united states authorities was far beyond that of a bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing
8728451 that on the basis that what was done was arguably wrongdoing the sys security service facilitated it in the manner and to the extent described
8728452 conduct of the security service facilitated interviews by or on behalf of the united states when bm was being detained by the united states incommunicado and without access to a lawyer in pakistan in the period april 2002 until at least may 2002 the court also concluded that the security service continued to facilitate the interviewing of bm by providing information and questions after 17 may 2002 in the knowledge of what was reported to them as to the circumstances of his detention and treatment in pakistan
8728453 uk is under no obligation under international law to assist foreign courts and tribunals in assuring that torture evidence is not admitted
8728454 if it is correct that in the course of an interrogation in which material supplied by the defendant the british government was employed the claimant binyam mohamed was tortured then it is arguable that there is an obligation to disclose material which may assist claimant in establishing before the american military court that he was tortured whether the court should exercise its discretion not to order disclosure can only be determined at a full hearing
8728455 could be considered exculpatory or might otherwise be relevant in the context of proceedings before the military commissions
8728456 the united kingdom armed forces are trained in the laws of armed conflict set out in the geneva conventions the joint services intelligence organisations training documentation states that the following techniques are expressly and explicitly forbidden a physical punishment of any sort b the use of stress positions c intentional sleep deprivations d withdrawal of food water or medical treatment and three other specified techniques
8728457 must have appreciated that it rendition was contrary to the rule of law
8728458 however they are described are entitled to the same levels of protection
8728459 hooding withholding of blankets and sleep deprivation of a detainee in afghanistan
8728460 a united states official had referred to getting a detainee ready which appeared to involve sleep deprivation hooding and the use of stress positions
8728461 with regard to the status of the prisoners under the various geneva conventions and protocols all prisoners however they are described are entitled to the same levels of protection you have commented on their treatment it appears from your description that they may not be being treated in accordance with the appropriate standards given that they are not within our custody or control the law does not require you to intervene to prevent this that said hmgs her majestys government stated commitment to human rights makes it important that the americans understand that we cannot be party to such ill treatment nor can we be seen to condone it
8728462 silver needed to embrace and advance a broader agenda of reform issues that included a nonpartisan redistricting commission greater transparency in and public scrutiny of the decisions that are made by the assembly and strengthening state legislative ethics rules in the areas of financial disclosure and conflicts of interest
8728463 one of his challengers was a compelling candidate paul newell who had a good grasp of the issues but had not been able to demonstrate that he had broad community support for his election
8728464 este espacio es para todos los argentinos y desde donde podemos sacar la fuerza la energ a necesaria y la experiencia para seguir avanzando en lo que m s nos gusta a los peronistas hacernos cargos de los problemas y resolverlos
8728465 mejor que decir es hacer este acto es una muestra de las soluciones y los cambios en los que venimos avanzando lo importante son los hechos y hoy la quinta se reabre en paz y sin conflictos
8728466 esta gran infraestructura social institucional y cultural est abierta la mayor cantidad de d as posibles para acercarnos a los valores fundacionales de nuestro movimiento y seguir avanzando

8728468 cuidar lo que hemos hecho a lo largo de estos a os y trabajar por construir lo que falta
8728469 and a lot of those folks go back with me to 2000 when i was the dnc chair we discussed ways to legally help the pennsylvania and ohio democratic parties to strengthen the parties which will strengthen their abilities to get what is called a coordinated campaign going to do things like registration and turnout to direct money to the parties to do that which helps us in our state reps race it helps us in our state senate race and helps us in our congressional race and it also helps us in presidentials
8728470 that money cannot be used by candidates it cannot be used by candidates it cannot be used for television it has to be used for what are called party building activities but party building activities help the guy running for state rep they also help the guy running for president
8728471 of course our state laws in pennsylvania and ohio are much more liberal than federal laws with less limitations
8728472 these are friends that governor rendell and i have had over the years and obviously are interested in ohio
8728473 it was an effort to communicate what we think we must do in ohio and pennsylvania to have a chance of winning
8728474 it would look as if we are ahead now and we have a lot of tools going forth
8728475 there was a lot of emphasis today on the amount of organization on the ground
8728476 republicans cant win the election without ohio and were focusing on that
8728477 there is a lot of confidence being expressed now by both the governors and the people doing the fund raising this is the time that everyone wants to go out and do it there are joint state parties that are non federal and the governors are making that point there are issues here that can be made available vehicles for people who are maxed out but we shouldnt think of being only donors there are a lot of people in this country who are not maxed out and organizing them is extremely important and im focused on that
8728478 even if i went out one night a week with all of the internet outlets for photographers it looks as though youve been out 50 times
8728479 the whole phenomenon was a diversion from how unsettled people felt after september 11 but finally were coming off out of it if the economy continues to slip dont you think the adoration of daisy buchanan types will fall with it they will be resented replaced by something grittier and more real
8728480 chief it does have those things on the fayetteville st side
8728481 would you tell me please which way i ought to go from here
8728482 that depends a good deal on where you want to get to
8728483 a man neednt go far to find a subject if hes ready with his salt box
8728484 however c d c and state health departments are continuing to conduct surveillance for cases of infection with the outbreak strain
8728485 possibly were a vehicle for infection particularly early in the outbreak
8728486 these findings indicate that additional measures are needed to enhance food safety and reduce illnesses from produce that is consumed raw
8728487 we need to develop technologies which will enable us to detect pathogens in fresh produce more quickly
8728488 the point is that not all industry is doing it and there need to be standards
8728489 its certainly been a difficult year but buying out a partner is never an easy thing
8728490 we have to work together again as we did two years ago or the joint venture will have to find its own solution
8728491 and youll get the results in plenty of time to improve the soil before the next growing season
8728492 i talked to her and she nodded over and over and over again she wanted to leave
8728493 no athlete would like to have a life with only their eyes talking
8728494 that first year five young kestrels fledged from the boxes
8728495 i dont think theres a more ecological way to fertilize plants
8728496 garbage is a commodity people pay to get rid of we take that garbage in as a resource process it into a product and sell it
8728497 gardeners have been doing this for years its a natural way to fertilize and makes for really healthy plants
8728498 its so organic i dont have to worry about overfertilizing
8728499 i use it on my garden a couple of times a month and my plants look great
8728500 we want to educate people and spawn a new eco conscious way of thinking
8728501 ever since that first day when i learned of composting using worms i knew i wanted to offer eco friendly alternatives to gardeners
8728502 serious gardeners love the earth and want to protect it and we want to do everything we can to support them
8728503 conservation is going to become a part of our future drought or no drought
8728504 a lot of people are worried that you cant wash your car
8728505 you can but try not to let your water hit the storm drain
8728506 we want to make it easy and reasonable for people to comply with this
8728507 i dont see us having a hard time with this at all
8728508 the citys always proactive and they always give us plenty of lead time to get behind things
8728509 blogher spoke with bloghim chris rabb publisher of afro netizen and husband of dr imani perry about gender and politics chris shared his thoughts on the importance of re thinking gender definitions especially for progressives and feminists of any gender he also speaks of the importance of men speaking out against the sexism that was directed towards hillary clinton in the campaign as well as how meaningful it is as a father to see barack obamas family
8728510 buried in susan faludis new york times sprawling op ed regarding the anger many women are expressing that hillary clinton did not win the democratic nomination how women are covered in the press and the history of the white suffragette movement there is a crucial paragraph with vital facts about our current political state faludi notes today the united states ranks 22nd among the 30 developed nations in its proportion of female federal lawmakers the proportion of female state legislators has been stuck in the low 20 percent range for 15 years womens share of state elective executive offices has fallen consistently since 2000 and is now under 25 percent the american political pipeline is 86 percent male
8728511 they set the stage they primed the audience of the faithful to use a sports metaphor they have teed it up as nicely as they can for barack obama when he speaks this evening before 70 000 people in denver the clintons have made their speeches and stepped out of the convention spotlight so now its up to him tonight is the night that barack obama is really going to have to hit it out of invesco field because even as motivating as the democratic convention has seemed the republicans are up next and theyll take whatever opportunities they can to knock him back down
8728512 barack obama is not my messiah hes human with human faults and foibles but hes the first presidential candidate in a very long time who has given me hope in a time when we certainly need it
8728513 maybe like me this day both in 1963 and 2008 has overwhelming significance for you or maybe youre reading this and thinking that you dont plan to vote for senator obama maybe you dont really know much about dr king or maybe you arent old enough to have lived through the fight for civil rights and maybe you havent experienced racial discrimination well thats ok because if you have 12 minutes to watch this video of dr kings speech youll get a sense of why as americans were all living history today
8728514 my babies are both in school no more babies at home
8728515 please describe what net neutrality is and your position on the issue
8728516 it does make you wonder this blog culture that grew up outside of the traditional media are we starting to step up to the stage and be with them as equals
8728517 the walls started moving then the bang everything started coming down everyone started screaming
8728518 just shows us where we need to direct our disaster preparedness effort
8728519 the findings in this report will aid public health and emergency preparedness efforts and may help reduce the mortality burden in future natural disasters
8728520 statements contained in this press release concerning numerex that are not historical fact are
8728521 we are very pleased to receive this sizeable follow on solar order in the rapidly growing asia pacific region which further demonstrates the increasing acceptance we are seeing for our solar products from our worldwide base of solar customers we continue to be optimistic about the strength of our marketing pipeline and opportunities to grow our solar business into fiscal 2009
8728522 it has been a long journey to where we stand today we look forward to a long and industrious relationship between rec and the people of quebec
8728523 we want to show people heres technology you have but dont use all danes know what a wind turbine is but in the u s wind is just 1 of the total and the turbines are in select areas
8728524 consumers arent going to run out and buy wind turbines but they do influence government and politicians if politicians feel that constituents support alternative energies like this theyre more likely to support legislation that allows these technologies to grow more quickly
8728525 being in the hearts and minds of the public can make a big difference if youre in a political fight
8728526 we all understand theres a need for renewable energy and wind is one of them but we dont know yet which companies will fulfill that need its still early enough in the game where a company can gain some of that leadership in the sense of influence over regulation and better visibility when theyre selling in this space
8728527 protecting the polar bears is something we are committed to but we going to base it on science and with input and collaboration with inuit and northern people

8728531 cylex is honored to be working with prof antonio daniele pinna md and his colleagues at the university of bologna and other centers in exploring the potential value of immuknow in monitoring the cell mediated immunity of patients following liver transplantation
8728532 professor pinna is a renowned authority in this field and we look forward to supporting his team as necessary through the course of this trial
8728533 evolving data strongly suggest the value of cylexs cell mediated immune function assay in monitoring patients undergoing liver transplantation
8728534 our intent is to investigate whether these data can be replicated in an italian clinical trial population thereby confirming the potential of the immuknow assay as a standard monitoring technology for long term follow up of liver transplant patients
8728535 ive changed my tune i used to think four was ok
8728536 a lot of veterans have used the time to get into shape players dont do that anymore were killing them in the offseason so you dont need as many preseason games you really dont
8728537 every play ive got to play like its my last play ever in the nfl
8728538 im trying to make it no doubt that i belong here
8728539 i just dont see the value of putting these guys out there and losing one of these guys
8728540 well that appears to be the way theyre going to go
8728541 yeah that looks good but youre going to deal with more injuries during the regular season
8728542 not that i know a lot about it but imagine the critics that come out when youre playing game 17 or game 18 and all of a sudden your start player gets hurt and isnt there for the playoffs
8728543 there are a lot of pros and cons to everything when you look at it
8728544 cylex inc in association with our korean distributor sun woo biotech is delighted to be able to announce our support for a major multi center trial of the immuknow assay for cell mediated immunity at seven highly respected medical institutions in the republic of korea
8728545 it is a critical goal for the company to be able to demonstrate the effectiveness of the immuknow assay in transplant populations of different ethnicities by working with specialized institutions around the world
8728546 the working hypothesis of the current trial is that the investigators will observe similar results in a korean population
8728547 if this is the case we will have a valuable mechanism to identify korean patients at risk of infection or rejection of their transplant within 3 years of transplantation
8728548 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
8728549 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8728550 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8728551 hopefully this serves as a constructive wake up call not only for tribal communities but for the national government and state governments as well
8728552 why is it that the average federal prisoner gets twice as much in health care dollars than native american people do
8728553 the good news is that there are lots of effective interventions to reduce alcohol misuse things like raising alcohol taxes reducing hours of sale and enforcing widely ignored laws preventing sale of alcohol to intoxicated persons
8728554 over the past three years in touch has been building its data collection solutions for the marketing sales and operations departments of business to consumer companies the nci acquisition validates our investment in a scalable technology platform which allows us to easily add the nci customers and revenue and eliminate over 60 of their operational costs nci customers will have immediate access to the broader range of products and services offered by in touch
8728555 we expect to close this transaction by mid september pending board and regulatory approvals the nci purchase should increase annual in touch revenues by at least 1 250 000 based on its trailing performance however our goal is to grow these revenues by an additional 30 in touch also plans to continue to use its technology advantage to grow further through consolidation

8728560 wuxis proximity to shanghai offers an advantage for achievos japanese customers as shanghai is an important hub for japanese business interests in china
8728561 achievos japan business group already enjoys a significant operation in shanghai furthermore establishing operations beyond chinas large urban centers such as shenzhen beijing and shanghai is an important part of our overall business strategy and a key differentiator between achievo and its indian counterparts the large indian based it companies are limited to specific regions that offer the necessary urban infrastructure china by contrast has many urban as well as suburban centers with infrastructures already in place we believe establishing r amp d centers in these cities shields us from the rapid inflation seen in larger metropolitan centers and allows achievo to offer additional value to our customers as a result
8728562 wuxi is a beautiful city and its importance to chinas high technology industry is growing especially for our japanese customers
8728563 our hope is that establishing operations in the yangtze river delta will further ensure our ability to attract hire and retain the best engineering talent available to deliver products and services with the highest possible quality while simultaneously giving achievo customers expanded regional choices
8728564 as a result of disappointing sales so far this year the board of directors has requested that lou assume the full time task of coordinating cdcs marketing and sales effort this arrangement will allow lou to do what he does best and concentrate 100 of his energy and efforts on marketing and sales as well as relieve him of the responsibility of day to day operations i believe this realignment is in the best interest of our public company shareholders we all look forward to a more robust marketing and sales effort
8728565 while the system has been extremely effective in combating this trend we quickly discovered that the value of the pips solution went far beyond stolen vehicle recovery
8728566 almost 7 5 million plates have been checked since we adopted the system in addition to recovering over 1 000 stolen vehicles and making almost 200 arrests the system has helped us to improve the parking situation within the city by enabling us to better enforce the rules people are less likely to break the law when they know they will get caught in the past twelve months we have begun using the system to enforce our parking regulations downtown over 700 vehicles with almost 350 000 in outstanding parking citations have been identified and towed using the pips solution this revenue helps us to justify purchase of additional equipment to improve the safety of our city
8728567 the pips solution from federal signal has been a great investment for long beach in many ways it has proven itself time and again and the pips team has been very responsive to our needs and receptive to our ideas as they continue to innovate their product were very pleased with our decision and would strongly recommend the technology to other agencies
8728568 leading law enforcement agencies like the long beach police department continue to turn to pips first for proven alpr solutions
8728569 the versatility of alpr technology helps enable world class public safety agencies such as long beach to enhance the protection that they provide to their communities and citizens every day
8728570 we can relax now but please be cautious they might return soon
8728571 we are staging a protest because the government has made too many mistakes and has no legitimacy to run the country
8728572 from now on it will be stickier our political rallying will get stronger because more of our supporters from upcountry will come to help us we will not back down
8728573 we can withstand any difficult conditions if we can topple samak
8728574 if you leave the government house that means we have been defeated
8728575 they want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and do the coup again
8728576 i am informing you that i gave away the precious thing that i have in which it became very cheap which is my own self to lift up the oppression that is upon us through the american government

8728579 the xcel center is one of the top hockey facilities in north america
8728580 the ncaa made a terrific choice for the fans and the teams that will be playing in the tournament you want to have an ncaa regional in a first class facility and the xcel will do a fantastic job hosting the event
8728581 looking at the nhl college hockey has adoped some nhl rules
8728582 and shootouts specifically have been a hot topic of discussion since the ncaa has allowed leagues to try it we figured we would go ahead and do it and set the standard
8728583 as of right now its a one year trial period
8728584 but throught the week of practice we will put more emphasis on it now
8728585 obviously teams with real strong goalies and teams with some creative shooters
8728586 it will not matter if a team is in first or last place once you get to a shootout it is one shooter and a goalie
8728587 there had not been any trash talking yet about the game but i am sure there will be some
8728588 id actually make the point that for us second hand sales is a very critical situation because people are selling multiple times intellectual property
8728589 gsk is looking forward to working with valeant to provide important medicines like retigabine to the medical community and to the patients we serve
8728590 there is a significant need for novel anti epileptic drugs as almost one third of patients with epilepsy continue to experience seizures despite treatment with currently available medications we believe that retigabine could potentially play a significant role in improving the management of epilepsy and is a welcome addition to gsks portfolio
8728591 we were pleased with the significant interest shown in retigabine and we have selected gsk as a collaborator because we believe they are ideally suited and strongly committed to the continued development of this important compound
8728592 gsks development expertise and strong commercial infrastructure will be critical to maximising the worldwide potential of retigabine we believe this collaboration will strengthen our ability to bring this medicine to patients suffering from epilepsy and a variety of other conditions
8728593 patent expiries are challenging times however following the recent approval of cimzia for crohns disease in the u s and the positive opinions for neupro for rls and vimpat for epilepsy in europe the time is now to take action to shape ucb for the future and become a specialist company focused on successfully delivering our new medicines to patients earlier this month we announced the shape project which aims to re allocate eur 300 million within the next three years towards increased investments into ucbs core cns and immunology business areas while also seeking to improve ucbs competitiveness
8728594 we will help our employees to go through the changes ahead of us our priority will be to look for solutions that lead to a new future we aim to achieve this through an open and constructive dialogue with our social partners around the globe
8728595 i have to find a way to meet younger kids my age and i am going to school too
8728596 ive been low key talking to people i always talk to
8728597 but to tell you the truth ive been hurting a little bit personally it hurts to lose but im doing all right
8728598 the foreign exchange market continues to track the oil market closely
8728599 crude price gains were the main influence on price action in the new york morning with the move above 120 00 a barrel driving activity
8728600 the downside of the robust german labor market is that it might add to the ecbs fears over a possible sharp pick up in wages growth
8728601 i used to teach hairdressers how to walk away from a cut that was going bad this guy shouldve walked away
8728602 hello to celebrate the end of a brilliant tour were going to webcast the last show here in america well be playing live in santa barbara at the bowl its one of our favorite places to play i think weve ended tours there before once even playing a cover of cinnamon girl its not too big in fact its very intimate a small arena with a dirt floor set in pretty countryside it should be a special night for lots of reasons and were going to try and share as much of it as we can on the webcast nigel our producer will be helping out getting it to you so if it goes wrong its live
8728603 the actions outlined today position us to focus on the strategic alternatives process that we initiated several months ago as well as preserve our cash resources
8728604 the process we are conducting involves a number of alternatives including merger or acquisition of the company together with the possible sale of our c difficile and dna replication inhibition programs while the process is ongoing we are encouraged by our progress to date

8728610 there is the u s labor day holiday on monday and the market will be shut theres a lot of nervousness

8728613 were making progress we have a variety of guys stepping up
8728614 samanis been preparing himself for his senior season all along
8728615 hes focused and shifty for a player whos 6 foot 185 pounds
8728616 were trying to teach manu to avoid contact hell be able to hold up hes a tough kid
8728617 i think im going to be a leader on the team not just on the court but off the court
8728618 ill have to be there and be smart it will be a lot of pressure for sure but im pretty good with pressure
8728619 we went to an orphanage and gave a clinic and taught them how to play volleyball it just made me feel how much stuff we have here
8728620 it got me thinking that i probably didnt give my all last year and i need to push and be positive
8728621 shes just a total all around player shes one of our primary passers
8728622 she can pound the ball but shes also smart shes more of an all around hitter she can change the speed if she needs to
8728623 i dont think im totally stacked but i have really good players working hard every day
8728624 we have a couple of big positions to fill but weve got some players that can step up and do the job and theres never a position that cant be filled with someone else we have good kids to pick from
8728625 our offseason along with our experience helped us they didnt get themselved down when they were down by a couple scores and i think thats maturity from a lot of these guys playing last year as underclassmen and they were able to draw from that experience keep their heads up and come back
8728626 i signed up to defend our nation if we went to state i would be thrilled in the long run i need to concentrate on that but as of right now im focused on football and getting our team into state
8728627 the further we go on in the season the better well get we just need to tweak a few things here and there and execute we have the kids that can do it but its about getting them in the right place at the right time it just comes down to the timing
8728628 i was really happy with how the first week went we didnt have many mental mistakes
8728629 this is the best way to get out of the gate since ive been here as far as pure execution on both sides of the ball
8728630 number one we have to take care of the football
8728631 physically we got after it we just made crucial mistakes
8728632 but were not about to press the panic button its just back to work
8728633 those two kids thought of themselves and not the team
8728634 theyll get back in the lineup if they deserve it but for now they are in the doghouse with me
8728635 alta is one of the best teams in the state
8728636 each party negotiating this has their own views about their own standards being better
8728637 but as long as we can show were not lowering safety and were lowering cost were all interested in that
8728638 it may involve changes to the structure it may involve changes to material but they result in not so many differences in the safety levels of the vehicles
8728639 the bumper to absorb energy to reduce the risk of injury is not the kind of bumper system you would design to help protect the vehicle
8728640 the data that we have really drives the direction and the nature of the standards we develop
8728641 we would much prefer to design a vehicle that provides good protection for unbelted occupants but is tuned specifically to protect occupants that are doing what theyre supposed to be doing
8728642 its very difficult for governments that have had a specific regulation on their books for many years to suddenly decide to change
8728643 we think its very important to have a single set of requirements that can be enacted globally
8728644 zachs very athletic on offense and will be a match up problem for other peoples secondary
8728645 but he also brings help to our defense hell be a physical presence in our secondary tough
8728646 i caught a ball in the end zone from young but the referees said i trapped it then parkinson had a 98 yard kickoff return touchdown called back because of a penalty it was ridiculous
8728647 we need to stop with the mental mistakes and just remember our rules
8728648 i thing for the first game of the season kolton handled the adversity well
8728649 the 2 percent increase in total u s store sales was also more than entirely due to higher spending by customers from other countries
8728650 sales to new yorkers were below last year which should not be too surprising to anyone
8728651 even though the u s was weaker than expected i think a lot of investors thought that could happen
8728652 we have grown our canadian store base where we are achieving much higher returns on capital and the economy is much healthier than we currently find in the u s
8728653 we worked out our problems and thats the important thing we ended on a positive note
8728654 passing definitely needs work we have the hitters so we need to get them the ball
8728655 we had a good result and we had a not so good result
8728656 i am confident we can play better we need to be more organized defensively especially against more physical teams
8728657 we are playing well early and im trying new things
8728658 evans was out there giving orders and directing traffic she did a great job
8728659 i dont really pay attention to what newspapers say about me
8728660 its hard for sophomores to come in and fit in with the older guys
8728661 hes getting there though our chemistry is getting better not to fast but not to slow he actually reminds me of last years quarterback r j tialavea
8728662 he taught us to start believing in ourselves when things werent going good in the past not to give up i thank him for that
8728663 the objective reality is that apple does plenty of wrong
8728664 very few companies have this kind of iconic status where anything they do even if it is mediocre will automatically have a halo around it
8728665 there was no going back at that point but after i sold it i quickly started to regret it
8728666 theyre skimping on materials on testing things to gain market share but theyre kind of pushing away people who have been with the brand even when it was struggling
8728667 a lot better than the alternative in terms of stability viruses being able to do high end graphics work
8728668 i wouldnt tell people to stop getting apple products they make very good products
8728669 sometimes you feel like youre in line with the soup nazi
8728670 its a really good deal to be part of the apple thing and you dont want to say anything to rock the boat no soup for you your apps are gone
8728671 the transgression has to be so egregious for someone to completely change the narrative
8728672 if something like this had happened to microsoft the long term impact would be much more for microsoft than for apple
8728673 we dont have the drama weve had in the past
8728674 the cliques are gone and weve been working really well as a team
8728675 we need a good show before we head to 5a
8728676 we want to place at least as well as we did last year
8728677 we dont focus on the winning we focus on the effort
8728678 im a little frustrated because we are known for scoring and finishing and weve struggled a bit
8728679 soccer is a game where you can get a little unlucky fortunately for us weve been lucky enough to find enough goals to win
8728680 we are a very hard working team i like to call us blue collar
8728681 we sweat we work we condition every day im very proud
8728682 last years team god bless them they were overachievers but they set the standard
8728683 it was a season long effort by the entire team
8728684 we were doing what we had to do to win in the postseason despite our troubles in the regular season the girls have done a good job at keeping the same attitude this year

8728688 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8728689 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8728690 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8728691 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8728692 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8728693 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8728694 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8728695 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8728696 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8728697 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8728698 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8728699 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8728700 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8728701 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8728702 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8728703 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8728704 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8728705 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8728706 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8728707 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8728708 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8728709 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8728710 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8728711 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8728712 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8728713 that will never wear out programs may sometimes become obsolete but the ideal of fairness always endures circumstances may change but the work of compassion must continue
8728714 for all those whose cares have been our concern the work goes on the cause endures the hope still lives and the dream shall never die
8728715 i will always remember the single mom who had adopted two kids with autism she didnt have any health insurance and she discovered that she had cancer but she greeted me with her bald head painted with my name on it and asked me to fight for health care for her and her children
8728716 i will always remember the young man in a marine corps t shirt who waited months for medical care and he said to me take care of my buddies a lot of them are still over there and then will you please take care of me
8728717 and i will always remember the young boy who told me his mom worked for the minimum wage that her employer had cut her hours he said he just didnt know what his family was going to do
8728718 were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that young boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8728719 john kerry believes in america and he knows that its not enough for just some of us to prosper for alongside our famous individualism theres another ingredient in the american saga a belief that were all connected as one people if there is a child on the south side of chicago who cant read that matters to me even if its not my child if there is a senior citizen somewhere who cant pay for their prescription drugs and having to choose between medicine and the rent that makes my life poorer even if its not my grandparent if theres an arab american family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process that threatens my civil liberties
8728720 never ask an american family to sacrifice for another american family
8728721 the 1980 republican convention was awash with crocodile tears for our economic distress
8728722 the same republicans who are talking about the crisis of unemployment have nominated a man who once said and i quote unemployment insurance is a prepaid vacation plan for freeloaders and that nominee is no friend of labor
8728723 the same republicans who are talking about the problems of the inner cities have nominated a man who said and i quote i have included in my morning and evening prayers every day the prayer that the federal government not bail out new york
8728724 the same republicans who are talking about security for the elderly have nominated a man who said just four years ago that participation in social security should be made voluntary and that nominee is no friend of the senior citizens of this nation
8728725 the same republicans who are talking about preserving the environment have nominated a man who last year made the preposterous statement and i quote eighty percent of our air pollution comes from plants and trees and that nominee is no friend of the environment
8728726 have nominated a man who said in 1976 and these are his exact words fascism was really the basis of the new deal
8728727 the great adventures which our opponents offer is a voyage into the past
8728728 progress is our heritage not theirs what is right for us as democrats is also the right way for democrats to win
8728729 it is surely correct that we cannot solve problems by throwing money at them but it is also correct that we dare not throw out our national problems onto a scrap heap of inattention and indifference
8728730 the poor may be out of political fashion but they are not without human needs the middle class may be angry but they have not lost the dream that all americans can advance together
8728731 as democrats we recognize that each generation of americans has a rendezvous with a different reality
8728732 the answers of one generation become the questions of the next generation but there is a guiding star in the american firmament it is as old as the revolutionary belief that all people are created equal and as clear as the contemporary condition of liberty city and the south bronx
8728733 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8728734 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8728735 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8728736 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8728737 hes going to be confused and not want to talk to me hes going to freak out
8728738 bitch this isnt dc people arent all douchey and uptight he clearly wants to talk to you just go give him the goddamn butt paste
8728739 i saw you from across the bar and well i have this present that i think you should have
8728740 so i have this gift here for you and i dont want you to freak out but im guessing you might not understand why im giving this to you i mean its weird but funny and you wont expect it thats for sure and no ones probably given you this before but its funny its supposed to be funny and i think you would think its funny maybe it might be the best gift ever its funny
8728741 youre not going to tell him you have a penis are you
8728742 no which is kind of unfortunate considering the gift build up i just did that would be much funnier
8728743 butt paste does that say butt paste did you just give me butt paste
8728744 we are pushing this material to uk media channels e g a bbc radio programme exposing tensions between aq al qaeda leadership and supporters
8728745 and a restricted working group will communicate niche messages through media and non media
8728746 we are not claiming victory over aq we are stressing their declining support
8728747 i have no idea who the source is for this story but its absolute nonsense while i cant comment on this specific player since hes under contract to atlanta red bull and the league work absolutely in lockstep on player negotiations and the league has not blocked any move for anyone by the red bulls its difficult to respond to blog entries where unknown sources are referenced and of course blogs are driven by hits not necessarily by the same standards as print media
8728748 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8728749 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8728750 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8728751 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8728752 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8728753 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8728754 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8728755 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8728756 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8728757 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8728758 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8728759 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
8728760 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
8728761 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
8728762 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
8728763 joe garcia is going to beat mario diaz balart and annette taddeo is going to beat ileana ros lehtinen
8728764 s lla er till hillary chelsea och mig f r att se till att barack obama blir n ste president
8728765 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8728766 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8728767 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8728768 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

8728784 were just a very young team but we just need to continue on its been close the last two region games we just need to keep working
8728785 we have the toughest region out of anybody every single team in our region can beat any team in region 3 even taylorsville our lowest can do that
8728786 it may be a function of social perceptions of alcohol in that particular region
8728787 it has had a very negative impact on our day to day life

8728792 esa musica refleja el sentimiento aut ctono de la letra
8728793 la musica de ra z esta presente por momentos y es importante pero la combinamos con otros estilos
8728794 tuvimos que dise ar un formato nuevo para poder interpretar fielmente las canciones del cd cada m sico tiene su plan de vuelo y es una pieza del rompecabezas que al unirse forma la imagen
8728795 cuando compusimos las canciones decidimos no ponernos limites y darle libertad a la creatividad
8728796 i accidentally saw the nurse looking at the x ray
8728797 that was probably one of the worst nights of my life
8728798 its funny they begin to feel like theyre not part of it they start to feel like the coach doesnt love me anymore
8728799 they have that sense that theyre no longer needed or wanted
8728800 they saw how much hard work the girls put in last year and saw that it was worth it to make the final four even though we have a young team the girls have high expectations for themselves
8728801 at the end of day its about a mother with young children who is dealing with a horrendous disease
8728802 soccer will come and go but real life is always there our team is excited to help out
8728803 whats amazing about them is that theyve improved with each game
8728804 it could be a good thing i dont know yet
8728805 these younger girls dont know what to expect and they are pumped up to play varsity it could definitely be to our advantage
8728806 the team is playing well together especially since its so early in the season
8728807 at the tournament i threw people into the game when my starters got tired and everyone stepped up and did what they needed to do
8728808 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world
8728809 having said that the people were right and he is yet to change but this time without his daughter by his side he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is
8728810 who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible
8728811 no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him
8728812 each party negotiating this has their own views about their own standards being better
8728813 but as long as we can show were not lowering safety and were lowering cost were all interested in that
8728814 it may involve changes to the structure it may involve changes to material but they result in not so many differences in the safety levels of the vehicles
8728815 the bumper to absorb energy to reduce the risk of injury is not the kind of bumper system you would design to help protect the vehicle
8728816 the data that we have really drives the direction and the nature of the standards we develop
8728817 we would much prefer to design a vehicle that provides good protection for unbelted occupants but is tuned specifically to protect occupants that are doing what theyre supposed to be doing
8728818 its very difficult for governments that have had a specific regulation on their books for many years to suddenly decide to change
8728819 we think its very important to have a single set of requirements that can be enacted globally
8728820 in all my years of high school football ive never seen anything like what i saw with our return game we had another return touchdown called back on a penalty
8728821 the passing was not as existent as i wouldve liked there are some other things here and there willie played very good at times and looked bad in others his running was outstanding his blocking wasnt thats what preseasons for the goal is for woods cross to get better
8728822 coach russ jones does a good job diversifying things theyre a good team with 22 returning starters its going to be a battle
8728823 obviously im real pleased with the win hunters going to be a good team down the road and to come in here and get a win is a good thing
8728824 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8728825 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8728826 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8728827 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8728828 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8728829 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8728830 im not talking about financial box office im talking about one on one with these putting fists up
8728831 theres not a badder dude in a movie this year than max payne this is like my characters from the departed fear four brothers all mixed into one times ten
8728832 just shows us where we need to direct our disaster preparedness effort
8728833 the findings in this report will aid public health and emergency preparedness efforts and may help reduce the mortality burden in future natural disasters
8728834 the remnants of the hurricane could bring a lot of rain into the midwest and that could be bearish for the grains
8728835 the diaper opened and the baby fell to the ground but at a much slower speed
8728836 the diaper obviously lessened the impact of the fall and saved the babys life
8728837 he could also have been killed by one of the spikes
8728838 requires a rethinking of what early urbanism may have been like in diverse and variant forms
8728839 every game is a big game but thursday is a big chance for us to showcase nationally what we certainly hope to be about as a football program
8728840 the biggest challenge without a doubt is i feel like when people havent had a lot of success a lot of times theyre scared of success we cant be a university thats scared of success
8728841 i like to walk down paths nobody else wants to
8728842 people are just throwing names and number out there before anything has happened
8728843 before you even play a down of football you feel like you should be handed a trophy
8728844 i think being on both ends of the spectrum has really helped us stay grounded we know that we cant let that stuff get to us
8728845 with the expectations through the roof for this football team i think theres a little bit of pressure
8728846 i hope we handle it better than we did last year
8728847 i started walking today i brushed my own teeth today sat up in a chair today fed myself today
8728848 rejects any process to select delegates and alternate delegates that restricts party grass roots activists from participating in that process as appears to be the case here
8728849 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
8728850 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8728851 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8728852 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8728853 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8728854 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8728855 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8728856 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8728857 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8728858 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8728859 significant financial loss for the band prosecutors said popeater com
8728860 the message that has come from the russians is one that is tied to invading another country invading sovereign territory

8728862 students inherit scripts from prior classes and thus are primed with the right answers to the professor s questions
8728863 jeg vet ikke hva h brekke har utrettet for norsk kvinnefotball
8728864 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8728865 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8728866 we encourage employees to take time to review the offer carefully discuss it with their families and vote in their best interest
8728867 my husband and i often said goodbye by making love
8728868 but one day all of a sudden it just happened i knew that something was wrong because i didnt hear anything from him but it was just the best way to go
8728869 i was just so proud to show off my big old jim mcconaughey and his gift
8728870 we made a real effort to find out and they were entirely uncommunicative
8728871 i came away with a very clear impression that something is going to happen that doing nothing is not a choice here
8728872 weve been telling them to think very carefully before acting and move very cautiously and whatever you do make sure that its multilateral not unilateral
8728873 out of your homes and into the streets was taken up by the people around me as watchers standing on there loft balconies looked on at the crowd passing by them
8728874 absolutely she went on to say we need to elect obama and then go on to address a number of other issues
8728875 i was not pleased with his vote on fisa and his tough talk
8728876 oh its ok he didnt mean it it was an axe o dent
8728877 but mommy oreo didnt really say he was sorry cats dont use words like we do oreo meowed he was sorry
8728878 but mommy oreo didnt meow he was sorry he just meowed
8728879 hij heeft me mijn huidige coach gesuggereerd want met mijn vorige coach lukte het niet meer hij luisterde niet meer naar mijn mening
8728880 senator obama this is truly a good day for america too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8728881 what i was trying to describe was a side effect of art and art as a kind of drug that numbs your senses
8728882 art might become a drug for an artist but i am not convinced that it is necessary for all artists
8728883 in japan they are convinced that they take any movie in venice
8728884 but there are so many who dont admit that they sent works and were rejected
8728885 after the game the whole student body was excited and there was a great atmosphere
8728886 we have a really great student body and needed to fire up the whole school
8728887 you know its a great win for skyline and a great win for the team i thought the kids played real hard with intensity and had a great attitude
8728888 they really gave it their all and they need to do that every week bring that kind of high intensity
8728889 winning the first game of the year is always a clutch its the first week of school and kids are all excited but on the opposite side its always hard to lose that first one cause it takes the air out of the sails it makes coaching the kids a lot easier and the spirit around the school is immensely positive
8728890 after the game the whole student body was excited and there was a great atmosphere
8728891 we have a really great student body and needed to fire up the whole school
8728892 you know its a great win for skyline and a great win for the team i thought the kids played real hard with intensity and had a great attitude

8728897 no hay en el pa s el nimo de tumbarse al presidente garc a ni el fundamento legal o pol tico por la inestabilidad que producir a para hacerlo los opositores que lo proponen reflejan orfandad de estrategia y los gobiernistas que la usan para justificar sus problemas se ponen en papel de v ctima sin causa
8728898 la propuesta que parti de ollanta humala y que luego fue respaldada por algunos dirigentes de izquierda como lo hizo ayer el sutepista olmedo auris para ir a un proceso de revocatoria presidencial es descabellada y carece de todo sentido constitucional y pol tico
8728899 whos out of control whose life is out of control give me a break going from place to place being dragged around by samantha so she can make more money off of lindsay being there when she spins shes gone from making 7 million to less than a million a movie whos out of control
8728900 i go to church i go and help people in rehab thats control how can she say im out of control i want lindsay to be in a good place when i started looking at what samantha was doing dragging lindsay to clubs drinking around lindsay samantha is one of the biggest problems in her life thats what dina told me im reacting on what dina said but then dina steps out of the picture because she wants to look like the good guy
8728901 dinas a two face she wants to try to look good and stay on lindsays good side instead of being a good parent
8728902 if theyre going to say im lying im out of control im going to show that theyre lying and theyre out of control

8728904 deze uitdagingen moet ik nu grijpen helaas kan ik die uitdagingen niet combineren met mijn functie bij de judofederatie
8728905 tot eind september zal ik de lopende zaken en de open dossiers nog afhandelen
8728906 mijn tijd werd opgeslorpt door de vele vergaderingen maar het was heel leerrijk
8728907 ik wil de federatie ook bedanken voor de kans ik wens alle judokas succes en ga mijn dromen realiseren
8728908 mijn keuze heeft niets te maken met de tegenvallende resultaten
8728909 i was offered playboy last year and again a couple of months ago and i did turn them down but thats not to say i wouldnt consider it in the future i have no problems walking around the house naked or anything
8728910 this is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object
8728911 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8728912 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8728913 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8728914 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location

8728919 ni el presidente ni la corte est n dispuestos a conciliar por un lado uribe porque se siente respaldado por el 80 por ciento que registra en las encuestas y la corte porque los magistrados est n convencidos de que est n obrando con transparencia y en derecho es una cuesti n de principios y por eso es dif cil prever una distenci n en el corto plazo sin embargo a pesar de su actitud camaronera uribe es tambi n un pol tico pragm tico para la muestra un bot n el mismo senador a quien casi golpe hace 14 a os es hoy su ministro de interior y justicia habr que ver si este ltimo incidente es apenas una nueva tormenta en vaso de agua
8728920 the roar of a hundred days stand up and be heard
8728921 i believe that the social emotional component is clearly the most important of a childs life
8728922 if we can create an environment where we feel good and care for each other everything else falls into place
8728923 and the content of the programs often addresses positive character development themes
8728924 a great way of getting a sense of who your kid is
8728925 i want children to be a part of anything they want to be especially at the middle school level
8728926 well compete with other junior high schools but the important distinction is we do not have a bf team that seeks to find the best kids who can compete with other kids
8728927 thats an example of how i want to build self esteem and self worth through a regular education program
8728928 each child in the course of every day gets touched by several social and emotional learning experiences as either a participant or a recipient and so if you take that and you multiply it by five days a week 180 school days over a period of years youd have a tremendously powerful intervention and thats what kids are getting
8728929 most children couldnt care less what we teach as long as they feel connected to us in some intimate way
8728930 ive been in obamas tour since the beginning of it
8728931 whether its restaurants or street vendors who are selling barack obama paraphernalia
8728932 just for the atmosphere and to meet people from different states
8728933 not so much about economics but about to keep obama in everybodys minds we need change
8728934 por lo menos en las reformas a la justicia y la pol tica
8728935 hoy la discusi n p blica est generando y est llegando a unos niveles de intolerancia que la verdad se pregunta uno c mo es posible pedirles tolerancia a las personas en los campos y en las ciudades cuando al nivel m s alto de la dirigencia pol tica no estamos mostrando la posibilidad de tener ese di logo constructivo
8728936 tambi n quiero invitar al se or presidente a que en un momento donde nos acusan de cosas injustas lo aceptemos con la dignidad del cargo manejemos la situaci n con concordia y demos el ejemplo que el 80 de los colombianos hoy respalda
8728937 en este momento tan dif cil demos un paso atr s y busquemos el escenario de concordia sin ep tetos en el que los temas para este pa s que est buscando esta nueva salida sean hechos sobre la discusi n publica fraterna
8728938 en vez de buscar el objetivo inmediato de hacerle da o al gobierno o tratar de tumbar ministro esperemos a que la justicia act e frente a las acusaciones que hay sobre su hermano y que nos sentemos con ese ministro que viene de las entra as del congreso a que aprovechemos esa discusi n para tener una reforma pol tica de largo alcance
8728939 c mo es posible pedirles tolerancia a las personas en los campos y en las ciudades cuando al nivel m s alto de la dirigencia pol tica no estamos mostrando la posiblidad de tener ese di logo constructivo
8728940 the arrest happened at a salt lake shopping mall where the suspect allegedly arranged to meet a young girl for sex
8728941 these people are failing to make themselves accountable for their actions and there is concern about peoples safety because of that
8728942 there is a criminal justice system the law of the land that people need to abide by
8728943 they have been through a process where they know they have to appear in court for an offence so they must know that if they fail to appear then warrants get issued they are well aware of it
8728944 i said you must think i am barking mad this is obviously a scam and i hung up
8728945 arcor toont aan dat industri le activiteit en ecologie perfect kunnen samengaan
8728946 het ministerie van sociale economie heeft alvast 4 miljoen euro gereserveerd voor beschutte en sociale werkplaatsen die willen investeren in milieuvriendelijke innovatieprojecten
8728947 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8728948 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
8728949 if my guesses are confirmed then the suspicion is raised that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of us president
8728950 i think that those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8728951 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8728952 they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8728953 what were supposed to let ourselves be killed and for that they will say leave us in the g 8 and who will remain in the g 8 when were all killed
8728954 ill talk to the prime minister about this later today with the concrete evidence that she will know that these allegations are vile malevolent malicious and wrong
8728955 im going to talk to the prime minister and my full considerations will be subsequent to my talks with her
8728956 serious questions about political funding which go to the heart of the democratic process and government
8728957 there are a lot of things that are different between now and what we faced in 2005 when katrina came ashore
8728958 weve had three years to put together a plan that never existed before
8728959 depending on how much surplus land were selling were expecting to get below the figure we budgeted for
8728960 its just taken us till this time to tell you all about it
8728961 if it doesnt go ahead its a great business deal
8728962 if we dont have that land people cant come to us with those thoughts and enhance things for the city
8728963 est bamos totalmente a favor de la estabilidad y la integridad territorial de georgia pero despu s del ltimo acto de agresi n y acto de genocidio y limpieza tnica osetia del sur y abjazia llegaron a la conclusi n de que no pueden seguir conviviendo con georgia en un s lo estado
8728964 la realidad es que tarde o temprano la comunidad internacional llegar a un entendimiento de la existencia de estos dos estados independientes
8728965 se hab a llevado a cabo con las tropas rusas rodeando las poblaciones mientras las milicias locales expulsaban a los habitantes y saqueaban e incendiaban sus propiedades
8728966 la estrategia es crear zonas de seguridad territorios vac os de los cuales la gente ha sido expulsada todas las casas destrozadas y los campos incendiados porque as ser dif cil que las personas vuelvan a sus hogares incluso si se hacen acuerdos de seguridad para eso

8728970 there are areas that we can do better there are areas that the pakistani military can do better we understand that its an area i think we can all improve on but it is not going to be something that gets solved overnight
8728971 was a chance to understand a very complex challenge in a critical part of the world and try to do that through the eyes of a leadership that lives and fights there
8728972 the city refused to provide any access to allow these persons to meet with attorneys
8728973 its clear the fbi wants to minimize this as a mistake and not abuse the facts are there was a ridiculous amount of misuse and abuse
8728974 surely there must be a better way to use this feature
8728975 but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security

8728995 after consulting with our storage vendor it was agreed the most sensible option would be to copy the entire volume to a new disk structure still maintaining its integrity and structure from where we could re mount it correctly
8728996 unfortunately due to its size we didnt have spare capacity on the platform to create a complete duplicate of it
8728997 there has been a 17 increase in violent crime across the country this year
8728998 in queenstown there has been a 14 increase so we are near the top
8728999 that is not something we want to be top of
8729000 nz police committed to making queenstown a safer place to live
8729001 you are 8 5 times more likely to be the victim of a violent attack in licensed premises in queenstown than the rest of the country
8729002 let me get some things straight the queenstown police are totally unbiased on this issue we are not motivated by profit but merely seek to make queenstown a safer and better place to live
8729003 what is happening where and when it is happening and who is doing it
8729004 the only difference i can see is the amount of violence otherwise i dont believe it is any different from most towns and cities in new zealand
8729005 the council has been helping quite a bit but it also has to be the people
8729006 but i believe we do act responsibly there are victims we are not denying it but its an emotional issue too
8729007 i thought if they are not going to set an example who is
8729008 we are very relieved about it they said this was just what happened from time to time because of the sort of rock the bank is made of
8729009 its solid beneath there they the geologists assured us of that
8729010 of course we would never undermine a piece of legislation so important as this because of something that is happening in politics because of untoward circumstances and people in new zealand
8729011 it is great to be back on a river that challenges our skills as guides

8729018 fight against the government will continue till that is achieved
8729019 we are not against industrialisation in the state but we are against the way in which fertile agricultural land had been forcefully acquired from unwilling farmers
8729020 a slander campaign is on against me my supporters and our struggle against injustice
8729021 we want to know why the tata group is being favoured over other industrial houses in facilities and concessions
8729022 it is a false allegation as we have not blockaded any road the entire matter has been fabricated by the state government
8729023 the situation in all the districts of the state other than kandhamal is under control
8729024 people often blame the government for being inefficient but this time it is a private corporation that has proven to be inefficient
8729025 it looks like a juicy fruit from the outside but it is all rotten inside
8729026 the chance of children contracting infections in such an environment is high
8729027 this is the first air conditioner we have started using we do not know what will happen when we start using the others
8729028 we cannot even take up the matter with the infosys foundation seriously we do not want to come across as ungrateful but this is not what we expected
8729029 there certainly has been help with the new ball for seven eight overs
8729030 its a question of playing through it and we have failed at that the control of their bowlers has been excellent and weve lost wickets early before the weaker fifth bowler has come in to the attack
8729031 dhoni is a class reader of the game and he tells me how to play
8729032 i just concentrated on reading the hand and playing in the v and i was happy that i was reading the hand
8729033 overcome the hesitation i used to have when going for the big shots
8729034 the operation is over with the killing of all three militants
8729035 we have information that there may be more militants so we are taking all precautions the fence along the international border has been cut so we suspect that the number of militants who had crossed may be much more
8729036 i had to be consistent and try to get a high percentage of my first serves in
8729037 i didnt return so well and i had a lot of ups and downs and big frustrations
8729038 but it is the first match it is always the trickiest one but hopefully the next one will be better
8729039 after it happened i was thinking more of it than i was the pain so it is not really a big deal
8729040 but in a certain moment i felt big pain so i had to get it taped
8729041 i felt good thats the best ive felt in four five months
8729042 i was really disappointed the way he had served the point before he served right at me for sure
8729043 i wasnt going for him it was a bad miss i was really excited about the way i was playing to end it that way was a little disappointing
8729044 it was really tough i am completely out of breath
8729045 the most important thing is to stay positive in the difficult moments in the match even when you feel tired
8729046 in a time of crisis it is critical that the minister be honest and forthright with the canadian people unfortunately this government is more interested in covering up its plan to gut food safety inspections than telling the truth
8729047 how can canadians trust the government response to the listeria outbreak if they cant trust anything the minister says
8729048 nothing in these plants has changed today from last month or six months ago

8729050 you are directed to provide a progress report on the implementation of all of your reallocation proposals those supported and those supported with follow up to the secretary of the treasury board by august 28th 2008
8729051 if you saw the document you would realize that theres no timeframe attached to it and theres no budgets attached to it
8729052 these were presented to and approved by the priorities and planning committee of cabinet and included in the 2008 budget
8729053 no one comparing the ministers statements to the actual contents of the secret document and the statements of cfia officials can reasonably reach any other conclusion except that minister ritz is misleading canadians at a time of crisis
8729054 the liberal party has a long history of working closely with northern canadians
8729055 in fact ours is a much more diverse approach to northern canada than mr harpers simplistic strategy of flexing military muscle and exploiting arctic resources
8729056 canadas north means more than just resources to be exploited and good locations for military installations
8729057 there are very serious issues in the north that the federal government must address including literacy the climate change crisis and settling land claims only the liberal party has a strategy to deal with all of these issues
8729058 how do we begin to create a school culture that values social and emotional well being while promoting academic success

8729065 were paying attention to each individual kid to see how theyre handling all of this to see if theyre too giddy were here to help guide them through the process
8729066 we want them to be excited thats a part of it but we have to have our poise

8729098 i think this is not a time to go back to trudeau style economic policies it is not a time to impose new taxes on the canadian economy and it is not a time to launch big unfunded spending initiatives
8729099 he is certainly the liberal leader that has taken his party farthest to the left at least since mr trudeau if not farther than mr trudeau
8729100 the fact that mr dion opposes any expenditure management in any area of the government indicates to us why increasingly we have little common ground in parliament with mr dion and where he is taking the party

8729125 im not ashamed to be a gamer and though a handful of opportunistic politicians and moralist activists would have you believe otherwise we are no more antisocial than the rest of society
8729126 all that matters is that we are gamers and there are 30 000 of us here which makes it hard to believe that we are an antisocial group of maladjusted misfits so if you happen to come across someone who thinks we are invite them to play a game with you

8729140 basic rights such as clean drinking water should not be left to the private sector or non governmental organizations nowhere else in the country would anybody condone this
8729141 i want to extend my thanks and appreciation to all the caw volunteers who came to little salmon carmacks to work on improving water quality in the community
8729142 after repeated unsuccessful efforts to get indian and northern affairs to look at the issue we welcomed the caw volunteers support and assistance
8729143 safe clean drinking water should be a right not a privilege in this country
8729144 and there are other communities that need this help also
8729145 were a social union our commitment goes beyond our members and our families
8729146 when i started talking to phil fontaine i was appalled to realize we had a developing world in our own country called first nation communities
8729147 we want to show the world that the canadian government is not living up to its obligations to first nations people
8729148 harper has been up north the last several days and not one word from him about the suffering of communities like little salmon carmacks so were trying to embarrass the government into doing the work
8729149 so when we looked at that chant construction came to us and said comon can we look at a settlement
8729150 these races are always fun and its just a really good group of people too
8729151 everybody is very supportive of each other no matter what your ability we have a few people who are more beginners this year and what is nice is they get probably bigger cheers than the faster people so its nice
8729152 its a fairly fast course but it really depends on the winds out here
8729153 if you get a strong headwind it can be a really hard course it just keeps it interesting when you can go on different courses and so we are lucky around here because there are quite a few different courses that we do
8729154 i used to road race when i was 16 or 17 so that was like 15 years ago and i just thought i would come out and relive it a little bit
8729155 it was fun time trials are hard that is what i remember
8729156 that is the whole point of it you want to push yourself so i was definitely suffering
8729157 i just wanted to come out and hopefully ride as hard as i could that was about it

8729168 we all want the same end state the question is how we can get there hopefully we re on the same path

8729178 were just a very young team but we just need to continue on its been close the last two region games we just need to keep working
8729179 we have the toughest region out of anybody every single team in our region can beat any team in region 3 even taylorsville our lowest can do that
8729180 were making progress we have a variety of guys stepping up
8729181 samanis been preparing himself for his senior season all along
8729182 hes focused and shifty for a player whos 6 foot 185 pounds
8729183 were trying to teach manu to avoid contact hell be able to hold up hes a tough kid
8729184 after the game the whole student body was excited and there was a great atmosphere
8729185 we have a really great student body and needed to fire up the whole school
8729186 you know its a great win for skyline and a great win for the team i thought the kids played real hard with intensity and had a great attitude
8729187 they really gave it their all and they need to do that every week bring that kind of high intensity
8729188 winning the first game of the year is always a clutch its the first week of school and kids are all excited but on the opposite side its always hard to lose that first one cause it takes the air out of the sails it makes coaching the kids a lot easier and the spirit around the school is immensely positive
8729189 we knew each other well from playing in previous ujga tournaments and we got along great just a great experience
8729190 playing against the greatest within the region magnified my mistakes
8729191 all four of us will be pushing towards the goal to be the last one standing
8729192 our offseason along with our experience helped us they didnt get themselved down when they were down by a couple scores and i think thats maturity from a lot of these guys playing last year as underclassmen and they were able to draw from that experience keep their heads up and come back
8729193 i signed up to defend our nation if we went to state i would be thrilled in the long run i need to concentrate on that but as of right now im focused on football and getting our team into state
8729194 the further we go on in the season the better well get we just need to tweak a few things here and there and execute we have the kids that can do it but its about getting them in the right place at the right time it just comes down to the timing
8729195 i was really happy with how the first week went we didnt have many mental mistakes
8729196 this is the best way to get out of the gate since ive been here as far as pure execution on both sides of the ball
8729197 we knew each other well from playing in previous ujga tournaments and we got along great just a great experience
8729198 playing against the greatest within the region magnified my mistakes
8729199 all four of us will be pushing towards the goal to be the last one standing
8729200 alta is one of the best teams in the state
8729201 after the game the whole student body was excited and there was a great atmosphere

8729206 zachs very athletic on offense and will be a match up problem for other peoples secondary
8729207 but he also brings help to our defense hell be a physical presence in our secondary tough
8729208 i caught a ball in the end zone from young but the referees said i trapped it then parkinson had a 98 yard kickoff return touchdown called back because of a penalty it was ridiculous
8729209 we need to stop with the mental mistakes and just remember our rules
8729210 i thing for the first game of the season kolton handled the adversity well
8729211 we worked out our problems and thats the important thing we ended on a positive note
8729212 passing definitely needs work we have the hitters so we need to get them the ball
8729213 we had a good result and we had a not so good result
8729214 i am confident we can play better we need to be more organized defensively especially against more physical teams
8729215 we are playing well early and im trying new things
8729216 evans was out there giving orders and directing traffic she did a great job
8729217 i dont really pay attention to what newspapers say about me
8729218 its hard for sophomores to come in and fit in with the older guys
8729219 hes getting there though our chemistry is getting better not to fast but not to slow he actually reminds me of last years quarterback r j tialavea
8729220 he taught us to start believing in ourselves when things werent going good in the past not to give up i thank him for that
8729221 i accidentally saw the nurse looking at the x ray
8729222 that was probably one of the worst nights of my life
8729223 its funny they begin to feel like theyre not part of it they start to feel like the coach doesnt love me anymore
8729224 they have that sense that theyre no longer needed or wanted
8729225 they saw how much hard work the girls put in last year and saw that it was worth it to make the final four even though we have a young team the girls have high expectations for themselves
8729226 at the end of day its about a mother with young children who is dealing with a horrendous disease
8729227 soccer will come and go but real life is always there our team is excited to help out
8729228 whats amazing about them is that theyve improved with each game
8729229 it could be a good thing i dont know yet
8729230 these younger girls dont know what to expect and they are pumped up to play varsity it could definitely be to our advantage
8729231 the team is playing well together especially since its so early in the season
8729232 at the tournament i threw people into the game when my starters got tired and everyone stepped up and did what they needed to do
8729233 we knew each other well from playing in previous ujga tournaments and we got along great just a great experience
8729234 playing against the greatest within the region magnified my mistakes
8729235 all four of us will be pushing towards the goal to be the last one standing
8729236 in all my years of high school football ive never seen anything like what i saw with our return game we had another return touchdown called back on a penalty
8729237 the passing was not as existent as i wouldve liked there are some other things here and there willie played very good at times and looked bad in others his running was outstanding his blocking wasnt thats what preseasons for the goal is for woods cross to get better
8729238 coach russ jones does a good job diversifying things theyre a good team with 22 returning starters its going to be a battle
8729239 obviously im real pleased with the win hunters going to be a good team down the road and to come in here and get a win is a good thing
8729240 we knew each other well from playing in previous ujga tournaments and we got along great just a great experience
8729241 playing against the greatest within the region magnified my mistakes

8729251 id actually make the point that for us second hand sales is a very critical situation because people are selling multiple times intellectual property
8729252 what were trying to do is build business models that are more and more online supported with additional services and additional content that you get online so people will see the value in not just getting that physical disc to play at home alone but actually playing those games online and paying for them
8729253 in our understanding of the business model we are actually giving away the rights to play and if you just pass it on pass it on pass it on that is not comparable to second hand sales in the normal physical goods area where you have physical wear out second hand cars second hand clothes second hand books theyre all physically wearing out so you have an inferior quality product
8729254 impulse is somewhat unique in that its power is mostly on the server and not in the client developers who want to make use of the features of impulse dont have to force their users to install impulse because its not impulse that provides these features its the impulsereactor platform behind it providing the common virtual platform apis cvp

8729274 i was a school principal in the 60s and 70s
8729275 we had battles back then with skirt lengths that left nothing to the imagination
8729276 rear ends or cleavage and undergarments should not be visible
8729277 theyre called undergarments because theyre supposed to be under something

8729279 we allow them as long as theyre off during the school day and kept in the locker
8729280 i dont think at any age cell phones need to be in schools
8729281 kids who needed something after school tended to load up on non healthy snacks
8729282 i think anything that eliminates that fear factor or that exaggeration of reality is probably what were trying to avoid
8729283 some of the things ive taken from kids dont look at all like any toy i ever saw
8729284 that is probably the most common thing that i have will turned in to me

8729415 the university is almost like a junior partner it is helping the community stabilize itself it has no desire to take over parts of woodlawn
8729416 the university has made a commitment to being a good neighbor during the construction
8729417 they pay lip service but when it comes to actual things they could do more
8729418 i think they tend to gobble up what they need to the exclusion of everyone else
8729419 woodlawn is gentrifying anyway poor people are being moved out and people who are more affluent are being moved in
8729420 my grey elephant at the planning committee table is affordable housing and people in the community how will they be able to stay
8729421 the university has been stepping up to the plate when we ask them to provide services
8729422 they have their own agenda which has nothing to do with the reality of this community except that they are part of this community
8729423 theyve been doing this for a long time reverend dr leon finney president of two has currency with the university so theyre the ones in the drivers seat
8729424 the wcdc has a lot of buildings now that are project based subsidies
8729425 they control those peoples households they have the say so whether theyre going to keep them subsidized
8729426 its a lot of door knocking passing flyers planning meetings
8729427 not happy with 300 poor families still living on that probably like to see that disappear
8729428 its been a long time coming but you can see it coming to fruition now
8729429 expanding southward done the right way can be mutually beneficial there are enough people in the university who will raise questions
8729430 ive lived here six years and from what ive seen their expansion cant hurt the neighborhood in terms of whats there now for the past thirty or forty years the community has tried one way and now we need more options the university is a wildcard you dont quite know what youre going to get
8729431 students and the community could interact in a non threatening space
8729432 will not support an activist center that does not open its doors to community service and non activist groups
8729433 the university has a long way to go in community relations
8729434 it seems like the woodlawn collaborative is doing the universitys work for them
8729435 there may have been a gentlemans handshake about university acquisition some years ago but i dont think there was ever anything in writing
8729436 the people who initially made the agreement two since that time have rethought their strategies
8729437 ill do everything in my power to make sure this growth is a partnership and i absolutely believe that is possible
8729438 too often the outside market comes in and has no compunction about poor people they dont want to see poor people at all
8729439 but its harder to do people dont want to spend the time or the money
8729440 give students and the community an opportunity for much more interaction
8729441 seem like they try to ignore me like im not there like im invisible
8729442 i want to think that something can happen so that one is not afraid of the other

8729453 i did a duet with the jonas brothers on my album and we wrote the song together
8729454 its like a breakup song and its called on the line it was important to have them on my album because i mean just look at how successful they are i would love to have their input anytime because theyre obviously doing something right
8729455 i tend to write songs that are i guess a little bit more intense and less catchy and i needed help writing catchy songs
8729456 so thats where they came in i put a lot of my musical input and lyrics into these songs and they just helped me with hooks and stuff like that
8729457 theres a song i wrote myself that i hope fans will react to and connect with
8729458 the song is about feeling insecure and just not feeling pretty and i hope girls my age can relate to it because i just felt like there needed to be a song about how not everyone has confidence i know it sounds cheesy but its true
8729459 i used to write really dark songs every night in my room like five or six a night and id be up until 5 in the morning and my mom would come up and say so what are you writing
8729460 id play her a song and shed go wow go to therapy but it really is therapy for me so i put everything in my lyrics you wont necessarily find a lot of that on the album but hopefully you will on the next album its my first one so i wanted it to be fun stuff you can drive around in your car to and jam out to

8729496 john mccain was able to weave in his experience in a vietnam prison camp no matter what the question was
8729497 its much better than talking about how hes changed his total character between being a senator a kind of a maverick at the time and his acquiescence in the last few months with every kind of lobbyist pressure that the right wing republicans have presented to him
8729498 i spent those five and half years not because i wanted to get a house when i got out
8729499 i would hope that the democrats could have enough senators elected in november so that we would not any longer need to include joe lieberman among the senators

8729504 the senator this style is fitting for the democratic senators and representatives attending barack obamas big speech we suggest the red overcoat toga with a red stripe it is very regal and befitting of a member of congress in the tradition of the most distinguished senators from antiquity
8729505 if he loses by 2 or 3 then i would certainly say that the racial issue was a major factor
8729506 i will do whatever barack obama tells me to do
8729507 it would be political malpratice if mccains vp choice came out tonight

8729520 the storm poses a serious threat to lives and property next week along the gulf coast all interests from the florida panhandle to south texas should closely monitor the storm prepare an emergency plan and stock up on supplies
8729521 senator mccain has always been sensitive to national crises in the 2000 race he postponed his announcement because of the situation in the balkans and we are monitoring the situation very closely
8729522 hes the one individual speaking monday night who might actually have some responsibility with regard to this
8729523 the republicans cant seem to get a break when it comes to august and when it comes to the weather

8729536 we appear to be the latest in a long list of nursing home providers targeted by the same lawyer who previously filed a series of similar class action style lawsuits in california
8729537 these lawsuits also alleged that nursing home providers falsely advertised the quality of care they provided to residents while this lawyer has not been successful in proving such allegations in a court of law we understand the previous cases have resulted in settlements many providers in the california suits were undoubtedly forced to settle these cases rather than fight the allegations and prove them to be false because of the costs of litigation
8729538 we intend to vigorously and successfully defend this lawsuit and discourage these lawyers from trying to recreate their california experience in washington state
8729539 the allegations made by these lawyers are incorrect and misleading and are clearly designed to maximize the potential recovery of attorneys fees rather than benefit residents
8729540 the companys first vertical exploration well of 2008 n 14 a has been drilled to a depth of 8 500 feet 2 600 meters the well encountered horton bluff shale at a depth of 3 600 feet 1 100 meters and drilled through a total of 4 900 feet 1 500 meters of shale and interbedded sands before drilling was terminated in the lower horton bluff an extensive suite of open hole logs has been obtained over the entire shale interval core was taken in the shale over a 60 foot 18 meter interval at a depth of 5 800 feet 1 700 meters and cuttings samples were retrieved throughout the drilling operation log and lab analyses are currently underway in calgary and houston the highest gas response was observed while drilling the interval between 4 200 and 8 200 feet 1 300 to 2 500 meters preliminary analysis of the shales below 8 200 feet 2 500 meters indicate higher thermal maturity and diminished gas response so the decision was made to suspend drilling at 8 500 feet 2 600 meters and to set 7 inch intermediate casing by setting the large intermediate casing the company retains the option to either deepen or drill out horizontally depending on formation evaluation and completion results in the vertical well triangle owns a minimum 45 working interest in the well and is the operator the companys second vertical exploration well in 2008 o 61 c spudded early this week this well is located approximately 14 miles 22 kilometers west of n 14 a and is located in a separate fault block from n 14 a extending the trend from the two kennetcook test wells drilled by triangle in 2007 planned total depth is 9 900 feet 3 000 meters this well has been positioned using seismic to test the horton bluff shales and to evaluate potential conventional reservoirs in the uphole windsor group triangle owns a minimum 45 working interest in this well also and is the operator
8729541 we are pleased with the on track progress of the windsor shale drilling operations and encouraged by the results obtained contacts current level of shale exploration activity in nova scotia and new brunswick is an exciting compliment to the companys ongoing oil production and field optimization in onshore atlantic canada

8729580 for an industry that reeled in more than 4 1 billion to our region over the past five years we must ensure that the decisions nfsc and the new england fishery management council are making most immediately in regard to the groundfish industry are based on sound credible science by performing an independent investigation of the nfsc to examine the credibility of the claims the department of commerce can possibly save our valuable and cherished fishing industry from an economic and ecological disaster
8729581 the revised guidelines are a step in the right direction but they leave many problems unresolved so that legislation will still be necessary for example there is no change in the benefit to corporations to waive the privilege by giving facts obtained by the corporate attorneys from the individuals in order to escape prosecution or to have a deferred prosecution agreement the new guidelines expressly encourage corporations to comply with the waiver and disclosure programs of other agencies including the sec and epa legislation of course would bind all federal agencies and could not be changed except by an act of congress
8729582 why wont you permit a straight up or down vote
8729583 but if you feel you have the better arguments why not give a straight up or down vote for drilling
8729584 well if youre right why not let it be debated out and have the vote
8729585 when you came in as speaker you promised in your commitment book a new direction for america let me show our viewers you said that bills should generally come to the floor under a procedure that allows open full fair debate consisting of a full amendment process that grants the minority the right to offer its alternatives if they want to offer a drilling proposal why cant they have a vote
8729586 do it all do it now do it for america
8729587 speaker pelosi a staunch opponent of offshore drilling has simply decreed that she will not allow a drilling vote to take place if drilling opponents really have the better of this argument why are they so worried about letting it come to a vote
8729588 space is big you just wont believe how vastly hugely mind bogglingly big it is i mean you may think its a long way down the road to the drug store but thats just peanuts to space

8729596 una decisi n prudente y que permitir avanzar realmente y en forma m s integral en la defensa de los derechos humanos en chile
8729597 la gran mayor a de la bancada acogi las inquietudes y optamos por manifestar a la mesa de nuestro partido la preocupaci n por este proyecto siendo partidarios de revisarlo y de buscar los cambios que se requieran para poder instalar definitivamente pol ticas de estado verdaderas frente al tema
8729598 este tema debe conversarse con el gobierno las agrupaciones y los parlamentarios integrando las demandas pendientes
8729599 estamos nuevamente ante las contin as vacilaciones que el gobierno ha manifestado en diversas situaciones
8729600 si bien es cierto es comprensible que las agrupaciones de derechos humanos hayan manifestado su rechazo a este proyecto ya que no los satisfac a totalmente exist an otras organizaciones como el fasic y el codepu que llamaron a aprobarlo ya que significaba un gran avance instituciones que nadie puede acusar de no buscar la verdad y la justicia
8729601 considero que es una muy mala noticia para la promoci n y defensa de los derechos humanos en nuestro pa s y muy especialmente para los miles de ex presos pol ticos y familiares de detenidos desaparecidos y ejecutados pol ticos que por diversos motivos no hab an entregado sus testimonios ante la comisi n rettig y la comisi n de prisi n pol tica y tortura y que ahora podr an hacerlo y acceder a una justa reparaci n

8729653 that sense of being trapped is an illusion we are not controlled by circumstances our past the expectations of others or our unhealthy expectations for ourselves we can choose what feels right for us without guilt we have options

8729663 i can tell you that there were a number of law enforcement administrators across the united states watching this case very closely and im sure they too will be relieved with the judges decision because these types of actions on the part of the district attorney can number one set a bad precedent and number two become contagious
8729664 number one this is unheard of in law enforcement for a police chief and a lieutenant to be indicted for a decision they made at a swat call
8729665 it was so shocking that initially i didnt believe it i figured there had to be more to the story for them to be indicted but there wasnt
8729666 i know these guys well enough where i know its been devastating for them living in a small community and hearing comments having your good reputation smeared before the public
8729667 being criminally indicted for basically being in charge of a high risk operation is not something that police chiefs have ever encountered before anywhere that i can find
8729668 i dont think any of us believed from day one that there was sufficient evidence to criminally indict either former chief douglas or lt zanotti for their actions
8729669 their actions never came close to rising to the level of gross negligence
8729670 to second guess law enforcement leaders in a criminal court can cause paralysis of the leaders in the future because folks are going to be hesitant to make quick decisions even in instances that necessitate quick decisions
8729671 when hesitation occurs in law enforcement officers can get seriously hurt or killed and thats why you need decisive leaders at swat calls

8729686 i was satisfied by how well we were running at mosport before the incident to go out at that point was a disappointment but the important thing was that we made further progress all round it was also satisfying that we found a good pace although many teams tested at the track earlier in the week and in fact we also missed out on the thursday sessions this is a development year using the races foremost as testing opportunities were not targeting eye catching results but we want to make real tangible progress at every race and this was the case at mosport now we have to carry this competiveness into detroit this week and face the challenge of a completely different type belle isle is a mix of concrete and asphalt surfaces and we expect it to be a bit slippery to start with but i think we can get a good set up for the race and the team has bounced back well from the damage at mosport
8729687 weve all worked really hard to get here and have the 18 car repaired in time for the first practice sessions which start on friday the logistics of being away from our miami base for most of august have been tricky and having to repair a damaged car this week has added to our schedule but we have a very strong crew under crew chief alex zaric and the guys have pulled together superbly as i know they would ive been coming here since 1992 and enjoyed some very good results so i hope we can get another solid one this weekend and this time load up an undamaged car at the end of it i must also say that the improvements to the venue made last year by roger penske have been excellent and provide a very welcome upgrade
8729688 im looking forward to this race i like street circuits generally and this one looks very interesting for sure i was disappointed not to get to drive at mosport but the car was working well there and its important that we are making steps forward for sure we had a good set up and race strategy but these things happen we have quite a way to go but we are going in the right direction and for me its both exciting and very challenging being a part of this big development project i enjoyed my time as a test driver in f1 and this project this year is very motivating for sure now were all focused on detroit and i hope to help the team to a good result on saturday
8729689 the race grand prix of mosport was going great the strategy went right and we were more competitive and as in road america the car felt very good the crash was bad luck for all in the team however the damage wasnt too bad so i was happy for the team and now im pleased to be racing in detroit thanks to the whole team and porsche that they managed the repair the car and get the parts quickly it will be my first race in detroit so thats going to be interesting i feel really involved and pleased with the team and im impressed by engineer roland wall i hope my team mates and myself we can show a good result like we wanted to do in mosport

8729740 now the lesson the government ought to draw from that is that when it comes to protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our community while the government obviously shares backbenchers concerns about this they do now have a group of backbenchers who are prepared to take the government right to the line to ensure that a package is delivered

8729854 it was just a gun theyre in their 20s and 30s to me it runs a little deeper i recognized immediately that the photo was from the 40s
8729855 if we can find the woman then we can find out who the man was who owned this gun
8729856 id like to find the nearest museum near them and put it in there with his and her whole story
8729857 and if i can find out where it was stolen then i can put a case on the guy we took it from for stolen property thatd be good too

8729864 just trying to take it all in and remember every experience ive had
8729865 a little r amp r here and there but i think over the next month and a half ill be able to settle down a little bit more and hopefully get settled in my new place and have some downtime
8729866 for the next few months just taking some time off actually i havent exercised at all since my last day of competition over a week ago but i think i need to start doing something im getting kind of antsy just sitting around
8729867 in beijing i had to really focus on one event at a time and once that event was done i had to put it behind me thats just sort of where my mind frame was during the meet and once it was over i dont think everything has really set in but i think over the next few months and years i think it really will set in and im proud of everything that ive done and im happy i had this opportunity
8729868 the medals are a little crooked but its a cool shot when i first was taking it i had never had them all on at once and i never realized how heavy it was but it was a fun picture and im glad i was able to take it like that it looks pretty cool i think
8729869 my proposals would protect children whether they are at school george latimers plan to keep westchester families safe from sex
8729870 i am very saddened that the clayton county school district has lost its accreditation my immediate thoughts are with the students teachers and parents who are directly affected by this decision the future of many excellent students especially those in clayton county high schools has been thrust into turmoil by the actions of the very people who were elected to look out for their best interests
8729871 i fully support governor perdues decision today to follow judge malihis ruling to remove four of the clayton county school board members there is now a window of opportunity for the new and remaining board members to seek reinstatement of the districts accreditation within a year and i hope they will commit themselves to fully addressing all of the concerns raised by sacs as new members of the clayton county school board are seated it is my hope they will commit to operating in full compliance with the letter and spirit of all local and state rules laws and regulations
8729872 in the meantime i will work with governor perdue university system of georgia chancellor erroll davis and other leaders around the state to help secure the futures of these students and all who attend clayton county public schools we will seek any and all flexibility in state policies and rules to make sure thousands of students are not harmed by the actions of the school board
8729873 it is important for the public to know that todays decision reflects solely on the actions of the clayton county school board it is not reflective of the many excellent educators and students in clayton county
8729874 additionally i hope todays announcement serves as a reminder to all citizens just how important it is for a district to have a functional productive and professional school board as we approach election day i hope georgia voters will take the time to get to know their school board candidates and choose those that they believe will best represent the interests of students teachers and citizens the power is in your hands
8729875 i really enjoy music that is enjoyable in a very straightforward way whether thats xtc or the beatles or pop music from the last ten years such as outkast
8729876 on this album unlike the first one i really made a concerted effort to make every song have a really powerful memorable chorus i wanted it to be an album that youd get on the first listen that was a challenge that i set myself and was excited about
8729877 appeal to me and also that i really felt would appeal to other people
8729878 on the first album there were a lot of songs where youd listen to them or youd read the lyrics and you probably wouldnt have an idea of what it was about and even if you did there was no telling if it would relate to what i meant the whole idea of this album was to take what i was doing and open it up
8729879 about feelings of guilt and shame its very much a cold light of day song
8729880 most guys have had that feeling where you would commit the most horrific act of violence to get your way even though you know you wouldnt really
8729881 the feeling you get in a relationship when youre trying to make something work but your best get you nowhere
8729882 rivalry for a girl most guys have been in that situation
8729883 although its a very specific story its also something that weve all experienced a little bit of in our lives being attracted to someone were not supposed to be attracted to
8729884 all of the songs on this album were written for this album whereas the last one was more of a compilation of eps and singles this one feels more like a piece
8729885 an attention to detail he really spots the details that make all the difference the other thing he brought to it was an overall aesthetic it sounds very much like a product of a single continued attempt to do something
8729886 we just have a party in our flat invite all of our friends around and put it online
8729887 just like any party sometimes it gets a bit stressful wondering if people are going to turn up
8729888 it sounds better its a much more satisfying listen from start to finish
8729889 the songs are so much better and that has come from age and experience
8729890 hes out of control i want him to stop hurting and talking to the media about the people i love

8729953 while i truly regret to see him leave our organization my first thought is to thank craig for his major contributions to delhaize group over the past seven years and wish him the best in this new job
8729954 craig has provided exemplary leadership in the companys drive to build strong finance strategy and it organisations and those organizations will continue to support our performance and growth going forward very capable professionals are in place in each of the functional areas under craigs responsibility we have begun a process that will be diligently pursued to choose a new cfo

8729964 we have a responsibility to honour the brave men and women who fought so selflessly on behalf of our country
8729965 our government is proud to provide support for memorial and cenotaph restoration in communities across the country

8729968 with its best in class billing system and ability to effectively implement significant new volumes of properties in a very short window of time we knew that nwp was just the right company to service our customers into the future at the high level of service that they have come to expect as well as offering customers the ability to utilize expanded services such as electronic payment and utility bill payment
8729969 we are pleased to have entered into this agreement with nwp who we believe is the leading billing provider to the multifamily industry
8729970 we believe that viastar customers will be able to even further strengthen their bottom line given the quality and breadth of services offered by nwp
8729971 the opportunity to leverage the strength of viastars leadership position in the indianapolis market and throughout the midwest makes this an attractive proposition for nwp
8729972 our advanced billing technologies and business process methods will enable us to rapidly transfer viastar customers to the nwp billing system helping to ensure that the companys properties and residents experience a seamless transition and are able to quickly benefit from our enhanced services and website functionality currently available to all nwp customers

8729975 our long term focus continues to be on investing in a solid business model that can deliver sustainable returns to our shareholders we have decided to slow our store and petshotel growth going forward to balance our investment between the productivity of our current asset base and driving market share gains
8729976 petsmart delivered on its plan for the first half and we feel good about delivering on our targets for all of 2008
8729977 we expect current macro trends to continue throughout the year so we are focused on consistent and efficient execution driving sales and taking great care of the customer for the third fiscal quarter of 2008 we estimate comparable store sales growth in the mid single digits and earnings per share in the range of 0 25 to 0 29
8729978 third quarter results were stronger than we expected principally due to strong performance from our european operations during the month of july
8729979 although we are optimistic we have excluded any results of those talks from our full year earnings estimate
8729980 from the 7 peak level in the prior quarter reflecting esterlines residual efforts on several major development programs including the boeing 787 and airbus a400m
