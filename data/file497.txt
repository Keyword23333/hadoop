4970000 i teach lots of classes like this for companies community groups and service organizations like the boy scouts
4970001 we teach full cpr which includes infant child and adult and first aid which covers cold and heat related injuries soft tissue muscle and joint injuries
4970002 she called to tell me that thered be a camera man and a producer at the cpr class i was signed up for on saturday
4970003 we had to make sure all the class participants today signed a release form saying it was ok for them to be filmed for the show
4970004 we also had to coordinate all the details with the red cross headquarters
4970005 if it hadnt been for you none of the others who also helped me would have mattered
4970006 during the race i apparently had a heart attack and fortunately i had a guardian angel maybe someday i can give back to someone else what she gave me
4970007 since i wasnt the only one who helped him i felt a little guilty getting all the attention but when they said it was to encourage others to take cpr and be prepared i decided it would be a good thing
4970008 it gave me the confidence to do what i had to do when i came upon keith after he collapsed when i first saw him during the race i was scared but i had to put that aside then the adrenaline kicked in i checked his pulse and when i realized he didnt have any i started chest compressions soon others came along and another woman started giving the rescue breaths and then someone else relieved me on the chest compressions
4970009 im glad to meet him again this time while hes conscious
4970010 this reunion today with the today show is a good message for all of us i learned cpr and got to help him and now hes taken cpr and maybe he can help someone else sometimes we have to get out of our comfort zones and not be embarrassed that others are watching especially when someones life is at stake
4970011 you have to wonder when they look at what they consider a loophole with such excitement
4970012 that would suggest manipulating the process and i think opens the door to suspicion
4970013 the prospect of someone coming in with no id and registering and voting is contrary to every sort of protection that legislators and lawmakers have built into this system for decades
4970014 the processes and the law and the systems in our 88 counties are not equipped to handle same day registration
4970015 this is one of many ways well be encouraging our supporters to skip the lines on election day and make sure their vote is cast early

4970018 im the head of the residential lending area of century national bank and i was interested in seeing some of these properties myself
4970019 this is nice im very impressed its nice to see downtown being revitalized
4970020 every year the downtown association does a real estate awareness event and this year were focused on the residential aspect
4970021 the whole point of the tour is the rehab of the buildings with the increase of people living downtown also comes the increase of businesses needed to serve those people each location has a chard of what is downtown like restaurants and banks
4970022 there are eight buildings with 11 units on the self guided tour
4970023 they range from 900 square feet to 3 200 square feet two major markets looking into downtown living are recent empty nesters and recent grads i think people will be impressed with the units downtown and hopefully theyll want to invest in them or tell their friends about it this is an excellent turnout im very optimistic
4970024 i think the tour is a good thing it gives us a lot of exposure
4970025 its different and fun from the imported hardwood floor to the kitchen and the openness the rooftop deck is perfect for barbecues and watching parades on the fourth of july
4970026 i have clients who are looking around and i think these properties will be attractive to them because theyre in the downtown area
4970027 residential living is coming around hopefully other events like this will tell people hey were still here theres a lot of art and architecture in town
4970028 im not afraid here now and there was a time when i was very afraid
4970029 it is a beautiful day and we have a wonderful turnout all of my pitchers showed up and everybody is having a ball
4970030 its a great cause and has great people running it

4970065 en el a o 1992 el producto bruto agrario de san mart n depend a en un 46 de la coca y actualmente registra s lo el 7 4 por eso es que mediante estos programas de desarrollo alternativo que se complementan con los trabajos de lucha contra las drogas interdicci n y reducci n de espacios cocaleros hoy d a podemos decir con mucha satisfacci n el avance notable que se ha logrado en esta zona solamente falta erradicar 400 hect reas en la regi n san mart n para poder acabar con la droga en esa zona
4970066 da aron plantaciones de ma z arroz yuca pl tano cacao y mataron los peces de varios estanques
4970067 as fue comenzaron a erradicar ellos mismos y a sembrar comida pero apareci la avioneta y acab con todo
4970068 pues yo creo que se dejaron como pretexto para fumigar
4970069 con estas aspersiones los campesinos han comenzado a expresar su cansancio con el gobierno y su falta de seriedad de los acuerdos
4970070 he visto como cerca del r o taraz han fumigado potreros sin hoja de coca pero sembrados con productos legales eso es muy triste nos est n dejando sin comida
4970071 con la erradicaci n manual quedan los cultivos il citos pero qu pasa que con la fumigaci n se afectan los cultivos l citos y acaban con nuestros alimentos eso nos pone en una situaci n de hambre muy dura
4970072 imag nese que hay un programa de seguridad alimentaria en marcha ya nos censaron en las veredas y nos ten an que dar semillas para empezar a sembrar productos alimenticios pero ahora resulta que no nos las dan hasta que dejen de fumigar qu vamos a hacer entonces qu vamos a comer
4970073 la alcald a ha solicitado que detengan las fumigaciones hemos tramitado las denuncias ante la gobernaci n de antioquia la procuradur a general de la naci n aqu se han hecho unos compromisos la gente quiere erradicar pero que no le afecten los cultivos de alimentos
4970074 estamos decididos a no ir a otra protesta eso solo nos trae golpes de la polic a y hambre queremos que el gobierno nos escuche que cumpla con los compromisos

4970083 the tv centre in gori has been blown up and they are now broadcasting russian radio
4970084 the pattern that we see on the ground is unmistakeable
4970085 systematic destruction of our military infrastructure and a seemingly random but no less painful degradation of our civilian infrastructure
4970086 they didnt manage to destroy the country to destroy the government to realize their wishes and dreams
4970087 its our legal and moral responsibility to do what we can for our children

4970097 son las 9 de la noche y en todo el d a he vendido 80 mil pesos las cosas no est n f ciles por aqu desde que comenzaron a fumigar la coca se acab no hay plata y la gente se est yendo
4970098 para nadie es un secreto que este pueblo es cocalero pero como est n acabando los cultivos la plata no se ve hay m s seguridad pero tambi n hay m s pobreza
4970099 el problema es que no tenemos capacidad de recibir m s porque los proveedores en villavicencio nos tienen ahorcados con facturas y no les podemos pagar con coca sino en efectivo

4970106 lo que pas en el chapare es un gran problema para nosotros porque en primer lugar nuestro personal tuvo que salir bajo amenazas del lugar no fue una decisi n en conjunto

4970160 celtic are perfect for him and he will be an excellent signing for them
4970161 glenn was just 17 when i got to know him at feyenoord and i could tell from our first training session he was a no nonsense defender
4970162 when he was coming through the ranks we would often have practise games in training between the first team and younger players of course id be right up against glenn and he wouldnt hold back
4970163 i remember telling him early in his career at feyenoord he would be suited perfectly to british football
4970164 sometimes in holland we expect too much from our stoppers we want them to defend score goals and set up attacks there is perhaps less pressure to do that in britain
4970165 so ive no doubt glenn will do well and i hope its another success story for a dutchman at parkhead
4970166 he was playing regularly at the de kuip stadium for feyenoord in front of 50 000 passionate fans
4970167 so playing for celtic is something he will look forward to and be keen to take on

4970190 the iau damaged the public perception of science by the high profile spectacle of imposing by vote a controversial definition of a commonly used term
4970191 too often science is presented as lists of facts to be learned from authority instead of the dynamic open ended process that it really is the iau reinforced this misconception of science
4970192 the importance of the ongoing debate is that it provides an opportunity to show the public how science really works in an area of great interest

4970225 it is fitting that at one of the most significant events of our generation we have witnessed one of the greatest performances in olympic history michaels record breaking performance during these games will inspire millions of people around the world to reach for their goals and aspire to greatness he is an example of the very best values of the olympic movement and our country
4970226 from winning by one one hundreth to doing a best time in every event its been nothing but an upward rollercoaster and nothing but fun for me
4970227 i guess i kind of just want to see my mom
4970228 no all four rounds he didnt do what we were telling him
4970229 third round i came out firing i was thinking that maybe id be up by two points but they said it was tied up
4970230 in that last round i went in there with my hands up i know i hit him with a straight left he caught me with the hook ill give them that but i think i caught him with two more punches and should have won the fight 8 7
4970231 we wanted him to box but the main thing we wanted him to do was get up early get ahead first we knew he had faster hands and more power so we wanted him to engage and make the guy have to come to him
4970232 instead they started playing the waiting game from the beginning we yelled at him talked to him between rounds but he basically did the opposite of what we asked him to do
4970233 one of the things we know is that these kids have been calling home so often
4970234 what happens is they get instructions all the way from the united states you can tell the difference because once the bell rings they start doing what their other coaches tell them
4970235 they were trying to tell me to just go at him go at him
4970236 im not that type of fighter to go out there and throw punches if i do that im going to get caught with shots i want to go out there and play it smart
4970237 luis was actually a very aggressive boxer until tonight one of the things thats always helped luis is his aggression but for some reason tonight he decided to stand back and wait and it cost him
4970238 before i came up here i talked to my dad its hard i feel like i let him down
4970239 i totally went home and cried itd be a rollercoaster all day and i was mentally drained i couldnt switch off
4970240 you see the story unfold you see where the emotion came from
4970241 there have been several landslides including one about one mile from the spelga dam on the slievemaman road in newcastle co down
4970242 that was amazing who said 13 was an unlucky number weve got rid of that one
4970243 before the race we sat down and said we wanted to come here and win this we have worked all this year and last year the last 10 years and it comes down to six and a half minutes or so of hell but with a fantastic result its unbelievable
4970244 i do not want to keep saying this but nobody is going to be leaving the club
4970245 this has been going on and on about santa cruz and other people the more you keep on about it the more it unsettles what we are trying to achieve
4970246 lets dispel all this no one is leaving the club we have had a really good start in this game we have won at everton and not many teams do that apart from the top four it was a great achievement
4970247 our defending at times was rubbish we had experienced players internationals who were not at the races
4970248 we gave away a daft free kick for their winner and even then ryan nelsen was offside when the ball came into the box
4970249 we needed the two points they were vital for us
4970250 we still have a little bit of work to do though
4970251 i was confident right through the game but i was never relaxed because we were always under pressure it was a hard fought contest and conditions played a part in how close it was
4970252 adam is a very good player who does not get the recognition he deserves
4970253 he is vital player and hes going to be good for catalans for the next three years
4970254 its a first game of the season and we had a physical match on the wednesday night and i was a little bit worried before that we would not be very sharp but we started well and were in control and we just couldnt finish them off
4970255 you have that old story that you feel you probably deserved to be punished in the end but i am pleased we did not let in a goal
4970256 is a trophy to finish 12 and win the carling cup not for me
4970257 you see the quality of a team after 38 games
4970258 in the carling cup or the fa cup you play five games and the final and could be drawn against second division teams but you have no quality and are not there at the end of the championship
4970259 for me when youre in a big club the important thing is that you are fighting for the title if you dont win it of course you are frustrated
4970260 you can make these up to one week in advance
4970261 what is it its the new camaro thats what it is
4970262 the new camaro well it accelerates like its being chased by the hounds of hell hey i can relate but enough about my love life
4970263 its a whole new kind of car for a whole new kind of people who really dig driving
4970264 its not how young you are its how old you arent
4970265 se trata de un gesto y de un paso para reconstruir la confianza un intento para fortalecer a los moderados en la anp y el proceso de paz
4970266 tres juegos tres medallas no tengo mucho que decir estaba muy nervioso el chino ha competido muy bien y estando en casa a mi me ha parecido que le han puntuado un poco alto pero yo no he hecho mejor ejercicio que l
4970267 iba a ser m s complicado que en los otros dos juegos porque adem s
4970268 ten a un sentimiento aqu en el pecho de ansiedad y les he visto fallar a ellos y he pensado les pasa lo mismo que a m que no han soportado la presi n lo nico que tengo que hacer es un ejercicio que he hecho millones de veces estoy s per preparado y no tengo que hacer maravillas
4970269 es como un pegamento para que no me suden los pies porque me resbalo un mont n al ir descalzo y los dem s no y al subir en el san pedro se me quedan un poco pegados los pies he tenido que hacer el doble de fuerza y he estado ah dej ndome la vida pero pasado eso sab a que todo iban bien hab a clavado las dos salidas de enmedio era lo importante
4970270 normalmente es lo mejor pero hoy viendo que pod a ganar te pone m s nervioso se me ha puesto cuesta arriba cuando he visto la nota no sab a si era segundo o tercero lo he visto en la pantalla y he dicho genial
4970271 por fin tengo una medalla ol mpica de suelo y no es bronce que me habr a jodido m s
4970272 no me ech is todav a espero poder estar en forma si no hay ning n tipo de lesi n si esto me gusta y disfruto de lo que hago como un ni o
4970273 it looks like a costume a waterlogged costume thats been stuffed into a freezer
4970274 it just doesnt have the hallmark of a real corpse
4970275 this represents a tremendous opportunity to intervene with intensive colorectal cancer screening and could also have near term implications for developing new approaches to prevention and treatment
4970276 this probably accounts for more colorectal cancers than all other gene mutations discovered thus far
4970277 we will be able to identify a large number of individuals that are at risk of colorectal cancer and in the long term maybe decrease the cases of colorectal cancer and of people dying from it by being able to screen them more frequently
4970278 germline allele specific expression of tgfbr1 confers an increased risk of colorectal cancer
4970279 whats there now for the most part are older people who really cant leave for either physical or financial reasons theyre too set theres nothing for them in georgia but theyve been there their whole lives
4970280 the joint distribution committee virtually could tell you every single jewish person in eastern europe and the former soviet union
4970281 and they have case workers who deliver food packages to people on a scheduled basis these people would be dead if it werent for the jdc
4970282 safeguard jews wherever they are so that no jew finds themselves alone without help again
4970283 its just terrifying how many ambulance services are teetering on the financial brink at any one time
4970284 any of them that are under 1 000 runs a year are probably virtually month to month in terms of whether they are going to have the manpower and the money to continue to operate
4970285 the only two that are bigger in oklahoma are the two emsas in tulsa and oklahoma city they run about 44 000 a year each fully half of our agencies run on fewer than one call a day they make it on volunteerism public subsidy and luck and their luck is running out
4970286 we are hoping we can encourage them oklahoma ambulance services to look at ways to cooperate instead of having their own services
4970287 were going to pray first going to pray for the food
4970288 these kids theyre great they need a lot of love
4970289 this isnt the worst neighborhood but its not the safest
4970290 a lot of the houses are section 8 and state housing people come for a few months and get evicted or theyre in transition from another section 8 house or have a baby and have to get a bigger apartment
4970291 nobody in their right mind is going to say anything
4970292 people tell me michael you shouldnt say anything theyll throw a brick through your window i dont care ill just replace the window as long as they dont hurt my grandchildren
4970293 people just want to be loved thats what this church is doing reaching out to the community letting people know it cares
4970294 vous pouvez voir combien les chevaux se plaisent ici ils sont d tendus
4970295 pour un cheval malade cest le meilleur endroit pour se faire soigner
4970296 but for commercial and closed source platforms its just a black box test
4970297 although there is bad inflation news around there isnt much the bank of england can do it is too late
4970298 we really felt a lot more focused than in athens
4970299 i knew last night after we had our pre race talk that the focus was there we were so much more focused and prepared than we were four years ago
4970300 coming into today i still had the nerves they were hitting me hard but i knew we had done everything that we needed to do to prepare for this race
4970301 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4970302 every time i walk through this place i find something new and ive been through here hundreds of times
4970303 at the elementary level youre not just a math room or a history room youre a classroom that could be used for any number of things
4970304 we have a lot of use by other members of the community
4970305 i think when it came to no child left behind our district had an individualized approach years ago
4970306 there are some things we feel we could do better
4970307 we want to sit down and really look at the test results more carefully and know which areas we need improvement in
4970308 we are very pleased that berkley high school scores improved in nearly every area these gains are directly attributed to data analysis of the scores and targeted interventions as well as staff development and teacher commitment to student achievement
4970309 as with all standardized tests these scores provide us with a measure and benchmark to continuously improve in our commitment to student achievement and success
4970310 because we help these alternative education students complete their high school diplomas after they have fallen behind in a previous high school experience their scores are often lower than our college prep and traditional high schools
4970311 our evaluation of individual scores at ferndale high school and university high school indicate that we are seeing growth consistent with growth across the state with our efforts to increasingly target students beginning in ninth grade concerns we see in our scores will diminish
4970312 i was waiting for the day when somebody else would be able to win a medal in a field event
4970313 all the government offices and services were on alert during the ceremony
4970314 the security plan required thousands of security personnel including more than 2 000 women police workers
4970315 the pilgrims were aware that these measures were for their safety and to protect them from terrorist attacks
4970316 this was the most successful ceremony since the fall of the saddam hussein regime because we did not face any problems as we marched for seven days to reach karbala
4970317 the security measures were in our interest as several pilgrims were attacked while on their way to karbala from baghdad
4970318 i had no fear this year the pilgrimage was successful
4970319 human exploration beyond low earth orbit should be a long term goal and investment for all space faring countries with america in the lead
4970320 work with the space industry to ensure retention of work force and technical capabilities
4970321 a bush program and didnt make a lot of sense
4970322 this will be difficult underfunding by the bush administration has left nasa with limited flexibility to accelerate the development of the new systems
4970323 funding the nasa constellation pro gram to ensure it has the resources it needs to begin a new era of human space exploration
4970324 so that leaves some doors open for hackers and identity thieves of which to take advantage
4970325 combine that potential vulnerability with the fact schools typically have every students social security number and not just current ones but all the ones from years past
4970326 those networks have default passwords that many people never change and most people dont turn on advanced security which can prevent intruders from joining their network
4970327 or maybe they will eavesdrop on the network with something called a sniffer and capture someones e mail or web site passwords the identity thief can then go log in as the victim
4970328 public access computers are definitely use at your own risk because they are open to the public so it is always better to use a personal trusted computer to log into web sites like your bank account
4970329 this great haircut was such a bargain so cheap it should have cost me more
4970330 i was somewhat taken aback yet i stood up because indeed for about a week i had been having some pain on the right side of my chest the cause of which was unclear to me
4970331 marina 101 is a challenging project and we wanted to entrust the construction of this project to a company which has the requisite cutting edge skills and knowledge to complete a project which will be part of one of the unique skyscrapers on dubais skyline we have selected tav construction after an extremely competitive sifting process and strict and diligent scrutiny to get the best in class contractor
4970332 work on the project is on at full swing and we have already completed the casting of the raft we are confident to complete the project with the support of tav construction
4970333 over the years we have earned a reputation in the uae as a construction company which has executed within the assigned time frame many pioneering projects we are glad to have marina 101 in our portfolio because it is a one of its kind project in dubais realty space
4970334 well do what we can for you now but dont trust us if we ever get back into office
4970335 theres no serious research on the value of transfer passengers
4970336 the government had not costed the carbon impact of international inbound flights
4970337 one of the alternatives the tories were looking at was high speed rail
4970338 because what you just told me was 100 accurate but totally worthless
4970339 harry took a fancy to the uniform straight away and asked me how do i get one
4970340 i said you only get one of these if you work in the bar he said i can do any job going
4970341 i said weve got only one job going at the moment and thats as a bouncer on the door and he said thats fine
4970342 harry adores going to lesotho he can just go to a bar for a few beers with his army pals and relax he was so determined to get a t shirt and be a doorman for the evening brian couldnt turn him down
4970343 harry was sitting there wondering who was paying for the next round
4970344 he came up to me and said eh ive got no money just lend me a tenner
4970345 when i was 12 and had crushes on guys id put my first name with their last name but it never sounded right rumer depp nope in school kids would sing rumer rumer with a big hairy tumour
4970346 effective and closely coordinated efforts should be continued for maintaining round the clock movement of essential items to ensure their uninterrupted availability in all areas particularly certain rural areas from where complaints had been received regarding shortages
4970347 its a fresh start hes made the decision he loves me and hes leaving
4970348 a friend has been looking at properties for them to rent and theyve seen one they love its got an 18 month lease and thats a sign of their commitment theyre even talking of buying an afghan hound puppy
4970349 the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale
4970350 on the advice of the cps we shall be taking no further action we will not be commenting further
4970351 but the figures supplied to the tax authorities in no way represent the amount of money earned
4970352 there was no attempt to disguise any activities there was no trafficking or exploitation
4970353 the brothel had well known clients including presenters on tv shows
4970354 others were in the legal political and medical professions it would be very embarrassing for them if their names came out
4970355 tu ne profite pas de ta jeunesse de la vie et tout voil
4970356 pourquoi nam liores tu pas ton q i dhuitres tats unis
4970357 a rise in the value of the renminbi would be unlikely to have much if any effect on aggregate employment in the united states
4970358 the story on trade and jobs in my judgment is a bit more complex especially with respect to china than this strain of conventional wisdom would lead one to believe
4970359 members generally anticipated that an economic performance in line with their expectations would not entirely eliminate currently large margins of unemployed labor and other resources until perhaps the latter part of 2005 or even later
4970360 you see your competitors moving in taking away your work while you look at your screen
4970361 u s textile makers hailed the announcement as a major victory to protect their beleaguered industry while critics warned that the decision would hurt american consumers by raising prices
4970362 they think they might get problems in getting a visa for those students
4970363 that is nonsense but it makes it hard for international students anyway
4970364 you see the price drop on the screen and nothing you can do about that
4970365 u s officials have identified intellectual property rights as an area where the united states could take action against china at the world trade organization
4970366 i was somewhere around lesalle when the truth began to take hold
4970367 little evidence that coffee and or caffeine in typical dosages increases the risk
4970368 it is an important game because i hope to get the answers from the players that i hope to achieve
4970369 i have to check on the form before the qualifiers but experimenting is finished
4970370 i know the players very well now when i started working with the players they were a bit scared and afraid after a lot of players played better its not fear about me but it was soon after not qualifying and for the players it was like an examination or test it is not so
4970371 i think they know me what i ask of them about my style the movement around the pitch they know and its better now the first and second games were different teams and it was hard enough i think they know better because at the end of the season we had ten days together
4970372 when playing with their clubs there is no losing mentality i think if you can train with them every day it is easy to change the mentality with every moment of training with the different work
4970373 i try to transfer the mentality into the national team because you have to play the same spirit that you see in the clubs i saw the games for the european qualifiers the matches at the start of the season like against russia and they played very well and with spirit
4970374 you have to play with that spirit and that mentality i think it is impossible to lose that just because we did not qualify for the european championships in the last four friendlies we have played i have seen one step forward every time towards recovering the mentality
4970375 i think three months ago people never spoke about spain now they are the best team in the world its a miracle
4970376 spain is a very good team they played well but we are different and i think we can win against spain why not im very confident in my team
4970377 i think rooney can be both its possible to play like a second forward and score goals
4970378 he played very well in two games he didnt score but i was very happy with the performance
4970379 you have to play in a different style the other players they have to score more goals
4970380 you have to come in front of the goal with a lot of players
4970381 stay the fuck away from me and dont talk to me
4970382 lifetime value is expressed as the total dollar value of your average customer over the entire period that theyre likely to do business with you
4970383 you can see that theyre developing their skills over time and transferring skills among one another
4970384 its the usual m o where they can go to be anonymous and help each other further their activity
4970385 its not just that theyre selling the information but if you go on these message boards its how to do compromises and giving advice its the criminals playground
4970386 i guess but theres no diplomas coming out of there
4970387 theres no evidence that any of these people had phds
4970388 dugrenier fought super hard she put everything shes got into it were so proud of her it was a character test and she lasted but it wasnt an easy match i know the japanese contingent are walking out of here thinking we dodged a huge bullet
4970389 were going to have to go through another war in the bronze medal match
4970390 were going to see how long the strong dollar weak commodities trade continues i think personally were going to have a snoozer
4970391 the economic data calendar is not robust i think the biggest driver in this market is going to be oil
4970392 i think the market has a path of least resistance thats higher and i think thats dictated by the fact we see lower commodities prices and a stronger dollar there is a limit to that trade but im not sure were close to it
4970393 were in this 0 to 2 percent real growth rate economy and i think the markets going to frustrate the bulls and the bears
4970394 the main story is whether the russian tanks roll back or are they going to roll forward thats the bigger story than any economic news we have on the docket most of the economic news is third tier and a lot of the large players are off their desks
4970395 if the situation does not resolve itself you could see the euro push all the way to 1 45 1 45 is one of the key levels once it gets close to this level it gets very tempting for speculators to run the stops
4970396 the larger implication is we might be moving into a new era a second cold war that could cripple globalization theres an interdependency of everybody in the globe that didnt exist 20 years ago this is a lot trickier than a lot of things weve had to deal with over the last couple years
4970397 i think its in a consolidation and its going to move higher next week
4970398 as the 19th century came to a close the american electorate changed more and more rapidly
4970399 to me it looks like what i would picture europe after world war ii
4970400 across the street a business just went out of business
4970401 i dont want to see that deterioration start back into our downtown
4970402 as long as its zoned properly which i think it is as long as they keep it up properly which as far as i can see they are the owner has the right to do with it what he wants
4970403 first of all i think there should be green space
4970404 hopefully down the road in two or three years possibly a building with apartments on top and merchandising retail on the bottom
4970405 the process of crafting your own piece of furniture is fundamental to the attitude of foldschool
4970406 si javance suivez moi si je recule tuez moi si je meurs vengez moi
4970407 ronald gregory the ex chief constable of west yorkshire police is
4970408 we can get money in another way and not sell our souls to outsiders or foreign companies
4970409 ronald gregory the ex chief constable of west yorkshire police is
4970410 im letting our clients know that this year we all need to think ahead to february things are going to be a little tighter and all of us have to begin preparing now for the winter
4970411 we think we could be hearing from folks who never asked for help before
4970412 our appointments are already booked to the end of september and thats just for people who use heating oil
4970413 people need to remember that these programs were designed as supplements to help them pay for fuel but not to pay all of the bills
4970414 were telling people to try to start setting aside a little money now
4970415 the people im worried about are some working families that never needed help before with the cost of food and gas and oil theyre finding they just cant make it anymore
4970416 attention si tu nes pas daccord avec ce monde la reine te fera oublier des mots
4970417 me le donnerais tu dit la fermi re hutu contre une g terie
4970418 month after month for more than three years florida has created more jobs than any other state in the union
4970419 were taking care of all the areas kids need to be ready for school
4970420 when a service is available to those who need it theyll turn out no matter the conditions
4970421 i wouldve had to take time off so this prevents me from losing a day of work
4970422 theyre nice people and they make it easy and quick
4970423 none of us want a special session right now on property taxes
4970424 you couldnt get a special session in the florida legislature right now if you paid every one of them 1 000
4970425 theres only so much state government can do lets be honest
4970426 i am an honest person and a person of integrity who will do what he says i believe in keeping my word i had a good quality of life growing up in florida and i want to provide the same for the families of this district
4970427 i want to use the talents and skills ive developed through the years and help in any way i can i feel i have the experience and the vision to do a good job for my constituents
4970428 ive already demonstrated the leadership needed for this community ive hosted crime summits community forums and job fairs as vice chairman of the volusia county metropolitan planning organization im familiar with other issues facing other cities
4970429 when you have this anti incumbent mood when everybodys mad at government at all levels people tend to think i can do just as well as they can and they offer themselves up
4970430 weve been impacted by the seminoles but we expected that in the first couple of months they began operation
4970431 theres going to be a turnaround where people come back and say i dont like it there
4970432 from our perspective it comes down to marketing to reach them
4970433 they dont deal like they want to beat you here
4970434 they deal like they want to you to win so they can get tips
4970435 theres a comforting feeling that you have on the princess
4970436 if i lived closer to the hard rock id just go to the hard rock
4970437 were a strong locals market and were catering to that
4970438 i invested everything i had in my retirement and now im stuck with a big payment and an apartment thats no good
4970439 some people want to get rich fast weve been saving 20 years and we wanted to do something wisely and plan on our retirement its really sad
4970440 do we walk away from all these units or do we sit with a vacant unit that requires loan payments association fees taxes and insurance
4970441 youve seen some of these investors walk away from the property
4970442 when investors cant get someone to live in the property and cover the mortgage then youve got the association assessments not being paid and they wont be paid when the bank forecloses
4970443 builders have made it more difficult for investors to buy because they are also trying to build a community that sustains its values and what they need is people living in the houses
4970444 its very sad when people come in and say we put down a large deposit and now through no fault of our own were being evicted
4970445 quite frankly right now you dont know who to trust in florida
4970446 she appears to be promising an unattainable objective without much thought to the budget squeeze were in
4970447 i would not put faith in any economic plan written by campaign consultants
4970448 we have to make bold decisions on how we get there
4970449 its not the time to stop spending its time to re prioritize spending
4970450 shes a wise leader for recognizing that public safety is a priority
4970451 i have seven years experience having served on the citizens advisory board and then elected to my current term with my background in finance i helped the board save money
4970452 were negotiating to buy a piece of property to build a clinic and well get that clinic running full steam
4970453 in business as well as in my personal life i collect information and use it to make sound decisions and i help others do the same im a good listener and a fast learner who cares about what other people think
4970454 we need to build public awareness of the authoritys activities we need to build awareness of the new federally qualified health centers for those who need their services i would recommend that the authority create a web site and other low cost high impact means of communicating with our constituents
4970455 as an advocate for the people i see my role as working for better treatment for the uninsured as well as affordable health care for the underinsured
4970456 more affordable facilities are needed by focusing on building clinics for equal and fair treatment of the residents clinics will free the hospital er from the day to day care for patients with nonemergency illness
4970457 after watching some of the chaos at some of the meetings and watching the way the board appears to be directed by staff rather than the other way around i have reversed my position i was against it i am now for it
4970458 the budget is the key and its going to be the biggest issue
4970459 how to balance the budget and still be the top producer of students in the nation is going to be hard and we have to explain how hard that is going to be if we have a disgruntled electorate that will be even harder to do
4970460 but for every three reasons why not i can think of three reasons why
4970461 has a heart for children and wants to make a difference
4970462 my main issue of course is having the community buy into the system and its leaders would be more responsive to the public and business community
4970463 the community would see a cheerleader who is out there building relationships and who would not be dictating educational policy
4970464 this is not the time to add more salaries when were trying to cut the budget
4970465 for me its not politics its a sense of urgency
4970466 we have kids dropping out of school and giving up on their education because of the fear of the fcat and because they find school boring
4970467 da quando il governo federale ha cominciato a far diventare le scuole zone senza pistole sono cominciate le sparatorie perch non dobbiamo essere messi in condizioni di difenderci
4970468 the disposal of human wastes is a subject normally buried in euphemism and avoidance at least in public privately every single person on the planet is intimately concerned on a day to day even hour to hour basis with the need to relieve themselves in a congenial place and fashion the physiological necessity of excretion cannot be averted even if it cannot be spoken of no one can attain the purity of the perfect saint who manages to digest every single thing he or she consumes a power that certain holy men in the ancient world were believed to possess even the most rigid toilet training can enable a person to postpone their visits to the rest room only for a certain length of time every day each human being emits an average of slightly less than 100 grams of feces and roughly one and a half litres of urine even though this regular process of bodily evacuation may not be thought of as dishonourable and base a phrase from victorian england it is nonetheless regarded as noxious and unmentionable by most of the human race this is an unspoken subject in almost every culture except in the context of ribaldry and scatological humour the organs of defecation are close to or identified with those used for sex another delicate subject the subspecies of engineers who preoccupy themselves with mire are viewed askance as if they were mildly touched and in the uk plumbers earn more than other kinds of household fixers because of bravery in the face of ordure the very word toilet at least upon the anglo saxon tongue has an awkward and embarrassed ring and its use is often regarded as vulgar that there is a worldwide sanitary crisis is indisputable over 40 per cent of people in the developing world still depend on a bucket a bush the banks of a stream a backstreet or some other sheltered place for their several daily emissions
4970469 why does this remarkable species devise a vastly laborious and time consuming system for channeling its piss and shite into its water supply and then expend equally vast amounts of time and effort on partly removing its piss and shite from its water supply
4970470 are the males of this species addicted to kinky sexual practices such as drinking girls piss if so they should just go to a prostitute or broach the subject of piss drinking with their wives its a bad mistake on their part because for one thing the female hormones from the contraceptive pill are being excreted in girls piss into the water supply via the flush toilet then the men are drinking recycled girls piss when they turn on the tap and the female hormones in the water supply are making the men of this species infertile and making them grow breasts

4970500 es ist nicht zu fassen dass wir jetzt zwei grand prix sieger in der familie haben
4970501 es war ein schwieriges rennen im training hatten wir viele probleme aber im warmup lief es viel besser und der start war auch sehr gut ich gab wirklich alles ging in f hrung und kontrollierte dann den abstand die letzten f nf runden waren am schwierigsten und ich musste mich sehr konzentrieren denn in f hrung liegend denkt man sonst zu viel nach
4970502 ich habe versucht ihn noch einzuholen aber er war einfach zu schnell und ich wollte keinen unfall riskieren
4970503 wir haben hart gek mpft daher war es uns unm glich bradl noch ein oder berzuholen
4970504 hanno dei fucili e cacciano molto noioso allevano anche delle galline il loro solo interesse tu cerchi delle galline
4970505 una cosa da molto dimenticata vuol dire creare dei legami
4970506 tu fino ad ora per me non sei che un ragazzino uguale a centomila ragazzini e non ho bisogno di te e neppure tu hai bisogno di me io non sono per te che una volpe uguale a centomila volpi ma se tu mi addomestichi noi avremo bisogno luno dellaltro tu sarai per me unico al mondo e io sar per te unica al mondo
4970507 la mia vita monotona io do la caccia alle galline e gli uomini danno la caccia a me tutte le galline si assomigliano e tutti gli uomini si assomigliano e io mi annoio perci ma se tu mi addomestichi la mia vita sar come illuminata conoscer un rumore di passi che sar diverso da tutti gli altri gli altri passi mi faranno nascondere sotto terra il tuo mi far uscire dalla tana come una musica e poi guarda vedi laggi in fondo dei campi di grano io non mangio il pane e il grano per me inutile i campi di grano non mi ricordano nulla e questo triste ma tu hai dei capelli color delloro allora sar meraviglioso quando mi avrai addomesticata il grano che dorato mi far pensare a te e amer il rumore del vento nel grano
4970508 ma non ho molto tempo per ho da scoprire degli amici e da conoscere molte cose
4970509 gli uomini non hanno pi tempo per conoscere nulla comprano dai mercanti le cose gi fatte ma siccome non esistono mercanti di amici gli uomini non hanno pi amici se tu vuoi un amico addomesticami
4970510 in principio tu ti siederai un po lontano da me cos nellerba io ti guarder con la coda dellocchio e tu non dirai nulla le parole sono una fonte di malintesi ma ogni giorno tu potrai sederti un po pi vicino
4970511 se tu vieni per esempio tutti i pomeriggi alle quattro dalle tre io comincer ad essere felice col passare dellora aumenter la mia felicit quando saranno le quattro incomincer ad agitarmi e ad inquietarmi scoprir il prezzo della felicit ma se tu vieni non si sa quando io non sapr mai a che ora prepararmi il cuore ci vogliono i riti
4970512 quello che fa un giorno diverso dagli altri giorni unora dalle altre ore c un rito per esempio presso i miei cacciatori il gioved ballano con le ragazze del villaggio allora il gioved un giorno meraviglioso io mi spingo sino alla vigna se i cacciatori ballassero in un giorno qualsiasi i giorni si assomiglierebbero tutti e non avrei mai vacanza
4970513 io non ti volevo far del male ma tu hai voluto che ti addomesticassi
4970514 va a rivedere le rose capirai che la tua unica al mondo quando ritornerai a dirmi addio ti regaler un segreto
4970515 voi non siete per niente simili alla mia rosa voi non siete ancora niente
4970516 nessuno vi ha addomesticato e voi non avete addomesticato nessuno voi siete come era la mia volpe non era che una volpe uguale a centomila altre ma ne ho fatto il mio amico ed ora per me unica al mondo
4970517 non si pu morire per voi certamente un qualsiasi passante crederebbe che la mia rosa vi rassomigli ma lei lei sola pi importante di tutte voi perch lei che io ho innaffiata perch e lei che ho riparata col paravento perch su di lei ho uccisi i bruchi salvo i due o tre per le farfalle perch lei che ho ascoltato lamentarsi o vantarsi o anche qualche volta tacere perch la mia rosa
4970518 ecco il mio segreto molto semplice non si vede bene che col cuore lessenziale invisibile agli occhi
4970519 il tempo che tu hai perduto per la tua rosa che ha fatto la tua rosa cos importante
4970520 gli uomini hanno dimenticato questa verit ma tu non la devi dimenticare tu diventi responsabile per sempre di quello che hai addomesticato tu sei responsabile della tua rosa
4970521 schade dass es nicht ganz gereicht hat aber ich habe noch zwei finals und bleibe deshalb positiv und optimistisch
4970522 10 antithetical traits often present in creative people that are integrated with each other in a dialectical tension
4970523 ich hatte am start durchdrehende r der und verlor gleich zwei pl tze die ich mir in der folge wieder zur ckholen konnte
4970524 ansonsten war es ein frustrierendes rennen f r mich ich hatte im verlauf der 24 runden keine chance weitere vor mir liegende konkurrenten zu berholen
4970525 der start war wesentlich besser ich konnte zwei pl tze gutmachen und der zeitr ckstand auf den sieger hat sich gegen ber dem ersten rennen um 10 sekunden vermindert trotzdem hat der wagen wieder bersteuert
4970526 ich hoffe dass wir dieses problem endlich in den griff bekommen

4970531 its a little different than punt return but you just have to go out there and use your vision and hopefully the guys up front will open up a hole and the guys did that tonight and made it easy
4970532 whenever you can break tackles and get yards after contact its big and can help the team
4970533 obviously its an opportunity to get on the field and make plays
4970534 id be more than welcome to do it but we have some great guys with blackmon and who can do it as well im just going to go out keep doing my job and see what happens
4970535 you cant color it and put it in any other light we flat out stunk and from an offensive standpoint theres nothing you can say we flat out were no good
4970536 i had a lot of family and friends here and didnt give them a lot to cheer about thats going to happen sometimes its how your respond to the situation and as an offense we have to respond we have to play a lot better next week
4970537 we need to be honest in our critiques of the film im going to be brutally honest with myself i know i didnt play well tonight and we have to improve
4970538 this is an excellent opportunity for our team to learn from this and ill take full advantage of this opportunity for our football team to learn from this whether its the quarterback free safety defensive linemen throughout our football team
4970539 we need to find that rhythm and figure out what our identity is going to be
4970540 is it going to be spreading teams out is it going to be running the football we just need to get healthy and hopefully have a better performance next week
4970541 i think we were all on different pages and we just have to go and correct it you get knocked down but you have to keep getting up its preseason we fix it and we go on from there
4970542 we didnt get it done on first and second down we allowed them to bring a lot of pressure and we didnt pick up the pressure so they continued to bring it
4970543 no excuses they were more physical than us they outhit us they out played us and when we watch the film itll show
4970544 this is not what we feel we have as far as this team is concerned

4970554 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4970555 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4970556 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4970557 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4970558 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4970559 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4970560 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4970561 nooglers and the pdb reactor ben darnell september 6 2007
4970562 all the generic ballot questions in the polls show voters want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want obama
4970563 he hasnt closed the sale every historical fact says he should be farther ahead than he is
4970564 obama lost the summer and part of it was he got arrogant and overreached he started talking about transition planning and going to all these red states like montana where he has no chance
4970565 a lot of americans were left scratching their heads thinking why isnt he talking to me
4970566 if he wants to win mccain has no choice but to go negative on obama
4970567 the fight is for the independents about 20 percent of the electorate
4970568 for mccain its the ties to bush and the desire for change and its obamas age inexperience and race theres enough to give people pause with each of them
4970569 i think weve dealt well with what has been thrown at us and made the most of the situation
4970570 it came down to great force and a gutsy performance unfortunately it wasnt quite there to beat them
4970571 im disappointed i thought we had the canadians but it turns out that we didnt have enough left in the tank
4970572 we were out there racing for the gold but silver is still amazing
4970573 its a very different experience being out there at the top rather than at the bottom
4970574 pretty radical but we think it makes the most sense
4970575 theyre proposing some pretty innovative and in some cases difficult things to do
4970576 its too early for me to predict how this is going to be received
4970577 anything is possible if you have enough money to do it
4970578 we just cant tweak our way out of this flooding
4970579 we were shocked by the volumes of water coming out of this watershed
4970580 and the success or failure of such an effort really depends upon whether you can get all the stakeholders to agree if there is not a consensus on how to proceed something like this could be held up at many stages
4970581 he has done many many terrible things he blew up the french plane and he blew up the american plane and what does the bush administration do the bush administration is far more on the side of the libyans than it is as far as the victims of terrorism go though it talks a good line about caring about terrorism if they can make friends with moammar gadhafi because they want his oil then that tells you where they stand
4970582 its really sickening and its really dirty they are being very private and secretive about it
4970583 the settlement goes to both sides the settlement is for outstanding claims on the part of libya as well as the united states
4970584 i dont have any information on that but it has been established i have no information on what the financial agreement will be or the financial compensation that will be paid
4970585 condoleezza rice is going to libya to kiss gadhafis feet
4970586 so this is what has come he blew up an american plane and i am supposed to have faith in the government of this country
4970587 we went through a long path of negotiations until we reached this agreement
4970588 it opens new horizons for relations based on mutual respect the agreement turns the page on the negative past forever
4970589 this is done after the murder of my innocent daughter and 270 people killed
4970590 gadhafi was the one who was behind the attack on that disco and reagan responded does that mean the republican administration is saying that ronald reagan and gadhafi are equivalent terrorists
4970591 a country that respects international rules can obtain civilian nuclear energy
4970592 nuclear power is the energy of the future if we do not give the energy of the future to the countries of the southern mediterranean how will they develop themselves and if they do not develop how will we fight terrorism and fanaticism
4970593 some say it is supposed to send a message to the iranians as far as i can see the message is that it worked because they had direct talks with the libyans
4970594 this agreement will pave the way for saudi arabias access to safe reliable fuel sources for energy reactors and demonstrate saudi leadership as a positive nonproliferation model for the region

4970605 hes always been friendly but as youd expect he has what i call a healthy scepticism about me i think any father would if their daughter got married the way we did
4970606 im terrified of meeting him face to face but thats going to happen soon its all been arranged
4970607 sir bob is nowhere near as well known in the us as he is in the uk i understand hes a real legend but i dont know much about him
4970608 john mccain has supporters but barack obama has believers and i think that makes a difference
4970609 i wouldnt necessarily call new jersey in play but at the same time were not going to take any votes for granted
4970610 shes been in political campaigns on every single level shes been on the national scene with the carpenters so its not foreign to her what she has to do here
4970611 if they truly believe that new jersey was not in play if they truly believe that this was a gimme they would not have put tricia mueller in charge
4970612 i think new jersey voters expect candidates to come ask for their votes
4970613 democrats at the end of the day will all be there
4970614 they might not be rushing toward the finish line but theyll be there
4970615 hasnt been there this voting bloc just needs to be educated
4970616 it will be the philosophy of our team here in new jersey to run like were 14 points behind
4970617 i think thats the way you need to approach any campaign
4970618 since ive become speaker my flagship issue has been energy security and addressing the global climate crisis
4970619 energy independence is a national security economic environmental health and moral issue
4970620 the notion that oil companies are just sitting on oil leases is a myth
4970621 any measure that reduces oil firms margins in america is likely to have the effect of diverting at least some investment to other countries and so exacerbate the shortage of fuel produced at home
4970622 america has only 1 6 percent of the worlds oil supply but we use 24 percent so drilling isnt much of a solution at all
4970623 equivalent of 30 years of current imports from saudi arabia
4970624 the planet is gods creation and we have a moral responsibility to preserve it
4970625 natural seepage from the sea floor is a much larger source of oil in american waters than is offshore drilling
4970626 america can achieve true greatness when we work together to make certain that every voice in america is a voice that will be heard
4970627 each candidate is carefully pandering to a smorgasbord of special interest groups ranging from gay lesbian and transgender people to children of illegal immigrants to working mothers to evangelical christians
4970628 there is one group no one has recognized and it is the group that will decide the election the angry white man the angry white man comes from all economic backgrounds from dirt poor to filthy rich he represents all geographic areas in america from urban sophisticate to rural redneck deep south to mountain west left coast to eastern seaboard
4970629 weve had comments from angry brown men a filipino american chippewa indians black men and lots of angry white women
4970630 so i really did strike a chord and i guess it is that people feel like theyre not being listened to by our government people want some fiscal sanity they dont want people to just stand there with their hands out and be given something for doing nothing there are a lot of people who feel like theyre pulling the freight for the rest of the country and theyre sick of it
4970631 i suppose so tepidly he was all wrong on immigration but hes right on national defense environmentally hes got to be more proactive than bush was no one could be worse than bush
4970632 i think people are supporting him out of emotion rather than a rational analysis of his policies
4970633 if you want more taxes on people who really make this country run working americans to support yet another generation of sit on your butt and collect a check slackers then obamas your man
4970634 the members of this cult who were more than twice her age were calling the shots
4970635 it fits the profile of a classic cult in the sense that its a personality driven group and that queen antoinette is that animating personality and central defining element of the group
4970636 with a passion for life a strong woman caught up in the torrent of historical turmoil and drowned
4970637 he could have testified but he just flew back stateside to his american family
4970638 we all knew he slept in the house many times the baby looks like the father
4970639 the south korean police and prosecutors hated her because she was the lover of lee gang kook and then of col baird and nobody could touch her they waited for their chance
4970640 the first thing they say when they visit is can we go downstairs
4970641 something you dont have yet and you figure youd like to add it to your collection
4970642 it fits my fancy if its beat up really old and rusted i need to have that
4970643 this was really bad once and he took it all apart and painted the back it was hard for him to do
4970644 when we were dating i used to stop by the candy store and they had gum ball machines with little trinkets and i would bring them to her and she saved them all

4970660 i used to be one of this ships shining stars tipped to one day possibly be captain how is it that ive been relegated to lifeboat number 4
4970661 my friend you like everyone else aboard this ship are valuable but the truth is i need young fresh faced enthusiastic people the most
4970662 besides your presence tends to remind everyone of that disaster back in 02 when we were in the seychelles not good for morale
4970663 the advertising campaign concept was based on the fact that the actor has roots
4970664 if there is anything i am lacking in it is taste in music and art and other great things in life
4970665 when some people said its not possible and it cant be done i think thats when my imagination came into play
4970666 and i thought i had a chance to do it coach bob bowman and i talked about it and we were able to get here through a lot of hard work its been fun
4970667 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4970668 hes not from another planet he from the future his father made him and made a time machine sixty years from now hes just an average swimmer but he has come back to this time to mop up
4970669 he is the greatest sportsman ever to walk the planet
4970670 just a normal person but he is maybe from a different planet a planet from a different galaxy
4970671 he doesnt want to just beat you he wants to destroy you
4970672 well never really know the answer to questions like that
4970673 but however you rank them michael cant be far down the list
4970674 there is no historical precedent for what he has accomplished how he is accomplishing it his body of work you have at once a supremely gifted athlete with a willingness to endure unmatched levels of preparation plus hes a fantastic competitor mentally tough and someone who appears to get even better in the face of a tough challenge
4970675 i think hes undisputedly the greatest swimmer of all time
4970676 hes stratospheric in technical terms and in terms of mental preparation ive never seen anyone like him
4970677 i hate to compare swimmers to players in the nba or nfl
4970678 but i will say that theres nobody in any sport that can win like he wins hes not just winning hes crunching world records and crunching the field
4970679 we are breaking records that are 20 30 and nearly 50 years old
4970680 whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4970681 some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy
4970682 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich
4970683 i dont want to raise anybodys taxes i really dont
4970684 if youre just talking about income how about five million
4970685 theyre similar enough for us to say to a neighborhood to be aware
4970686 at first glance he doesnt look like the other perpetrator
4970687 before we just had to worry about gunshots in the day now we have to worry about going to sleep
4970688 i feel like getting some kind of protection for myself from now on
4970689 we really wish theyd recognize whats happened in other states
4970690 is really not going to cut into the lcbs profitability or revenue
4970691 the question you as legislators must ask yourself is whether it is a wise policy to create or perpetuate an unregulated unaccountable non face to face channel of access for our kids
4970692 we do not believe the direct ship program has had a negative impact on revenues
4970693 both a regulatory challenge and concern however we have not found these two issues to be of significant negative consequence
4970694 not done the research on what other states are doing
4970695 it is a state we will be looking at but it is only about the size of allegheny county so theyre operating on a much smaller scale
4970696 dogs who live in this type of kennel are valued only for the sale price of their offspring
4970697 would shoot the dogs rather than pay for vet care
4970698 the warden said to them that if they would like to surrender dogs we would make arrangements with the animal rescue league to surrender those dogs
4970699 there are all kinds of ways to euthanize an animal a bullet to the head is instantaneous
4970700 she was destined to spend her life in a small cage and give birth to litter after litter until she was 8 or 9 and be discarded or shot like the dogs in berks county
4970701 to think nothing could happen to the people who did that is a disgrace
4970702 i wish i had this training when i was there before
4970703 it helps take away the enemys advantage on us i know what i am looking for now
4970704 we give them the ability to think like the enemy
4970705 we can now see if anybody has been there and if we are being tracked
4970706 we lost our moral high ground and set a precedent that invites any country on earth to do exactly the same thing
4970707 i find it no different than selling a picture that say my brother drew
4970708 hopefully romance im an extremely sensitive man falsely accused and serving a life sentence behind these prison walls
4970709 a weaver who has to direct and to interweave a great many little threads has no time to philosophize about it rather he is so absorbed in his work that he doesnt think he acts and its nothing he can explain he just feels how things should go

4970712 its a first game of the season and we had a physical match on the wednesday night and i was a little bit worried before that we would not be very sharp but we started well and were in control and we just couldnt finish them off
4970713 you have that old story that you feel you probably deserved to be punished in the end but i am pleased we did not let in a goal
4970714 when everybody is here we can create more clear cut chances because here the final ball was not good enough but overall it has been a good week for us
4970715 is a trophy to finish 12 and win the carling cup not for me
4970716 you see the quality of a team after 38 games
4970717 in the carling cup or the fa cup you play five games and the final and could be drawn against second division teams but you have no quality and are not there at the end of the championship
4970718 for me when youre in a big club the important thing is that you are fighting for the title if you dont win it of course you are frustrated
4970719 we were very close to doing it last season and were the most unlucky team with so many bad injuries we finished with 83 points last season lost only three games and we have stability in our club which allows us to feel we will be better this year
4970720 delight exercise care for himself go to town and gurut grant anything in the background

4970722 i saw that there was a void when i when to congress so i started participating to get a good handle on what strategies and what policies the united states should mount
4970723 when i was in toronto it dawned on me that we should have one of these great conferences in my district in oakland then someone reminded me you cant do that barbara theres a travel ban so i went back to congress wrote and introduced a resolution that would lift the travel ban im proud to say that in the pepfar bill that president bush signed into law that travel ban was repealed now we need to implement the regulations which were working on
4970724 that is something that was left out of pepfar and we couldnt negotiate it with the other side hopefully when there is another president we can go back to the drawing board and fix that its absolutely essential that we have coordination between hiv aids initiatives and family planning i want to repeal the global gag rule that does not allow organizations to receive federal funding to provide full reproductive health counseling including abortion counseling it is a shame and disgrace and does a disservice to women harming millions of women throughout the world
4970725 theres been a severe undercount the black aids institute knew this i knew this members of congress knew this bai is calling for a domestic pepfar and i fully agree with them they want 1 3 billion to begin i think we need billions and billions and billions more
4970726 the responsible education about life real act be for real thats my bill has more than 100 co sponsors that bill would in essence allow states to use federal funding to teach comprehensive sex education in public schools to teach young people how to prevent the transmission of hiv and aids and also how to prevent unwanted pregnancies its got to happen
4970727 please dont do this to me i cant think of two things at once
4970728 im pleased we were able to keep the produce center not just in terms of jobs but because we are a food capital of america
4970729 create an environment of trust and prevent any disruptive actions by the enemy
4970730 i just remember there was a chase scene in the forest
4970731 but we are not without a savior jesus christ has come and he is a great savior every need we have he supplies and his death on the cross is the price that purchases every gift that leads to deep and lasting joy
4970732 hed been heckling me when i went to pick up an award shouting duffo up the duffy things like that nice
4970733 when i picked up the award i had to walk past him so i went to say hi and suddenly he had me pinned against the wall i just went white and had to get away

4970751 man does not live by bread alone but by all that comes out of gods mouth
4970752 only that you remain in awe of god your lord so that you will follow all his paths and love him serving god your lord with all your heart and with all your soul you must keep gods commandments and decrees so that all good will be yours

4970769 we never can comprehend the things of god and of heaven but by revelation we may spiritualize and express opinions to all eternity but that is no authority
4970770 the doctrine of revelation far transcends the doctrine of no revelation for one truth revealed from heaven is worth all the sectarian notions in existence
4970771 salvation cannot come without revelation it is in vain for anyone to minister without it no man can be a minister of jesus christ except he has the testimony of jesus and this is the spirit of prophecy
4970772 we are differently situated from any other people that ever existed upon this earth consequently those former revelations cannot be suited to our conditions they were given to other people who were before us
4970773 we believe all that god has revealed all that he does now reveal and we believe that he will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the kingdom of god
4970774 the president then gave a relation of obtaining and translating the book of mormon the revelation of the priesthood of aaron the organization of the church in 1830 the revelation of the high priesthood and the gift of the holy ghost poured out upon the church and said take away the book of mormon and the revelations and where is our religion

4970789 what happened was the designers came up with this really great idea then they take it to the engineers and the engineers go nah we cant do that thats impossible and so it gets a lot worse then they take it to the manufacturing people and they go we cant build that and it gets a lot worse

4970814 avevamo paura che la russia ci mandasse a casa con una medaglia di legno dice montano la finale per il bronzo quasi pi stressante di quella per loro perch se perdi non ti rimane niente e stata una grande gara tirata appassionante con la vittoria in rimonta contro un grande avversario alla fine stato bello nonostante il rammarico di non aver potuto competere per loro
4970815 ce lavevo dentro quando mi hanno chiesto se me la sentissi di dare una mano non ho avuto bisogno neanche di rispondere dice mentre montano passando urla
4970816 forse vista come andata la finale per il bronzo ammette montano schierando pastore anche in semifinale avremmo potuto ottenere qualcosa in pi ma siamo una squadra e la logica quella di una staffetta dove chiunque pu avere un passaggio a vuoto senza doversi prendere delle colpe

4970837 our concern is that this is in strong contrast to what was recommended to us
4970838 its important that responsible development be applied you can get the golden egg and kill the goose that laid it in the process we want to make sure that beautiful northwest guilford county is preserved
4970839 traffic is already a big issue on 68 edgefield and pleasant ridge roads plus were worried about northwest schools already being overcrowded and clear cutting of trees to build
4970840 our hope is to have the area treated like oak ridge rather than treated like high point
4970841 why do they need to develop more in our area when there is already plenty of space available elsewhere all within minutes of the airport
4970842 what we felt were compromise conditions they really didnt meet any of them except what they would have had to meet anyway we are extremely disappointed with their lack of earnest compromise
4970843 what happens here will set the bar on what happens in this area in the next few years

4970857 once student enrollment settles often this is not until a week or two into the school year i will examine our needs as a total school facility and make decisions regarding how the mobile units can best accommodate these needs
4970858 although i am very pleased to hear him listening to those around him i saw several quotes from school board members and parents who praised him for saying i dont know and not having a ready made plan
4970859 personally im all for a ready made plan that includes giving back more power to teachers and principals incorporating the community in the schools finding ulterior means for educating students more interested in disrupting schools than planning for their future preventing and not merely handling violence in schools and bringing back skill classes like shop keyboarding and home ec for students not on a traditional college track
4970860 while it was nice to hear that mr green didnt think he had all the answers i would have been more confident if he had a firm vision of direction for guilford county schools
4970861 hopefully this will come after his 100 days of listening mr green will have to stand up and be a leader and hold people accountable
4970862 i think his lack of specifics and plans may be his greatest strength
4970863 mr greens biggest challenge will be to overcome the morale and intimidation issues and the lack of trust that the grier years have heaped upon our teachers

4970869 the iraqi people the resistance and oil versus american bases
4970870 the deaths of two u s soldiers in western baghdad last week have sparked concerns that iraqi insurgents have developed a new weapon capable of striking what the u s military considers its most explosive resistant vehicle the soldiers were riding in a mine resistant ambush protective vehicle known as an mrap when an explosion sent a blast of super heated metal through the mraps armor and into the vehicle killing them both their deaths brought to eight the number of american troops killed while riding in an mrap which was developed and deployed to iraq last year after years of acrimony over light armor on the armys workhorse vehicle the humvee the pentagon has set aside 5 4 billion to acquire 4 000 mraps but last wednesdays attack has shown that the mraps are vulnerable to an especially potent form of ied known as an efp for explosively formed penetrator which fires a superheated cone of metal through the vehicles armor

4970875 he deserves every ounce of respect and admiration and attention that he gets because what hes doing is incredibly phenomenal
4970876 being his teammate for so many years you get desensitized to how amazing he is i think many years down the road me and the other members of the team will realize what an incredible performance he put on for everybody here
4970877 i mean its something im incredibly proud of but it was never a goal of mine to be the most decorated female swimmer or anything like that im very happy with the six medals i have hopefully ill get some more in london
4970878 to enjoy all these places that ive been to for swim meets and never seen anything but the pool and hotel
4970879 i think i forced myself to get back in too early after athens
4970880 i had a real lack of motivation the first practice i want to be excited about by staying physically in good shape and staying away from competition i think ill shoot back fast
4970881 ive got my wedding coming up so i want to be in good shape
4970882 it took a lot of pressure off me for the rest of the meet
4970883 i remember leaving athens i was like wow i dont remember that
4970884 i was just overwhelmed with the entire experience i think that gave me a bit of an advantage this time i did make a conscious effort to stay present in the moment
4970885 for the final you need to go all out and if the pain cant effectively be eased it will definitely have an effect

4970888 being his teammate for so many years you get desensitized to how amazing he is i think many years down the road me and the other members of the team will realize what an incredible performance he put on for everybody here
4970889 i mean its something im incredibly proud of but it was never a goal of mine to be the most decorated female swimmer or anything like that im very happy with the six medals i have hopefully ill get some more in london
4970890 to enjoy all these places that ive been to for swim meets and never seen anything but the pool and hotel
4970891 i think i forced myself to get back in too early after athens
4970892 i had a real lack of motivation the first practice i want to be excited about by staying physically in good shape and staying away from competition i think ill shoot back fast
4970893 ive got my wedding come up so i want to be in good shape
4970894 it took a lot of pressure off me for the rest of the meet
4970895 i remember leaving athens i was like wow i dont remember that
4970896 i was just overwhelmed with the entire experience i think that gave me a bit of an advantage this time i did make a conscious effort to stay present in the moment
4970897 for the final you need to go all out and if the pain cant effectively be eased it will definitely have an effect
4970898 everyones buzzing they the players dont think we can get beat by anyone
4970899 we are really provoked and motivated to bring home that gold
4970900 we are not far from it two games more and hopefully we can do it
4970901 the 1996 olympics was such a big event for nigeria
4970902 i watched those games like 10 times even after the tournament i had recordings of them and used to play them often
4970903 i dont believe that actually myself i am so close to it if i get that medal i dont know how ill feel but definitely it is going to be a great feeling
4970904 theres hope from our country and other african countries hoping that we can go and make africa proud
4970905 even when we beat the ivory coast they were saying good luck to us hoping that we can go on and win this
4970906 it would be nice if an african team can win it but there are other teams in this tournament south americans as well so its going to be tough really tough
4970907 now my boyfriend will understand why i didnt spend so much time with him last year
4970908 it doesnt really matter who gets in the new president is in for a very hard time it doesnt take too many more hundreds of billions in bailouts to be more than the taxpayers can handle
4970909 private industry is where the innovations need to come from
4970910 obama is a great talker but can he lead congress into the right moves to salvage the economy
4970911 no matter who wins the november election the economy will not improve overnight
4970912 we must find a way for the national government as well as state and local government to cut out the wasteful spending bring jobs back to america and find alternative energy sources
4970913 i do not like the war stance of mccain but have economic issues with more government programs and other democrat obama economics
4970914 more government in our lives and erode freedoms plus we know what happens to programs run by the government
4970915 it appears that the past eight years have resulted in one of the worst economies in decades the highest deficit severely damaged international reputation and the lowest support for womens rights since the 1970s
4970916 a positive but short lived effect on our countrys economy
4970917 i have been a grocery shopper for 50 years and i am dismayed at how much prices are rising
4970918 something must be done and soon and i am not sure a new president is the answer i keep listening to mccain and obamas plans to help our economy but wonder just how much they can do
4970919 the meeting was an effort to get feedback from neighbors
4970920 it was an effort to get input on our plan in a collaborative manner
4970921 it is important that we try to address the concerns of our neighbors the community and the town of summerfield the meeting on the 31st was the first step in that process
4970922 just how many grocery stores do we need in this area anyway
4970923 we already have a walgreens going up 100 yards from a cvs with a food lion behind it i thought this was summerfield not wendover avenue
4970924 if it were flat i would be much less concerned but that septic field slopes downward and could seep into the water systems it just doesnt stand to reason that that would work
4970925 the developer said they did a traffic study and this development wouldnt impact traffic by more than about two seconds
4970926 we are clearly taking those comments seriously thats really the stage were in now with the planning process
4970927 because of the oppression of the weak and the groaning of the needy i will now arise
4970928 australian notes are more secure against counterfeiting the notes are printed on polymer substrate instead of traditional paper
4970929 the vast majority of counterfeits are printed on paper and can be easily torn
4970930 as polymer notes last four times more than paper notes there is less waste which is good for both the environment and the economy
4970931 we are happy to have achieved this milestone of being the largest integrated telco in the country in customer terms for us the benchmark of real leadership is customer delight and would like to thank all our customers for placing their faith in us
4970932 going into the event i just didnt want to finish last
4970933 from what ive heard around the yacht club its the first national title by a yacht club boat thats pretty cool
4970934 in the pac man race we packed it in because we didnt want to rip or stretch
4970935 all summer ive concentrated on doing this national we bought a new main sail and jibe
4970936 it was basically a four mile course because you sailed up to a buoy and sailed back
4970937 the conditions the first day were great we had a lot of wind
4970938 i looked around the yacht club and picked the best people they also are the lightest people
4970939 grab your clothes and get gone you better hurry up before the sprinklers come on
4970940 ive got tears in my ears from lyin on my back in my bed while i cry over you
4970941 you stuck my heart in an old tin can and shot it off a log
4970942 if fingerprints showed up on skin wonder whose id find on you
4970943 i liked you better before i knew you so well

4970969 theyre taking care of him and were very grateful for it
4970970 he was despised and rejected by men surely he took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows yet we considered him stricken by god smitten by him and afflicted

4971027 el espa ol tiene un futuro muy esperanzador porque la hablan casi 500 millones de personas en el mundo

4971050 well flosso did a version of it but it was vernon who had the real work on it and he announced it in harrys book he used to do it at the summer table at the castle but meanwhile craven was doing a similar version except with the aces reversed and with a different handling at the witchdoctors table in new york you know the one that met around the corner from the palace when blackstone junior was headlining
4971051 was that the table that max was a regular at
4971052 no youre thinking of the witchcraft roundabout that vernon ran
4971053 everything else is a distraction magic talk on the internet is a distraction magic contests are a distraction magic organizations are a distraction the latest advertisement the latest trick distractions methods for their own sake are a distraction you cannot cross over into the world of magic until you put everything else aside and behind you including your own desires and needs and focus on bringing an experience to the audience this is magic nothing else
4971054 magicians have taken something intrinsically profound and made it look trivial
4971055 mimes were invented to give magicians someone to look down on
4971056 youve got to no youve got to relax your wrist just then you have to you want it to look more casual youre making too much of the moment the ace is no big deal dont force it let it happen
4971057 amateur magicians with stars in their eyes had little idea of how unsatisfying the work could be performers traveled great distances and performed numerous shows before unappreciative audiences those who presented large scale illusions tall grass showmen were shunted to the hinterlands and focused their efforts on the cities towns and villages that received little entertainment of any sort
4971058 he could do the moves but he tore the dollar up slowly like this
4971059 why why would you tear it up slowly nobody tears a dollar bill up in the first place but if youre going to tear up a dollar bill at all youd tear it up quickly in a sudden fit zip zip zip
4971060 the only reason you would tear a dollar bill up slowly is if you were doing something else to it at the same time if you were doing a goddam magic trick so right away were off in the magic land of i have in my hand an ordinary deck of cards but o k lets live with that why are you tearing it up are you doing it angrily gaily why are you asking me to watch you tear up a dollar bill the method is not the trick the method is never the trick once youve mastered the method youve hardly begun the trick
4971061 i thought it was wonderful amazing and he taught me how to do it
4971062 and then we started going to tannens together taking the train in on saturdays all the way from sheepshead bay to times square
4971063 in those days tannens was in the wurlitzer building behind bryant park where the verizon building is now
4971064 we had a mixed up family often at odds with each other but there was one cousin ill call her sharon whom i adored i would show her the color vision box over and over and she
4971065 mastering magic at twenty nine is as late to begin seriously as it would be if you were studying violin i felt that i had hands like stumps its why i still so envy closeup men like prakash who has such soft hands by the end of the year i had begun to get very good technically and i had heard somewhere that you could work as a magic bartender so i went to bartender school
4971066 i loved being a bartender loved it there was a blue collar side to it i suppose i didnt talk with an accent like this growing up it was a rebellion against my cosseted middle class upbringing magic was for me partly an art thing partly a blue collar artisanal thing so being a magic bartender was ideal
4971067 ha it turned out that the whole idea of magic bars was dying even as i entered it
4971068 the night shook me up completely i mean beyond completely they made fun of magicians and still did brilliant magic and they refused to say that they were magicians doing a magic show although that was obviously what it was
4971069 i was arrogant enough to call the castle and say that i was free to lecture or perform
4971070 and they let me do some work there naturally i was desperate to see vernon and we sessioned together
4971071 when i entered for the second show there he was again much to my surprise i was calmer this time and the show came off without a hitch
4971072 i asked vernon so professor did you see anything you liked
4971073 but his friendship with vernon led him in another direction as well backward in a sense to try to define what it was that made magic matter why the tradition counted and what it meant
4971074 a spectator never or rarely was fooled by what a magician performed for him in the way of tricks
4971075 from the very start the moment a magician looks into his practice mirror he is envisioning an alien awareness a mind other than his own perceiving an illusion that he is creating but cannot actually experience for himself
4971076 the one thing i can do that steven spielberg cant is to say take a card any card you like swiss says
4971077 and i can have you sign it so that its unique in the world and then i can make it disappear from the deck and find it in your pocket and hand it back to you that one card your mind and mine
4971078 at every moment in the history of magic there is an anti magician to go along with the mainstream magicians
4971079 blaine saw something that we all saw how people looked when they got fried
4971080 but just being in a room with lions isnt about anything so then i thought whats the worst torture someone can undergo and i realized its going without sleep so i researched it you know and found out what the record was the guy who set the record didnt train for it and he went kind of crazy afterward i know ill start to hallucinate and everything but my idea is to do it outdoors and let people do anything they want to keep me awake stay awake for five days and then bring out the lions
4971081 all my work is about honesty magic card tricks we have to get beyond that if magic is just magicians doing card tricks to impress other not interested in that anymore i dont want magic that looks real what i want are real things that feel like magic
4971082 david copperfield made the statue of liberty disappear but then it came right back my ideal magic would be really making the statue of liberty disappear so that it never comes back even if i have to go to jail afterward
4971083 after the ed sullivan show ended and before doug henning there was nothing there was always some guy out there somewhere sawing a woman but that was it doug henning did what robert houdin set out to do he presented magic in the dress of the time only now it was tie dye and long hair and hippieness that saved illusion at least on television and then copperfield came along copperfield i remember when he was still calling himself davino at tannens
4971084 he smiles sheepishly like many combative souls he takes his feuds and eruptions as part of the weather in his world and assumes that his disputants do too
4971085 its a good show a fun show who can deny it but what do people come to a big magic show for now celebrity to be amazed what did they come for then of course there was less to see in the world then they werent going home to watch television but i think they were there for beauty too a lot of what magicians did then was just meant to be beautiful it got that ahhh sound you hear when teller does the goldfish
4971086 david ben does an illusion show set in 1909 and because its set then he does it much slower than we do now and that kind of stage slowness turns out to be the right speed for magic it isnt a high speed art the beauty lies in the unfolding not in being zapped to the finish it does for me anyway onstage it takes me three minutes to say my name
4971087 jamy youll be amazed when you see what i have at the warehouse
4971088 you were at tannens too right of course you were i loved it with lou did you know lou did you see me in the jubilee the year i was eighteen when they gave me the whole second half
4971089 magic is the most intrinsically ironic of all the arts
4971090 i dont know what your definition of irony is but mine is something where when you are seeing it you see it in two different and even contradictory ways at the same time and with magic what you see collides with what you know thats why magic even when merely executed ends up having intellectual content its intrinsic to the form
4971091 there is a more romantic way to do it to calm down the intrinsic irony but that can get schmaltzy
4971092 many magicians do that but it tends toward the sentimental
4971093 theres a moment in your life when you realize the difference between illusion and reality and that youre being lied to
4971094 santa claus the easter bunny after my mother told me that there was no santa claus i made up an entirely fictitious girl in my classroom and told my mother stories about
4971095 he smiles with somewhat pugsley addams like glee and goes on more soberly
4971096 you know the funny thing about that a friend and i did the germain flowers last year we put the music on the right music played at the right time slightly off speed and we prepped the illusion properly you know had the buds set right so that they would open when you fanned them the fanning is part of the piece and we watched it emerge this lovely music was playing and we just wept at the beauty of it tears streamed down our cheeks at the lovely apparition of it that was magic
4971097 what magic is out to do isnt just to amaze you but to achieve what whit haydn calls putting a burr under the saddle of the mind
4971098 he leaps up from the table and becomes a man on a tightrope
4971099 lets say you do a blaine trick one hes done on television where you have someone choose a card and then find it in a sealed basketball well if he sees it in the basketball he knows that somehow the cards been forced on him its too perfect but if its got a torn corner or its signed or if maybe instead of being inside a basketball its behind a backboard he thinks it wasnt there before but he cant get over there the mind starts working he cant rest here he cant rest here and he stays on the tightrope
4971100 my real work began when i was walking down the street just practicing a one handed shuffle and all the guys in this garage i was walking by went ohhhh
4971101 ohhhh just for a shuffle i started realizing that what i love to do is bring magic for one second and that one second is enough my endurance pieces are all about taking away the ego putting yourself in a position so intense that the ordinary i doesnt exist anymore youre surviving the way a baby does or its like just before an accident when you see everything the seats and the road and the dashboard and your life in slow motion that heightened sense of awareness the blinding flash of being shocked out of your logical magic for me
4971102 im trying to get him to see some of the some of the deeper psychological things not just tricks

4971138 the georgian soldiers had been guarding irans border with iraq

4971150 james mason leigh was a good man ive known him since we were both kids tubing down boulder creek we went to boulder high cu and then off into the world of movement and pilates he was my best friend
4971151 james loved this town he loved his life in this town he loved all of you who have come here today
4971152 james also loved pilates over the last few years he spent all of his energies supporting the university of pilates from its initial inception through to its existence today
4971153 his retreat from the forefront over the last couple years has only made the university stronger in the process he made each of us stronger to stand on our own to not only help but to lead the way
4971154 he always lived his life and talked about his life in retrospect so in many ways today he got his wish
4971155 a gathering like this is for the living we gather to acknowledge a loved one who has gone before us we gather like this to bolster our strength to go on life will be emptier without james among us but life will surely go on with james within us he was a gift he remains a gift and with his blessing and in his spirit we shall go on
4971156 well wait for you back at the car you take as long as you want
4971157 james and i were pretty good friends he was like a brother to me
4971158 james was always a private guy and the last couple years he was more and more the hermit he seemed impatient for this very day
4971159 something happened in his life that made him want more look forward to more someone i should say
4971160 you he spoke of you wanting more of life with you
4971161 well i thought you should know i think james would have wanted you to know

4971297 solo interagendo con il mondo dei vedenti posso demolire i loro pregiudizi sul nostro universo e costruire ponti
4971298 un bel giorno ricorda detti una bella lezione a un gruppo di teste calde dopo aver trascorso una settimana a studiare la configurazione della palestra della scuola in base ai suoni e al calore prodotto dalla luce li misi ko fu allora che capii la forza straordinaria della memoria sonora e luminosa
4971299 gi allora riuscivo a percepire la luce in maniera cos vivida da arrivare a vedere i contorni del mio scheletro proprio come unenergia pulsante o come dei raggi x a volte incalza riesco addirittura a dare una forma umana ai suoni e a intravedere persone e oggetti dal retro della mia testa
4971300 impiego la pellicola fotografica come una tela sulla quale fissare ci che i miei altri sensi portano allattenzione dellocchio mentale
4971301 io continuo a percepire il mondo visivamente assicura anche se adesso devo utilizzare i miei altri sensi e la memoria per formulare una visione interna nellocchio della mente perdere gli occhi non ha diminuito la chiarezza di questa visione interna mi ha solo indotto a lavorare pi sodo per acutizzare gli altri sensi e imparare il suono specifico di ognuno
4971302 i neonati debbono imparare a comprendere la vista cos come io debbo imparare a capire i suoni e il loro modo di interagire con gli oggetti solo cos posso realizzare foto sempre migliori

4971310 i believe in the power of poetry which gives me reasons to look ahead and identify a glint of light poetry can be a real bastard it distorts it has the power to transform the unreal into the real and the real into the imaginary it has the power to build a world that is at odds with the world in which we live i see poetry as spiritual medicine i have no other tool with which to find meaning for my life or for the life of my nation i built with words a homeland for my nation and for myself
4971311 o those who pass between fleeting words carry your names and be gone rid our time of your hours and be gone steal what you will from the blueness of the sea and the sand of memory take what pictures you will so that you understand that which you never will how a stone from our land builds the ceiling of our sky from you steel and fire from us our flesh from you yet another tank from us stones from you teargas from us rain as bitter dust go where you wish but do not pass between us like flying insects pile your illusions in a deserted pit and be gone and we have what you lack a bleeding homeland of a bleeding people

4971476 why does the chief of the lto single out congressmen is it because its good publicity for him at our expense

4971531 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4971532 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

4971534 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4971535 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4971536 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4971537 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4971538 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4971539 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4971540 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4971541 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4971542 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4971543 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4971544 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4971545 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4971546 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4971547 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4971548 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

4971552 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4971553 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4971554 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4971555 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4971556 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4971557 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4971558 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4971559 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4971560 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4971561 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4971562 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4971563 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4971564 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4971565 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4971566 who are open to doing something on the production side
4971567 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4971568 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4971569 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4971570 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4971571 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4971572 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4971573 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4971574 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4971575 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4971576 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4971577 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4971578 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4971579 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4971580 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4971581 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4971582 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

4971586 its generally just a bunch of guys typing into their computers
4971587 oh we recently got a small nerf basketball hoop for our office so i guess that constitutes action
4971588 theres the dot com silicon valley blow all your money on booze style
4971589 then theres the chicago thing do something do it well and be modest about it
4971590 im just amazed at how much the news industry does because other people are doing it
4971591 one large newspaper chain has contacted us and said can we license this now
4971592 says gary kebbel journalism program director for the john s and james l knight foundation which funds holovatys project with a 1 1 million grant
4971593 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4971594 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4971595 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4971596 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4971597 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4971598 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

4971607 the antiques roadshow is a wonderful insight into the differences between two cultures the antiques business in the uk is fuddy duddy full of eccentric characters and gullible but polite people who just nod pleasantly saying yes a lot when told their piece is a load of junk etc the us show is dominated by really annoying presenters most of whom are flagrantly homosexual and just plain dull also in the us show there is much more emphasis on price than in the british version where the history of the piece is more important

4971615 but jesus was full of grace and truth and we have to try to discern when should grace be applied and when truth is the better medicine
4971616 if someone is hurting because of something beyond their control you apply grace and if theyre hurting because of destructive behavior you apply truth as the better medicine

4971622 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4971623 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4971624 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4971625 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4971626 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4971627 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4971628 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4971629 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4971630 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4971631 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4971632 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4971633 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4971634 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4971635 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4971636 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4971637 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4971638 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4971639 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4971640 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4971641 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

4971701 for most of this year we have been negotiating with a preferred development management company that would oversee this project on behalf of folkestone harbour company
4971702 obviously for something that could cost between 500 million and 750 million to implement a company that is putting so much time and resources into it is going to want a large return on that
4971703 however in the current economic climate it is clearly quite hard to negotiate what that return will be the situation changes pretty much every week and its becoming more and more difficult to get the numbers to stack up
4971704 its taking longer to sort out than anyone forecast but i would ask people not to panic as this development will go ahead eventually
4971705 it will renew the whole area folkestone is one of the most deprived towns in the country so we were delighted when roger came along with this wonderful scheme
4971706 its a shame it has stalled because we were looking forward to seeing it get under way but were sure roger will not give up and we will see this development create lots of new jobs and provide a more upbeat feeling for the town
4971707 we are very supportive of roger and we campaigned for his view for the future to come to fruition
4971708 however there are obviously difficulties in the current economic climate because companies are quite rightly concerned about where they are putting their money

4971743 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4971744 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4971745 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4971746 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4971751 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4971752 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4971753 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4971754 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

4971757 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4971758 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4971759 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal

4971803 were very excited to welcome you to campus in just nine days
4971804 but there has been no real mechanism for the geoscientific community to collectively feed this early warning research back to governments
4971805 but the same level of attention has not been given to the desperate need for an early warning system for many other environmental crises
4971806 as a result we are now seeing as just one example very serious environmental problems such as falling water levels in the murray river and the immediate risks to the lower murray lakes being posed by acid sulphate soils
4971807 nah you cant do it you wouldnt want to do it
4971808 no no really i dont run everything else would be fine the running part well i put it to you this way do you know cpr

4971810 there are only 3 people competing at the athena level i have two more weeks of hard training before having to rest and eat a whole mess of carbs the week before the race im a little nervous but looking forward to it and worse comes to worse some of those paramedics are wicked hot
4971811 no one cares what you had for lunch 100 ideas for your blog
4971812 we are told we are being mean all the time but what nobody mentions is why the drugs are so expensive
4971813 pharmaceutical companies have enjoyed double digit growth year on year and they are out to sustain that not least because their senior managements earnings are related to the share price
4971814 its not in their interests to take less profit personally as well as from the point of view of the business all these perverse incentives drive the price up
4971815 the other thing we have to pay for is the cost of marketing marketing costs generally are about twice the spend on research and development
4971816 im alone on my boat and i have been a fisherman for almost my entire life and im going to continue fishing while i can and my health permits it
4971817 the catch was good today i caught 1 800 kilos of excellent cod there are three rolls of fishing line on board and it is sometimes difficult too drag them in all at once despite the fact that i only fish in shallow waters
4971818 the catch from these trips has never weighed less than 1 700 kilos and i gut the fish and ice it onboard
4971819 i dont think there are fewer fish in the waters here than there used to be although the trawlers are too aggressive in the shallow waters around here and clear up everything
4971820 island on skagafj rdur fjord in north iceland fell into the ocean by accident after ferrying tourists to the island but managed to swim back ashore on his own accord
4971821 i thought id do some fish angling for dinner while the people were on the island i turned the boat around as usual and was going to step on board when i slipped fell onto the pier and from there into the ocean
4971822 the boat was loose and drifted away from the pier i thought it was rather silly to be there like a fool with people on the island and no boat so i decided to swim after it
4971823 the boat just offered its right bow to me where i was sitting on the cliff so i could walk onboard like a gentleman
4971824 i thought it was kind of it not every skagfjordian stallion would have done the same skagafj rdur is famous for its horses i then sailed the boat back to the pier and had put on my flotation suit before the people came back onboard like nothing had happened
4971825 its a given that i participate in this initiative i despise violence
4971826 since i first started out in politics i have always been convinced that if anything is of importance then that is improving the rights of women it is not only important for women but also for the community as a whole
4971827 the problem for crouch when he was at liverpool was that he only maybe got a game once a month
4971828 i could see how frustrated he was getting but now he has the chance to show what he can do

4971837 our channels will be entertainment based verticals for both bollywood and news based channels
4971838 for news based content we are planning to tie up with news agencies like reuters
4971839 nobody knew how this mechanism worked before we described this protein
4971840 this protein directly affects photosynthesis and how plants create biomass stems leaves and stalks and oils
4971841 weve found that if the tgd4 protein is malfunctioning the plant then accumulates oil in its leaves
4971842 if the plant is storing oil in its leaves there could be more oil per plant which could make production of biofuels such as biodiesel more efficient
4971843 i appeal to the government to stand behind these farming families here today and support them
4971844 i dont think australia really understands the extent of the devastation the impact the drought has had on farmers its not over
4971845 if you have one bad year it takes three or four years to recover from that we had had two bad years in a row
4971846 and in his usual classy fashion brendan had something very complimentary to say about michael so of course he you know brendan never surprises me with that hes a class act

4971857 this is it now we are going to fall off the side of this mountain into oblivion
4971858 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4971859 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4971860 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4971861 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4971862 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4971863 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4971864 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4971865 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4971866 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4971867 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4971868 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4971869 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4971870 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4971871 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4971872 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4971873 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4971874 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4971875 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4971876 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4971877 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4971878 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4971879 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4971880 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4971881 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4971882 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4971883 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4971884 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4971885 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4971886 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4971887 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4971888 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4971889 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4971890 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4971891 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4971892 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4971893 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4971894 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4971895 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4971896 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4971897 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4971898 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4971899 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4971900 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4971901 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that

4971908 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4971909 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4971910 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4971911 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4971912 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4971913 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4971914 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4971915 this is a planning took where all things are going
4971916 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4971917 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4971918 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4971919 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4971920 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4971921 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4971922 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4971923 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4971924 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4971925 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4971926 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4971927 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4971928 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4971929 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4971930 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4971931 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4971932 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4971933 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4971934 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4971935 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4971936 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4971937 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4971938 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4971939 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4971940 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4971941 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4971942 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4971943 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4971944 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4971945 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4971946 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4971947 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4971948 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4971949 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4971950 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4971951 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4971952 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4971953 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4971954 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4971955 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4971956 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4971957 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4971958 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4971959 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4971960 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4971961 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4971962 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4971963 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4971964 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4971965 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4971966 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck

4971970 da die versorgungs und beihilfeleistungen bis 2019 voraussichtlich am schnellsten steigen werden ist es unbedingt notwendig dass die reformschritte bereits in dieser zeit zu einer sp rbaren entlastung f hren

4971975 very well if your ship cannot take me god will find some other way i have never broken an engagement for fifty seven years let us go down into the chart room and pray
4971976 my eye is not on the density of the fog but on the living god who controls every circumstance of my life
4971977 first you do not believe he will answer and second i believe he has and there is no need whatever for you to pray about it
4971978 captain i have known my lord for fifty seven years and there has never been a single day that i have failed to get audience with the king get up captain and open the door and you will find the fog gone

4971986 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that entered georgia since aug 7
4971987 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4971988 they have robbed the military base and taken almost everything and they have burned or sunk the stuff they could not carry
4971989 we have no guarantee that the russians will keep to their agreement
4971990 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so

4972006 let businesses figure out how to reduce those losses then give them incentives when you give incentives you start seeing what people can do for me its better to incentivize companies to reduce system loss than to arbitrarily reduce the caps
4972007 most distribution utilities are above the cap theres a fair amount of pilferage there you can reduce system loss by investing but when you invest you have to make a return
4972008 if you cant make a decent return on your investment then it might not be worth it the investment to reduce system loss may be higher than what you can save just to meet the cap if thats the case it would be better to just leave things as they are

4972073 i have been buying 2cvs since 1969 i bought this van in 1984 but it has recently been restored to its former glory
4972074 i had my first 2cv in 1971 and have thousands of stories to tell when this couple saw my 2cv they asked if they could use it for their wedding of course i said yes
4972075 this is our familys 2cv in a suburb of paris in 1969 my brother and father were working on it before taking it on holiday to the south of france my father was really just there for support
4972076 the 2cvs are wonderful little cars here are my 1967 ak350 van and my 1987 dolly i bought the van in france for the sole purpose of bringing back copious amounts of wine from spain
4972077 my ex wife liked 2cvs so against my better clarksonian judgement i got her one for valentines day in 1986 we drove more than 100 000 miles through europe in it
4972078 this is my 2cv van on a hot day in the south of france i bought it from an italian woman when i retired to france but it has now been sold and taken to germany to be restored

4972082 m s sincera enhorabuena en nombre de la generalitat y de todos los valencianos por haber escrito una p gina de oro en la historia del deporte valenciano y espa ol
4972083 es la primera vez que una valenciana consigue una medalla en esta disciplina
4972084 todo el nimo tanto en estos juegos como en su carrera futura
4972085 ejemplifican d a a d a el gran xito del deporte espa ol en todas las disciplinas
4972086 todos los valencianos y espa oles est n orgullosos de la representaci n de nuestro pa s
4972087 durante el ltimo tramo bandas de m sica autoridades y feligreses se unir n a la comitiva para dar la bienvenida a la virgen en su entrada a la iglesia y comenzar n de ese modo oficialmente las fiestas que le rinden homenaje
4972088 en los que valencia se convertir en la capital de la categor a reina del automovilismo y desplazarse por la por la urbe y las proximidades del mar timo puede ser complejo
4972089 ha hecho acopio de existencias por el previsible incremento de demanda informativa y de material en todas sus oficinas especialmente en la m s pr xima al circuito urbano la tourist info playa
4972090 se ocupe de homologar los criterios de calidad en la gesti n y tasas de las instalaciones de servicios
4972091 nicamente est n funcionando las tres que ya exist an con anterioridad onda elche y guadassuar
4972092 las tres que se comenzaron antes de la aprobaci n de su respectivo plan zonal xixona villena y fontcalent
4972093 nicamente fontcalent cuenta con la preceptiva autorizaci n ambiental integrada aai
4972094 s lo tres tienen aai cervera algimia de alfara y el campello cuatro est n tramitando la aai quart de poblet manises vall d uix y caudete de las fuentes dos est n en fase de redacci n del proyecto ll ria y orihuela y las instalaciones del consorcio de valencia sur todav a est n por determinar
4972095 todav a no se ha puesto un solo ladrillo de una instalaci n adjudicada por un plan zonal y en consecuencia los objetivos previstos por el pir 1997 est n muy lejos de poder conseguirse
4972096 amenaza con colapsar la capacidad de las escasas instalaciones actuales que obliga a exportar nuestros residuos fuera de la comunitat incrementando el coste de tratamiento
4972097 un crecimiento sostenido de la generaci n de residuos incumpliendo el primer principio jer rquico de toda pol tica de residuos como es la minimizaci n tal como recoge la normativa europea estatal y auton mica
4972098 ser la misma para el periodo 2008 2013 que el promedio del periodo 2002 2004 cuando la poblaci n de la comunitat valenciana ha aumentado en 1 mill n de personas
4972099 se pretenda mantener la producci n de residuos en base a la aplicaci n de pol ticas de prevenci n cuando la recogida selectiva de materia org nica no se ha introducido en ning n municipio de la comunitat valenciana a pesar de estar prevista a partir de 2003 y la de papel cart n vidrio o envases a aden tiene un evidente d ficit tanto de contenedores como de frecuencia de recogida
4972100 la capacidad de las instalaciones resultantes de los planes zonales es lo suficientemente holgada para absorber la totalidad de los residuos urbanos que se generar n en la comunidad valenciana al horizonte del a o 2013
4972101 resulta imprescindible dar un paso m s hacia la valorizaci n energ tica de los residuos urbanos
4972102 puede adelantarse la conveniencia de optar como m nimo por tres instalaciones de valorizaci n energ tica
4972103 our focus is on the premier league and we know how important it is to win the premier league for the fans
4972104 it has been too many years and we are focusing on that it was important to start with a win after the not so very good game in the champions league
4972105 i always want to play with a good player like robbie and he is fine for me and the team which is more important
4972106 we want to concentrate on winning and the best news for our supporters is to win games
4972107 in the first half they were attacking the second half we were on top and attacking and continued until the end
4972108 we had chances torres is a key player and he can change games for the team its really important to have these sorts of players
4972109 we tired in the last 15 to 20 minutes which is something i should take responsibility for we should have had some tougher games in pre season
4972110 i know liverpool have only had one game in europe but it was a tough game we tired and i think that probably affected our decision making
4972111 for all the hard work the number of goals scored in the last 15 minutes is huge and the other 75 minutes goes out of the window
4972112 it was just one moment thats all were talking about but thats the beauty of the premier league i cant complain because ive been on the other side of it
4972113 no lo puedo creer la primera cosa que pens fue analizar todos los integradores alimentarios que he ingerido

4972117 with tweaks rv we found an elegant solution that we can customize and integrate into our pipelines for film animation and episodic production
4972118 there are no other playback tools on the market that come close to rvs ability to customize and seamlessly integrate within our environment which was an absolute requirement for us
4972119 the thing is ive heard rafa benitez saying keane can play anywhere left side or right side if he plays robbie on the left or right then hes not going to get the best out of him
4972120 to get the best out of robbie is to play him down the centre with torres if benitez does he will get the best out of the partnership
4972121 robbie and torres are both intelligent players torres makes great runs and robbie has played with dimitar berbatov and a lot of players so he knows where to go and where not to go
4972122 there are no such plans the news report is completely false and baseless
4972123 india is interesting we would not rule out going there
4972124 most definitely we want to take the club to india qprs profile is getting bigger because there are indian shareholders
4972125 hes long gone levys been hopping between bulgaria and russia trying to find berba so they can sell him and massaging zenits ego so theyd release arshavin on time its a tricky period at spurs what with ramos trying to get his new charges adjusted to playing for such a stylish side and worse trying to get berbas double to score a goal and a half
4972126 the bloody dutch did us twice first they sent him to learn the secrets of football from the altar that is old trafford and then they got him to wreck our chances at qualifying for the euros if i didnt have a ridiculous moustache youd see my upper lip quivering in anger
4972127 there were just a few too many tulips around the place and who comes to training by canal
4972128 i am happy with the trophy as well as that i feel comfortable i am getting to know the team and my new team mates
4972129 im discovering what i knew that there is a great team here and i want to contribute my bit to sevilla
4972130 im with great players who are making things easy for me there is a lot of quality and ability
4972131 ive come here to help the team we are full of confidence for the opening game of the league in santander
4972132 he is a player who arrived later than the others and he needs more time to adapt

4972144 das anforderungsprofil an einen profi club hat sich fundamental ver ndert wir sprechen hier ber mittlere bis gro e mittelst ndische unternehmen wichtig ist doch jeder verein k nnte dann doch immer noch selbst entscheiden ob er anteile verkauft oder nicht
4972145 nicht der mentalit t in deutschland wir wollen weiterhin fu ball f r die fans machen
4972146 man keine kapitalgesellschaft sein muss und auch unter den bestehenden rahmenbedingungen in die europ ische spitze vorsto en kann
4972147 dort ist die identit t der vereine zum teil verloren gegangen ich habe noch keinen fu ball fan getroffen der die bernahme seines clubs gut fand
4972148 mit unserem verein wollen wir alles im konsens regeln aber die m glichkeit einer klage gibt es nat rlich
4972149 es muss zusammen passen wem man vielleicht 30 prozent anteile verkauft
4972150 wir sind bereit ypsilanti nicht nur zur ministerpr sidentin zu w hlen sondern auch feste verabredungen zu treffen wir erwarten dann aber auch dass die von uns tolerierte politik in die richtige richtung geht

4972152 dass man uns so viel vertrauen entgegenbringt dass die leute aus dem verfassungsschutz abgezogen werden die uns derzeit berwachen

4972171 a huge number of people suffer from allergies and while hay fever for example is generally not life threatening allergy sufferers often also have asthma which can be deadly
4972172 late phase reactions also occur in allergic asthma and can in the proper settings be potentially life threatening the results of this study should alert practitioners and patients alike to the adverse effects of stress on allergic reactions in the nose chest skin and other organs that may seemingly resolve within a few minutes to hours after starting but may reappear the next day when least expected

4972190 if you look back at the last three years of your life and consider yourself an asshole in that time youve made progress
4972191 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4972192 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4972193 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4972194 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4972195 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4972196 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4972197 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4972204 abbys one of a kind she brings something different than i bring
4972205 because we dont have abby others of us have had to step up and i think theres proof of that in recent games
4972206 were playing more as a team since we havent had abbys presence
4972207 while sundhage called the americans domination over japan an advantage midfielder heather oreilly takes little comfort from history
4972208 we dont look back on years past we have a 1 0 victory and we have to learn from that
4972209 with germany playing brazil in the other semifinal japan is by far the biggest surprise of the tournament
4972210 they needed a must win game against norway with a lot of goals and they did it then they had a must win game against china where the entire crowd was cheering for china and did it
4972211 each game weve gotten better weve been adjusting without abby
4972212 its a great sign for the future the average age of the team is quite low and it shows the potential we have for the next year

4972224 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4972225 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4972226 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4972227 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4972228 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4972229 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4972230 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4972231 we simply must do everything we can in our power to slow down global warming before it is too late the science is clear the global warming debate is over
4972232 americans are coming to understand that global temperatures have actually cooled over the last 10 years and are predicted to continue cooling over the next 10
4972233 if you look from 1995 you dont see any change that could be regarded as statistically significant for the last 13 or 14 years nothing has been happening
4972234 if you take the last 30 years its completely evident that its going up
4972235 if this helps anyone out there who is in their middle aged years and has put off what they wanted to do because they thought they were too old or because they have a child and that they cant balance what they want to do with being a parent then thats great what ive done is show them that they can do it
4972236 it was thought that if youre getting to 16 17 or 18 youre getting to the end of your career dara has done a fantastic job in proving that you can continue to improve and that women can have children and get back into the sport she has gotten rid of a mythology in swimming that has been there for so long

4972238 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
4972239 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
4972240 i told him if he allowed turbines in that field he would lose a son
4972241 i tell people its not a wind farm its an industrial development
4972242 we knew we were going to change the landscape maybe forever
4972243 we knew some people would be unhappy but the benefits far outweighed the objections of a few
4972244 im an educator not a wind expert or an investor
4972245 the great unknown which is how much the wind company is making
4972246 this cow doesnt need to be fed doesnt need a vet doesnt need a place to lie down
4972247 this project was happening like it or not and you would have to be a fool not to participate to be excited and take advantage of it
4972248 it seemed like the cost in terms of how it changed the community was too high
4972249 its hard when change is for the common good but some people suffer more than others
4972250 dad taught us such respect for the land for my father to be part of this
4972251 did you know richard nixon is the only president whose formal portrait was painted by a police sketch artist
4972252 not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
4972253 people werent creating and posting videos online there was jibjab a website but that was done by a production crew what youre seeing now are individuals participating in the process and thats really exciting
4972254 so often with these its not the huge production values that make them work
4972255 in a couple of hours we can turn something around its the ideas behind them not the money
4972256 what makes this such a fun election is that there is so much awareness its like when youre at the water cooler and everybody watched the same television show the night before people are just really ready to be engaged
4972257 then of course theres just so much to rip on
4972258 the guy who sits on the sidelines teaching the white guy valuable lessons like bagger vance the big magical brother from the green mile or when shaq played kazaam

4972263 i have the oldness it takes to protect america honor her love her and tell her what cute things the cat did
4972264 act now and dont delay we know he doesnt have much experience and isnt ready to lead but that doesnt mean he isnt dreamy
4972265 we can start up that rumor about you having a black baby with a prostitute
4972266 but sir it would be healthier for the two if they were separated
4972267 mccain supports universal health care for all current and former pows
4972268 john edwards presidential aspirant and author of the famed claim that there are two americas was apparently only faithful to his wife in one of them apparently he didnt realize that the national enquirer had reporters stationed in the other america where he was in fact having an affair with his videographer
4972269 obamas camp initially agreed that the cartoon was quote tasteless and offensive really you know what your response should have been its very easy here let me put the statement out for you barack obama is in no way upset about the cartoon that depicts him as a muslim extremist because you know who gets upset about cartoons muslim extremists
4972270 barack obama heading to hawaii for a vacation with his family
4972271 republicans say that john mccain will be good for business they didnt say what business but im guessing probably the scooter store doans pills craftmatic adjustable bed and the miracle ear
4972272 people are now talking about the ticket barack obama and hillary clinton would that be a good ticket and i think this would be the first if you think about it first combination of an african american man and a white woman since well michael jackson
4972273 barack obama gave a speech in germany and 200 000 people showed up there were so many germans shouting and screaming that france surrendered just in case
4972274 barack obama said today that he is going to fight for votes in all 50 states yeah thats what he said meanwhile john mccain said hes going to fight for votes in all 13 colonies
4972275 ralph nader in the news this week ralph nader announced that he is certified to be on the presidential ballot in 12 states however doctors say that nader is certifiable in all 50 states
4972276 barack obama still continuing to dominate media coverage the new york times just did a big piece they say that barack obama has been successful in politics because hes a black man who doesnt make white people feel threatened yeah yeah which explains obamas secret service code name al roker
4972277 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
4972278 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws

4972286 i am aware of the enhanced importance of this issue given my age
4972287 dr paul is non interventionist and does not want us intervening in the affairs of others
4972288 its certainly good to have attention drawn to the issues of the libertarian party
4972289 being a third party candidate is very different a lot of republicans like to donate to republicans you just have to keep on plugging
4972290 it could be that a few thousand votes tip the balance
4972291 i truly believe that the florida division of elections every decision that came from their office favored bush

4972293 a lottery and you know that with lotteries you lose most of the time
4972294 theres nothing like taking a nice quiet bomb apart to steady the nerves
4972295 thats an all time high for optical scan usage in this nation
4972296 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
4972297 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
4972298 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
4972299 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
4972300 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
4972301 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
4972302 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
4972303 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
4972304 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
4972305 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
4972306 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
4972307 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
4972308 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
4972309 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit
4972310 this is the central act of democracy it is the basis for the all the legitimacy of our government and its actions we believe or at least want to believe that people are put in office by the will of the voters thats what you need to be able to verify
4972311 on august 21 there will be a national premier of the film in 400 theaters across the nation the film purports to be an entertaining analysis of the serious financial situation facing america regarding its national debt and fiscal irresponsibility
4972312 from its trailer and description it sounds suspiciously like a hokey concoction ala al gores an inconvenient truth put together by louis xvis financial ministers on the eve of the storming of the bastille blaming all our troubles on sunspots or the humble snail darter
4972313 the premier will also feature a live panel discussion after the film of distinguished experts filling in to the suckers who viewed this fiasco what they just saw they include peterson walker billionaire investor warren buffet and cato institute chairman william me too niskanen
4972314 heres what we wont be hearing from these esteemed gentlemen
4972315 poor david rockefeller his grandfather senator nelson aldrich created this monstrosity the federal reserve thats responsible for all that we saw in the film and now the ignorant masses will be coming after him in a blind fit of revenge theyll be coming after all of us like they did the aristocrats in france were closing down the harold pratt house in new york and moving the cfr headquarters to a secure bunker in virginia
4972316 you know i should have earned less and listened more to my dad the heroic
4972317 the clarity over the past year has improved by at least 2 5 feet
4972318 i know what fire does and with global warming and the water issues we have fire looms its ugly head much more formidably than it has in the past
4972319 we want young chinese girls or boys to get such an impression from this place that 20 years from now theyll want to work for johnson amp johnson
4972320 supports privatization tax cuts and government spending cuts and opposes laws that limit spending by non party organizations during election campaigns
4972321 in order to attract votes the harper government has combined tax cuts with big spending the effect being to suck the treasury dry
4972322 therefore do not be foolish but understand what the lords will is
4972323 pray that i may declare it fearlessly as i shoud
4972324 the truth is the truth and thats how the president will testify
4972325 if a man wants his dreams to come true he must wake up

4972329 ik hoop dat de juryleden die geen tijd hebben om alle boeken te lezen ontslag nemen en de anderen het nu voorgestelde reglement afwijzen
4972330 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
4972331 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
4972332 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
4972333 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
4972334 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground
4972335 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
4972336 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
4972337 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
4972338 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years
4972339 a remarkable indictment of the corruption and cynicism rife among climate scientists
4972340 if nothing is done all the polar bears could die in our lifetime
4972341 science keeps getting stronger and the mathematical models keep getting better
4972342 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will in the foreseeable future cause catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate
4972343 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
4972344 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
4972345 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
4972346 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
4972347 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
4972348 these solutions are flexible the student will be moving a few times throughout college and you want something that can be adjusted to different places
4972349 miss ive got a free spin card with your name on it
4972350 hi im regis philbin can i buy you a drink
4972351 im sorry but i cannot accept get lost game show boy unless its phrased in the form of a question
4972352 a key statistical procedure on which many past epidemiological studies had relied was flawed
4972353 emissions of smog producing pollutants decreased both nationally and regionally between 1990 and 2000
4972354 both decreased substantially nationally and regionally with statistically significant downward trends nationally no levels in 2005 were about 50 lower than in 1991 and no2 about 30 lower
4972355 one million to die from smog related illnesses in the next two years
4972356 the most problematic aspect of the cmas research is the assumption that air pollution kills
4972357 we make each other feel as if they actually have a heart
4972358 fox and falco youre the last team to arrive im sorry to tell you you have been eliminated from the race
4972359 once there find your next clue on mushroom bridge teams have 138 coins for this leg of the race
4972360 last leg we raced on our home planet and we managed to build an advantage
4972361 hopefully we can hold on to it and win the race
4972362 we are a lot older than any of the other teams here
4972363 it hasnt stopped us yet and hopefully it wont stop us in this leg but we know that we need to win in mental strength and not physical strength
4972364 were leaving last but we arent really worried we should be able to make up some time at the great leveller which is the airport
4972365 were probably going to be starting even with the others in mushroom city and we should be able to win from there
4972366 the earliest flight to mushroom city departs at 1 pm and arrives at 9 am the next morning
4972367 weve shown several times that we can find our way past teams so i dont see why we cant do it again
4972368 we deserve to win this final leg more than anybody else
4972369 once we get into the city it is going to come down to the smartest team
4972370 thanks to the huge rest we got a couple of days ago we are fresh and we know the other teams will be fatigued and unable to perform their best
4972371 we need to get to mushroom bridge as fast as possible
4972372 were in a huge hurry to get to mushroom bridge
4972373 we need to pass the two other cabs that just left
4972374 i dont think ill be able to climb the bridge
4972375 but i have a thing about heights it was really windy up at the top of the bridge and i knew that i couldnt do the bridge task
4972376 we saw the bus cleaning task that the teams had to go through in season nine and climbing up a bridge would be so much faster
4972377 i dont know if im going to be able to do it
4972378 and search around the starting line for your next clue
4972379 it would have for us though because i wouldnt have been able to do it
4972380 leg 1 was city 17 and mable and sable got eliminated that has to be the black mesa logo
4972381 then it was jessie and james and romani and cremia
4972382 then it was the fire emblem and team sex bat
4972383 so i need to leave a blank there after that it was knuckles and rouge then fox and falco
4972384 leave our bags here well come back for them later
4972385 run along the marked path and find phil and the finish line this is it go go go
4972386 we just need to outrun her and well win it
4972387 we bonded really well on this trip and stayed positive the whole way and look where it got us
4972388 i dont think ive ever felt older in my life
4972389 twenty or thirty years ago we would have easily outstripped the other two and we would have been standing where they are now
4972390 we raced really hard and in the end we came really close to beating a couple of people half our age it doesnt matter what anybody says thats an achievement

4972392 the army failed five years and more than 12 000 british deaths later the redcoats withdrew an army of rebel enslaved africans had defeated the army of the worlds superpower and the largest slave trading nation the humiliation of this defeat sent a shock wave through the british establishment and indirectly strengthened the forces in parliament that voted to abolish the slave trade in 1807

4972433 we recognize the complexities in the lives of young men of color who have sex with men

4972435 all young people need the strong support of family to grow up healthy and safe
4972436 this is especially vital for young gay men who are at higher risk of contracting hiv many parents dont know how to react when a child tells them he is gay this campaign gets across the message that it is most important for a parent to let their child know they love him no matter what you can deal with your own feelings later but it is essential to stay close to your child
4972437 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to go to university
4972438 to be able to eat a typical peking duck gives the athletes the most enjoyment
4972439 every day i think i had it for breakfast the other day
4972440 i get so tired and i dont feel like eating any of the other dishes i eat some duck drink some rice porridge and take off
4972441 the famed beijing duck is a hot gold medal contender for the most popular food in the host city of the ongoing olympic games
4972442 the skin is very thin and very crispy their sauce is not too salty or too sweet one bite and the oily duck juice spurts into your mouth
4972443 its the best representation of our country you have to climb the great wall you have to go to a hutong traditional alleyway you have to buy silk and you have to eat peking roast duck
4972444 its the most authentic its taste is different from all the others
4972445 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4972446 these suckers are so soaked in oil that i can walk in water and they dont leak
4972447 every time you use it you have to wait another billion years for something to create some methane
4972448 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
4972449 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would
4972450 and it must happen because even natural gas will not be sustainable forever we do need to switch to renewable resources the gas buys time i dont believe that the market forces in this day and age will favor just an overnight conversion
4972451 this is a district that has been changing a lot over the last several years the number of new people in the district is huge and the people who have lived in the district are also changing
4972452 she doesnt have much of a political track record and she has staked out very left positions in a moderate district
4972453 my hunch is that if there is a democratic wave nationally reichert will be one of the incumbents who is swept away by it
4972454 but the race is a toss up if the national pattern is more competitive
4972455 my sense is that 2006 might have been a peak for democrats in washington
4972456 at least our polls showed the war was a bigger issue then versus now and that had to help burner in 2006
4972457 if theres an obama mobilization effect this year or an anti incumbent vote due to the economy there might be a trend toward democrats in the 8th the big question is will that trend be as large as the anti war spike in 2006
4972458 while the district has a republican partisan leaning it has been a swing district for some time
4972459 the split ticket voting indicates that party preferences are soft at the margins and the district could go either way
4972460 long before the democratic party was returning my phone calls
4972461 we didnt want to change what was working what was working was our message and what was working was the grassroots approach
4972462 kirks been more active in the district emphasizing case work a bit more and raising money more than he did in 2006 when seals seemed to have surprised him
4972463 kirk is taking nothing for granted so this is going to be a tough close race
4972464 the interest in change is bigger than it was in 2006
4972465 what we are seeing is record turnout at our events and if you look at the election turnout for the primary
4972466 the worlds youth have a huge personal stake in global warming
4972467 after all it is our future that hangs in the balance the inconvenient youth network will give a voice to the many youth around the world who want to make difference now
4972468 we believe the climate change problem can be solved and youth will make a difference this group of 80 trainees will tap into their local communities and quickly grow to a network of over a thousand youth were already working to schedule sessions at campuses across the nation
4972469 were going beyond facebook to get this issue in the face of adults and other teens together we can solve it
4972470 we are constantly running into problems created by the georgian side
4972471 and so everything will depend on how effectively and how quickly these problems are resolved
4972472 would in no way limit or put in danger the freedom of movement and travel along the road and rail axes of georgia
4972473 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future
4972474 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4972475 no we are hunting that finish line all the way
4972476 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4972477 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4972478 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4972479 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4972480 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4972481 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4972482 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4972483 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4972484 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4972485 hed be a good man on a boat during a storm
4972486 obama does better against mccain with hunters and especially fisherpeople than did his two democratic predecessors vis a vis bush
4972487 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4972488 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
4972489 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4972490 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4972491 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4972492 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4972493 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4972494 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4972495 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4972496 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4972497 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4972498 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4972499 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4972500 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4972501 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4972502 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4972503 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4972504 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4972505 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4972506 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4972507 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4972508 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4972509 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4972510 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4972511 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4972512 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4972513 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4972514 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4972515 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4972516 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4972517 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4972518 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4972519 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4972520 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4972521 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4972522 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4972523 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4972524 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4972525 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4972526 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4972527 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
4972528 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
4972529 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
4972530 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
4972531 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
4972532 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
4972533 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4972534 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
4972535 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
4972536 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
4972537 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
4972538 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
4972539 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4972540 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4972541 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4972542 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4972543 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4972544 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4972545 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
4972546 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
4972547 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
4972548 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
4972549 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
4972550 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
4972551 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
4972552 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
4972553 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4972554 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4972555 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4972556 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4972557 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4972558 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
4972559 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
4972560 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
4972561 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
4972562 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
4972563 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
4972564 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
4972565 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
4972566 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
4972567 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
4972568 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
4972569 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
4972570 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
4972571 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4972572 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4972573 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4972574 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4972575 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4972576 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4972577 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4972578 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4972579 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4972580 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4972581 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4972582 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4972583 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4972584 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
4972585 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
4972586 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
4972587 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
4972588 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
4972589 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
4972590 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
4972591 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
4972592 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4972593 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4972594 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4972595 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4972596 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4972597 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4972598 this will be one of those areas that will be very close
4972599 i think mccain reaches into the middle of the district fairly well i think of course obama will have strong support
4972600 i think hes going to drive big numbers in a place like fort collins
4972601 its been a very difficult territory for republicans probably in large part because of the war the college environment and so forth
4972602 in many ways that affects our politics more than specific issues
4972603 the unaffiliated voters are always the ones that get the most robo calls the most phone calls the most direct mail pieces
4972604 i talk to a lot of people here they are scared of obama
4972605 with obama it is not business as usual i like the fact that we are about to elect a black man president of the united states
4972606 bottom line john is not strong enough and obama is too new
4972607 i dont know enough about obama i really liked hillary clinton
4972608 i think a few years ago it was pretty well split
4972609 those are my two biggest expenses right now fuel and food
4972610 im still unsure if im actually going to vote that way
4972611 if i did vote for him it would be because his position is lets go someplace different
4972612 lets try to fix our economy lets try to deal with iraq from a different point of view
4972613 the next president is essentially going to be my boss
4972614 people are worried about the looming energy crisis and how that affects their dollar expenditures
4972615 im not worried about his lack of experience he knows what he wants
4972616 i think larimer is going to be one to watch
4972617 obamas got the momentum but hes got to run on more than that democrats woo independents much of the democrats recent success in colorado and larimer county comes from the partys ability to win over independent voters who make up a third or more of the electorate statewide
4972618 i wanted to be thought of as a person who didnt just vote a party line who voted for the person independently
4972619 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4972620 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4972621 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4972622 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4972623 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4972624 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4972625 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4972626 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4972627 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4972628 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
4972629 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech

4972636 we have in this country an overabundance of supply of health care services
4972637 so as we look to find ways to help stem the increase in cost associated with medical benefits we have to realize thats money coming out of revenue for a provider of care
4972638 the economic cost estimate to central new york for smoking is 763 million
4972639 individuals and society we can act on what we see in the mirror
4972640 you folks cant sustain that we cant as a community sustain that
4972641 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4972642 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4972643 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4972644 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4972645 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4972646 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4972647 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4972648 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4972649 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4972650 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4972651 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4972652 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4972653 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
4972654 im very aware of how precious the time with my children is
4972655 the boys know how to compost all the food and it goes into the garden
4972656 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4972657 i wish we were on the other end of this but the pitchers got it they threw it they threw it over the plate
4972658 its a fun game to play defense in i guarantee if you ask our guys theyll say that and i know their guys feel that way they love playing behind halladay theres a reason
4972659 hes pretty tough he throws strikes hes got great stuff its tough to get in a rhythm on him because hes creating his own rhythm for himself we didnt get anything going we hit some balls good but not enough to get anything started he pretty much controlled us the whole night thats why hes one of the best in the league
4972660 not a single turkish cypriot wants or dares to speak up and defend cypriot interests
4972661 three years ago the plant city police found a girl lying in her roach infested room naked except for an overflowing diaper the child pale and skeletal communicated only through grunts she was almost 7 years old the authorities had discovered the rarest of creatures a feral child deprived of her humanity by a lack of nurturing

4972667 i ended up getting into a lot of great schools
4972668 just not the one that would make me disregard all the others
4972669 its a great way to shape the class and meet our institutional priorities
4972670 maybe we could use a few more artists or a few more math or science researchers
4972671 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4972672 fail to act and whats been accomplished will be lost
4972673 the area has an ice base and the snow sometimes isnt stable
4972674 id say hes been there it the snow and ice has rolled and hes gone
4972675 it was a particularly good day up here this is just bad luck i presume
4972676 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4972677 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4972678 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4972679 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4972680 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4972681 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4972682 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4972683 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4972684 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4972685 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4972686 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
4972687 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4972688 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4972689 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4972690 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4972691 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4972692 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
4972693 uit straatinterviews van jan chipchase en zijn team blijkt dat het gebruik van de mobiele telefonie wereldwijd grondige verschillen vertoont
4972694 bijvoorbeeld de manier waarop het toestel gedragen wordt hier draagt bijna niemand zijn mobiele telefoon aan de broekriem maar in de chinese stad jin li doet 40 procent van de mannelijke ondervraagden dat wel in het indiase hyberadad draagt 45 procent van de mannen de telefoon in zijn borstzak in los angeles is dat nog geen 2 procent
4972695 zo bleken de inwoners van dorpen in uganda geen elektriciteit hebben maar toch mobiel bellen
4972696 een gezin doet er ongeveer een maand met een tweedehands autoaccu als de batterij leeg is moet hij een paar dorpen verderop worden opgeladen en is er een dag of drie geen stroom in huis in uganda schiet men dus niets op met een energie vretende smartphone die met een groot scherm wifi en gps ontvanger is uitgerust
4972697 dat kan opgelost worden door een toestel waarvan de kleuren kunnen uitgeschakeld worden
4972698 een zwart witscherm verbruikt immers minder stroom in china en india is nog altijd een groot gedeelte van de bevolking analfabeet daar moet het leren omgaan met de telefoon eenvoudiger gemaakt worden
4972699 het gaat erom of de telefoon iets relevants toe te voegen heeft aan het leven
4972700 the selection of the featured blogs is made on the following criteria a fair share of posts discuss current research the discussion is more about papers and articles than other blog posts op ed or newspaper articles the blog has been active for at least one month and seems to be managed in a sustainable manner the blog is about economics finance and their fringes it needs to be of academic nature
4972701 o you who believe fasting was prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you so that you may become pious fast for a fixed number of days but if any of you is ill or on a journey the same number should be made up from other days and as for those who can fast with difficulty they have to feed a poor person but whoever does good of his own accord it is better for him and that you fast it is better for you if only you knew
4972702 it is as the lord of glory said a fixed number of days rather it is a fixed number of hours the month of ramadan is either 720 hours or 696 hours and every minute of it has a price and a value the
4972703 o allah assist us in worshiping you in rajab and shaban and allow us to witness ramadan
4972704 we fear that we will miss the suhur praying behind ubayy and we fear that the fajr time will come causing us to miss the blessed meal they used to refer to suhur as the blessed meal so let our children rush to prepare the meal
4972705 i saw my teachers and some of them would not speak at all in ramadan rather they would only engage in worship either quran or prayer if someone were to speak to them they would count out their words and calculate them by the minutes and seconds
4972706 she will not be cured unless she puts on a cross
4972707 you really are devils you are from the disbelieving jinn
4972708 from now we have nothing to do with each other
4972709 i dare you to try to hurt me we will meet at midnight at the graveyard the most secluded and frightening place i can think of
4972710 whoever provides food for the fasting person then he will have the same reward as the fasting person without the fasting persons reward being diminished at all
4972711 our lord descends to the lowest heaven during the last third of the night asking
4972712 those who are patient those who are true the obedient with sincere devotion in worship to allah and those who spend in the way of allah and those who pray and beg allahs pardon in the last hours of the night
4972713 they used to sleep but little by night and in the hours before dawn they were asking for forgiveness
4972714 for me to sit with a group of people after the morning prayer remembering allah the mighty and majestic until the sun rises is more beloved to me than freeing four slaves from the children of ismail
4972715 and for me to sit with a group of people after the asr prayer remembering allah the mighty and majestic until the sun sets is more beloved to me than freeing four slaves from the children of ismail

4972727 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4972728 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4972729 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4972730 had sex with my girlfriend before i went to the gym
4972731 yup dan thats from the man himself he gives some pretty good sex tips but dont ever open the emails that dante sends you they usually have strange titles like doin da hoot hoot and when the pic was loading i just saw the top 1 4 of it and it was dante with his mouth open and the face of an extremely confused animal in front of him needless to say i wasted no time hitting delete one strange fella yea i didnt even open the why dont you love me and im just trying to make friends ones didnt even waste time with them nothing good can come out of an email entitled why dont you love me from a 300lb man to another guy
4972732 doggcrapp i dont know there is no fixed answer for that as recovery abilities are variable and genetics are variable
4972733 i have no understanding how people have to throw things in categories or its becomes just some kind of clusterfuck to them and they cant comprehend it otherwise i will state this right out i dont agree with mentzers diet mentzers over obsession with overtraining doing one set every 2 weeks to a month after he started out obsessive compulsive about doing forced reps negatives partials etc etc after every set the guy went one way and then went off the deep end the other way heres a novel approach dantes thoughts thats all this is my opinions on what i think builds muscle mass the fastest way possible and so far i think im building one hell of a track record proving it
4972734 if you weigh 200lbs and if you were on the absolutely 100 perfected by science bodybuilding training program if you were on the absolutely 100 perfected by science bodybuilding supplement program and you were on the absolutely 100 perfected by science bodybuilding gh and steroid program and you ate like a 13 year old girl scout your not going anywhere in this sport muscle wise
4972735 i see the problem right off the bat why are you eating like its 4 weeks out from a show when your in offseason gaining mode egg whites and chicken all day you might as well go on tuna and rice cakes this is offseason my man red meat steak hamburger whole eggs etc etc mcdonalds wendys burger king eat as many double burgers as you can hold the mayo so many burgers you cant eat the fries i look above and it looks like you start your carb cuttoff at 10am broccoli cauliflower salad for your 3rd 4th and 5th meals chow down trust in your cardio on off training days and your carb cuttoffs your 182lbs and your eating what a 160lb guy eats
4972736 how to do rack deadlifts in a power rack safety bars at knee level your pulling from knee level keep your back arched or at least flat the entire movement not rounded at all if your back starts rounding its time to end the set or your using too much weight personally i pull with an overhand and underhand deadlift grip and with my arms perfectly straight try to pull my shoulders up and back at the top i then do about a 4 5 second negative down but i wouldnt suggest that to others unless i can show how to do it i keep locked my back arched and knees slightly bent and lower it it kind of takes a little getting used too
4972737 i learned long ago that if you have troublesome triceps extension movements outside of nosebreakers seem to be a huge waste of valuable time
4972738 true story im walking out of the gym one day and this mother no not a milf jim
4972739 i will dump your ass so fast if you dont get on the same fucking page as me its not even funny
4972740 dc the second thing the cruise does is get the mindset back the appetite back and heal all aches and pains
4972741 nothing is sadder to me then some guy 205lbs who lifts for 5 6 years and is weighing 208lbs now
4972742 i cant even fathom how much food it takes me to maintain 280 300lbs so i sure as heck know how much food it took me to get here
4972743 if you double triple or quadruple your training weights in good safe form over the next year s or so your basically with diet going to be double or triple your current muscular size if your going to sit there and overanalyze this shit like its rocket science which it isnt i dont care what anyone tries to make it out to be and worry about things that really arent going to add up to pounds of muscle mass then blame yourself when you never get there
4972744 if the israelis dont resolve the palestinian prisoners issue soon and contemplate attacking gaza the palestinian resistance is prepared to not only defend the strip but also take the initiative and kidnap more soldiers who will never see the light of day unless a prisoner exchange deal is signed
4972745 australians are three times richer than their parents and grandparents were in the 1950s but they are no happier
4972746 jason giambi hit a home run off ryan franklin tonight how do you count that do we wipe that off the records or are home runs hit by a steroid hitter good if they come off a steroid pitcher
4972747 id much rather train a 200lb guy who is going to go at this 100 because he hasnt been able to get there
4972748 old school spindle training isolating the outer quadrant of section b of the pectoral with incline flyes pinky twist always changing exercises each workout to keep the body off balance bullshit
4972749 you can crap chicken into a bucket it doesnt mean your colonel sanders
4972750 those two were kazmiers training partners are you going to sit here on your high horse and tell this forum that the 3 time strongest man in the world had bad technique
4972751 yup dan thats from the man himself he gives some pretty good sex tips but dont ever open the emails that dante sends you they usually have strange titles like doin da hoot hoot and when the pic was loading i just saw the top 1 4 of it and it was dante with his mouth open and the face of an extremely confused animal in front of him needless to say i wasted no time hitting delete one strange fella
4972752 im not going to let the profileration of people who think they are hardcore to the bone but who are truly candyasses do this training that has my name on it no way in hell and ive seen alot of that lately too much every lame trainer around is trying to do this kind of training now thinking its the missing link and it pisses me off you know why your not growing because you are a lame trainer bottom line you have one chance with the logbook and this is low volume training which means you have one chance at doing it right you want to tell me to fuck off for being an ass to you then fine but you arent going to do my methods like a 13 year old girlscout without me saying something about it
4972753 he essentially would become a human blast furnace that would be the fastest way to make a 175lb natural guy a lean 250lb bodybuilder
4972754 after changing up to keep the body off balance lol
4972755 im going to turn that into a compound movement and destroy that thing
4972756 i really have to post on this in detail because ive changed my views on this slightly due to the feedback from my previous competitors but im going to put it in a nutshell here short version
4972757 one thing to remember and i hope jim paul puts this in the
4972758 i keep having a recurring nightmare that i would like to go away its like that
4972759 i have to be the nice guy because of trueprotein and being the origin of this dc training stuff
4972760 if you want to say my methods dont work and i say this stuff then come see me in person at insert gym name here ill be the second biggest guy there because nasser trains there now
4972761 i could put trunks on a broomstick and oil it up it would lose the symmetry round to you but it would win muscularity
4972762 thanks lou but i have not been practicing what i preach at all this year lol i dieted down from 298 to 272 for that show from october to december and then pulled out and then my training from january till now has been off and on with trueprotein coming to fruition
4972763 screw you dante youve been slacking it for 6 months anyway lol
4972764 i see some people are confused a little bit on the blasting and cruising and i want to clear something up this goes for enhanced as well as natural trainers the enhanced guys always blast hardcore for 4 8 weeks with a 2 week cruise natural guys do the same principle but i leave it up to them to when they want to cruise some natural guys start getting beat at 6 8 weeks of all out hardcore training and then some natural guys can go 3 4 months before they feel they should cruise either way you must cruise sometime and if you dont i promise you you will stagnate ok this is where some people are getting confused at the end of the cruising point whenever you start a new blasting you shouldnt look at the old blasting logbook and try to beat the last blasting ending weights just do this do your best and wing it and set all new baselines to destroy push hard but dont live and die by the last blastings numbers set new ones and destroy them your new baselines might be past your last blasting poundages or it might be slightly less regardless just do your best you can over the first 6 workouts setting new baselines start off with extreme stretching slow the first week back too you will see that at the end of every blasting you most definitely will be ahead of any weights you ever did for an exercise in a previous blasting
4972765 280lb inhuman who will chew on your car bumper if he knew you hit a deer the week before to get any remnants of protein
4972766 people figuring out yet that genetics and back breaking poundages used in training are what separates pro physiques and that drugs are not the telltale deciding factor better suited for people who have exhausted all means of training and have 3 5 years under their training belt the one way road to failure in bodybuilding is overanalyzing yourself to death and switching things up every 3 weeks before you even have a bit of a clue whats working
4972767 alot of people believe if they train like so and so pro bodybuilder or use the techniques that they used to build a bodypart that they will end up with the same development or close to it
4972768 if you do not or have not done rack deads in the past you will not want to learn them on the smythe in the old days we use to use a milk crate for the plates to sit on and that was just below the knee you can also use a bunch of aerobic steps to place the weights on go floor deads or just pick three other exercises for back thickness til you get to a gym with a good cage or rack
4972769 well my perfect man he treats me like a princess and he makes me feel like im the only person in the whole world and he takes me to wonderful places and makes me feel awesome
4972770 he knows he needs to bump this up to gain and bump that down if needed its a very very tough line to ride because if you dont give a little when trying to gain muscle mass because your so scared of putting on bodyfat here is the 100 truth unless your black or your genetics are up there on the elite scale
4972771 bigp3 yea i liked that sushi story when you told me last night i feel like this thread would be a good sticky either in the dogg pound or the pound puppy section there is a lot of good info here that could help people out a lot
4972772 h de m doet niks hier xd en volgens mij leest ze dit ook niet actief dus het is geen k i m randomness
4972773 this post is going to make me look like an ass so be it
4972774 well i cant play basketball and i cant rockclimb if i do deadlifts on thursdays and i dont want to use wrist straps because
4972775 try this next time anyone thats having trouble with hammer presses of any kind sit your ass as far back as it can go i mean press it against the pad hard or the metal beam raise your sternum upward and pinch your shoulderblades inward like when your doing a rear double bicep and at that point press back against the pad now with your back and stay in that position the whole entire set use your feet and leverage to keep you in that position sternum high ass pressed back hard and shoulder blades inward on ever single rep your breathing in on the eccentric part of the rep so your chest should be filling with air and raising anyway on the downswing but when the handles are coming back down to the rubber stoppers check yourself on every rep and make sure your back in that position when you push forward again this takes a millisecond and im actually checking my position right before the handles hit the rubber stops so as soon as they hit i push the positive again ive had to fix alot of guys on these over the years and if you can get them to stay in the rear double bicep pose position on these they work extraordinarily well but if you flatten your chest and especially at the top push with your front delts your waiting for injury to happen
4972776 sit at your desk right now and pretend your doing an incline bench press and control the weight down now do it again and count one onethousand two onethousand and see what you come up with for me it comes out to about 4 seconds whats it going to be on a t bar row it sure as hell wont be 4 seconds maybe 2 seconds what will it be on a squat if you go rock bottom and pause and raise up like i want you to do them it will probably be a true 3 4 seconds my whole reasoning of this is if you want to spend the time to research it on medline the positive part of a movement is a priming strengthening predominantly method and the eccentric is where most of the cellular disruption is taking place without getting too wordy here because im hungry and have to eat they tried testing with only positive movements and it had less effect than both together they tried to do eccentric only training and it didnt work as well without the positive explosive positive and controlled negative have been stated too many times too discount the trouble starts when people start overanalyzing this again to death with stopwatches if your controlling the weight down instead of just letting it drop then your doing a ok if you took the whole amount of people who are in lean shape but claim to be powerlifters and the whole amount of people who are in lean shape who claim to be bodybuilders or rather who are trying to look like one this group would be huge and made them stand in front of you you would see a glaring fact most of the powerlifters you would be able to tell that they lifted because of their thickness i would estimate that about 35 40 of the bodybuilders you would be able to actually tell lifted you can see this by going into your gym tonite see all those people lifting how many people in the gym are there and how many would you actually be able to tell are lifters if you saw them walk down the street the powerlifter group is a smaller number definitely but i can always tell a powerlifter in my gym big traps and thick muscle mass gee why is that its because powerlifters train with controlled movements for meets they lower a bench press bar slow touch their chest and power it up they descend under control in a squat and then power it up i pointed out in a post up above about boat rowers and lumberjack tree sawers who did predominantly positive movements and had no muscle mass to show for it while gymnasts do extended eccentric negative movments and always have a discernable musculature you do the math
4972777 im going to show you who the brahma bull in this gym is
4972778 im going to have everyone know exactly and i mean exactly what im talking about here

4972810 the predator state how conservatives abandoned the free market and why liberals should too
4972811 veblens vision of an essentially stable order yet dominated by a predatory and unproductive class was plainly too subversive for the marketeers yet it was also too cynical for the marxists and so it was effectively squeezed out of existence between them my father saw an economic world dominated by large interlocking organizations his achievement as an economist was to analyze that world it was a world in which veblenian predation was possible but in which the predatory instinct might come under enduring organizational control but as wr have seen the project of using private organizations to tame personal power failed the imperative of technological control over production processes was simply not strong enough especially in an age of globalization to keep the system in place power was again dispersed to finance to the tech firms and to the ceos this dispersion of power led to the reconnection of power with particular persons and this in turn to a result that would not have surprised veblen the reemergence of predation predatory conduct and pathologically predatory conduct as a central theme in business life once power passes back from organizations to individuals what are they going to do with it organizations may have complex social and technical objectives individuals generally do not as veblen told for the leisure class accumulation is mainly a way of keeping score but as power ebbed from the corporation in the late 1970s and 1980s and become vested once again in free acting individuals of the type we have described the basis for collaboration between comparatively progressive elemets within business and a broadely progressive state temded to disappear instead business leadership saw the possibility of something far more satisfactory from their point of view complete control of the apparatus of the state those who saw the economic activities of the government not in ideological terms but merely as opportunities for private profit on a continental scale this is the predator state whereas in the new industrial state the organization existed principally to master advanced technologies and complex manufacturing processes in the predator state the organization exists principally to master the state structure itself none of these enterprises has an interest in diminishing the size of the state and this is what separates them from principled conservatives for without the state and its economic interventions they would not themselves exist and could not enjoy the market power that they have come to wield their reason for being rather is to make money off the state so long as they control it and this requires the marriage of an economic and a political organization which is what in every single case we actually observe

4973107 we started everything we could in the first 500 to get ourselves into the race and essentially through the middle its a dogfight everybody wants a piece of it
4973108 we knew that we had a really solid 500 and it was just a matter of not waiting for it but going everyone together we closed the eyes and went for it
4973109 coming into the last 500 we seemed to get our rhythm and ian said go for it we committed everything we had and went
4973110 we knew it was tight we really had no idea where we were when we started that sprint
4973111 it was exhausting there wasnt anything left in the end
4973112 when we looked over i could see that our bow ball was definitely in front of the germans it was just making sure the judges were with us

4973133 a man who cared greatly about stature and status in the world of fiction

4973135 hes kind of acknowledged as the individual that founded the specialty of health care law

4973138 i realised we wouldnt make it back to linton and faced with the prospect of ejecting i carried out the emergency drill hoping instead to glide the aircraft to a forced landing
4973139 we broke through cloud at 2500 feet and both of us looked for somewhere flat and uninhabited on which to land from the corner of my eye i spotted rufforth airfield and turned towards it
4973140 i then made what may seem an unusual decision to shut down the engine by then it was doing more harm than good and i knew that by closing it down the aircraft would act more predictably in its final descent as well as increasing the gliding range
4973141 at about 700 feet in the final stages of the approach i thought we were not going to make it the safer option would have been for me to eject us both but the aircraft would have crashed onto rufforth village so we had to stay with it and i continued to fly the aircraft to the best of my ability hoping the situation would improve
4973142 ft lt dunn showed great presence of mind he displayed captaincy airmanship and handling skills well above that of his probationary instructor category he also minimised any potentially very serious collateral damage and saved a valuable aircraft
4973143 hes probably had the two best practices that he has ever had here at texas tech the last two practices

4973174 the biggest thing is i wanted him to play tougher
4973175 hes gotten off the line well hes blocked well hes come in with a tough guy mentality and youve got to do that especially at those inside positions
4973176 its going to be a tough decision but its good if its a tough decision that means theyre both playing good
4973177 right now id say brent has given me so much consistency it would be between him and marcus bunton knowing that pete richardson has done some really good things

4973190 ik heb nog nooit in een strafworpenserie van itali gewonnen
4973191 fantastisch als je op deze manier kunt winnen we hadden het in de reguliere speeltijd al moeten afmaken ook in de verlenging waren we beter een strafworpenserie is een loterij maar dan is het geweldig als keepster ilse van der meijden direct de eerste italiaanse pingel pakt dat gaf ons heel veel kracht

4973346 its been brilliant this campaign has been about pure perfection and were just an awesome team
4973347 it is a shame they were werent here but huge thanks to them
4973348 there is a lot of fuss being made over these reports that i have already made up my mind to retire i will go home and make my decision about what to do retiring is a possibility but i need time to think it over
4973349 we all really wanted to stand on the podium together and see the japanese flag raised
4973350 in the individual events its just me but in this one we all had to put our strength together
4973351 just to be able to get the top seed and not have to face the americans till the gold medal game is huge
4973352 we just knew we had to buckle down on defense and get stops to fuel our offense
4973353 we really got our running game going in the second half
4973354 definitely winning the pool and avoiding the u s until as late as possible is a huge thing for us
4973355 the first half we came out and did what we wanted offensively and defensively we always knew that australia is know as being a bunch of fighters and scrappers who would come back
4973356 we humans are indeed fortunate if we happen to be chosen to be owned by a cat
4973357 when i told people i was going to weightlifting they said how boring
4973358 but its not boring they are really great and powerful and its a great atmosphere
4973359 the rules are designed so that every lift is decisive
4973360 when youve achieved your goal or the opposite then the flood gates open even in the heavier divisions you have big strong men getting very emotional
4973361 i was under psychological pressure as i have not been competing for three years
4973362 this emotional outburst came as a result of everything that has happened to me in previous years
4973363 if you hang on to the bar too long thats what happens
4973364 ahora yiwu ha devenido en la mayor base de producci n de joyas de la parte continental por lo que los precios de yiwu determinan los precios al por menor de mi negocio
4973365 we were looking fine in the first 25 minutes but we dropped our heads after the first goal
4973366 the other two goals were disappointing they came from set pieces were were naive in both situations
4973367 i think the scoreline is a bit harsh as one or two things did not go our way
4973368 we improved when they came on and i think we will be better when we gain experience in the premier league
4973369 thomas sorensen played well in goal and i am confident kitson will get goals for us
4973370 we made a lot of changes in the summer both on and off the field and you hope things go as planned
4973371 in fact we had such an exceptional weeks training i said to my wife i had nothing to moan about
4973372 so for things to go like the did today you have to be pleased because stoke caused us a lot of problems
4973373 we had to deal with long throws and crosses into the box in the main we did that and to score goals at the time we did gave us the momentum to go on and win the game it was a fair result
4973374 he is a good player and there is going to be an obvious link with nicolas anelka
4973375 but he is not like him at all you would not see nic working across the line closing down defenders and making block tackles
4973376 obviously we have been concentrating on the game and since friday our minds have been on the game
4973377 for the moment berbatov is a spurs player we are happy with him he is part of the spurs squad and there is nothing to say about it i dont have any comment to make on it
4973378 we actually opted for giovani dos santos because we thought that his speed would be something that would trouble middlesbrough
4973379 however as middlesbrough tired in the game we thought it might be the right moment in the game to throw on berbatov
4973380 we have lost one forward robbie keane lets just see if were capable of adding to the squad in one or two areas putting an end to any purchases and then seeing how we can get everyone to play as a team and as an efficient unit
4973381 its really good that weve got a platform to build on
4973382 spurs are a good side they obviously had a couple of players in their team who havent played in the premier league before we watched their pre season games and we felt no one had pressed them the way that we intended to and nobody had got at them in the way we intended to
4973383 we had certain ideas about where we were happy for them to have the ball and where we didnt want them to have it and the players fulfilled all the plans
4973384 that will give confidence to everybody theyre a young group of players and they have bought in completely to what were doing
4973385 no we are hunting that finish line all the way
4973386 this has been going on and on about santa cruz and other people
4973387 the more you keep on about it the more it unsettles what we are trying to achieve
4973388 i do not want to keep saying this but nobody is going to be leaving the club
4973389 we want to keep our best players be it santa cruz warnock or mccarthy and any one of a dozen players
4973390 lets dispel all this no one is leaving the club we have had a really good start in this game
4973391 we have won at everton and not many teams do that apart from the top four it was a great achievement
4973392 the whole performance was fantastic to come from behind twice and win was outstanding i would have settled for a point at one stage
4973393 that was very good stuff i am very pleased with the win
4973394 in the first half we were the better team and controlled the game and we should have been two or three up
4973395 then they hit us with an equaliser that really killed us it affected the way we started the second period
4973396 but once they got the second goal it seemed to lift us we were level straight away and kept going right to the end
4973397 i would have settled for 2 2 at one point but it is funny how things work out on the balance of play we deserved the three points
4973398 the whole performance was fantastic to come from behind twice and win was outstanding
4973399 i told my defence to stay back and keep the point but in the last few minutes they ignored all that and went up to win us the game
4973400 this win showed great team spirit it dispels all the crap that people are saying about us
4973401 the lads wanted to fight to the final whistle and it showed we had spirit in abundance
4973402 our defending at times was rubbish we had experienced players internationals who were not at the races today
4973403 we gave away a daft free kick for their winner and even then ryan nelsen was offside when the ball came into the box
4973404 it was hard for the linesman to see that but nelsen had moved from an offside position to head against the bar
4973405 on the balance blackburn probably deserved the win but we had enough chances and once we were ahead we should have had defenders out there who could have hung on to the victory
4973406 the spirit of the football club was there for everybody to see
4973407 the fitness levels in the second half were incredible as was the passion and the drive the character was tremendous
4973408 before the game we said to the players that fulham didnt travel too well last season and we tried to exploit their weaknesses
4973409 we stuck to a game plan and the substitutions changed the game late on
4973410 im really happy because there werent many times last season we came from behind to win
4973411 could i have asked for more i would have liked a clean sheet as those are going to be very important this season
4973412 he geovanni gives us something that we perhaps didnt have last season a little bit of quality in the middle
4973413 he didnt really get a fair crack of the whip at manchester city last season and i couldnt believe it when he became available
4973414 at times in the first half we were on the back foot and their goal knocked the stuffing out of us
4973415 we were chasing shadows for 15 minutes after that and if they had got a second it probably would have been game over
4973416 we were prepared for the game but we just didnt play as well in the second half as we did in pre season
4973417 in the first half i think the team were coming together well and we played some good football
4973418 it became a fight at both ends in the second half and in those circumstances it was always possible a defensive error would settle the match which is what happened
4973419 its tough to come away without a result after the first half performance but hull were very motivated in the second half they chased things down and we made some mistakes as a result
4973420 a fee in the region of 3million has been agreed

4973483 at the end of our community service we all took trash bags to the dumpster and dumped them in there at the same time so we all finished community service together
4973484 hes got a proven track record hell get them competitive its hard to beat a whole bunch of teams at duke but they should be very competitive soon
4973485 im not avoiding the question but i dont think we can think that way
4973486 when your seniors have won two games in their career when your last home victory was sept 17 2005 for us to get beyond focusing totally on beating james madison in the opener is a big mistake
4973487 im not going to burden our guys with numbers and predictions because i dont want them thinking that way
4973488 the thing i would characterize as a success is believing you can win and competing like you can win every week thats a bigger deal than you think
4973489 we went through that at ole miss when youre playing lsu or youre playing alabama or auburn you know youre not supposed to win that somethings going to happen even if we get a little lead that was the biggest challenge we faced there early on its magnified 100 times at duke
4973490 i want people coming to duke eventually because they want to play at a great football program and they happen to get a great education on the side rather than coming just to get a great education and they dont care what kind of football program it is
4973491 looking back on it now i feel we were kind of out of shape
4973492 if you look at it wed be in a lot of games to the end and we couldnt finish the game off i believe it was because players got tired the want to was there wed just get tired
4973493 i think were going to be able to throw the football pretty well
4973494 for duke to be better weve got to find a way to be a more physical offense and more balanced
4973495 the skys the limit were under a new regime right now and things are looking very very positive for duke football we cant just talk about what were going to do were going to go out and show people so they can believe
4973496 we havent earned that right yet no ones going to give you anything were going to earn the right to win sometime somehow
4973497 it will eventually come together that were winning more than were losing sometime i dont know when but it will
4973498 there was nothing we could do but make the best of it
4973499 i dont ever want to deal with a storm like that again believe me it will change your attitude for the worse
4973500 its a wonderful day for jamaica it was a stunning performance and were so proud of you
4973501 the games are not yet over and we expect a lot more from the team in the days ahead but i can assure you that we are planning a massive welcome home party for all of you
4973502 we have chances in the mens 200m womens 200m the womens 100m hurdles the mens 400m hurdles the womens 400m and all four relays
4973503 so we have a lot of expectations that there are more medals to be won
4973504 i knew he had it in him i cant wait for him to break the 200m record and then run 42 seconds in the 400m
4973505 he has taken jamaica on his back and demolished the whole world that is the respect to be given to the greatest sprinter of all time
4973506 it was euphoria it was the greatest feeling ive had in all my life because jamaica has never had the joy and glory of a gold medal in the 100m sprint in my 60 years
4973507 and in addition to getting our first gold he broke the world record it is an experience that is almost unspeakable it brought me out in goose bumps
4973508 that wasnt just my feeling but the whole of jamaica i got reports from the districts and cities back home where people were out on the streets hailing the victory
4973509 it was good old vintage reggae it was tremendous of the organisers they were able to find a piece of music that helped us celebrate
4973510 we are expecting at least another five medals from the track and we feel very confident if we do that then i would not be surprised if we declared a national holiday
4973511 its ridiculous to say he was disrespectful in the way he finished
4973512 hes a young athlete hes having a great time and this sport of all sports needs that hes carefree hes got the talent he did not do it in a disrespectful way he is just excited about his sport

4973516 i will say at once quite firmly that the best grounding for education is the latin grammar i say this not because latin is traditional and mediaeval but simply because even a rudimentary knowledge of latin cuts down the labor and pains of learning almost any other subject by at least fifty percent it is the key to the vocabulary and structure of all the teutonic languages as well as to the technical vocabulary of all the sciences and to the literature of the entire mediterranean civilization together with all its historical documents

4973520 it is with great sadness that i have learned of the death of the great irish singer ronnie drew
4973521 ronnie was a champion of traditional irish music and with the dubliners he re energised and refreshened our unique musical heritage he brought great pleasure to the people of ireland and yet more around the world ronnie will be greatly missed by many but most particularly by his family with whom our thoughts are today
4973522 weddings funerals bar mitzvahs thats what i loved about ronnie drews voice and spirit music to inspire to console an optimism that was contagious thats what u2 took from the dubliners
4973523 ronnie has left his earthly tour for one of the heavens they need him up there its a little too quiet and pious god is lonely for a voice louder than his own then the bad weather will break
4973524 god is lonely for a voice louder than his own
4973525 ronnie drew was an iconic figure in irish music over the last five decades i met him and admired his music his unique singing voice was loved by so many people
4973526 ronnie whether as part of the dubliners or during his solo career will also be remembered for his promotion of irish music both at home and around the world
4973527 ronnie drew with his distinctive voice and wonderful sense of humour was truly a dublin icon
4973528 a man who is now part of our modern folk history ronnie drew will be sorely missed by his fans not just in ireland but around the world
4973529 my sympathy is extended to his family and wide circle of friends at this sad time
4973530 it is not exaggeration to say that ronnie drew was a legend and his sad passing will be felt both at home and abroad
4973531 his contribution to irish music and irish life was immeasurable and his influence will be felt for many many years to come
4973532 i wish to convey my sympathies and all those of the fine gael party to ronnies family and hope that they found some solace in the joy that he brought to so many people through his music and gregarious character
4973533 and i have been able to trace the ideas origin as far as stalwartmoonpie it struck a chord with me i think i had been talking to too many pub bound aussies that day and i just could not resist

4973631 everything from television radio and print ads to a youtube page web advertising and a substantial grassroots organizing effort
4973632 its the most important issue in the election to us
4973633 but that doesnt mean we cant continue to run ads that address the issue
4973634 ive heard that from other folks he was intended to be intimidating but the whole card check things is intimidating the question is how do you educate someone in 30 seconds on an issue you can bring a voter to water but you cant make them go further if they dont want to
4973635 and they told me i would be welcomed to buy an ad
4973636 who tie things up to try to prevent us from coming in
4973637 to bargain with their employers for better wages and benefits
4973638 doesnt have the resources to buy the kind of ad time
4973639 out of state allies spending money in new hampshire trying to distort jeanne shaheens position
4973640 attempts to link tom allen and maines 67 000 union members to organized crime this is wrong and has no place in this campaign
4973641 my legal counsel advised me not to go as there are other legal issues involved in the case if im such a thief why is there no class action suit with all the investors
4973642 we can slice it dice it any way we want
4973643 we can resell it and if anyone is interested in that wed be interested in talking to them
4973644 i was approached by schani krug after i met him at caf brioche
4973645 he was quite a con artist and had the gift of gab i invested because marilyn monroe was an icon it has been terrible i dont know why i invested and i was advised by two lawyers not to i still see him hanging out in portsmouth
4973646 for them to perpetuate this legacy of deception is nefarious
4973647 they have false information and most investors are on my side the truth will be known that all they allege is not true jim dougherty and i were friends if they manage to get rid of me they keep all the money and the other investors do not get paid and they make me a thief and scoundrel massages i have a back injury but the dating services thing is ludicrous i was sleeping on an air mattress for three years and made the film for less than it could have cost
4973648 it was earthy and warm and i knew exactly how id design it
4973649 people need to be with their pets in order for them to heal
4973650 the owners are nervous the pets dont understand whats happening its important that they have a place thats warm
4973651 i want this to be a calming place for them
4973652 so they can see out they may be contagious but that doesnt mean they should be isolated completely
4973653 they didnt want a cold sterile place we were very much in sync that way
4973654 thats maybe the single worst decision in the last 50 years in the city of portsmouth
4973655 it would be wonderful if it can some day be done elsewhere
4973656 i and many others were pretty concerned with the kind of people hanging out there and the kind of things that were going on out there
4973657 we are a small church and as a retired pastor my heart would like to see them grow a little
4973658 we think about gas mileage fuel costs for the have nots but to think that the churches are going to struggle too especially small churches so we are coming up with creative ways of addressing this
4973659 the young granddaughter of one of the members of our church came in and said this church has a heartbeat
4973660 this has been one of the examples of that heartbeat
4973661 people ask me what is your goal and i come back and say 70 pounds but the goal is to stay healthy and lose as much as we can in a healthy way and also to exercise grace with those who are trying to lose and the numbers arent coming up the way theyd like
4973662 we have a big church and its expensive to heat
4973663 we had something similar many years ago and did it for a different reason i thought doing it now for fuel would be a benefit for the church
4973664 people are giving up the things they love like sweets or for some its carbohydrates everyone is pretty much using their own method some are just cutting down on the amount of food reducing portions by half and staying busy
4973665 we have a great support system in place for everyone where they can get together with the other pledges do walking and share recipes
4973666 the efforts and love and support that weve received within the church and outside the church has been a great support system for all of us and whenever we feel we are going to backslide we all tap into that reserve of faith and support
4973667 but i was more trying the get the kids interested in it
4973668 one things i liked was i wanted to get other people interested in alternative energy its so necessary to get off oil
4973669 the things expensive but anyone who can help should help
4973670 i want to make sure people know that this is something we do every night
4973671 you can see everything that happened everything the staff did as a precaution until they leave the parking lot what happens after that i cant control anymore
4973672 he was a nice clean cut american boy ive known the powers family for years and theyre the kind of family thats always giving back to the community you dont see that too often

4973676 wolves consume many prey animals a minimum of 150 200 moose contribute to an isle royale wolfs diet over the course of its lifetime and the prey consume a whole lot of plants
4973677 just by being who they are wolves and other top predators increase the sample size because they do the sampling for us
4973678 since the widespread combustion of fossil fuels we have put a human fingerprint on atmospheric carbon dioxide
4973679 that fingerprint shows up in trees and it shows up in animals that eat trees but it shows up with the least variation in the top predators
4973680 its noisy for trees less noisy for moose and even less noisy for wolves
4973681 in a way this whole study can be summed up by asking how many trees does a wolf represent
4973682 instrumental measurements of environmental variables are only available for about the past few hundred years so this may help us understand paleo environmental change better and if we can understand ancient environments better then our ability to predict future changes is improved
4973683 stable isotopes ecological integration and environmental change wolves record atmospheric carbon isotope trend better than tree rings
4973684 we wanted to investigate what was behind the observed sex differences in asthma rates and ar
4973685 this is the first study to prospectively examine the natural history of sex differences in asthma in this manner
4973686 while our results were not unexpected they do point to intriguing potential mechanisms to explain the gender differences in asthma incidence and severity especially intriguing is that the differences in gender begin at the time of transition into early puberty
4973687 it will be of great interest to follow these children over time to see what happens with ar and severity of asthma in adulthood
4973688 we are now able to perform a secondary analysis with an emphasis on those who have reached clinical normalcy
4973689 they dont see as much difference between themselves and others
4973690 students who dont cheat seem to be in the minority and have plenty of opportunities to see their peers cheat and receive the rewards with little risk of punishment
4973691 we see avoiding cheating as a form of everyday heroism in an academic setting
4973692 the heroes didnt rationalize cheating the way others did they didnt come up with excuses and say it was ok because lots of other students were doing it
4973693 these 29 percent are like undecided voters they would be an especially good focus for intervention
4973694 our results suggest that interventions may have a real opportunity to influence at least a quarter of the student population

4973696 middle ear infection is a common childhood disease and obesity is a growing problem worldwide
4973697 any potential association between these two public health issues is of considerable interest
4973698 this suggests that taste damage from ear infections may alter food choice and thus lead to obesity risk
4973699 this data suggests that there are lingering effects of tonsillectomies on taste nerves and that can affect eating habits
4973700 inflation costs have not been addressed by the state funding formulas for three years
4973701 unless the state adjusts the formula well be looking at cutting something
4973702 i believe the finance system needs to be reformed so there is not only an index for inflation which includes gas utilities and insurance costs which are going up for all school districts as well as an ability for the school districts to keep more of their money

4973711 a group of native hawaiians claiming to be the states legitimate rulers occupied the grounds of a historic palace for two hours before being arrested by state officers in the second recent takeover of its kind

4973718 if you have good drying weather and no humidity you can cut it early one morning and bale it the following afternoon
4973719 ive had the best year ever we got all our first crop off early then we fertilized and we have a great second crop thats almost ready to cut when the rains came we were all done
4973720 as long as that hay is sitting on the ground its going to be sucking the moisture right up out of the ground
4973721 most of it is grown by dairy producers followed by livestock producers
4973722 most of these operations have a little extra they can sell to other farms first and foremost when we have a reduction in the crop that means that most of these farms are going to have to buy some feed to replace what they havent been able to grow
4973723 now its getting to the point where the days are going to get shorter
4973724 ive bailed second crops in october but the days are so short then you have to have five full days of sun so the gamble is real high
4973725 we were already dead in the water before we even got started
4973726 if thats the case hay will be running seven to eight dollars a bale out of the barn never mind delivery youre going to be looking at 10 a bale delivered
4973727 its an excellent quality feed but it just means theres less dry hay available

4973735 if you add in other risk factors for cardiovascular disease stress or high blood pressure this could be potentially deadly
4973736 the study does not show effects which would go beyond drinking a normal cup of coffee
4973737 if you have any predisposition to cardiovascular disease id think twice about drinking it
4973738 wow you could see this huge billowing column of black smoke over the city
4973739 it was very worrisome because theres a lot of industrial buildings right near the fire and if it got out of control it could get bad very fast
4973740 the fire has entirely been limited to these unoccupied homes

4973761 natural supplements vs pharmaceutical drugs the politics of surviving cancer
4973762 if one were to believe all the media hype the triumphalism of the medical profession in published research and the almost weekly miracle breakthroughs trumpeted by the cancer charities one might be surprised that women are dying at all from this cancer
4973763 challenge dogma and redirect research efforts along more fruitful lines
4973764 aside from certain rare cancers it is not possible to detect any sudden changes in the death rates for any of the major cancers that could be credited to chemotherapy whether any of the common cancers can be cured by chemotherapy has yet to be established
4973765 some oncologists inform their patients of the lack of evidence that treatments work others may well be misled by scientific papers that express unwarranted optimism about chemotherapy still others respond to an economic incentive physicians can earn much more money running active chemotherapy practices than they can providing solace and relief to dying patients and their families
4973766 as a chemist trained to interpret data it is incomprehensible to me that physicians can ignore the clear evidence that chemotherapy does much much more harm than good
4973767 the personal views of many oncologists seem to be in striking contrast to communications intended for the public
4973768 indiscriminate automatic adjuvant chemotherapy was replacing the halsted radical mastectomy as therapeutic overkill in the united states
4973769 the treatment of this tumor now has slipped from too much surgery to too much adjuvant therapy

4973778 the security plan required thousands of security personnel including more than 2 000 women police workers
4973779 the pilgrims were aware that these measures were for their safety and to protect them from terrorist attacks
4973780 this was the most successful ceremony since the fall of the saddam hussein regime because we did not face any problems as we marched for seven days to reach karbala
4973781 the security measures were in our interest as several pilgrims were attacked while on their way to karbala from baghdad
4973782 i had no fear this year the pilgrimage was successful

4973786 i know we were expecting and planning for some medals but i dont think anyone could expect three medals from the girls so this is really big moment for russia
4973787 the olympics is truly about participation but its also your moment in time
4973788 today my moment in time was with my sister who i love almost more than anyone in the world its just amazing to think that we could participate and bring home a gold medal

4973790 five of the six irb regions are represented with italy jamaica and russia signalling an interest to tender for a rugby world cup for the first time
4973791 such a response highlights the growing development and popularity of rugby across the world
4973792 the strong response also justifies the irbs move to award two tournaments at the same time this provides longer term certainty for the hosts rugby world cup limited rwcl and the tournaments commercial partners

4973796 the ceasefire is fragile like all ceasefires but it is absolutely necessary for diplomatic and political pressure to continue
4973797 the russian military has effective control over the gori region making it responsible for the security and well being of all people living there
4973798 russia should prevent any further militia attacks and allow humanitarian aid to reach the hundreds of vulnerable civilians still in the area including many elderly

4973867 honestly dear why dont you just put the sweets away
4973868 i tossed it all into the bin and we went to meet fred and george for lunch

4973871 why dont you catch a shower while i take care of the mess
4973872 you killed them didnt you i managed them by myself all week long but i leave you alone with them for less than an hour and you do away with them

4973874 well those were the only two youre getting from me so dont come over here with any bright ideas about making a couple more
4973875 so thats what you did with them you left them on your parents doorstep
4973876 hurry we dont have much time ill grab some clothes and you get a trunk theyll be returning them soon
4973877 wrong again we would be found out much too quickly and mum and dad would only fill em up with loads of chocolate frogs to punish us before sending them back home completely counter productive dont you think
4973878 i know you left them at the orphanage in diagon alley didnt you
4973879 i tried to leave them there but apparently our daughters reputations precede them the bird at the front desk said something about a lady with brown curly hair that the girls called mummy attempting to leave them there before anything you would like to tell me wife
4973880 im a bit tired of this game really i can think of a few other games i want to play with you though
4973881 i can go and fetch em home if youd like
4973882 no i did not say a thing about fetching them however
4973883 i will sound like a bad mother if i dont even know where my own children are wont i
4973884 after the week youve had sweetheart i think you get bonus points seeing as how theyre still among the living
4973885 so you noticed then how bad it was i mean
4973886 not really and im sorry bout that babe mum opened my eyes for me this morning
4973887 that woman does get her messages across loud and clear doesnt she
4973888 i noticed when i got home the past few nights after you and the girls were already asleep that your usually must be neat and tidy house looked like it had been hit by a tornado or two i should have paid more attention youre typically a light sleeper and i dont think you woke up once when i climbed in beside you the past few nights im sorry you got stuck doing so much of this by yourself while weve been testing this product we made some real progress but it still needs a lot of work
4973889 im glad you made progress but ive missed you fred
4973890 back to these bonus points weasley what do they get me
4973891 when i tell you youre going to think your husband is so brilliant that youll climb on top of him and rip his clothes off
4973892 how many times do i have to tell you thats not my name anymore
4973893 youll always be granger to me it only matters that everyone else knows youre my wife hermione
4973894 i have decided to take this week off from the shop
4973895 but the new george need your help i know the two of you were trying to get it ready to put on the shelves before people begin shopping for the start of term at hogwarts and its already july wont you run out of time
4973896 it probably wont be ready for august but its not a tragedy itll be ready for christmas instead
4973897 oh fred now i feel guilty i didnt mean to take you away from the shop the shop usually triples its profits during august while people are shopping for school supplies in diagon alley
4973898 it does and one product is not going to change that its not like were foundering anymore wheezes is making galleons hand over fist the shops exceeded all of our expectations george and i talked this evening and i told him i needed to be home for a while
4973899 george nah he knows if i tell him i need to be home theres a reason one of the joys of having a twin is they rarely question your motives listen to me hermione the shops important but not more important than my family or my marriage frankly baby out of the three you seem to be the one who needs my attention most right now i think ive been a bit neglectful of late
4973900 i still feel guilty and a little selfish but the girls and i are going to love having you home
4973901 no theyre not because the girls are not going to be here
4973902 they are going to be gone for the next seven nights it is just going to be the two of us
4973903 after the week youve had it seemed only fair that you should get a break from the demons we call daughters so your brilliant husband went to the ministry of magic and called in a favour with minister shacklebolt
4973904 it is good to have connections amaze me with your brilliance husband
4973905 when you put it that way how can i resist
4973906 you know love its not really punishment if you enjoy it so much that ya beg for it
4973907 as i was saying thats a place for our daughters to stay every night for a week
4973908 you sent our daughters to the dragon reserve in romania tonight
4973909 sarcasm really does not become you fred theyll drive poor charlie spare hell be bringing them back in the next hour
4973910 we should take advantage of this time alone while we can
4973911 ah but there is more my beautiful wife tell me im marvellous granger
4973912 brilliant and marvellous think rather highly of yourself tonight dont you
4973913 lee jordans sister happens to be working at the floo regulation commission and as of a few minutes ago our fireplace has been disconnected from the floo network theres no way in except through the front and back doors and i put up the wards
4973914 that is why i love you weasley when you see an opportunity you dont let it slip by
4973915 its just what if george needs you for something with the shop
4973916 what if something happens that your family needs to tell us something about the girls
4973917 fred im worried theyve never been away from me for long and well i know george is good with them and all but what if they need
4973918 you really are a good mum yknow and with those two it cannot be easy some days
4973919 george has agreed to run the shop by himself for the entire week and take both of our daughters for a day as well he knows how to get through the wards and the others can contact him if something goes wrong george will get us if anything comes up we should know about and he wont bring the girls back because he actually thinks theyre fun you know in small doses he said if they become too much for one of the others hell take them for the extra night
4973920 now that ive answered all your bloody questions may i continue what i was doing
4973921 good morning handsome im sorry i fell asleep last night
4973922 mornin hermione i hope the hot water in my flat goes out more often if this is the way you welcome everyone who borrows your shower
4973923 ya know you were a lot more personable a minute ago
4973924 that is because i just shared a rather intimate shower with your brother think you might warn me next time were not alone
4973925 i believe your brothers a bit larger than you love
4973926 oh i think it was almost as funny as my shower with george you prat
4973927 i am sorry i fell asleep on you last night
4973928 i should probly be the one apologising for molesting you before i realised you were snoring and not moaning
4973929 show me how disappointed you were and i will see what i can do to make it up to you
4973930 ah come on granger wont mind weve gotten close ya know we even share showers on occasion
4973931 besides i hear women fall asleep in bed with you so you obviously need a few pointers its a tough job and all but im willing to make the sacrifice for you brother
4973932 no i told you who just well happened to not be you and oh this is
4973933 well one of us needs to reset the wards before another of your relatives or our friends decides to pay us a visit and you happen to be the only one of us who is clothed
4973934 i really hate to admit youve got a point as many people as there are in my family one of them is bound to show up especially after they hear we have a community shower mum may feel the need to have a serious talk with you about your lascivious behaviour with my brother love
4973935 if thats what taking a shower with my brother does for you love well invite him over more often
4973936 im sorry but that was too good to pass up its been too long since i shagged you good and proper
4973937 come on lazy i want breakfast gotta keep my strength up and all
4973938 if we move away before the week is over how long do you think it would take your brothers to find us
4973939 with the threat of raising our daughters as motivation two hours tops
4973940 i was afraid thats what you were going to say its been a while now how do you think its going
4973941 baby the girls are fine no need to worry about em
4973942 george promised to check in on him and make sure they hadnt killed him as soon as he got back to the shop i think we would have heard by now if there was a funeral to attend
4973943 youve given me plenty to smile about this morning i was just thinking about what we might do with the rest of our day
4973944 there are certain things which are off limits when joking in this house thats one of those things you arse
4973945 ah but i did love it when you were pregnant
4973946 you loved the shagging when i was pregnant because we did it all the time ive never been so randy in my life its a wonder we didnt both die from exhaustion
4973947 nothing limits intelligence more than ignorance nothing fosters ignorance more than ones own opinions nothing strengthens opinions more than refusing to look at reality

4974025 everyone thinks samantha is lindsays first lesbian love but we were very passionate until her fear of being found out drove us apart
4974026 at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies
4974027 but then samantha came on to the scene and i was dropped
4974028 she met lindsay in the summer of 2006 at a party in malibu
4974029 from the start lindsay was very confused about her feelings for courtenay so did more and more drugs to stifle the sexual attraction she was experiencing
4974030 but eventually she just gave in and at every party theyd kiss and touch each other in the corner its a miracle nobody found out
4974031 both of them would do lines of cocaine in the toilets then head home and fall into bed together
4974032 back then samantha and lindsay didnt have a physical relationship
4974033 apparently samantha acted in a paternal way towards her giving her advice and cuddles
4974034 by now lindsay was sending i love you notes to samantha and signing them lindsay ronson but telling courtenay she loved her too
4974035 courtenay would throw fits of rage writing her hundreds of angry e mails from another room in the house
4974036 the sexual attraction between them was electric though and theyd still kiss and make up
4974037 courtenay still cant understand how lindsay is now so open with samantha
4974038 we have to break up because im going to uni

4974094 the last time you went out with your friends you got so drunk that you puked on your shirt
4974095 but honey i promise that i wont drink a drop of alcohol all night
4974096 sh t the old lady is going to throw my ass out of the house for getting drunk and puking on my new shirt
4974097 all you got to do is have a 20 bill in your hand when you walk through the door then when she accuses you of barfing all over yourself just tell her that some other drunk puked on you and that he gave you 20 bucks to get the shirt cleaned
4974098 i knew that your drunk ass would spew bile and booze all over that new shirt
4974099 honey let me explain this drunken fool at the bar puked on me and gave me 20 bucks to have it cleaned
4974100 is that so then where did the other 20 dollar bill come from
4974101 oh thats from the guy who sh t in my pants

4974122 if its a poor choice you spend the next 60 days worrying about the other plane
4974123 as long as it takes if i have to be here 20 years ill be here 20 years
4974124 we see her pain and her quest for answers but in suicide cases we often cant give those answers
4974125 its very common for relatives to have a difficult time accepting how their loved one died all we can do is make sure we covered every base and be as thorough as we can and try to provide the family with answers
4974126 i talked to him the day after christmas and he was as happy as hed ever been
4974127 hed reached a point at work and in life where he didnt have anything to prove he was content
4974128 shes produced multiple claims that we cannot document or substantiate some of which quite frankly arent even believable
4974129 you have to take a look at the overall facts and scenarios and determine if any of those claims and allegations are accurate or even make sense and fit the crime scene the only reasonable conclusion that you can come to is that this was a suicide
4974130 maam do you realize your brother blew his brains out
4974131 as far as being able to go out and do the things he wants to do hes been able to do that
4974132 thats so much better than a number on a scale
4974133 last i heard he can still ride a bike as opposed to being a week or 10 days from dying
4974134 i notice that stress eating is something i do well
4974135 whatevers in the refrigerator is what gets put in the tank
4974136 instead of portioning the chips out of the sack and then putting the sack clear in the other room thats one of the things he has a little problem with
4974137 its either curl up in the corner and cry or keep it light and try to get through it
4974138 i could be pretty upset pretty easily but why should i be everything would get worse my health would start going downhill theres no profit in it
4974139 so you might as well say your prayers talk to the lord and let him handle it and do your best to get through it until he does thats what i do
4974140 section d continued but i need my header to read
4974141 fortunately the market isnt big enough to have some huge corporations try to take over box making if they did it takes the human mind hand connection out of the production thats really really critical some huge production facility could never be able to input that at all
4974142 this is my 62nd year here im just waiting for them to kick me out
4974143 if youve been here any length of time like i have everythings comfortable everythings like an old friend
4974144 its kind of weird i suppose but you can feel connections through people and processes that happened before you
4974145 not only do i think it brings something to wilton but i think it brings something to the state of new hampshire as well as the country
4974146 anytime you end up being the last of anything it would be a real shame to lose it so were hoping we can find someone to come in and learn and take over and continue this for another 50 years 100 years
4974147 its so important in a modern world today to be able to look and make a connection to how we got here this is one piece of that and it would be a shame to lose it
4974148 clearly families had to balance the gas costs and their other monthly costs in making a decision whether to attend
4974149 it should also include investments in job creation and infrastructure to help build new jobs and invest in the competitiveness of our businesses
4974150 anything that leaves more money in the pockets of those who earn paychecks
4974151 the real problem here is that congress failed to act until there was a crisis
4974152 the economic stimulus package this spring gave taxpayers back 600 of their own money but in order to get it those very same taxpayers spent millions of dollars so congress could tell us they were giving us our money back and then millions more actually delivering it
4974153 this wasnt an economic stimulus package this was a pr stunt
4974154 this years economic stimulus package seemed designed primarily to stimulate campaign contributions to incumbent congressmen
4974155 the first and best step congress can take to stimulate the economy is simply to get out of the way
4974156 there are 68 million acres of federal land already leased by oil companies for energy production now but sitting idle
4974157 oil companies should drill on these lands that are leased environmentally permitted and ready to go
4974158 we have to start addressing the real problem and stop attacking the symptoms
4974159 congress thereby the american taxpayer cannot be expected to jump in every time a poor financial decision has been made
4974160 personal responsibility must be required to function in a successful economy
4974161 few of the people debating vacation choices or family reunions are worried about deposits in excess of current limits provided by the fdic
4974162 i just couldnt live on one healthy foot anymore let alone try to skate
4974163 weve tried everything to avoid surgery because we knew it would mean missing a chunk of the season but nothing worked
4974164 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4974165 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4974166 my aim was to come out and win when i saw the time im celebrating im happy
4974167 he was definitely untouchable tonight he could have gone a lot faster if he had run straight through the line
4974168 its the first time ive entered a contest like this
4974169 i saw the ad in the paper and thought why not i think i got my entry in just in time
4974170 i just looked at the previous races in new hampshire and came up with a number
4974171 i really never thought i would win it i just figured id give it a shot
4974172 we need somebody else to knock sussex off and weve got other teams to get knocked off too its not just them
4974173 he was throwing his change up good keeping it low
4974174 his fastball he was spotting it basically he was just throwing his changeup when he needed to make a pitch he made a pitch
4974175 he didnt throw 95 but he was throwing strikes and locating
4974176 whatever he was doing we didnt adjust to it tonight
4974177 we thought about an abortion but then we felt its religiously forbidden
4974178 aquele viol o aquela batida chamada especial o canto mais econ mico a entrada do sil ncio na m sica um tipo de harmonia com inspira o no cool jazz o que jo o gilberto faz basicamente samba mas tocado de uma maneira muito sint tica toda concentrada no viol o e com um canto mais baixo isso o que configura basicamente a bossa nova
4974179 ele entrou com processo que est arrastado e os discos est o fora de cat logo
4974180 woolworths retail division has a negative value and is weighing on the share price the share price will only rise if woolworths gets rid of its retail division
4974181 a great deal to contribute to the recovery and growth of the woolworths group
4974182 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination
4974183 there are so many emotions going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
4974184 without the help of my team mates this isnt possible
4974185 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
4974186 but the whole loose trio were excellent i thought jerome kaino had his best game yet while rodney sooialo is always superb
4974187 we showed some real skill out there in defence the guys positional play was excellent
4974188 we gang tackled them and knocked them back i thought it was a courageous effort
4974189 it is tough because things can snowball but ive got a great bunch of guys around me
4974190 when you dont do things so well or when things are not coming off or you miss a kick you just look around you and your team mates are all putting their bodies on the line you push what happened behind you and you just refocus
4974191 it wasnt the drums that just makes you want to get it more
4974192 i have enjoyed my time with the wallabies immensely and there is still much to be done over the next few months
4974193 we are in the midst of a tri nations campaign and have a six match tour to hong kong and europe in november december
4974194 looking further ahead what this opportunity with the waratahs provides is an appealing opportunity to be at home more frequently
4974195 with four children thats very important to me and my family the travel demands over the past three seasons have been extensive
4974196 well have several months after the spring tour to consider the make up of the coaching staff for 2009 and beyond
4974197 michaels been working hard with our forwards for some time now and weve seen the results in the waratahs set piece play and scrummaging in particular
4974198 walking humbly with our god i know that i dont walk alone and i know that if i can get myself out of the way that i can maybe carry out in some small way what he intends
4974199 when i find myself taking the wrong step i find that a lot of the time it is because i am trying to protect myself and not do gods work
4974200 i know that i dont walk alone and i know that if i can get myself out of the way that i can maybe carry out in some small way what he intends
4974201 we still dont abide by that basic precept of matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4974202 when i find myself taking the wrong step i find that a lot of the time it is because i am trying to protect myself and not do gods work
4974203 for a minute there there was just two christians worshiping together ill never forget that moment
4974204 i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
4974205 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
4974206 ok we dont have to go longer on that one
4974207 weve got to drill now weve got to drill here
4974208 well if youve got book sales of 25 million you qualify
4974209 i would argue that if youre making more than 250 000 youre in the top 3 or 4 of the country and youre doing well
4974210 i think if youre just talking about income how about 5 million
4974211 mccain who is about to become the gop nominee has made several statements about how he divorced carol and married hensley that conflict with the public record
4974212 i spent as much time with cindy in washington and arizona as our jobs would allow
4974213 i was separated from carol but our divorce would not become final until february of 1980
4974214 colaboraci n total con las fuerzas y cuerpos de seguridad del estado
4974215 and the gay boys go wild throwing shapes you know its time to leave
4974216 i think they sent a message to everybody in the tournament they let everybody know that they are for real
4974217 they are playing with a purpose and that purpose is to win and show everybody else they are superior thats the bottom line
4974218 i was asked where has my offense went it aint go nowhere
4974219 its the same shots i was taking in the last couple games they just went in that comes from putting in extra work in practice before practice getting in a little better shape im going to continue doing that until the tournament is over
4974220 were not going to let up were trying to get ready and win a gold medal no matter how well we play
4974221 each game we dont know if were going to be tested or not we came into the greece game thought we were going to be tested spain game though we were going to be tested
4974222 if at the end of the tournament thats where we are well take that
4974223 i will continue to struggle and work hard hopefully this is the start of many good things to come
4974224 im definitely pleased that if i couldnt do it she was the one
4974225 and im old enough to be able to handle it
4974226 i wouldnt have come back if i wasnt ready to come back
4974227 its what i do get out on the sidelines and get the boys fired up
4974228 i dont think we even expected this to turn out as it did
4974229 i was pretty calm until i got on the trampoline
4974230 theyve got to know now that if they play like that they can win this thing
4974231 i am a big girl but thats a lot of weight
4974232 we were looking into buying our own camping east car and we called dave davis to get more information on one
4974233 it just so happened that he didnt have a driver anymore and gave us an opportunity to run loudon
4974234 its going to be like a hometown race for me
4974235 a bunch of people have already told me that theyre going and making signs for me its a big deal for me and my whole family
4974236 ive been to loudon a bunch of times to watch races
4974237 but i dont think its really sunk in yet that ill actually be racing there it will be really cool just to be on the track
4974238 weve been working towards this for so many years and now we have a real first class opportunity to shine in front of all the hometown people who will be watching at loudon
4974239 i learned a lot from the first camping east race
4974240 the racing is completely different from what im used to and the cars are a lot heavier and more powerful having that experience from thompson will help me so much more at loudon
4974241 its no slouch on equipment id be really happy with a top 10 finish but who knows what could happen with this great car
4974242 the only thing we can do is go out and play to our highest ability and play to what we are capable of i think we are all excited for this opportunity to prove we can get it done
4974243 i am not officially the starter for the season but i feel confident that i can be the starter and i am excited for the opportunity
4974244 there have been flashes and i think youll see some moments when youll say
4974245 kevin boss is going to be a good receiver hes going to make a lot of catches i think he is going to be the first one to tell you that he needs to continue to work on his blocking
4974246 i played under as much pressure as i can during that super bowl
4974247 right now i feel i have a lot of confidence and i want to go out and prove that i can play
4974248 the baseball gods have been with us a little bit
4974249 i just kept telling the kids to keep believing in themselves
4974250 di israele che svelano le menzogne di chi punta solo a dividere e a demonizzare sono loro il futuro anime vibranti della vera
4974251 the reasoning was that those who were offended could turn away
4974252 but that doesnt prevent the state from criminalizing a verbal assault of repeated loud profanities in a public place that disrupts the rights of others
4974253 but you dont have the right to continue to assault people with offensive speech once theyve indicated they dont want to hear it
4974254 he was choking the s t out of me and i wasnt fixing to die that night
4974255 i didnt have my music on and my windows were rolled up
4974256 plus it was cold and i had my leather jacket on
4974257 they slammed me down on the ground put pistols and tasers to my back
4974258 i didnt know what they were here for they said it was for assaulting a peace officer
4974259 whenever he told me to watch my mouth i looked at him like he was crazy like he didnt look like an actual police officer to me
4974260 decker was calling me a chicken s mother f get out and i will beat your ass
4974261 a fost putin surpinzator faptul ca am pierdut in fata olandei atat de aproape de linia de sosire la un varf de barca startul a fost destul de bun insa se pare ca nu am mers la capacitate maxima trebuie totusi sa nu uitam ca echipa de canotaj a romaniei se intoarce acasa cu doua medalii una de aur si una de bronz si ar trebui sa fim mandri de acest lucru
4974262 intr o asemenea competitie cu totii avem emotii si invingatorii si invinsii cred ca ne am agitat prea mult din prea multa dorinta de a ne depasi adversarele iar acest lucru ne a dat peste cap ritmul imi pare rau ca ma retrag cu o medalie de bronz dar cu putin umor as putea spune ca era singura care imi lipsea trebuie sa trecem insa peste asta sa avem incredere in noua generatie de canotoare si sa speram ca data viitoare vor fi ele invingatoarele
4974263 desi o parte din echipajul de 8 1 de astazi se va retrage avem incredere ca vom gasi in canotoarele tinere performanta pe care ne o dorim in continuare cu totii in canotaj spre deosebire de alte sporturi avem o baza de selectie destul de mare in momentul de fata avem peste 150 de sportivi in pregatire pe care ii vedem remarcandu se la campionatele mondiale de juniori si de tineret si care pot completa echipajul de aur al romaniei
4974264 we have done everything that had to be done and now we expect the nsg exemption without any change to the draft that was circulated to them recently
4974265 we expect the process to move consistent with the july 18 2005 understanding and any change in their nsg position is problematic
4974266 we can not agree to further demands and there is no way we can
4974267 dont worry about a thing cause every little thing gonna be all right
4974268 dont worry bout a thing cause every little thing gonna be all right
4974269 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4974270 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4974271 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4974272 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4974273 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4974274 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4974275 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4974276 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4974277 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4974278 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4974279 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4974280 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4974281 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

4974291 these demands arent new as we have been taking these issues for the past several years
4974292 they pro freedom leaders are talking about it now but we have been demanding it for the past six years it is the recommendation of working groups and today our stand has been vindicated
4974293 you cant manage alienation as aspirations of people have to be voiced normalcy which was returning fast during mufti muhammad sayeed sahibs tenure had to be consolidated but unfortunately in last three years no steps were taken kashmir is a problem of alienation as long as new delhi tries to manage rather than solve k issue problem would remain
4974294 in 90s it was a violent movement this time it is peaceful but unfortunately despite being peaceful movement force is being used to quell it in jammu maximum restraint is being shown while here bullets are showered on peaceful protesters new delhi should act fast to restore normalcy in the state
4974295 restoration of normalcy should be on priority this time rather than elections
4974296 they have their own agenda and we have our own im happy that they are now demanding what we have been for last so many years
4974297 mirwaiz umars demands arent wrong weve been talking about general amnesty to all the prisoners for long our president omar abdullah has been time and again talking about demilitarization and revocation of draconian laws
4974298 when prime minister has himself talked about opening of roads and above all union home minister publicly said that they have no objection if pakistan is ready to open trade routes then it is a golden opportunity with new delhi to talk with hurriyat but new delhi should act and act fast on it to cool down the situation
4974299 there is no administrative control and people have taken law and order in their hands i think it is worse than 1990 as the authority has been eroded it is complete failure of government machinery
4974300 it is a genuine demand and we support it why should we keep limited options when whole world is coming closer the demand of separatists this time is what we have been pursuing for long
4974301 it is an eye opener for both india and pakistan that all routes should be opened both the government should feel the pulse of the people
4974302 when people felt that the only road link has been closed they started struggle for opening of muzzafferabad road government should ensure that srinagar jammu highway remains open and nobody should be allowed to close it at any cost
4974303 we support the demand of separatists and rising above vote politics mainstream parties should unite and bring the separatists on table for negotiations new delhi should talk to separatists
4974304 opening of trade routes wont only benefit kashmir but it would lead us to peace and bring indo pak much closer
4974305 it would be better if new delhi announced opening of trade routes this time keeping in view aspirations of people of kashmir
4974306 omar sahib isnt here he has gone on a dinner party and i dont know when he would come back
4974307 i think i was naive in the sense that i was 20 and i thought oh man im going to the nfl im going to get the best coaching in the world im going to develop im going to get the chance to really progress and i feel like thats just been handicapped in the sense that every year youre just trying to reboot you erase everything and have to start all over
4974308 i look at aaron and obviously its a completely different world
4974309 the financial security for my family is one thing but to have gone through what ive gone through the last four years and a lot of early picks have to go through that its hard ive learned a lot

4974318 were 100 percent sure it was dumped back on our doorstep
4974319 where it was found was not somewhere it could have gone by itself
4974320 it was an up and down type of situation where your emotions get involved
4974321 it was just something i wasnt expecting for the first game
4974322 i just took what the defense gave me and made the best out of my opportunities
4974323 they loaded us up pretty good in the box and they blitzed us quite a bit in the first half
4974324 everyone gets nervous i think its a good thing it just means youre doing something you enjoy and something you really care about you want to go out there and do all you can
4974325 im happy i got a chance to really get my feet wet
4974326 you just have to be patient if you rush things youre not really going to get a good aftermath
4974327 im just waiting for things to start clicking and rolling thats how it was when i was in college things werent clicking until my sophomore year
4974328 it seems like every game weve played for the last five weeks has been like this tough
4974329 the losses are all tough even the wins are tough were playing a first place team here and were playing them tight
4974330 after they got five i wasnt going to give them anything else whatever it took
4974331 i got my pitches down i got ahead in the count i hung in there
4974332 they got going that inning and they wouldnt be stopped
4974333 clearly its not going to hold up under the stress of me going out there every five days and throwing a lot of pitches
4974334 by no means do i want to go through another year with what im going through now
4974335 but at the same time i dont think i want my career to end this way either i think that lends me to think i want to pitch next year i think its easier to walk away if you can honestly tell yourself you know what i cant do it anymore and i dont know that i can answer that question right now because my body hasnt allowed me to do it this year as much i wanted to
4974336 this was clearly a case of attempted murder we could have been dealing with multiple casualties this morning and the devastation that would have caused throughout the community
4974337 there are a number of families out there who will be counting their blessings that they are not grieving for a loved one
4974338 the disregard that this shows for the lives of the local community and my officers is unbelievable
4974339 there are still a small number of people who refuse to live in peace refuse to accept that northern ireland wants to move on and that northern ireland has to move on
4974340 i agree with his sentiment but people will want to see it being followed up by a serious an co ordinated police response to deal with these dissident groups the dup recently supported tough anti terror legislation in the house of commons
4974341 our record shows that we will support tough action to eliminate any terrorist threat from any quarter people in northern ireland have endured too much to allow these groups to go about their dastardly behaviour they must be harried and pursued relentlessly by the forces of law and order
4974342 tough action is called for now to eliminate these groups the police should be given the resources and the support they need to take the fight to the dissident republican micro groups who i believe are held in widespread contempt on both sides of our community

4974368 what if the zhinch are not there like before i know those eggs are bad by now i should have took as many as i could
4974369 the caves got cold because something per say clouds blocked the suns rays the zhinch left the caves because it got to cold and their eggs got ruined by being refrigerated they have probably returned after mating again and eating whatever else was out in the span in this rare time of coolness returning to finish off their bad eggs
4974370 they are out there in large numbers by my calculation
4974371 its going to be a lot more work getting one then
4974372 let me go if you think i will run away you can leash me in some way
4974373 rope my ankle post me out in the open where you know they are and youll see
4974374 fine if you want that then we will do that since your so sure
4974375 what is crazy is starving to death your stomach churns nothing but acid your head becomes light and you feel sleepy or worse dying in the clutches of some beast letting it rip your skin off your bones life requires chancing if you cant understand that than why live
4974376 yeah but what if you die how are you going to be able to defend yourself from like forty of those things when your going to be leashed what if you are over taken and cant get away besides all that your arm is broken remember
4974377 im not sure it has only been about ten days but if you feel its ready it can be taken off
4974378 i know it needs longer than that but im thinking i need to be able to bend my wrist to hunt
4974379 it could be taken off but the bone if its not back together it might become infected if it comes apart again it could also heal misshaped
4974380 why did you say you wanted to hunt you might die you know
4974381 cause i know i can do it im not on a suicide mission and everyone dies sometime
4974382 dont care or have feelings for me keedan you will get nothing in return
4974383 keedan there is no such thing as luck there is only fate
4974384 youll use arrows and no funny business cause if you even think it ill be waiting
4974385 you dont scare me if you did then why the hell would i be going out there to those things huh
4974386 take me to the open where there is a cliff but plenty of open space

4974389 how are you going to kill without a weapon or do you have weapons i dont know about still
4974390 you would already be dead if i did trust me
4974391 let me kill a few when i say shoot shoot whoever has the bow
4974392 if they swarm us before or after a catch i say we kill all the bitches we can while retreating leave no one behind huh

4974411 ian walthew was a newspaper executive with a career that took him round the world who one day did a mad thing he saw a for sale sign on a cottage in the cotswolds bought it resigned and moved in for the first few weeks he just lay on the grass in a daze then he started talking to his neighbours and digging into the rich history of this beautiful part of england out of his inquiries grew this affecting and inspiring memoir what sets it apart from others of its ilk is the authors enviable immunity to clich and his determination to love his homeland better than he used to his elegiac account of relearning how to be an englishman should be required reading for anyone who claims to know or love this country
4974412 the authors story of two journeys his own and that of the english countryside has resulted in a eye opening book that is extremely satisfying for this reader on two different levels namely a personal emotive one and also intellectually dealing as it does with the serious problems facing farmers in the uk today
4974413 my personal enjoyment springs from the fact that the book is a cracking good read walthews search for a rural dream is shot through with a glittering humorous thread but also overlaid with a cloak of sadness caused by the loss in childhood of his father and brother and his yearning to remember them
4974414 walthew is a master of metaphor and a true wordsmith his sentences are long and complex but perfectly balanced he evokes the glorious wildlife and vegetation of the english countryside beautifully with sentiment but not mawkishness his repeated use of the moon as a leitmotif confers a pearly sheen of melancholy over many scenes an almost unbearably poignant memory concerns his older brother protecting a hoard of sweets for both boys to share
4974415 is the present a moon cast shadow of the past
4974416 breathless beauty full of devilment humour and rich untold histories

4974422 el espa ol tiene un futuro muy esperanzador porque la hablan casi 500 millones de personas en el mundo
4974423 es una ley de garant a de derechos individuales que desarrollar a los art culos de la constituci n que hacen referencia a esos derechos

4974429 in my estimation confronting this country which is trying to gain the time necessary to acquire nuclear weapons is unavoidable

4974431 at present we are suffering from two things irans attempts to gain regional hegemony and its attempts to impose its influence via its sectarian allies the fifth column of arab shiite fundamentalists
4974432 perhaps it is a strange coincidence that this time around our strategic interests coincide with those of israel the regime of the mullahs in iran is our enemy and at the same time it is an enemy not just of israel but of world peace and security

4974443 never in my time have i had this joy whelled up within me all i was raised with was hate in my mind enough hate to rid myself of pathetic human emotion
4974444 from human suffering im given life through thier loss ive but gained
4974445 for you like them ill feel no sympathy no sorrow nor remorse you think you are greater than me but i know you better than anybody else in all realms before me you are as good as
4974446 there was time when the nine choirs sang the endless melody of the lives you would take i bet it makes you feel bad they will not even sing for your demise you cant hold out forever doom
4974447 im so glad the creator has decided to at least give me somebody of worthy calibur to bring forth my final breath
4974448 the end is coming soon but like you said i cant hold out forever
4974449 your tenacity will only cause existance more suffering doom a lifetime ago with frozen eyes you closed the door that let your hatred pour through your being allowing you power over all things why did you to meddle in the lives of mortal souls to feel like them for you are in their likeness you are nothing like them
4974450 take the souls i have damned and burn them in my name
4974451 impressive truly i was waiting so for you to give me a taste of your power forged from witnessing creation after creationn but

4974458 desarmar a la generalitat valenciana que ha abierto una grieta en el frente cl sico
4974459 pondr a a catalunya en una situaci n l mite pero muy clarificadora
4974460 el psc nunca m s podr a tener la misma relaci n con el psoe porque quedar a claro que el psoe prefiere al pp que al psc
4974461 ha pagado muy caro pactar con zapatero de espaldas a catalunya
4974462 el psc fue quien inici el proceso de ruptura del frente para el estatut
4974463 espero que la actitud del presidente de la generalitat jos montilla primer secretario del psc sea la misma actitud del conseller de econom a
4974464 lo que ser a terrible continu es que el psc se supeditara a los intereses del psoe y de hecho el psoe lo intenta forzando reuniones de barones para convencer al presidente de la generalitat pero no le ha salido bien
4974465 obliga a pasar por el consejo de pol tica fiscal y financiera cpff
4974466 dentro del modelo del estado espa ol no hay m s soluci n para catalunya que el concierto econ mico que es el nico instrumento que nos permitir a una negociaci n en condiciones de igualdad y equidad con el estado
4974467 el nico mecanismo que entender a el estado para negociar con equidad y paridad es que catalunya recaptara todos los impuestos como pasa con el sistema foral navarro y vasco
4974468 en catalunya hay una imposici n unilateral por parte del gobierno y nosotros como mucho podemos oponernos
4974469 referencia de lo que es un buen acuerdo y lo que es un mal acuerdo
4974470 puede haber un acuerdo de todas las ccaa menos cartalunya podr a pasar
4974471 ni erc ni el govern podr n aceptar un mal modelo
4974472 el govern tendr muchas dificultades que van m s all de si hay o no elecciones anticipadas
4974473 ser n dificultades para este govern o el que venga
4974474 mucho me temo que jos luis rodr guez zapatero les llevar a este l mite
4974475 el psoe no considera que el psc sea de los suyos los suyos son los que cuando el psoe manda y ordena al psn en navarra que regale el gobierno a la derecha obedecen
4974476 cuando el psoe le dice al psc que la presidencia debe ser para artur mas y el psc dice que no dejan de ser los suyos
4974477 los suyos argument son los que cuando lanzan exabruptos contra catalunya desde la junta de extremadura de andaluc a o de galicia nadie desde madrid les contesta los que no son suyos son los que cuando alguien pide un m nimo de equidad para catalunya autom ticamente se les llama al orden para el psoe hay diferentes categor as una divisi n de honor en la que juegan andaluc a extremadura y galicia y hay una segunda divisi n donde juega catalunya
4974478 el gobierno de zapatero s lo ha tenido una intenci n clara la de erosionar al govern de catalunya que naci en contra de su voluntad
4974479 la financiaci n que se deriva del estatut tampoco es justa pero somos dem cratas y el pueblo de catalunya decidi avalar este estatut
4974480 el bloqueo del modelo es absoluto falla el sistema pol tico espa ol
4974481 querr a una eutanasia pasiva de catalunya que catalunya no se queje tenga buena imagen pero a cambio de renunciar a todo

4974505 she is extraordinarily deserving of having a documentary made about her life
4974506 one of those qualities that is unique about helen thomas is this quality of reporting that is hard core she continually asks those hard questions and shes done it for so many years and shes seen so much and shes so well known
4974507 she felt like the white house reporters didnt do their job well
4974508 they failed because they were too close to the president and it took two outside reporters bob woodward and carl bernstein of the washington post who were not part of the white house press corps to uncover what was happening
4974509 i will never again allow this to happen on my watch
4974510 its extraordinary for me to see a woman who after so many decades doing one job that she was really happy with and she had a name for herself now doing so wonderfully as a columnist and able to voice her opinion and finding her voice comfortably
4974511 she did have strong opinions as it turns out even though she did hide them over those years and i think its been a relief for her to be able to voice them particularly now under this administration where i think she has some very strong opinions about where this country is being led in and the role of the reporter and journalist in holding them accountable
4974512 even though she doesnt have any children herself she maintains strong ties to family and family is very important to her
4974513 she doesnt have a southern accent but there were some ways that she spoke that made me think about people in appalachia mostly because there were kinds of sayings and ways she used to describe things that felt very familiar to me in terms of what i experienced in kentucky
4974514 you see a president ask a question you have one chance in the barrel dont blow it

4974553 one of the surprising things is that retailers are still spending money even though their businesses are under pressure now
4974554 these guys have a nice chunk of their business that comes from retail
4974555 retailers arent often on the front edge of the adopters but the good news is that if you have an attractive and functional piece of software you can really run the tables
4974556 everything we do is to drive a retailers topline sales minimize labor and reduce costs
4974557 we know that labor is the biggest cost to the retailer
4974558 its important for the buyers at the company to be able to intelligently purchase the merchandise so they know what to order for the upcoming season
4974559 it tracks transactions by customer and can allow a retailer to do more marketing campaigns based on their customer base
4974560 it allows employees to pull up a customers history and see what styles they prefer or what size they wear it also helps retailers cater to repeat customers on their birthdays and anniversaries and launch product marketing campaigns on the demographic level
4974561 dont have a large budget but they do need the technology
4974562 weve done quite well with it in the last few years

4974677 people will wince and say this isnt what i recognize
4974678 we would have to fix the fire alarm and ignore the fact that library was way too small
4974679 unless we address the long term funding needs we will be taking projects that were deferred before i started elementary school and deferring them beyond when my grandchildren start elementary school
4974680 its not like deferring that disney world vacation another year
4974681 many people in this community are going to come undone with some of these recommendations
4974682 they are already saying they have not been engaged by the district regarding the future of their schools now to have those schools listed to be closed or be moved there is going to be a fight
4974683 as with the public housing dilemma my concern is about public schools and public education staying public and these buildings not being transferred to private owners for private purposes
4974684 hopefully at audubon students can see the scientists at work
4974685 you will not see a double corridor with classrooms down each side in these buildings
4974686 when we have community activities on campus we trip all over each other
4974687 until we can get the publics take on this i think everyone has got to be real cautious about embracing this as a final plan
4974688 dont think of this only in terms of what does this mean to my neighborhood

4974707 pension reform in my view is our no 1 priority and that is saying a lot given all our other problems
4974708 the administration is focused on pension issues and fully intends to put forward reforms that will address outstanding issues and ensure that our pension obligations are reasonable and sustainable going forward
4974709 i dont envision us forming a task force the issues are known and straightforward we simply have to gather the full range of information and propose recommendations to council
4974710 we would expect to do all that this calendar year
4974711 ever since ive been on council the liability has been huge
4974712 i welcome anything they can do to deal with this problem
4974713 the pension boards and the city council have to work together to get these things where they need to be
4974714 is it going to take massive amounts of money to solve this problem yes
4974715 living in this city is expensive and weve moved three houses we can now buy a flat in bandra which is like a dream come true
4974716 we wanted our daughter to know her parents were married that was the big thing for us
4974717 our journey to parenthood was not easy cheap or fun
4974718 the result however has been the most amazing experience in the world being called daddy and dad by our loving daughter
4974719 all the realms involved with men are much more complex
4974720 for future generations knowing they can fall in love get married have a child absolutely that will become a way of life more than it is
4974721 some early life exposures such as maternal smoking during pregnancy or personal characteristics may impair the development of physical control and coordination as well as increasing the risk of obesity in later life
4974722 rather than being explained by a single factor an accumulation throughout life of many associated cultural personal and economic exposures is likely to underlie the risks for obesity and some elements of associated neurological function

4974728 the korean market due to its relatively more mature nature is probably a good indicator of whats to come in asia as well as other markets and this is most likely very valuable for ebay

4974781 desarmar a la generalitat valenciana que ha abierto una grieta en el frente cl sico
4974782 pondr a a catalunya en una situaci n l mite pero muy clarificadora
4974783 el psc nunca m s podr a tener la misma relaci n con el psoe porque quedar a claro que el psoe prefiere al pp que al psc
4974784 ha pagado muy caro pactar con zapatero de espaldas a catalunya
4974785 el psc fue quien inici el proceso de ruptura del frente para el estatut
4974786 espero que la actitud del presidente de la generalitat jos montilla primer secretario del psc sea la misma actitud del conseller de econom a
4974787 lo que ser a terrible continu es que el psc se supeditara a los intereses del psoe y de hecho el psoe lo intenta forzando reuniones de barones para convencer al presidente de la generalitat pero no le ha salido bien
4974788 obliga a pasar por el consejo de pol tica fiscal y financiera cpff
4974789 dentro del modelo del estado espa ol no hay m s soluci n para catalunya que el concierto econ mico que es el nico instrumento que nos permitir a una negociaci n en condiciones de igualdad y equidad con el estado
4974790 el nico mecanismo que entender a el estado para negociar con equidad y paridad es que catalunya recaptara todos los impuestos como pasa con el sistema foral navarro y vasco
4974791 en catalunya hay una imposici n unilateral por parte del gobierno y nosotros como mucho podemos oponernos
4974792 referencia de lo que es un buen acuerdo y lo que es un mal acuerdo
4974793 puede haber un acuerdo de todas las ccaa menos cartalunya podr a pasar
4974794 ni erc ni el govern podr n aceptar un mal modelo
4974795 el govern tendr muchas dificultades que van m s all de si hay o no elecciones anticipadas
4974796 ser n dificultades para este govern o el que venga
4974797 mucho me temo que jos luis rodr guez zapatero les llevar a este l mite
4974798 el psoe no considera que el psc sea de los suyos los suyos son los que cuando el psoe manda y ordena al psn en navarra que regale el gobierno a la derecha obedecen
4974799 cuando el psoe le dice al psc que la presidencia debe ser para artur mas y el psc dice que no dejan de ser los suyos
4974800 los suyos argument son los que cuando lanzan exabruptos contra catalunya desde la junta de extremadura de andaluc a o de galicia nadie desde madrid les contesta los que no son suyos son los que cuando alguien pide un m nimo de equidad para catalunya autom ticamente se les llama al orden para el psoe hay diferentes categor as una divisi n de honor en la que juegan andaluc a extremadura y galicia y hay una segunda divisi n donde juega catalunya
4974801 el gobierno de zapatero s lo ha tenido una intenci n clara la de erosionar al govern de catalunya que naci en contra de su voluntad
4974802 la financiaci n que se deriva del estatut tampoco es justa pero somos dem cratas y el pueblo de catalunya decidi avalar este estatut
4974803 el bloqueo del modelo es absoluto falla el sistema pol tico espa ol

4974812 la sociedad espa ola ha practicado la demagogia con los derechos de autor a diferencia de otros pa ses de nuestro entorno ya que aqu no se entiende por qu hay que proteger los derechos de los trabajadores de la cultura
4974813 la cultura no puede ser gratis ya que es un bien que se transmite previo pago porque detr s de su construcci n se encuentra el esfuerzo y el talento de una persona

4974823 its a wonderful day for jamaica it was a stunning performance and were so proud of you
4974824 the games are not yet over and we expect a lot more from the team in the days ahead but i can assure you that we are planning a massive welcome home party for all of you
4974825 we have chances in the mens 200m womens 200m the womens 100m hurdles the mens 400m hurdles the womens 400m and all four relays
4974826 so we have a lot of expectations that there are more medals to be won
4974827 i knew he had it in him i cant wait for him to break the 200m record and then run 42 seconds in the 400m
4974828 he has taken jamaica on his back and demolished the whole world that is the respect to be given to the greatest sprinter of all time
4974829 it was euphoria it was the greatest feeling ive had in all my life because jamaica has never had the joy and glory of a gold medal in the 100m sprint in my 60 years
4974830 and in addition to getting our first gold he broke the world record it is an experience that is almost unspeakable it brought me out in goose bumps
4974831 that wasnt just my feeling but the whole of jamaica i got reports from the districts and cities back home where people were out on the streets hailing the victory
4974832 it was good old vintage reggae it was tremendous of the organisers they were able to find a piece of music that helped us celebrate
4974833 we are expecting at least another five medals from the track and we feel very confident if we do that then i would not be surprised if we declared a national holiday
4974834 its ridiculous to say he was disrespectful in the way he finished
4974835 hes a young athlete hes having a great time and this sport of all sports needs that hes carefree hes got the talent he did not do it in a disrespectful way he is just excited about his sport
4974836 when bolt broke the world record at the national championships and at all the championships in which he has participated in between he and the other jamaican sprinters have been tested
4974837 ive been coming here for 43 years my children were baptised here my daughter was married here my wife was buried here if this goes the biggest part of my life will go
4974838 its the very meaning of my life its not just the building its the community
4974839 in each individual area hes produced dvds given them to people asked them to go away and look at them in groups asked them to write in but none of them have produced a different plan but i can assure you categorically that he has agonised over this
4974840 in an interview grady says that falling mass attendance and shortage of priests means churches have to be closed

4974844 we worked extremely hard on that through the acl and tonight didnt concede again so its a positive sign but if you look at the whole round this weekend there werent too many goals scored
4974845 so certainly every team is better structured and if you dont see too many goals this year its not for the lack of effort in front of goals itll be more for the way teams are better structured
4974846 in the a league theres not much between the teams you saw adelaide tonight are a very good side and we gave as good as we got
4974847 they created chances towards the end simply because we were pushing forward the other three games were draws todays game could easily have been a draw as well so its important we go home and try to win next week
4974848 we were disappointed not to take all three points but to come to sydney and feel disappointed like that is a good sign
4974849 my darling i am sure this will break your heart when you hear this but i dont mean it well if someday this happens of course i would save my mother first what did you expect you would rather me to be a heartless bastard that would sacrifice my own mother for a woman if i really am a heartless ungrateful bastard i would do the same to you for another woman too so stop asking this retarded question arent you glad that i am a family man who puts his family first
4974850 silly you my dear i will only answer this once if this awful thing happens one day it would be terrible for me the two most important women in my life what am i going to choose i could not watch my precious darling and my mother die i would instead jump together with you i dont want to be separated from you dying together with the most important women in my life is an honorable thing to do i would not regret it dear so please dont ever ask this question anymore it breaks my heart just the thought of it
4974851 the whole thing every race one after the other from winning by one hundredth of a second to finishing if off with a world record its an amazing experience
4974852 but there has been no real mechanism for the geoscientific community to collectively feed this early warning research back to governments
4974853 but the same level of attention has not been given to the desperate need for an early warning system for many other environmental crises
4974854 as a result we are now seeing as just one example very serious environmental problems such as falling water levels in the murray river and the immediate risks to the lower murray lakes being posed by acid sulphate soils
4974855 my mother was triumphant youre finally playing your roots instead of the english rose

4974859 when i knew she was doing it it was a big shock basically
4974860 in england shes a very big actress and when i found out she was playing my mum i thought that such a big actress wouldnt talk to me but she was very friendly she gave me a lot of advice she and eddie marsan who plays my dad were like my parents on set
4974861 like helena well shes half i dont think a lot of critics knew when she was getting the part and didnt believe she could pull it off but we both had to put it on a little bit
4974862 a big fan of shoes that give you some height with comfort
4974863 they just called me for this its a bit worrying i guess just to be asked to play a sociopath its s interesting to be called a bit off its sort of natural casting
4974864 with a movie like sixty six youre like this is the way to go
4974865 there are fewer leads but im definitely having more fun i always wanted to be a character actor it suits me given what has happened in my life i wouldnt want to be working like i did the first 20 years i can be with my babies its just a discovery of a different self which is the living bit which i didnt do from 18 on when i was working pretty consistently
4974866 i couldnt look less english ive got dark curly hair and now im 42 god knows that english rose has definitely wilted

4974950 im letzten halben jahr haben wir einen hurrastil gespielt und verloren jetzt spielen wir kontrolliert und gewinnen wie otto rehhagel

4974978 i watched the race and saw him with his mother they look like a good family
4974979 he deserves every ounce of respect and admiration and attention that he gets because what hes doing is incredibly phenomenal
4974980 being his teammate for so many years you get desensitized to how amazing he is i think many years down the road me and the other members of the team will realize what an incredible performance he put on for everybody here
4974981 i mean its something im incredibly proud of but it was never a goal of mine to be the most decorated female swimmer or anything like that im very happy with the six medals i have hopefully ill get some more in london

4974985 ive got my wedding come up so i want to be in good shape
4974986 it took a lot of pressure off me for the rest of the meet
4974987 i remember leaving athens i was like wow i dont remember that
4974988 i was just overwhelmed with the entire experience i think that gave me a bit of an advantage this time i did make a conscious effort to stay present in the moment

4975006 the first is that we shouldnt spend too much time trying to answer the why questions
4975007 i dont know why i have cancer and i dont much care

4975010 to regain footing remember that we were born not into death but into life and that the journey continues after we have finished our days on this earth
4975011 we want lives of simple predictable ease smooth even trails as far as the eye can see
4975012 the natural reaction is to turn to god and ask him to serve as a cosmic santa

4975046 we dream through the technologies we produce we dream of ways to alter our material reality including our own bodies to make it correspond to our desires and to banish our sense of limitation
4975047 between one being and another there is a gulf a discontinuity
4975048 sperm and ovum are to begin with discontinuous entities but they unite and consequently a continuity comes into existence between them to form a new entity from the death and disappearance of the separate beings the new entity is itself discontinuous but it bears within itself the transition to continuity the fusion fatal to both of two separate beings
4975049 we yearn for our lost continuity we find the state of affairs that bind us to our random and ephemeral individuality hard to bear
4975050 incorporated the car into our understanding of time space distance and sexuality to want to merge with it literally in a more physical way seems a good metaphor there is a desire to fuse with techno ness

4975059 but there has been no real mechanism for the geoscientific community to collectively feed this early warning research back to governments
4975060 but the same level of attention has not been given to the desperate need for an early warning system for many other environmental crises
4975061 as a result we are now seeing as just one example very serious environmental problems such as falling water levels in the murray river and the immediate risks to the lower murray lakes being posed by acid sulphate soils
4975062 it is very easy for governments to ignore the research of one expert geoscientist but much harder for them to ignore the collective recommendations of a high level independent expert panel
4975063 its a technical issue with the rudder that will be rectified overnight
4975064 the whole thing every race one after the other from winning by one hundredth of a second to finishing if off with a world record its an amazing experience
4975065 we worked extremely hard on that through the acl and tonight didnt concede again so its a positive sign but if you look at the whole round this weekend there werent too many goals scored
4975066 so certainly every team is better structured and if you dont see too many goals this year its not for the lack of effort in front of goals itll be more for the way teams are better structured
4975067 in the a league theres not much between the teams you saw adelaide tonight are a very good side and we gave as good as we got
4975068 they created chances towards the end simply because we were pushing forward the other three games were draws todays game could easily have been a draw as well so its important we go home and try to win next week
4975069 we were disappointed not to take all three points but to come to sydney and feel disappointed like that is a good sign

4975075 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
4975076 whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is you know above my pay grade but let me speak more generally about the issue of abortion because this is something obviously the country wrestles with one thing that im absolutely convinced of is that there is a moral and ethical element to this issue and so i think that anybody who tries to deny the moral difficulties and gravity of the abortion issue is not paying attention
4975077 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
4975078 dance may be an appropriate and effective strategy for improving functional mobility deficits in people who are living with brain disorders such as parkinsons stroke and traumatic brain injuries
4975079 medications are important in the treatment of parkinsons but many symptoms dont respond as well to medications as we would like
4975080 music and other rhythmic stimuli help parkinsons patients to move better so dance may help patients regain balance and make more fluid movements the thought is that by moving to music the brain will reinforce movement pathways or simply create new ones dance also may help the fight against depression seen in parkinsons disease
4975081 dance for me has always been therapeutic in many ways although its important to note that this is not a therapy session this is a dance class that combines the artistry of dance with live music to encourage ones natural instincts for movement and the benefits that movement can produce physically and socially its an opportunity for participants and their loved ones to do something fun together
4975082 this information can help guide hospitals in determining where to focus their efforts for addressing this problem
4975083 medication discrepancies at discharge are especially dangerous because patients are no longer being monitored consistently and may not recognize signs of medication problems on their own
4975084 with patients today on more medications than in days past the stakes are higher than ever before
4975085 knowing when and where to look for discrepancies will help hospitals prevent errors that could cause harm to patients
4975086 while we are awaiting the results from large clinical trials this information can be helpful to doctors and patients alike who are looking for circumstantial evidence regarding the role of psa screening
4975087 this research can be added to the body of literature suggesting that screening may reduce prostate cancer deaths
4975088 while the us preventive task force recommends against screening for older men these results and other published studies show that psa screening may be an effective tool in reducing the number of prostate cancer deaths
4975089 psa tests should be discussed between a man and his primary care physician while taking into consideration his overall health profile rather than his age
4975090 withdrawal without delay of all the that entered georgia since aug 7
4975091 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4975101 we were trying to engage people who had previously been shunned by the establishment
4975102 we knew if someone made a 25 donation they were totally committed to the campaign
4975103 there is a psychological element to the commitment of giving money

4975141 we were in position to make plays we just have to finish them
4975142 we dont tackle all training camp long and you get in the game its full speed and youve got to do it

4975394 that is going to be critically important because right now there is really no data to make a scientific judgment one way or the other
4975395 the information that has been put out there is really very little scientific information in there
4975396 the case is built from a number of pieces of circumstantial evidence and for a case this important its troubling to have so many loose ends the briefing pointed out even more loose ends than i thought there were before
4975397 its very hard to get the sense of whether this was scientifically good or bad we didnt really get the question settled other than taking their word for it

4975411 city apartments are a blight in the market in many uk cities but in belfast they are still booming with the average price for a flat in the city up 25 1 per cent helping to push up prices for all types of homes in the city by 3 3 per cent
4975412 there are significant restrictions on the opportunities available to men around gestation childbirth and breastfeeding which will be extremely difficult to overcome via social or technological mechanisms in the foreseeable future women also have longer life expectancies than men
4975413 i argue that if these are our goals we may do well to move towards a post sex humanity until we have the technology to produce genuine hermaphrodites the most efficient way to do this is to use sex selection technology to ensure that only girl children are born girl babies therefore have a significantly more open future than boy babies
4975414 i dont think were seriously looking at a world of only girl children just yet but i do think that when philosophers start talking about using medical technology to achieve things that arent about health so increasing peoples iq or life expectancy for example you have to ask why we shouldnt all be girls

4975456 we didnt shift the ball quick enough and i thought we were too cautious we took that extra touch that you cant afford against a team like queensland and they got on top of us
4975457 we got better in the second half without reaching any high levels and got ourselves back in the game were probably going away happy with a point
4975458 i think in game one everyones being a little bit tentative because youre getting the season under way and you dont want to make mistakes my message at halftime was to release the shackles and be a bit more positive and to start playing the way we know were capable of
4975459 we came out a bit flat in the second half and after we conceded that goal we lifted a bit and equalised not long after so its a positive sign that we hit back and showed character after some lapses in concentration
4975460 i think everyone was trying to find their feet in front of the home crowd and it was a bit scrappy
4975461 its a matter of taking things forward now its probably a relief for everyone to get the first 90 minutes of the season out of the way and theres some good points to build on and some areas right across the park where we need to be a hell of a lot better

4975488 this is for the first time in the last five six years that water level in yamuna has reached to 205 55 metres however there is no imminent threat to life and property
4975489 the water level in the yamuna has risen consistently as haryana is releasing 2 5000 cusecs of rainwater everyday and if this continues the water level is expected to further rise in the next few days
4975490 to extricate the masses of the people from the dire straits in which they find themselves
4975491 we want the course to act as a vehicle to re engage them but we will be setting ground rules
4975492 we dont want to simply take them out of school and that is all they do there will be a clear understanding that this is an add on conditional on carrying out their normal school work
4975493 this qualification will be of use anywhere where people are trying to enthuse and inspire youngsters it will promote a can do attitude and give them a sense of achievement on which to build
4975494 it is up to individual headteachers if they think it would be appropriate for some pupils it may be that some pupils will respond but i would be sceptical
4975495 it is very much our policy that pupils who are persistently disruptive should be removed from class until they learn to behave and that is popular with teachers and parents alike
4975496 there have been various initiatives of this type and while it is maybe a bit unusual it may have a function
4975497 the ssta has no objection to anything that retains contact between children and the education system
4975498 everyone thinks samantha is lindsays first lesbian love but we were very passionate until her fear of being found out drove us apart
4975499 at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies
4975500 but then samantha came on to the scene and i was dropped
4975501 she met lindsay in the summer of 2006 at a party in malibu
4975502 from the start lindsay was very confused about her feelings for courtenay so did more and more drugs to stifle the sexual attraction she was experiencing
4975503 but eventually she just gave in and at every party theyd kiss and touch each other in the corner its a miracle nobody found out
4975504 both of them would do lines of cocaine in the toilets then head home and fall into bed together
4975505 back then samantha and lindsay didnt have a physical relationship
4975506 apparently samantha acted in a paternal way towards her giving her advice and cuddles
4975507 by now lindsay was sending i love you notes to samantha and signing them lindsay ronson but telling courtenay she loved her too
4975508 courtenay would throw fits of rage writing her hundreds of angry e mails from another room in the house
4975509 the sexual attraction between them was electric though and theyd still kiss and make up
4975510 courtenay still cant understand how lindsay is now so open with samantha
4975511 every time she sees a picture of them together it kills her
4975512 we hope the release will help strengthen the peace process
4975513 president mahmud abbas had requested the release of very large numbers of prisoners eventually leading to the release of all palestinian prisoners from israeli jails
4975514 whoever engages in dialogue with israel can be boosted through dialogue and not through the use of force

4975532 you hear all these highfalutin people on tv talking about a recession they dont know what a recession is
4975533 we didnt have anything back in those days but we didnt think about it because no one else had anything
4975534 we have actually had growth in the last two quarters
4975535 that doesnt mean that there arent problems out there with the price of energy the housing crisis and the unemployment rate
4975536 but it isnt even comparable to the great depression especially when you look at the unemployment rate most of the 1930s was just really bad
4975537 but my parents didnt lose any money because they didnt have nothing to lose
4975538 we never went hungry even if we just had potatoes and beans to eat
4975539 since we lived in jackson we couldnt grow anything but had to buy everything we ate
4975540 a lot of people talk about sewing clothes from fertilizer sacks but we didnt live on a farm so we didnt even have those
4975541 we didnt have any toys but we made our own fun
4975542 we used tops off fruit jars to make mud pies and played hide and seek and kick the can
4975543 i will never forget the name of his dog fala
4975544 and he would say all we have to fear is fear itself
4975545 i still pick up every penny i see because if you have 10 pennies you have a dime
4975546 we didnt have anything but a two eyed burner and some pots and pans
4975547 that is what is wrong with people today they want to go right to the top and buy these expensive homes no wonder they lose them
4975548 i dont like being inside if i dont have to
4975549 we grew up without air conditioning and i dont mind the sun
4975550 we did all the work while the farmer sat under the shade tree and then we gave him half the money for the crops
4975551 but i thought those were some wonderful times and i wouldnt mind going through them again we didnt know there was a depression because we didnt have any money to begin with
4975552 we bought sugar and flour and coffee from the store but this was pretty much all
4975553 we even raised our own corn and ground it for cornmeal
4975554 even if we didnt have anything else to eat in the winter we always had nuts and parched corn
4975555 people think they have these fancy t shirts nowadays but they didnt have nothing on us
4975556 our shirts would say tennessee rose or daybreak fertilizer with a picture of a rooster crowing on the back
4975557 we got in the field by the time we could see and stayed there until dark
4975558 i remember striking matches to look at the scales to see how much cotton we picked
4975559 the reason i know work dont kill people is because if it did id have been dead a long time ago
4975560 i knew the third grade books pretty well by that time but never could make it all the way through
4975561 if i had got to school more i would probably have been president or something
4975562 he would have five or six at a time but i never played with them that much
4975563 if we had it we had it but if we didnt we didnt and nobody threw a fit about it
4975564 even if we didnt have anything we always saw people who were poorer than we were
4975565 there was no such thing as welfare and neighbors helped each other out
4975566 if you look back over his record he really didnt do that much to help america and he brought in this whole welfare mess
4975567 i had worked really hard that spring and planted 12 acres of cotton
4975568 that was a lot of cotton for one man to take care of
4975569 i got more out of what i plowed up than what i gathered
4975570 we had a big family so we didnt have a lot of extras
4975571 we had a room that we used for our pretend games
4975572 we would pretend to be movie stars and act out movies
4975573 as the youngest i probably didnt have to do as much
4975574 my older brothers and sisters did a lot of the work
4975575 he didnt own his house and all his money was in the business
4975576 so he went down to the bank and gave them the key to his laundry business then he loaded the family up and went back to iuka miss
4975577 you didnt think about being poor because everyone else was poor
4975578 i hated picking bugs off the beans and sweet potatoes
4975579 you had to shake them into this can and let them die
4975580 the sole breadwinner was out of work and it was truly catastrophic
4975581 today even if we had 25 percent unemployment it wouldnt be nearly as severe as it was then but we arent even close to those numbers
4975582 the big industrial cities were hit much harder and unemployment was as high as 70 to 80 percent
4975583 periods of difficulty can inspire creativity and during the 30s there were a lot of interesting innovations
4975584 for example the game monopoly was created during this time
4975585 back then people believed that the government should not get involved
4975586 they were concentrated on fighting wars not spending money to create jobs
4975587 between the new deal and the progressive era the country develops a new way of thinking about what government ought to be doing
4975588 there was a significant committment on the part of the government to improve the daily lives of people
4975589 they will do whatever is necessary to avoid a depression
4975590 the government will create jobs to repair infrastructure or other sectors the world has changed so much with respect to economic policy that it is hard to make a comparison
4975591 its hard to think of anyone who did well in the great depression
4975592 there were falling prices and deflation but today if you are in certain industries prices are going up
4975593 that means when the value of stocks go down you instantly lose everything you had
4975594 even if there are some similarities there are even more dissimilarities
4975595 whenever the olympics come around we always mention it its a pretty amazing thing
4975596 were very proud of him we were always very proud of him
4975597 its one of the first trophies uncle duncan won as an athlete
4975598 we are not quite sure what he won it for its been a treasure in my parents home and my aunts home and now i have it
4975599 i think he may have had to fudge his age at some point in time because we came across so many dates but we went with what was in the parish records
4975600 at the time he was considered one of the greatest athletes of his day
4975601 before the 1912 olympics the new york times did a profile on athletes to watch at the stockholm olympics the only canadian mentioned was duncan gillis and that is why he carried the flag
4975602 were just a small community and when someone from here does well we just latch onto it
4975603 we came out of the stadium just absolutely stunned at the magic and completely inspired at the opportunity that we have to go off and think and dream
4975604 our goal of course will be to be just as inspiring
4975605 despite the heat and humidity the entire stadium was riveted
4975606 they couldnt have done a better job i dont think
4975607 were still in the planning phase for sure but thats why this is so critical to learn the lessons that we see in beijing to make it a better experience here in vancouver for 2010
4975608 id like the world to feel think they know a little more about canada as our opening ceremonies close
4975609 its canadas olympics its canadas opportunity to remind the world what were going to be in the 21st century
4975610 the amount of effort it takes behind the scenes to move performers in and out of their positions the amount of volunteers and staff thats required to do that behind the scenes is incredible
4975611 ive done some pretty big rock shows but were way behind this stuff believe me this is mind boggling
4975612 in his world theres no greater audience no greater opportunities and no greater pressure its a one shot deal
4975613 were hate to inconvenience those visitors that had plans to be in the keys the next few days but their well being is our top priority
4975614 we like to have the executive order in place before the storm
4975615 whatever happens happens if we get evacuated that will definitely put a damper on our plans but until we have to were not moving
4975616 i would say the brand to this day is very important but we saw a decline in sales last year so there has been the concern that there are cracks in the foundation for ea sports

4975851 how to get control of your time and your life
4975852 no we are hunting that finish line all the way
4975853 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4975854 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4975855 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4975856 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4975857 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4975858 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4975859 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4975860 for the past two years crude has followed the dollar almost lock step
4975861 the strength weve seen in the dollar is almost certainly helping bring crude down at this point as you move backward it actually acts as a stimulus on the economy
4975862 as for housing starts i think everyone is expecting them to remain soft ppi wont be much of a market mover as commodities have been moving lower which makes last months numbers irrelevant
4975863 i dont think were out of the woods yet on financials because i dont think were out of the woods on housing
4975864 when we have new orders thats going to tell you are people ready to put stuff on the shelf
4975865 its important because one of the big drags on the gdp in the second quarter was inventory
4975866 any geopolitical developments whether it be the iranian situation or further developments with russia and georgia those will influence oil markets
4975867 its a great sign for the future the average age of the team is quite low and it shows the potential we have for the next year
4975868 sri lanka is one of the toughest places to play cricket as you dont get a lot of runs on slow low wickets you have to always stay positive
4975869 obviously i have to face a better attack when i play the odi but my innings was against an international side with mendis and muralitharan sri lanka will have a potent attack
4975870 theres no technological reason why you cant play cross platform but theres a philosophical reason why design doesnt want to do it if we have to compromise one platform to support both then we wont
4975871 a couple of members of our team gained a lot of experience working on shadowrun and no matter how well you fine tune it you end up with a player base thats polarised
4975872 if it has been a disaster then please provide the evidence
4975873 i dont understand the reasoning behind the assertion that this is dangerous for climate change
4975874 should the uk change our policy on gm to one that is more liberal
4975875 team sports like cricket should not be included in the olympics olympics is a personal game where sportsman tries to excel within himself
4975876 it would be unfair to include cricket in the olympics as the players of other sports especially of individual events wait for the single day to happen and show their talents
4975877 hampers other sports but it is the governments who should take corrective measures to ensure that individual sports also get their due

4975880 sister a real terrible thing has happened to our town
4975881 weve got a lot of people here who need help we cant just throw them out on the street
4975882 theyre our family theyve made their homes here had jobs here raised families here
4975883 this town has constantly been changing it had opened its heart to change but now i sense anguish within people
4975884 they are asking whats going to happen to the town
4975885 a lot of good workers were taken away a lot of good families are gone
4975886 the community is drained of our giving energy of wondering how long the new people will stay if it will be a culture that fits into our community we are grieving scared apprehensive
4975887 i am very nervous i dont know what is going to happen and i dont know if i have the strength to keep fighting
4975888 i wish i could plead with the judge for my childrens sake that he would give me a little more time here so my children could continue studying so i could keep working
4975889 you come here with so many plans and illusions that your children will do better than you did
4975890 what joy that gives me to hear i see that they could have a future
4975891 it wounds my soul to think that i might not be able to give them what they desire to think that i might fail them
4975892 i wish people could put themselves in our situation for one moment what would they do if they were poor if they were in dire need wouldnt they risk coming here as well
4975893 i wish that the hearts of people with hearts of stone of ice the people of ice could be transformed into good hearts we came here to work not to do harm to anyone
4975894 they are serious offenses and we will not apologize for enforcing the nations laws if 305 u s citizens had committed identity theft and misuse of social security numbers would people expect us to look the other way
4975895 any disruption whether to families or communities should be put at the feet of those who violate the law
4975896 what happened here is a microcosm of whats happening in the country
4975897 if nothing is done there will be many many more postvilles around the country and thats not healthy for anyone
4975898 i hope our little town will survive i think it will
4975899 weve gotten through lots of things and well get through this too itll take awhile and its tough but were just a resilient bunch in iowa
4975900 i heard there was work here so i came first to get settled if it works out then i will bring them
4975901 before we tolerated everything they did to us at the plant we worked very hard but we lived free
4975902 now we have no work we are not free and we have no idea what will happen to us
4975903 jag ska aldrig igen uttala mig om att brottare r barnsliga

4975930 the strangest thing ive tried to snort my father i snorted my father
4975931 he was cremated and i couldnt resist grinding him up with a little bit of blow my dad wouldnt have cared
4975932 i seriously dont understand why anybody would believe i snorted my fathers ashes
4975933 ive always been embarrassed that we managed to come up with a theory
4975934 why are the physical constants in the universe so finely tuned to allow the possibility of complex life forms
4975935 he should have been more honest and simply said he believes because he wants to believe
4975936 collins provides an argument for god which is little more than paleys watchmaker in disguise
4975937 there is no meaning beyond what you give to it
4975938 there is no meaning beyond what you give to it
4975939 as an atheist what evidence would convince you to believe in a god
4975940 gods supposed to be pretty smart im sure hell think of something
4975941 there is no meaning beyond what you give to it
4975942 atheism is the most daring of all dogmas for it is the assertion of a universal negative
4975943 there is simply no facet in logic whatever that is violated by believing in god unicorns or santa a rather strong claim for someone who wonders what logic is
4975944 nothing he wrote survived all the accounts are second hand there is no contemporary documentation of his existence
4975945 as an atheist what evidence would convince you to believe in a god
4975946 just because youre not sure doesnt mean that reality isnt sure either
4975947 monothesitic tradition has been shown to be logically impossible several times over are you sure a little ineffability cant weasel around all of this
4975948 after resisting for nearly two years i found it impossible to go on living in such a state of uncertainty
4975949 you mean like brief mentions in tacitus josephus in addition to the gospels
4975950 consequently to get rid of the report nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations called christians by the populace
4975951 the nonhistoricity thesis has always been controversial and it has consistently failed to convince scholars of many disciplines and religious creeds biblical scholars and classical historians now regard it as effectively refuted
4975952 i suggest that they dump a whole lot of classical texts in the medieval forgery garbage heap as well
4975953 gladly what the hell difference could it possibly make to anyone except a historian whether they were forged or not
4975954 and there is precious little evidence that the jesus of the bible even existed
4975955 written a generation or more after the supposed events and probably second hand or more removed at that
4975956 many biblical scholars reject the entire testimonium flavianum as a later christian insertion however some maintain that josephuss work originally did refer to jesus but that christian copyists later expanded and made the text more favorable to jesus
4975957 especially since the story about his death may have been the inspiration for the jesus story
4975958 it is a virtual certainty that the name mark was assigned to the book not the name of the actual author
4975959 to the best of my knowledge there are but a handful of people who assert that
4975960 the existence of a jewish mystic who was executed in first century palestine sounds like a perfectly plausible thing to me
4975961 is there reason to believe that there was someone named jeshua in the area of jerusalem around 30 ce
4975962 is there reason to believe that the biblical jesus existed
4975963 when you have pared the sayings of jesus down to fewer than twenty one begins to wonder about the survivors
4975964 the jesus project is an attempt to evaluate every scrap of evidence for the historical jesus but it is also an attempt to evaluate the quality of the evidence itself something that earlier projects did not do explicitly this new project will be more inclusive and rigorous in its approach it will include scholars from a variety of areas outside biblical and religious studies including archaeologists social historians classicists and people in historical linguistics
4975965 there isnt alot of question on the 20 among top scholars
4975966 as an atheist what evidence would convince you to believe in a god
4975967 its unbelievable for me this is the best moment in my career ill never forget it
4975968 it does mean more for me to win it with serena to share this kind of moment with your sister
4975969 to serve you have to push yourself up to jump up and when the legs are a little bit slow it just doesnt go
4975970 se come scriveva henri bergson la ragion dessere della democrazia la fraternit occorre altres ammettere con lui che la democrazia per essenza evangelica ne scaturisce che nostro dovere offrire alla democrazia il contributo della nostra filosofia della nostra morale della nostra tradizione un contributo certamente molteplice e vario contraddistinto per dal cristianesimo elemento comune alla vita personale e sociale di tutti noi affermando che allorigine della civilt europea si trova il cristianesimo non si vuole introdurre alcun criterio confessionale esclusivo si vuole invece fare riferimento alle radici comuni delleuropa a quella morale unitaria che esalta la figura e la responsabilit della persona umana col suo fermento di fraternit evangelica

4975974 we want the course to act as a vehicle to re engage them but we will be setting ground rules
4975975 we dont want to simply take them out of school and that is all they do there will be a clear understanding that this is an add on conditional on carrying out their normal school work
4975976 this qualification will be of use anywhere where people are trying to enthuse and inspire youngsters it will promote a can do attitude and give them a sense of achievement on which to build
4975977 it is up to individual headteachers if they think it would be appropriate for some pupils it may be that some pupils will respond but i would be sceptical
4975978 it is very much our policy that pupils who are persistently disruptive should be removed from class until they learn to behave and that is popular with teachers and parents alike
4975979 there have been various initiatives of this type and while it is maybe a bit unusual it may have a function

4976050 all the government offices and services were on alert during the ceremony
4976051 the security plan required thousands of security personnel including more than 2 000 women police workers
4976052 the pilgrims were aware that these measures were for their safety and to protect them from terrorist attacks
4976053 there was collaboration between baghdad police and neighbouring provinces of karbala there were special forces from the ministry of interior who also took part
4976054 this was the most successful ceremony since the fall of the saddam hussein regime because we did not face any problems as we marched for seven days to reach karbala
4976055 the security measures were in our interest as several pilgrims were attacked while on their way to karbala from baghdad
4976056 i had no fear this year the pilgrimage was successful
4976057 the bombing was a desperate measure by al qaeda the day will come soon when we will announce that coffin has been thrown in the garbage of history

4976065 una delle grandi conquiste dellumanit ha detto ancora infatti proprio il superamento del razzismo
4976066 purtroppo per di esso si registrano in diversi paesi nuove manifestazioni preoccupanti legate spesso a problemi sociali ed economici che tuttavia mai possono giustificare il disprezzo e la discriminazione razziale preghiamo perch dovunque cresca il rispetto per ogni persona insieme alla responsabile consapevolezza che solo nella reciproca accoglienza di tutti possibile costruire un mondo segnato da autentica giustizia e pace vera

4976107 democrat barack obama has had about a 3 to 1 advantage over republican john mccain in post page 1 stories since obama became his partys presumptive nominee june 4
4976108 we make our own decisions about what we consider newsworthy
4976109 the nomination of the first african american presidential nominee after a bitter primary campaign and his efforts to unite a party afterward were simply more newsworthy than a candidate whose nomination was already assured and who spent much of that time raising money in the end we can and should be judged on the fairness of our coverage but that is a judgment that must be made over the course of the whole campaign not a single period of time

4976153 nosotros eramos solamente un grupo de jovenes que busco una identidad musical algo diferente porque lo que se jugaba en brasil a fines del 60 a pesar de ser una hermosa musica bien hecha no era en absoluto la realidad de una generacion mas sino la definicion del contorno de un estilo mas suelto mas alegre mas ligado incluso a la naturaleza que la anterior generacion que curtia la noche y el amor sufrido

4976160 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4976161 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4976170 there is a huge thirst for knowledge among the younger generation for contemporary art but most of them learn about it by going on the internet

4976189 the share price is very important to a pharmaceutical company
4976190 pharmaceutical companies have enjoyed double digit growth year on year and they are out to sustain that not least because their senior managements earnings are related to the share price
4976191 its not in their interests to take less profit personally as well as from the the point of view of the business all these perverse incentives drive the price up
4976192 and so part of the cost is cushioning against that
4976193 we have had all our crews out since virtually two oclock yesterday afternoon and all through the night dealing with incidents relating to flood water
4976194 i dont think weve either seen a time when the flooding has been as devastating as this or has affected the road transport as badly

4976196 the police and the coastguard evacuated people to the newcastle centre and the coastguard organised sleeping bags and we laid out our karate and gym mats for people to sleep on
4976197 it happened so fast that they had no chance to do any sandbagging or anything so they just had to come out of their houses

4976417 were getting reports of buildings shifting on their own including a few where the buildings disappear and reappear minutes and in one case hours later
4976418 ah now this is a bit awkward timelines crossing i take it sorry hello im the doctor but you already know that
4976419 and yet you know me no wait dont say anything i cant know obviously
4976420 were you trave no wait stupid question no materialisation sounds so had you just arrived
4976421 i was about to leave the tardis when reality blinked if youll pardon the glib metaphor still its as good a term as any i suppose when everything settled again i opened the doors and found myself here london yes but not the london i was expecting while travel between dimensions is simple enough it does take some effort on my part to achieve it
4976422 and then going back to the way they were the walls between the worlds are breaking down arent they
4976423 calling the barriers between universes walls isnt technically correct think of them like the thin membrane of a soap bubble theres some room for movement but not much the multiverse is composed of countless billions of these soap bubbles each separated from the other by that thin containing membrane however some times if acted upon by an outside force those membranes can merge letting bits of their universes bleed over into the other and thats never good
4976424 if we dont stop it yes but theres a problem for every living thing theres likely to be a duplicate in that alternate dimension the duplicates can never touch any sort of interaction will result in a quasi blinovitch effect
4976425 its happening again somethings stretching through the universes merging them so the future of one becomes the future of them all
4976426 this is just the beginning the stars are going to disappear soon
4976427 according to these readings the merging has stopped but theres something cascading through the universes all the tardiss sensors can see is darkness its tracing back to oh now thats impossible
4976428 can do nothing but separately oh we can do anything
4976429 a bit of emerald and a mobile ive already got a mobile thanks
4976430 every universe has a unique signature something that differentiates it from every other one this mobile can detect that and if connected to something say a transmat it might even be able to help you slip through the membranes between universes
4976431 youve got time a month maybe two before the damage becomes permanent i however do not have that same luxury
4976432 oooh a power crystal where did you oh oh yes rose thats brilliant that is im brilliant i knew oh not entirely mind had a bit of thing with precognition in that body but still power crystal thats brilliant
4976433 i didnt want to remember the beginning of the war for a long time it hurt too much
4976434 you let me that past me go without telling me about my future i know how much it mustve hurt you and im sorry but you did the right thing
4976435 i know what the mobile was for that helped us build the dimension cannon what i dont know is what this power crystals for
4976436 oh now thats the most brilliant thing of all i didnt strand us here rose well the other me the full time lord me
4976437 see add one power crystal to one piece of the tardis and you know what you get
4976438 and then well have the rest of our lives to explore this universe time and space in our own tardis if you want
4976439 oh i dont mean go go just a short trip well be back before your mums even missed us promise
4976440 oh yes and i dont just mean that well hop back in time to do it where were going what were doing itll take less than an hour
4976441 before we go though theres something else we should probably get out of the way youll have questions now that im not half dead from regeneration sickness or getting into a sword fight to defend your planet and really a sword fight what was i thinking i should probably let you ask them
4976442 you said this is something time lords do right so how many times
4976443 im sure youve got more questions than that rose or has someone kidnapped you and replaced you with a clone a silent clone stepford wife
4976444 why did he you die cause it wasnt the daleks you were still alive when i woke up in here i saw the daleks kill someone when i was a prisoner on their ship it was horrible but it was over in less than a second an no flames
4976445 i know mum an mickey helped me open up the tardis sos i could get back to you an jack but then it all goes sort of fuzzy its like i told mickey its like its sort of forbidden
4976446 i didnt want you remembering it all immediately wouldve been too much for your little human brain
4976447 see one things not changed then you still like insultin other species
4976448 blimey you like to jump to conclusions i meant that literally rose your brain is tiny compared to mine anyway spose you deserve to know what you did you did save the universe after all
4976449 youre worth it rose tyler youre so so very worth it and besides
4976450 if you hadnt come back id have died anyway and the daleks wouldve taken over the universe even time lords cant come back from extermination
4976451 i wanted to save you both of you you an jack an i failed
4976452 you told me he was busy rebuilding the earth is he really the daleks killed him didnt they doctor
4976453 long story well longish but wouldnt you rather just go and find him
4976454 you could say i am really only just over twenty four hours old arent i
4976455 this body is yes all new and untried isnt that exciting
4976456 me on the whole nah still over nine hundred years old
4976457 heard you got left behind by mistake come on no hangin about
4976458 but what bout you jack youve been here on your own for how long hours
4976459 yeah about five hours but thats okay couldve been worse couldve still been fighting off daleks
4976460 i died im sure i did the daleks were right there in front of me i heard them fire i remember getting hit and then i woke up again and they were all gone
4976461 could lie i suppose and give you some excuse but you deserve the truth both of you anyway i spent most of my last life running from things maybe in this life ill be the sort of man who faces up to things who knows
4976462 you died jack and rose brought you back to life after she destroyed the daleks one wave of her hand and there you were alive and breathing all over again
4976463 sometimes jack harkness you are such an idiot why wouldnt i youre one of my two best mates you think i wouldnt save you if i could
4976464 ill kiss you too if you want you did come back for me after all
4976465 you might want to hold off on that for a minute or two jack i said id tell you the truth but you might not like it
4976466 rose said you got left behind by mistake could let you believe that course i could but its not what happened i ran away deliberately left you behind
4976467 rose didnt just bring you back to life jack she gave you immortality youll die again oh yes but youll never stay dead never age either youll just keep living youre a fact a fixed point in time an anomaly time doesnt touch you it bounces off you and leaves you untouched thats why i ran
4976468 time lord that kind of anomaly feels wrong makes me shiver scares me if im gonna be completely honest i forgot it was you jack and i just bolted took rose and the tardis and disappeared before you could get there
4976469 before i could feel it though knew itd be happening soon
4976470 this immortality thing i gotta say much as the idea of not dying any time soon appeals im not sure i like it as a retirement plan
4976471 but that wont happen ill sort something out im brilliant remember leave it to me
4976472 whats next oh spose i did say id have you home within the hour cant let your mum think weve run off again already
4976473 did you mean it you want to face up to things put them right
4976474 i dont think she should have fired that weapon but you shouldnt have done what you did either two wrongs dont make a right doctor an when we met her you said shes prime minister for three whole terms britains golden age you said thats not gonna happen now is it
4976475 youre right shouldnt mess around with your planets history not without a good reason and that wasnt one i dont agree with what she did but if i did something like that every time i didnt agree with a prime minister or a president or a dictator well
4976476 yes ill sort it after all for all i know whoever replaces her could be far far worse
4976477 we do not target children and do not promote phones to under 16s we recognise teenagers use phones but we have adopted the ethical policy not to target them if it is found that there is an increasing market appetite and we believe there are no ethical implications at that time then we would consider targeting under 16s

4976497 this denial of the historical spiritual and archeological connections of the jews to the temple mount is something new
4976498 in the washington dc think tanks surrounding president bill clinton it was understood that the temple mount was the crux of the problem of the middle east conflict
4976499 the prime minister at that time was ehud barak and as usual he didnt consult with anybody else
4976500 he gave them permission but instead of an emergency exit they created a main entrance to the building a monumental entrance for that entrance they dug a pit 40 meters long and 12 meters deep they did it with bulldozers in the most destructive manner possible that of a bull in a china shop the work on that place should have been done carefully not with bulldozers they removed 400 truckloads of earth
4976501 probably the brother of gealyahu is mentioned a priestly man named pashur son of immer he is introduced as the man in charge of the temple

4976552 i m writing every day right here at the piano in this
4976553 in 1973 i was part of a small group of exceptional young business executives who were all also serving in one capacity or another in the rhodesian security forces we were all under 30 years of age rapidly rising through the ranks in business and all born rhodesians we were a patriotic bunch drawn from every possible profession we agreed to put our heads together and project different possible outcomes for the war that was then in the second year of real conflict after a month of work we thought we had it pretty well sewn up all our predictions were for defeat in the long run and the different ways to get the best deal out of the process of seeking a solution we drafted a memorandum and sent it to the prime minister with a letter asking him to see us within a week we were called to a private home in highlands where we found a relaxed ian douglas smith waiting for us we sat on the floor and after we had presented our conclusions to him with supporting argument and facts he responded by saying i simply cannot accept that we are not going to win this war we are winning the war and i can see no reason for changing course within six months only 8 of that outstanding group of men were left in the country the others just packed up and left saying that that they could see no reason to sacrifice their lives on a lost cause three years later smith was called to south africa to meet a man called kissenger sic and the south african president it was the end of his political career when finally he got to lancaster house to negotiate the end of the war he had lost the power to dictate anything except a short transition protecting the narrow short term interests of the white community in 1973 we had argued to smith that he should settle immediately negotiate the best deal he could and if you look at the proposals on the table at that time had he done so he might have saved all of us a lot of stress and suffering
4976554 the different ways to get the best deal out of the process of seeking a solution
4976555 he had lost the power to dictate anything except a short transition protecting the narrow short term interests of the white community
4976556 the similarities with that situation and the one we face today are uncanny mugabe is winning the political skirmishes but losing the war he is gradually being forced to retreat and lose ground its a struggle he cannot win this is a numbers game and its already lost the longer he hangs on and tries to defend what he has the less influence he will have over its outcome mr mbeki says that the talks will go on and that he will stick at it until a deal is reached he is probably right to adopt such a stance as to abandon the talks route is to open the door to bloodshed and violence and this can only make the situation much worse with the economy now disintegrating fast it is unlikely that the regime will be able to pay the civil service at the month end tax revenues lag government payments by about two months on average in two months with 42 million percent inflation those tax revenues will be worthless at yesterdays parade pf the army mugabe thanked the chinese government for a gift of new uniforms for the armed services if he cannot get them to also pick up the tab on their salaries at month end he might face a real crisis and find himself like the rumanian president in the early 90s ending up a casualty and in no position to negotiate anything not even where he should be buried
4976557 kissenger sic wrote in his autobiography that it was the saddest day of his life when he had to end the career of smith in pretoria but in doing so he began the process that ended a long and bloody war that was only going to eventually conclude with defeat for the tiny embattled white minority and their supporters
4976558 history has laid that mantle on the shoulders of south african president mbeki eventually he will have to pull the trigger or someone else will do it for him like all unpleasant tasks it is best not to dilly dally about what is inevitable

4976562 its always been the case that states have had the right to make their own decision on whether or not to allow gay marriage
4976563 no supreme or federal court ever said they states had to recognize each others marriages well before doma the defense of marriage act the principle was settled that states make their own choices
4976564 whether or not doma is repealed has no affect on forcing states to recognize same sex unions contracted in other states
4976565 the full faith and credit clause is interpreted by the supreme court not by congress frankly the section of the defense of marriage that purports to say what the full faith and credit means has no constitutional validity whatsoever because the supreme court has never allowed congress to make those decisions
4976566 full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts records and judicial proceedings of every other state and the congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts records and proceedings shall be proved and the effect thereof
4976567 we will enact a comprehensive bipartisan employment non discrimination act
4976568 we oppose the defense of marriage act and all attempts to use this issue to divide us
4976569 i think it is very unlikely that the whole thing will be repealed i am not optimistic though i welcome the fact that he obama is for repealing it

4976611 from tomorrow russia will begin withdrawing its military forces that are supporting russian peacekeepers
4976612 the georgians have also to comply medvedev has made it very clear that he expects to see that before the russians pull back
4976613 the question of whether the russians will leave south ossetia is another matter as under the terms of this peace plan they are entitled to maintain a peacekeeping presence as they did before this conflict began
4976614 we are hearing from russian military contacts around the town that the troops in georgia are considered to be last in so they will be the last out
4976615 in gori itself there is still a very high russian presence you can still see many russian troops they are digging trenches their armoured personnel carriers their tanks are now well hidden under camouflage
4976616 what we see on the ground clearly shows that russia is not abiding by the ceasefire that its president has signed as of today we are not seeing any reversal of this threat we are not seeing any withdrawal at all

4976650 its humorous that the norfolk community has accepted a hooters yet it cannot accept a piece of fine art made in the greco roman tradition that goes back thousands of years
4976651 while no artist likes to be subjected to censorship i think its really positive that my work has gotten people to really think about art and its place in our society as well as a whole host of issues surrounding the human body and sexuality
4976652 also impressive is her use of color to again deny us of the simplicity of just an image each panel in the four panel piece is an orgy of color and form and becomes an accomplished success for the artist

4976667 french had very detailed notes of what their conversation with the russians had been about
4976668 one reason that i wanted it in writing that the georgians wanted it in writing was that nobody wanted the russians to make the kinds of claims that they may now be making

4976739 government has been the voice of big business not small business
4976740 voters dont like bad behavior on the part of c e o s but economic populism really doesnt work
4976741 and both guys have to show leadership on the economy
4976742 they have to be seen as thoughtful responsible stewards of economic policy who can get along with business and talk to business
4976743 john talks to and cares about big business but he has the greatest affinity for small business which creates more than 70 percent of the jobs in this country
4976744 his entire lens on economic policy is job creation and small business
4976745 ive gotten calls for a year and half saying tell me about this guy
4976746 says william m daley who served as secretary of commerce in the clinton administration before returning to chicago where he is a senior executive with jpmorgan chase
4976747 ive long admired john mccain and i told him i would be delighted to help him
4976748 and i said i have good news for you john
4976749 mccains style makes the big business crowd uncomfortable but they will back him in the election because of his conservative free market policies
4976750 the small business crowd likes him for reasons of both policy and persona
4976751 i have never run a small struggling business unless you count my presidential campaign last year
4976752 not to denigrate government but to make it better not to deride it but to restore its good name
4976753 when he tells you something i think he really means it
4976754 barack tended to attract the younger up and coming leaders at big firms and people in private equity
4976755 many of them had an interest in economic policy as well we didnt have as many gray hairs at the table so there was room for them
4976756 he was remarkably clear eyed and thoughtful about what the country needed to do
4976757 most businesspeople at the big business level are republicans either knee jerk or born into it
4976758 and no one has wrapped himself around the new technology and the new fund raising space like obama so to that crowd this is a message
4976759 he listened more than he talked which is always a good thing
4976760 he clearly sees himself as a clever synthesizer of other peoples ideas and i think that is an important skill in a president
4976761 i dont think senator obama has an agenda for big business
4976762 hes trying to affect the overall economy and hes got to find a way to help people who are worse off i dont think he loses any sleep worrying about how to craft a policy just for big business nor should he and i say that as a former commerce secretary
4976763 but on the big issues that will determine whether the u s is prosperous and whether we improve the living standards of working people i think hes right
4976764 for the final you need to go all out and if the pain cant effectively be eased it will definitely have an effect
4976765 around 80 000 e passports would be issued by 2010
4976766 it is compatible with international standards and identity cards it will protect against fraud and security breaches it is easy to verify the authenticity of e passports
4976767 i call upon the central passport organisation to take steps to upgrade their resources according to international standards it will make the passport more secure
4976768 too ashamed to speak about the occupation of any country he is already occupying one
4976769 u s forces have been in iraq for five years and they still fight in an unacceptable manner that violates human rights conventions bush had better talk about his own occupation of iraq
4976770 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4976771 bush did not realize that by intervening heavily in other countries affairs he would give the same right to other players
4976772 the u s had no problem to interfere and separate provinces from bigger states like it did with kosovo
4976773 this is exactly what russia is doing now intervening to prevent the annexation of certain provinces to georgia russia is using the same logic that the u s used
4976774 in iraq we were dealing with a fascist government which was hated by all iraqis because of the suffering that was inflicted on them
4976775 saddam husseins regime threatened regional stability and made war with neighboring countries
4976776 this presidency will have pro life policies that is my commitment
4976777 ok we dont have to go longer on that one
4976778 there is a solemn obligation that you do everything you can to get that decision right
4976779 dar o cre un lenguaje distinto una sensibilidad literaria una percepci n del lenguaje tambi n muy diferente en nicaragua no hab a como en otras partes de am rica latina un lenguaje estratificado por clases sociales el lenguaje es el mismo lenguaje que hemos hablado es lenguaje vivo que dar o capt y transform en literatura
4976780 if byron says hes feeling pressure then hes feeling pressure lord i dont know what to ask you to do i dont know what kind of pressure hes facing and feeling
4976781 different things im afraid of failing afraid of not having enough
4976782 enough time enough money enough support enough help enough interest enough attendance enough cooperation enough energy enough ability
4976783 so youre afraid of not having what you need or at least afraid of not having what you
4976784 yea i fear the unknown the uncertainty im afraid of what could happen or afraid of what wont happen that needs to happen
4976785 ramon remember what david said about where he went and where i showed up that there is no place in time location or experience that im not already there with the coffee made when you first arrive ramon if you knew really knew that i was going to be fully present and engaged in the mysterious unknown and uncertainty of your future what else would you need to know
4976786 i think i get it but you know youll need to remind me of this conversation from time to time short memory
4976787 i was talking about me my pressures my fears i didnt get around to asking you to do anything for byron
4976788 cool thanks anything else you want to tell me before i go inside to this breakfast thing
4976789 yea just tell byron about our conversation this morning tell him im thinking about him
4976790 my assumption is that the story of any one of us is in some measure the story of us all
4976791 creo que m s de 15 cargamentos o alrededor de 1 mill n de toneladas de soja hacia china fueron interrumpidos algunos cargamentos ser n sustituidos por soja estadounidense pero los costos ser n m s altos
4976792 si esta interrupci n contin a brasil est posicionado para ser el que m s se beneficie con las exportaciones de soja a china ah es donde brasil es m s competitivo
4976793 brasil ya tiene un gran n mero de barcos en los puertos aguardando para llevarse la nueva cosecha de soja a fines de mayo o principios de abril
4976794 estados unidos ya ha visto algunos beneficios de esta crisis de exportaci n argentina pero a n no queda claro qu tipos de beneficios tendr brasil con un volumen adicional
4976795 i dont know why i thought this couldnt happen to me
4976796 just shut up or something stronger and enjoy your life
4976797 well it looks like its up to me to clean house
4976798 you have done well my son but look at the holes in the fence the fence will never be the same when you say things in anger they leave a scar just like this one you can put a knife in a man and draw it out it wont matter how many times you say im sorry the wound is still there
4976799 i trace the rainbow through the rain and see the promise is not in vain
4976800 that was a very good start and that did it he is running oh god oh my father that was great and he broke the world record that was the bonus
4976801 he is the first jamaican to win the 100 metres at the olympics
4976802 there is no one there to test him and he has the three fastest times in the world this year so he should win this one
4976803 i decided not to watch the race as i did not want to get too excited
4976804 sat under an ackee tree until the race was over and neighbours told me what happened
4976805 usain is a cut above the rest and has an added speed dimension that sets him apart
4976806 once i saw bolt run that 10 03 seconds in march under no pressure i knew he would be the man to beat in the olympics
4976807 a bit disappointed that michael did not get on the medal podium but i am pleased with his personal best
4976808 i think the injury he suffered earlier in the year set him back a bit but he trained very well to get here i just hoped he had finished in the top three
4976809 a good friend someone i talk to often i feel for him he has so much ability
4976810 he has worked so hard and to see it pay off its so great

4976818 pero el hecho de hacerlo realmente cambia la situaci n estrat gica
4976819 en este momento cr tico parece que estados unidos no puede en realidad hacer nada
4976820 aquellos que decidieron apoyar exclusivamente a estados unidos van a reflexionar
4976821 we have agreed to continue with our work plan and develop a roadmap to victory
4976822 we shall nurture and adopt a new language which can foster mutual respect between the co operating parties
4976823 we shall make sure that we field a single candidate
4976824 the way of doing this is simple we may decide to have various primaries among ourselves to determine our strength so that we come up with one person to challenge the nrm candidate
4976825 when we talk of inter party cooperation people think that it is besigyes plan to get support of other opposition parties that is not true
4976826 to explore possibilities of adopting a common electoral platform for the 2011 general elections
4976827 for the past two years crude has followed the dollar almost lock step
4976828 the strength weve seen in the dollar is almost certainly helping bring crude down at this point as you move backward it actually acts as a stimulus on the economy
4976829 when you cant someone says you cant do something it shows that anything is possible
4976830 when you put your mind to a certain thing it can happen
4976831 were all watching this very closely the result of this will potentially affect all of our programs
4976832 we really want this girl to go home and have everything resolved
4976833 if this family wants to adopt her they should do that outside this program
4976834 and everyone is extremely concerned and quite devastated by it
4976835 were all trying to come together to a common agreement a way to get her home to safety that shes comfortable with
4976836 im not at liberty to tell you the meat of the meeting but things are very amicable between all parties at this point

4976847 through all these years russia has continued to recognize georgias territorial integrity
4976848 there doesnt seem to be much president bush can do about the russian invasion of georgia at this point except maybe feel guilty about his role in provoking it

4976902 hay que trabajar m s la pelota y tener paciencia para llegar al gol
4976903 las alemanas tienen un conjunto muy fuerte y muy dif cil de ser batido
4976904 estamos dando m s nfasis a la parte del acierto en los pases a la parte del conjunto del equipo para que la gente llegue y pueda trabajar bien y crear espacios
4976905 en brasil trabajamos siempre todos los puntos tanto en lo defensivo como en lo ofensivo y en la parte del centro del campo en la finalizaci n el pase del bal n la intensidad del juego todo lo necesario para que el equipo pueda conseguir esa victoria
4976906 nosotras necesitamos 120 minutos para conseguir el pase a semifinales mientras que brasil lo obtuvo en 90 estamos en un buen momento y ser un partido en el que la jugadoras deber n mostrar mucha voluntad para poder imponernos
4976907 cualquier detalle har la diferencia quiz s la suerte el desgaste o el cansancio
4976908 muy dif cil no como el primero que tuvimos en la fase previa
4976909 la cosa hoy es muy distinta a lo del a o pasado no podemos encararlo como si fuera la final de la copa del mundo porque no lo es
4976910 necesitamos ver las cosas como si fuera una final pero una final de olimpiada no de copa del mundo
4976911 no puedo incorporarme a la selecci n pero lo importante es que voy a recuperarme y espero hacerlo lo antes posible
4976912 en la final hay que correr con todo y si no logramos eliminar el dolor seguramente lo va a afectar
4976913 hemos hecho un buen saque durante todo el partido y en defensa el bloqueo ha funcionado a la perfecci n hemos conseguido muchos puntos en el bloqueo y hemos dejado a las italianas sin ideas en ataque con lo que todo ha sido m s f cil de lo esperado
4976914 estamos jugando muy bien cada partido vamos a m s porque le hemos cogido el ritmo a la competici n pero ahora viene lo m s dif cil ya no existe posibilidad de error pero creo que estamos preparadas para todo
4976915 ahora todos los equipos son fuertes y se juega todo a un partido da igual quien nos toque si nosotras hacemos nuestro juego podemos vencer a cualquiera
4976916 creo que hemos hecho una gran transici n defensa ataque aunque hay que reconocer que el bloqueo nos ha ayudado mucho a no pasar ning n apuro durante todo el partido
4976917 es cuesti n de concentraci n de trabajo y de un poco de suerte el bloqueo lo hace alguien pero tiene a todo el equipo detr s trabajando
4976918 todos los equipos sacan muy fuerte y es dif cil hacer una buena recepci n para la transici n al ataque en ese aspecto es en el que creo que debemos estar m s concentradas para lo que no queda de competici n
4976919 en el primer heat me sal de la raya y me descalificiaron yo siento que iba bien el entrenador estaba contento porque a pesar de la falta l piensa que yo deb estar entre las ocho primeras
4976920 no estoy contenta pero fueron mis primeras olimpiadas y los nervios me traicionaron pero pienso continuar representando a mi pa s de la mejor manera voy a prepararme mejor
4976921 las cosas no me salieron como esperaba pero pienso que todav a soy joven y tengo con qu salir adelante
4976922 la meta es llegar a la final y ah todos empiezan de cero

4976925 venir como individual s es m s dif cil los individuales entran primero en la pista mientras que entrar despu s tiene sus ventajas como ver c mo construyen los otros los saltos si la combinaci n la est n saltando de una forma concreta eso siempre te puede dar una idea
4976926 uno podr a decir que por ah ellos pueden tener una cierta ventaja pero a la hora de la competencia los saltos son los mismos para todos a todos se les pueden caer las barras

4976935 i constantly worry about boring the reader i think this psychology helps me developing a more captivating plot and pace
4976936 when writing bodies in motion my advisor looking at an early draft said that i seemed to be writing for white people because i was doing a lot of explaining of sri lankan culture that really startled me
4976937 it honestly blows my mind to imagine what my junior year of high school self would have thought had someone told him the story he was writing would be published twenty years later in a collection by knopf and that it would be his eighth book
4976938 jennifer the publisher also strongly encouraged me to make the story bare the first story so the first four words of my collection are i shaved my balls
4976939 it was interesting to see the different ways in which my stories

4976941 all the days events at least the ones were allowed into
4976942 the daily show news scraper 117 stories 73 situation rooms 26 news tickers
4976943 you all the news stories first before its even true
4976944 my favorite team is the bears and whoever is playing green bay this week
4976945 the main reason is we measure lactate levels is so we can judge at what intensity hes working at eamons a finely tuned athlete and you dont want him going at full capacity the whole time
4976946 for us its a way of judging at what intensity hes running at more so than him just telling us or going by his heart rate or other methods
4976947 we have a portable lactate analyser about the size of a mobile phone maybe a little bigger
4976948 it takes a sample of 0 05 of a millilitre and takes 60 seconds to count down so we can give pretty quick feedback to the coach
4976949 its something we do across a number of sports like swimming canoeing and cycling its stock standard and has been around for quite a few years
4976950 but every athletes different in how they respond to exercise and the lactate numbers you need to look at
4976951 with someone like eamon i think its worked pretty well weve looked at a lot of sessions so we know how he responds to training and what kind of numbers we expect from him
4976952 the only thing i was ever told by my mother was that of six previous children my dad was not involved in naming any of them so he supposedly tried to catch up using me he named me after a president a roman emperor and an indian chief being part indian i guess he felt he had to get an indian name in there somewhere ive always claimed he had to be in the firewater to give a kid a name like that
4976953 i did it man i did it i killed that guy i was running against
4976954 but officer were on the same side my middle name is crimefighter
4976955 everyone i know with an unusual name loves it its only the losers named dave that think having an unusual name is bad and who cares what they think theyre named dave
4976956 this appears to be the first example of cryptic female choice found in an externally fertilising species
4976957 we were startled to find that female salmon are also able to exert this kind of influence previously it had been thought that once their eggs had been released females had very little say over which of the males around her would fertilise them
4976958 we found that the speed of a males sperm varied significantly according to which females ovarian fluid it was swimming in
4976959 from the females perspective it makes sense that when you only have one opportunity to reproduce in your life you want to make sure you get it right
4976960 for the males you could say that the upshot is that there may be someone for everyone in the salmon world the race does not always go to the naturally fastest runner as the conditions on the racecourse differ
4976961 for instance whatever it is in this ovarian fluid that is enhancing or retarding sperm function may have a similar effect on sperm in other species
4976962 the key lies in giving residents of a settlement the responsibility for looking after their own water and allowing them to put into practice their own water management plans
4976963 in the desert if a sophisticated water purification system breaks down there is rarely anyone who lives locally who can fix it and it may stay broken for weeks or even months you need something that is simple robust and manageable
4976964 in the desert people are very aware of the need to manage water supplies and consequently they pay closer attention to their water supply than do city dwellers this means it is easier to adopt a risk management approach which requires a constant eye on things
4976965 and finally it is more economic to prioritise and target the big risks rather than trying to run a costly but vulnerable system that produces perfect water
4976966 we found that the australian drinking water guidelines framework for the management of drinking water quality was applicable to remote settlement water management and that the community water planner devised by the national health and medical research council provided a good way to get residents involved
4976967 everybody who took part said they learned something about how to look after water mainly through discussions this is immensely valuable when all residents in the settlement feel they have an involvement and quite the opposite of what goes on with water in cities
4976968 we also found there was a lot more knowledge and skill in how to manage water in these settlements than expected but it wasnt being put to use under the old system the new approach ensures that it will be

4977028 our data showed that there are very high levels of trust in australian healthcare professionals however australians want a better public health care system
4977029 overwhelmingly our sample said they were willing to pay higher taxes to have an improved healthcare system that would provide quality healthcare for all australians they trust their doctors they trust the medicare system but they really want to improve that system
4977030 everybody knows that public hospitals have been under pressure theyre under funded and under resourced therefore people might think there is reason to trust private hospitals which are better resourced
4977031 australians have faith in the system but believe that the system can be better the public understands that professionals working within the system are doing the best they can with the resources they have
4977032 we asked them about having a us style user pays system and attitudes were very negative for those questions overall we found that australians were very much in favour of publicly funded healthcare

4977072 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
4977073 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
4977074 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

4977093 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4977094 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4977095 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4977096 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer

4977098 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4977099 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4977100 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4977101 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4977102 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4977103 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4977104 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4977105 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4977106 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen

4977112 mama this is the first time i have been pain free this medicine just might really help me
4977113 this is a wonderful medicine used appropriately but an unforgiving medicine used inappropriately
4977114 many legitimate patients following the direction of the doctor have run into trouble with methadone including death
4977115 methadone is an extremely difficult drug to use even for specialists people were using it rather blithely for several years
4977116 in the clinical and regulatory communities everyone is trying to run and catch up with and deal with the causes of methadone overdoses
4977117 this could unequivocally cause death in patients who have not recently been using narcotics
4977118 we would have no reason to suspect that the dosing regimen
4977119 as soon as we became aware of deaths due to misprescribing for pain patients we began the process of instituting label changes
4977120 i dont think a drug that requires such a level of sophistication to use is what id call cheap because of the risks
4977121 given the medicines he was on his brain forgot to tell his heart to beat and his lungs to pump
4977122 i never had any idea of the risk nor did my husband
4977123 we know that a significant share of the methadone deaths involve doctors making well intended prescriptions
4977124 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4977125 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4977126 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4977127 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4977128 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4977129 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4977130 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4977131 the referee like the priest must be a complex personality he must have a strong ego in order to rise to the challenge of his job and yet he must resist all signs of his egocentricity
4977132 in the eyes of the others the referee can only be a loser never a winner and so he enters each match with the private hope that he might walk off the pitch at the end of ninety minutes as a completely unsung hero
4977133 milan kundera author of the unbearable lightness of being defended the role of the literary critic by arguing without the meditative background that is criticism works become isolated gestures historical accidents soon forgotten i would say the same of social history and sport
4977134 if you make football too important you deprive it of its beauty
4977135 pressures and burdens which have helped to create an atmosphere of fatigue and stress that has exacerbated existing issues in the bentleys relationship we want to affirm that there has been no sexual immorality on the part of either todd or shonnah
4977136 in his late teens todd had a dramatic encounter with the saving and delivering power of god this experience brought todd out of a lifestyle of drug and alcohol addiction without cravings or withdrawal symptoms he was also delivered from a lifestyle involving criminal activity youth prisons drugs sex satanic music and bondage
4977137 i had to be obedient to the lord sir why did the preacher just knee you in the gut i tell you the lord is working in you you felt a quivering
4977138 as unbelievable as it may sound i actually saw the apostle paul come walking toward me onto the bridge
4977139 you might be wondering how i knew immediately that it was paul i just perceived it by divine knowledge and revelation people have asked me what he looked like and so i will attempt to describe his appearance he was short not more than 51
4977140 but i suppose im one of those who is moderately skeptical these things are rarely black and white
4977141 im sure the demands of that kind of life can be extreme putting pressures on families
4977142 the dutch dont like conflict so we try to find compromises
4977143 encouraging debate among muslims on the role of women and the place of homosexuality
4977144 we dont want to be fundamentalists to revive 15 century islamic culture
4977145 we walked around and watched the sun rise it was pretty cool i liked the silence it was fun to pull back from the crazy world and take time to think
4977146 we had to write a paper about what we thought about abortion she never pushed an anti abortion line
4977147 all greatness is unconscious or it is little and nought
4977148 it is a rough road that leads to the heights of greatness
4977149 theyre afraid they wont get deployed again that it will end their careers that the military or their fellow soldiers will say so and sos not strong any more hes not going to cover my back theyre afraid of banishment
4977150 when i did the re enactment i realized i would have had to kill her and i was so relieved i didnt have to a woman a volunteer from a canadian veterans group took part in the enactment with us she played the role of the young serbian woman she later told me she wouldnt have blamed me for shooting her
4977151 when individuals confront a lot of pain they want to deny it put it behind them in our group we try to help the past become the past by helping people go through it the only way out of it is through it
4977152 we do it in a way that doesnt re trigger
4977153 theyre able to grieve and thats synonymous with dropping the baggage theyre no longer afraid they feel shame about their initial trauma and the group is a place where their shame can be lifted
4977154 its hard for men to ask for help its part of machismo but when men feel emotionally supported they become very expressive of their feelings
4977155 these soldiers have accessed their pain and learned how to relieve it theyve had other men validate them and say thats a lot of s you had to take and after that they can be very strong these soldiers could teach other men how to grieve in a healthy way
4977156 weve got a call im going to have to roll
4977157 not the answer to everything it is not the answer to atrocities or even tragedy
4977158 i think were afraid because ultimately in sex were going to meet god
4977159 to leave me all on fire with a great love of god
4977160 what the poem suggests is that spirit is more like a lover than a lawgiver or judge
4977161 and that living in harmony with spirit is more like falling in love than living up to an external standard of rightness
4977162 if our ability to love makes us most like god then it stands to reason that when we make love we might be in our most holy state should we break out the linens candles incense flowers and wine o god yes great sex is not only possible its divine
4977163 wiping them dry with her long sensuous hair it always knocks me out reminding me of the intimate christian connection between sacredness and vulnerable flesh
4977164 it appears that the peaks of sexual and spiritual connection among christians were more holistic
4977165 involving full body gratification as well as emotional and spiritual highs
4977166 this study demonstrates that peak sexual union requires mutual trust in the security of a committed relationship with another person just as spiritual union requires unquestioned trust in god
4977167 i think god desires sex to be as whole and complete as possible to include the whole body mind and soul why settle for something less for just physical pleasure when you can have the whole thing
4977168 i think jesus was celibate but that doesnt mean he wasnt sexual
4977169 people loved him and were in awe of him i think there was a lot of sexual energy there
4977170 its a very difficult time in the history of journalism
4977171 we are facing an emerging christian right leadership that intends to christianize all aspects of american life
4977172 for all you know i might murder a woman a week
4977173 everybody is happy for me ive gotten a lot of phone calls people are saying good job and well be watching you on tv a couple of old girlfriends and all of my aunts and uncles called me a couple of my old friends called one old friend i havent talked to in three years called hey man i just saw an article on you youre starting yeah dude i played pop warner with him i saw him one time in high school and that was it
4977174 it was cool its not a bad little place its a good city good neighborhoods i grew up in its not bad at all its just hot thats the only downside to it
4977175 i tried to have fun i was a little kid doing whatever i rode my dirt bike played football i played all of the sports i was pretty much an active kid school wasnt my priority back then i kind of had to pick it up in high school but i was a good little kid
4977176 i got it when i was like 8 on christmas morning my dad said hey brent go out and get the paper i opened the front door and the bike is leaning against the wall right there it was a yz 125 it was a red one i didnt even know how to ride yet i had to learn i was happy about it but it was sitting in the garage for a couple of weeks my dad taught me he put it on me he said heres the clutch here are the gears heres the gas go i got used to it and i got better and better at it
4977177 i got it three years ago and i started putting money into it
4977178 the highest ive gotten is 6 feet of air it was cool youre all strapped in youre not going anywhere
4977179 its full pads its like regular football except with three fewer guys it was fun its a lot different theres more scoring i liked it i liked running around there wasnt a playbook it was pretty simple the offense wasnt like this where its pretty complex its pretty much double out double slant stuff like that it wasnt real complicated
4977180 it was real small i think there were 250 people there there were 40 something in my graduating class everybody knew each other it was a christian school its a pretty good school but i didnt go to my senior prom im not into that
4977181 the biggest we had was two grand for one of our home games the cif championship game it seemed like a lot back then for our junior college bowl game i think we got 9 800 people thats the most ive ever played in front of that was an experience
4977182 i pitched i think thats where i got my arm strength i was a backup quarterback all through pop warner i think i threw two passes until i got to high school nobody taught me or anything like that i got in at quarterback and started throwing i dont like baseball anymore my junior year i played baseball my senior year i played golf
4977183 my family hates the bald look they want me to go back but nobody else has the spikes around here and the bald look is comfortable ive been rocking the spikes for a couple of years i dont know when i started doing it but i liked it i just grow it out gel it up i mess around you cant keep your hair the same all of the time
4977184 i got this one near his spine a couple of days after i turned 18 and i got this one on the right shoulder six months later ive been planning on it since i was 15 years old i cant really draw i told the tattoo artist who drew it up for me i said go ahead and do it i wanted it to look like someone took a razor blade cut the skin peeled it off and youd see the spine youd see the ribs youd see everything itll look pretty good when its done right now it looks pretty crappy itll get there
4977185 i eat everything theres not a food on this earth that i dont like i eat whatever comes ive been eating in the caf for a while now if i go out ill eat anything i had never had sushi before i got introduced to that last saturday night it was pretty good
4977186 not too good no girlfriend or anything im just kicking it trying to keep my mind on football why not football is pretty important to me
4977187 if i had just heard from the proponents i would probably vote for it myself
4977188 law enforcement agencies shall not allocate any resources for the investigation and prosecution of prostitutes for prostitution
4977189 coercion extortion battery rape and violent crimes regardless of the victims status as a sex worker
4977190 it will be a beautiful day when the masses look at the paper and truly realize they have lost their own country
4977191 white people arent going to do a thing until their toys are taken away from them
4977192 so things have to be worse for things to be better
4977193 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country
4977194 boy buggering in both islam and catholicism is okay with the pope as long as it isnt reported by the liberal press
4977195 the sexual attraction of his mother to her african husband jumps out from the page
4977196 american politics has often been an arena for angry minds
4977197 simply because no other word adequately evokes the sense of heated exaggeration suspiciousness and conspiratorial fantasy that i have in mind
4977198 yesterday i paid our latest home heating fuel delivery 1 100 i also paid my 2 000 plus credit card balance which bought gas and groceries for the month as we approach the traditional retirement age we are slowly paying off our daughters college tuition loan and trying to keep our heads above water please dont use my name i live in a small town and this is so embarrassing
4977199 i am so frightened i spent this winter with my heat turned down to 53 degrees i am a teacher and have my masters degree everything is going up except my salary which next year will go up slightly above 1 percent the middle class is no longer the middle class ive slipped into the lower class after a winter of double heating costs and now these new economic hits
4977200 i am a registered school nurse and my husband is a self employed bread baker we are in our mid 30s and have two young children we always thought if we went to college earned four year degrees and worked hard we would be able to live a decent life we both work very very hard to provide needed services to our vermont communities yet we scratch our heads when trying to budget our income how can it be that two college educated individuals with respectable careers are in such a financial bind
4977201 my husband and i followed all the rules he grew up in urban projects and went into the military service in vietnam so he could get gi bill benefits and go to college i grew up picking strawberries as a migrant worker but i was able to go to college on scholarships it doesnt seem right that after working hard and following all the rules for our lives now at 60 were tumbling down
4977202 i am thankful that my employer understands that many of us cannot afford to drive to work five days a week instead i work three 15 hour days keeping the heat at home just high enough to keep the pipes from bursting the bedrooms are not heated and stay at 30 degrees and i still cant keep up
4977203 we eat cereal and toast for dinner some nights because that is all i have
4977204 my parents both in their 60s are back to work so they can make ends meet and struggle to get enough gas money to see their doctors they are opting to close their house up for the winter and stay with my uncle so they dont have to put oil in the furnace meanwhile my mortgage is behind and we are at risk for foreclosure
4977205 usually one or two of the other party are chosen as a nod to non partisanship
4977206 you cant tell me that the very best people in the country except for one in 1999 were all democrats but then suddenly two years later all the best people in the country except for one were republicans
4977207 if the country is a third democratic a third republican and a third independent a democratic president who appoints only democrats has eliminated two thirds of the public from consideration
4977208 that rare combination of humility and confidence required to perform wisely at the highest level
4977209 the world has changed fundamentally and our system has not been able to adapt to these changes
4977210 the kind of reaching across the aisle that all of us believe is necessary
4977211 it might seem odd that one of the goals of britains biggest branded truck company is to get trucks off the road but that is exactly what we are trying to do
4977212 it seems ironic that we are now looking to revive more traditional modes of transport but new pressures such as congestion rising fuel prices and the environment mean the old methods are becoming viable again
4977213 this is a march for freedom a march for honor and a march against occupation
4977214 all issues can be resolved only through dialogue and peaceful means
4977215 se quemaron de 10 000 a 15 000 ha no recuerdo exactamente en n
4977216 hello my name is larry korkmas and i am calling mr phelps to speak with him regarding the mediation we have scheduled for next week if he is not available would you ask him for a time when i should call back oh and with whom am i speaking
4977217 kita sama sama membangun pertanian pertanian bukan hanya masalah antar departemen bukan hanya masalah antar mahasiswa tapi merupakan sinergi dari seluruh masyarakat
4977218 kami juga minta dukungan baik dari presiden dan semua pihak kami bekerja sama agar pembangunan pertanian menuju arah yang lebih baik
4977219 kami memberikan solusi dan masukan dari pandangan kami sebagai mahasiswa kami akan selalu ada bagi pemerintah untuk membantu dan bekerja sama dengan pemerintah
4977220 kami gembira bahwa mereka sangat berkomitmen untuk ikut berpartisipasi dalam memajukan pertanian indonesia
4977221 cambios significativos en su intensidad pero muestra mejor organizaci n
4977222 hay que mantener la mayor atenci n para las pr ximas 24 horas en la zona oriental del territorio nacional pero para periodos desde 36 y hasta 48 horas o un poco m s tambi n en las provincias centrales desde matanzas y hasta ciego de vila
4977223 va desde el occidente del pa s hacia la zona central pero en este momento el mayor conglomerado de esa trayectoria se encuentra en la zona central
4977224 los rganos de direcci n de esos territorios deben adoptar con racionalidad las medidas de protecci n de la poblaci n y sus bienes as como los recursos econ micos en riesgo
4977225 damn i could just cry to bits any second its the strangest thing
4977226 if its not for work please dont make me kick away my option to read next to my husband and critters instead
4977227 jeezum crow its frickin hot outside cant we just email
4977228 look why dont you go with so and so and ill try to meet you guys there but dont hate me if i dont make it promise okay kisses
4977229 was overlooked on reaping day am now just a crunchy expired soul in a well meaning shell
4977230 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4977231 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4977232 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4977233 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4977234 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4977235 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4977236 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4977237 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4977238 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4977239 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4977240 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4977241 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4977242 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4977243 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4977244 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4977245 thats maybe the single worst decision in the last 50 years in the city of portsmouth
4977246 it would be wonderful if it can some day be done elsewhere
4977247 i and many others were pretty concerned with the kind of people hanging out there and the kind of things that were going on out there
4977248 my legal counsel advised me not to go as there are other legal issues involved in the case if im such a thief why is there no class action suit with all the investors
4977249 we can slice it dice it any way we want
4977250 we can resell it and if anyone is interested in that wed be interested in talking to them
4977251 i was approached by schani krug after i met him at caf brioche
4977252 he was quite a con artist and had the gift of gab i invested because marilyn monroe was an icon it has been terrible i dont know why i invested and i was advised by two lawyers not to i still see him hanging out in portsmouth
4977253 for them to perpetuate this legacy of deception is nefarious
4977254 they have false information and most investors are on my side the truth will be known that all they allege is not true jim dougherty and i were friends if they manage to get rid of me they keep all the money and the other investors do not get paid and they make me a thief and scoundrel massages i have a back injury but the dating services thing is ludicrous i was sleeping on an air mattress for three years and made the film for less than it could have cost
4977255 that proposition is untenable and cannot be justified by appeals to presidential autonomy
4977256 the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law
4977257 we are a small church and as a retired pastor my heart would like to see them grow a little
4977258 we think about gas mileage fuel costs for the have nots but to think that the churches are going to struggle too especially small churches so we are coming up with creative ways of addressing this
4977259 the young granddaughter of one of the members of our church came in and said this church has a heartbeat
4977260 this has been one of the examples of that heartbeat
4977261 people ask me what is your goal and i come back and say 70 pounds but the goal is to stay healthy and lose as much as we can in a healthy way and also to exercise grace with those who are trying to lose and the numbers arent coming up the way theyd like
4977262 we have a big church and its expensive to heat
4977263 we had something similar many years ago and did it for a different reason i thought doing it now for fuel would be a benefit for the church
4977264 people are giving up the things they love like sweets or for some its carbohydrates everyone is pretty much using their own method some are just cutting down on the amount of food reducing portions by half and staying busy
4977265 we have a great support system in place for everyone where they can get together with the other pledges do walking and share recipes
4977266 the efforts and love and support that weve received within the church and outside the church has been a great support system for all of us and whenever we feel we are going to backslide we all tap into that reserve of faith and support
4977267 i think we had to close it 30 days this year
4977268 in our 19 years of business we have never come close to being closed that much
4977269 its nice we dont have to irrigate but on the down side right now our low lying fields are getting flooded some of the crops are dying
4977270 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4977271 on me demande sans arr t ce qui compte le plus un grand chelem ou les jeux et bien pour moi a ne se compare m me pas les jeux sont tellement plus grands cest le summum dune carri re
4977272 yes we can get you into a car even if you have bad credit or bankruptcy
4977273 by turns touching funny dark and redemptive this is a book for reading through then re reading in a different order for following clues for setting aside and thinking about and for getting lost in
4977274 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4977275 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4977276 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4977277 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4977278 his zeal was too active for him to allow himself any rest whilst he saw souls perishing eternally in the ignorance of the true god
4977279 his fasts were almost perpetual and on all fridays and vigils on bread and water the bare ground was his bed and sometimes in the open fields neither hunger thirst weariness rains extreme cold or dangers could ever abate his ardor to gain a soul to christ
4977280 seeing one day an assembly of idolaters on their knees before a great tree in an island in the river boristhenes commonly called the nieper he walked over the water to them and easily prevailed with them after the sight of such a miracle to destoy their idols fell the great oak and embrace the faith
4977281 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4977282 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4977283 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4977284 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4977285 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4977286 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4977287 je nai pas toujours voulu tre un papa mais une fois que votre copine est enceinte il ny a pas dautre choix que dassurer
4977288 je suis plus strict que nicole je ne suis pas hitler mais ils grandissent et quand il font des b tises ils nettoient
4977289 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4977290 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4977291 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4977292 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4977293 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4977294 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4977295 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4977296 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4977297 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4977298 gerade die startspiele sind sehr wichtig damit man schon mal luft hat wenn man zu hause gewonnen hat kann man ausw rts unentschieden spielen
4977299 wenn man auch in dortmund nur einen punkt holt hat man am ende vielleicht vier z hler zu wenig auf dem konto
4977300 wir brauchen noch einige zeit um den spielfluss zu entwickeln an dem wir t glich arbeiten
4977301 wir sind doch nicht wahnsinnige die wegen ein zwei drei wochen millionen ausgeben
4977302 but i was more trying the get the kids interested in it
4977303 one things i liked was i wanted to get other people interested in alternative energy its so necessary to get off oil
4977304 the things expensive but anyone who can help should help
4977305 if we are going to manage the ocean we need to understand it and participating in programs like this helps me as a fisherman to understand what is going on
4977306 it also helps the scientists learn how fishermen do things what knowledge and skills they have everybody learns
4977307 getting the environmental data back from nefsc confirms what i have been seeing in terms of where the fish are
4977308 i can definitely see the trends one degree change in water temperature can mean cod or another species you are fishing are not where you thought they would be
4977309 it isnt always intuitive either sometimes it is colder in waters to the south that you think should be warmer
4977310 the data help fishermen understand why they are catching certain fish at certain places at certain times
4977311 the data these vessels can provide using flounders for fisheries logbook data recording software is more accurate detailed and comprehensive than would be obtained without deploying expensive observers who are part of the northeast fishery observer program
4977312 the fishermen send in their data near real time to nefsc using their vessel monitoring systems vms the data are loaded to our databases and made available to fishermen via the internet to view edit and confirm in less than an hour after a fishing trip has ended
4977313 this allows the industry to ensure that the data received by nmfs are reported as they reported them they have additional control and accountability for the fisheries data they collect
4977314 it is very important to have fishermen involved in the research about their industry
4977315 the only way we are going to get things to improve is to participate in the process i get frustrated at times that things havent moved further forward but at least they are moving in the right direction
4977316 it is all about cooperation scientists need and want data about the ocean and fishermen can help provide that
4977317 the industry has to trust the scientists enough to want to provide accurate data and the scientists have to trust the industry enough to believe in the quality of the data
4977318 we had a burst of salt marsh mosquitoes two weeks ago
4977319 we ask people to keep a close eye on artificial containers outside houses and to empty them periodically wading pools recycling cans those can be really great mosquito breeding grounds
4977320 im not sure he realized those were cameras i dont know
4977321 i havent talked to him i dont know what he was thinking at that point
4977322 f r viele arbeitslose ist der einsatz in einem pflegeheim die m glichkeit des wiedereinstiegs in den alten beruf
4977323 wenn die menschen f r diese aufgabe qualifiziert sind ist das in ordnung
4977324 die langzeitarbeitslosen sollen aber auch keine medikamente verabreichen sondern beispielsweise vorlesen oder einkaufen
4977325 demenz gleichzusetzen mit basteln vorlesen und spazierengehen ist eine unversch mtheit
4977326 die pflegekasse will es immer m glichst billig haben aber die heime sollen weiterhin die hohen qualit tsstandards erf llen das passt nicht zusammen

4977330 its obviously two to three weeks earlier than when we usually do it but were given very little alternative here because of whats being done by an extremely officious and very antagonistic national democratic party in the way theyre treating new hampshire and the history of new hampshire
4977331 im very disappointed in the response of the democratic party in new hampshire
4977332 theyve basically taken a what me worry view of this issue and theyve allowed their leadership at the national level to actually go forward and manipulate them and discount the new hampshire primary
4977333 the party is done with the northeast you keep pulling us to the center be quiet or youll lose that
4977334 they said they rarely review short story collections maybe two a year and it has to be from a big name author
4977335 we seem to always know where we are in a billy collins poem but not necessarily where he is going i love to arrive with him at his arrivals he doesnt hide things from us as i think lesser poets do he allows us to overhear clearly what he himself has discovered

4977357 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4977358 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4977359 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4977360 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4977361 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4977362 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4977363 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4977364 het was n groot feest het weer was goed het publiek was fantastisch de sfeer was goed kortom een super geslaagd boerenrockfestival welke zonder problemen is verlopen
4977365 de derde en vierde editie van het boerenrockfestival zullen worden gehouden op de laatse zaterdag van augustus en n van de bands die al weer is gecontrateerd is mooi wark
4977366 wir sind bereit ypsilanti nicht nur zur ministerpr sidentin zu w hlen sondern auch feste verabredungen zu treffen wir erwarten dann aber auch dass die von uns tolerierte politik in die richtige richtung geht
4977367 wir verlangen nicht dass sofort alle ein euro jobs umgewandelt werden aber wir wollen einen einstieg sehen
4977368 dass man uns so viel vertrauen entgegenbringt dass die leute aus dem verfassungsschutz abgezogen werden die uns derzeit berwachen
4977369 wir sehen keinen anlass f r ver nderungen im conti vorstand
4977370 this is the greatest moment of my career and i will never forget this
4977371 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4977372 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4977373 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4977374 desarmar a la generalitat valenciana que ha abierto una grieta en el frente cl sico
4977375 pondr a a catalu a en una situaci n l mite pero muy clarificadora
4977376 el psc nunca m s podr a tener la misma relaci n con el psoe porque quedar a claro que el psoe prefiere al pp que al psc
4977377 ha pagado muy caro pactar con zapatero de espaldas a catalu a
4977378 el psc fue quien inici el proceso de ruptura del frente para el estatut
4977379 espero que la actitud del presidente de la generalitat jos montilla primer secretario del psc sea la misma actitud del conseller de econom a
4977380 lo que ser a terrible continu es que el psc se supeditara a los intereses del psoe y de hecho el psoe lo intenta forzando reuniones de barones para convencer al presidente de la generalitat pero no le ha salido bien
4977381 obliga a pasar por el consejo de pol tica fiscal y financiera cpff
4977382 dentro del modelo del estado espa ol no hay m s soluci n para catalu a que el concierto econ mico que es el nico instrumento que nos permitir a una negociaci n en condiciones de igualdad y equidad con el estado
4977383 el nico mecanismo que entender a el estado para negociar con equidad y paridad es que catalu a recaptara todos los impuestos como pasa con el sistema foral navarro y vasco
4977384 en catalu a hay una imposici n unilateral por parte del gobierno y nosotros como mucho podemos oponernos
4977385 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4977386 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4977387 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4977388 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4977389 predict whether the 2008 congress will break the record number of jewish legislators that was established in the 2006 election cycle

4977402 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that

4977404 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4977405 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4977406 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4977407 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4977408 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4977409 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

4977412 cheguei h pouco tempo e ainda estou conhecendo os companheiros acredito que vamos crescer a cada jogo
4977413 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4977414 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4977415 its a great sign for the future the average age of the team is quite low and it shows the potential we have for the next year
4977416 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4977417 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4977418 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4977419 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4977420 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4977421 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4977422 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4977423 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4977424 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4977425 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4977426 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4977427 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4977428 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4977429 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4977430 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4977431 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4977432 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4977433 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4977434 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4977435 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4977436 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4977437 sense of limbo wherein the bars palpable detachment from the surrounding geography and the norms of both the society in which it exists and that which it strives to emulate mirrors that of its transient patrons

4977440 i would like the immediate opening of humanitarian corridors between south ossetia and the rest of georgia so that the dead can receive a dignified burial the wounded can get access to care and those who want to rejoin their dear ones can do so
4977441 security and fundamental rights which can never ever be violated have to be guaranteed to the ethnic minorities caught up in the conflict
4977442 i hope in the end that the current ceasefire struck through the efforts of the european union will lead to a lasting peace
4977443 i would like the immediate opening of humanitarian corridors between south ossetia and the rest of georgia so that the dead can receive a dignified burial the wounded can get access to care and those who want to rejoin their dear ones can do so
4977444 nobody knows whats being said and no one will take claim
4977445 i heard something about you but im not saying what from whom
4977446 i knew it because the first name of the season is arthur
4977447 theres just so much debt on the properties the bank has to protect their interest and thats what they did
4977448 theres a ton of supply theres a normal amount of demand
4977449 we may not get 2 million for a property thats worth 1 million
4977450 the event will be one of the finest with food and dancing and the theme will set an exciting evening that everyone is interested in dressing up for
4977451 santee may be one of the best kept secrets in south carolina
4977452 sisi ho sempre amato i carabinieri so tutto di loro
4977453 it wasnt a classic by any means but it was important for us to get off the mark it was based on a real wholehearted defensive display from everybody
4977454 we took the limited chances we created and managed to hang in there we knew for 20 minutes they were going to come at us and we had to stop them playing and then come back with a bit more its a foundation for us
4977455 goals change games theres no doubt about that we took control of the game and created three or four very good opportunities and the keeper has made a couple of great saves and we squandered a couple of good chances
4977456 we didnt get off to the best of starts we were a bit sloppy at the back early on although when we lost jody it didnt help matters but neill came in and did a tremendous job and we coped well not only when they played with one up front but also when they put on another striker
4977457 i feel that as a unit all the back five defended well but going forwards we were different class we got four goals and if the truth be told we should have had more if we can keep this up teams are going to struggle to keep pace with us
4977458 it was a great feeling to put four past the league leaders im loving it at wolves and couldnt be happier with the way things are going
4977459 i thought southampton were the better side in the first half but we were much the better side in the second wasnt happy with our first half performance and southampton deserved to go into the break 1 0 up but i am pleased with our performance in the second half
4977460 we created a lot of chances and i felt we fully deserved our victory and all three points i am really pleased with the way we performed
4977461 obviously its difficult to say because he was playing against wycombe not manchester united but i thought quincys performance was exceptional
4977462 he wanted the ball he kept the ball and his goal was incredible there was a certain sense of arrogance about it i think hes still got a lot of hardwork to do and hes got to build up his fitness obviously its difficult to judge him after just 30 minutes but he appears to have star quality somebody who excites the fans
4977463 hes the type of player who likes to test full backs which i think is one of the hardest things to do in the game it started off in the days of stanley matthews and its always hard to find somebody who is prepared to take on defenders
4977464 it was an excellent game of football but swansea were brighter and better in possession than us in the first half we found our way through them but they had more opportunities
4977465 we gave the ball away needlessly on occasions but we quelled that in the second half and it was more of an even game the second half was going well we made a huge improvement and we looked as if we would be in control
4977466 but then the penalty gave them the advantage the penalty didnt look much and having seen it again it looked even less it is unfortunate to have a bad decision against us
4977467 we will go into our next home game looking to bounce back from that
4977468 we have got to work hard in training this week because we have another physical game coming up we know what watford are like so they will be on a high and we have to try and reach those kinds of highs
4977469 it is good and guy is a good player i have been playing in midfield from the start and it is working together we both sit in break the play up and give it to the others
4977470 one man cell the new face of al qaeda terror
4977471 he deserves every ounce of respect and admiration and attention that he gets because what hes doing is incredibly phenomenal
4977472 being his teammate for so many years you get desensitized to how amazing he is i think many years down the road me and the other members of the team will realize what an incredible performance he put on for everybody here
4977473 i mean its something im incredibly proud of but it was never a goal of mine to be the most decorated female swimmer or anything like that im very happy with the six medals i have hopefully ill get some more in london
4977474 her immediate plan is to give her mind and body a well deserved vacation
4977475 to enjoy all these places that ive been to for swim meets and never seen anything but the pool and hotel
4977476 i think i forced myself to get back in too early after athens
4977477 i had a real lack of motivation the first practice i want to be excited about by staying physically in good shape and staying away from competition i think ill shoot back fast
4977478 ive got my wedding coming up so i want to be in good shape
4977479 it took a lot of pressure off me for the rest of the meet
4977480 i remember leaving athens i was like wow i dont remember that
4977481 i was just overwhelmed with the entire experience i think that gave me a bit of an advantage this time i did make a conscious effort to stay present in the moment
4977482 cada uno a su cada que esto no tiene sentido y votar a favor del refer ndum

4977514 my moms wellies proved useless and that was before the water got really high
4977515 in the end my neighbours decided to just wade through the water to get around
4977516 a lot of the houses in banbridge were flooded and rescue services came to drain some of the water off ive lived here all my life and ive never seen it this bad
4977517 i took this shot after picking my daughter up from work the water was just gushing down from a carriageway above

4977560 on august 7 after days of shooting incidents in the south ossetian conflict zone georgian president mikheil saakashvili made a speech in which he said that he had given the georgian villagers orders not to fire that he wanted to offer south ossetia unlimited autonomy within the georgian state with russia to be a guarantor of the arrangement
4977561 both sides said they were discussing a meeting the next day to discuss how to defuse the clashes
4977562 that evening however saakashvili went for the military option the georgian military launched a massive artillery attack on tskhinvali followed the next day by a ground assault involving tanks
4977563 this was a city with no pure military targets full of civilians who had been given no warning and were expecting peace talks at any moment
4977564 the attack looked designed to take everybody by surprise perhaps because much of the russian leadership was in beijing for the opening of the olympic games it also unilaterally destroyed the negotiating and peacekeeping arrangements under the aegis of the organization for security and cooperation in europe that have been in place for 16 years russian peacekeeping troops based in south ossetia were among those killed in the georgian assault

4977575 the donors are not dead i understand that they would like us to change the definition of death but they cant do that by themselves its very problematic to start treating a baby as an organ donor before its dead
4977576 the whole issue is whether the infants from whom the hearts were taken were dead it seems very clear to me that they were not
4977577 i think its illegal and if its illegal what were talking about is the physicians causing the death of the three patients and that would be homicide its immoral i think it should be stopped

4977696 i cheated here and did some research before hand i actually looked at this idea ahead of time
4977697 any voluntary quiet period that does not begin before the agreements actually expire or which is too brief to preclude potentially confusing messages about broadcast carriage during the time of the actual dtv transition represents the illusion of a commitment and does not serve the consumer
4977698 while we appreciate those nab members willingness to embrace a retransmission consent quiet period a start date of feb 4 2009 is simply too late and will not go far enough to protect consumers whose signals could be pulled by broadcasters before feb 4
4977699 were focused on the dtv transition theyre focused on retransmission consent those are two very different sets of business issues
4977700 thats a business decision between the cable company or satellite provider and the local broadcaster
4977701 i dont want to speak on his behalf but martin seemed fine with it
4977702 he said his dates had just been kind of floating around in his mind there was nothing magic about his dates
4977703 he is open to options but he has not made a decision on this one
4977704 many tv carriage contracts are coming up at the end of the year
4977705 i know fcc commissioner jonathan adelstein has supported the dec 15 date for the very reason the contracts would be expiring at the end of the year this would prevent any kind of ability of broadcasters to leverage that to the detriment of our members and certainly their customers
4977706 while we support a quiet period around the digital transition we strongly believe that all affected parties should be involved and reach a consensus on the parameters before moving forward
4977707 youd have to live under a rock to not know

4977716 if youre a comcast customer and you buy a package of content from us you should be able to consume and manage that content across screens
4977717 we very much believe that the internet and the pc should be a tool to manage and consume that content
4977718 one of the luxuries we have as part of comcast is the scale to pursue our huge ambitions for cim
4977719 we want to capture a share of what everybody believes will be an increasingly ad supported revenue stream online
4977720 were providing the ecosystem to have a low friction way of moving from the content owners and the distributors
4977721 not only is it the right strategy its the essential strategy
4977722 consumers are showing companies what needs to be done by shifting their consumption away from linear video any company that doesnt give customers what theyre looking for is going to be disadvantaged
4977723 are worried that if they give you online video youll drop your premium cable subscription
4977724 theyre right in that fear by the way but only comcast seems to have the money and the commitment to getting there first rather than watching someone else come in and walk away with their business
4977725 proven track record of developing and growing multiple online entertainment businesses
4977726 but by stitching the windows together in that fashion we believe that consumers will get an on demand experience when they want it where they want it
4977727 what youll see over the next 12 months is if what youre looking for is online but you want to watch it on your living room tv well be able to say heres how you get it from the internet to the television
4977728 we think consumers really are going to respond to what we can offer
4977729 we have 30 year relationships with these content guys its a synergistic relationship with them theres no reason why that relationship shouldnt extend online
4977730 fancast reinforces linear by helping people find new and complementary content
4977731 i think its nothing but good news for us to figure out ways of working with comcast and other distributors to extend to as many platforms and as many devices as possible
4977732 they can experiment and they can come in later and buy and integrate if they need to take advantage of a market trend

4977736 cable one customers opted in to our monitoring of their internet usage and content consistent with this third party test when they agreed to our aup

4977774 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4977775 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4977776 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4977777 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4977778 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4977779 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4977786 being promoted to bbc one and gaining a wider audience
4977787 the patient must utilise the technology usefully in the correct perspective instead of dissection discussion and hair splitting
4977788 the internet which is very useful to most of us can supply ideas to the patient to gain knowledge to pose intelligent questions to the urologist and forget the actual purpose of the visit to the doctor
4977789 the urologist may have a tough time treating such patients successfully and satisfactorily
4977790 for a long time people kind of got use to going to the doctors and filing a claim now its like we want the whole bill upfront
4977791 we are like any other business we have to collect our money to pay our bills its far easier to collect upfront than to go after someone on the back end
4977792 its reasonable to go an eye doctor on monday and then visit other doctors on wednesday and thursday and there will be an overpayment

4977804 people talk of global warming but dont go out and do anything about it
4977805 i only plant trees that are strong have long life provide shade and are useful to society they should impede neither traffic nor pedestrians
4977806 just planting a tree and taking a photo with it is a very immature act if you want to grow a useful healthy tree you need to be willing to spend rs 1 500 to rs 2 000 per tree and two to three years tending to it till it becomes stable and strong
4977807 you have to examine the soil prepare the hole and only then plant a sapling
4977808 we made many mistakes and spent a lot of money before we learnt the right way to grow healthy trees
4977809 you can learn a lot from just growing one tree i always say trees are the best friend of man but man is the worst enemy of trees
4977810 people from adyar and tiruvanmiyur who are travelling to puducherry cuddalore and further south had to go all the way to the north of the city to koyambedu to get their bus that made no sense wasting all that fuel and time

4977820 celtic are perfect for him and he will be an excellent signing for them
4977821 glenn was just 17 when i got to know him at feyenoord and i could tell from our first training session he was a no nonsense defender
4977822 when he was coming through the ranks we would often have practise games in training between the first team and younger players of course id be right up against glenn and he wouldnt hold back
4977823 i remember telling him early in his career at feyenoord he would be suited perfectly to british football
4977824 sometimes in holland we expect too much from our stoppers we want them to defend score goals and set up attacks there is perhaps less pressure to do that in britain
4977825 so ive no doubt glenn will do well and i hope its another success story for a dutchman at parkhead
4977826 he was playing regularly at the de kuip stadium for feyenoord in front of 50 000 passionate fans
4977827 so playing for celtic is something he will look forward to and be keen to take on
4977828 all the government offices and services were on alert during the ceremony
4977829 the security plan required thousands of security personnel including more than 2 000 women police workers
4977830 the pilgrims were aware that these measures were for their safety and to protect them from terrorist attacks
4977831 there was collaboration between baghdad police and neighbouring provinces of karbala there were special forces from the ministry of interior who also took part
4977832 this was the most successful ceremony since the fall of the saddam hussein regime because we did not face any problems as we marched for seven days to reach karbala
4977833 the security measures were in our interest as several pilgrims were attacked while on their way to karbala from baghdad
4977834 i had no fear this year the pilgrimage was successful
4977835 what i actually said was that we were just friends and only friends the whole time and if anything he had a thing for chemda

4977842 the doctor said well it looks like hes got all the symptoms of west nile virus
4977843 i called the state health department because i needed to know how long he was going to be sick
4977844 i was just bawling i thought he was going to die
4977845 he was diagnosed with epstein barr virus which is pretty much the same thing but you dont die from it
4977846 i dont blame him because all the doctors are doing it
4977847 id like to know how many people have been told they have west nile
4977848 this has been going on since west nile came into utah some doctors will base things on symptoms and not do tests
4977849 like any medical test they can be expensive and if people dont have insurance then sometimes the doctor will go ahead and try to help the patient
4977850 whether theyre helping or not may be something of a question
4977851 he said well it sounds like youve got west nile
4977852 it was really strange it was just contradictory to what we had heard on the news and what seemed to be happening everywhere
4977853 i ended up going to the doctor in the springtime
4977854 they found out that i was really anemic the question i have now is did i ever really have it am i immune to it am i going to get it again
4977855 people who have been told they have it are out on the lake not really worrying about it
4977856 i cant imagine how many people have been told that
4977857 maybe theres something seriously wrong that they dont know about and they say nah its west nile
4977858 we try to do education for physicians and stuff like that thats the best we can do is try to educate people of what tests to draw and those kinds of things
4977859 thats the only way to tell for sure if theres west nile

4977957 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
4977958 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto

4977960 y as pa no morir de hambre buscaban los animales de los men ndez por eso los mataba men ndez
4977961 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
4977962 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno
4977963 detritus de la sociedad seres sin escr pulos y sin entra as que en pos del dinero y de la fortuna ca an en punta arenas atra dos por la f cil impunidad
4977964 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
4977965 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
4977966 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
4977967 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4977968 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4977969 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4977970 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4977971 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4977972 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4977973 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4977974 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4977975 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4977976 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4977977 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4977978 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4977979 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4977980 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4977981 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4977982 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
4977983 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
4977984 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
4977985 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4977986 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4977987 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4977988 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4977989 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4977990 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4977991 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4977992 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4977993 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4977994 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4977995 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4977996 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4977997 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4977998 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
4977999 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
4978000 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
4978001 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
4978002 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
4978003 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
4978004 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
4978005 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
4978006 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
4978007 i couldnt really get engaged in anything yesterday as i felt worn down
4978008 sabemos da import ncia desse jogo j que uma vit ria vai nos deixar mais pr ximos da ponta da tabela e uma derrota deixa o gr mio mais perto do t tulo por isso estamos concentrados para fazer um bom jogo
4978009 se perdermos para o gr mio vamos ficar com 11 pontos a menos ficando muito mais complicado para pensarmos em t tulo por isso temos de vencer l em caso de derrota fica quase imposs vel buscar e precisamos recuperar os pontos que eles nos tiraram no morumbi
4978010 n o diria que uma final pois sabemos que o campeonato n o termina outra partida importante seria uma decis o para nossa equipe dessa forma que estamos encarando esse jogo todos estamos cientes do que significa esse confronto na competi o por isso nosso pensamento apenas de vencer
4978011 eles est o cada vez mais atentos ao gr mio e precisamos criar formas de surpreender
4978012 o s o paulo um time muito qualificado que se recuperou no campeonato e forte candidato ao t tulo
4978013 se vencermos vamos nos distanciar de um advers rio apontado como favorito ao t tulo n o podemos dar espa os temos de marcar forte especialmente alguns que podem desequilibrar
4978014 realmente uma promessa uma meta e um objetivo livrar o fluminense da s rie b vou aproveitar o bom trabalho do renato ga cho que conquistou o t tulo da copa do brasil 2007 e foi vice da libertadores
4978015 ela foi totalmente positiva espero que o nosso time seja recompensado no domingo com uma grande vit ria sobre o atl tico mg
4978016 precisamos criar uma estrat gia para os tr s quatro primeiros jogos do returno vamos enfrentar equipes que est o pr ximas ou at atr s do atl tico mg
4978017 tinha uma preocupa o pois foram 12 jogos num espa o curto de tempo ent o os jogadores sentiram o serginho estava com gripe saiu no primeiro tempo do jogo com o botafogo mas todos se apresentaram bem ontem s bado felizes entusiasmados e motivados
4978018 its unbelievable for me this is the best moment in my career ill never forget it
4978019 it does mean more for me to win it with serena to share this kind of moment with your sister
4978020 create an environment of trust and prevent any disruptive actions by the enemy
4978021 i wanted to know that i would have the ability to call the shots
4978022 the relays and putting four guys all together made this possible
4978023 we dont want to have any doubts about the decision and the integrity of fina
4978024 they say this is how it happened and we assume everybody was treated equally in the race
4978025 they accepted the ruling because it was not the human eye making the judgment
4978026 a lot of religious voters are trying to make up their mind about how they vote
4978027 a lot say they have some preference for mccain but a lot of that preference is soft and many are still open
4978028 the candidates faith and how they connect to issues is important to those voters
4978029 as a pastor i believe in the separation of church and state but i dont believe we can separate religion from politics because ones faith determines ones worldview which informs ones decisions and determines how one would lead
4978030 just as sept 11 revolutionized our resolve to defeat our enemies so has it brought into focus the opportunities we now have to secure and expand our freedom
4978031 i particularly hope he strengthens his economic message even sen obama can speak more clearly and specifically about the kitchen table bread and butter issues like high energy costs
4978032 its fine to tell people about hope and change but you have to have plenty of concrete pragmatic ideas that bring hope and change to life
4978033 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
4978034 i think sen obama is a motivational speaker but at the end of the day i dont think that will translate into votes and certainly not the image of strength that ronald reagan had
4978035 the one area he still needs credibility in is experience and picking an evan bayh or a joe biden as vice president would help a lot with that
4978036 the ad calls on people to support the freedom to marry
4978037 in the midst of an initiative campaign this kind of call to action advocacy should be seen as lobbying against the current initiative
4978038 is untethered to any political moment election year political decision or vote it is all about asking people how they would feel if they or their loved ones couldnt marry who they love
4978039 running a campaign of this size and scope is costing millions of dollars
4978040 this is our chance to put all our time hard work and money into changing the climate in california this is the time to do whatever you can and all you can
4978041 it aint for wedding gowns of course it is a campaign ad
4978042 it is clearly use of a loophole in the law
4978043 whether it is an effective campaign tool is a different matter clearly theyre trying to set a soft message in place to get the electorate ready for the battle that is likely to come
4978044 what passes for optimism is most often the effect of an intellectual error
4978045 will consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
4978046 we hope our republican colleagues will join in a bipartisan effort not only to increase domestic supply but also to help consumers and to protect the environment
4978047 if speaker pelosi and her democratic colleagues were truly serious about increasing production of american energy and lowering the price of gasoline they would call congress back into session immediately to vote on our all of the above energy plan rather than taking a five week break away from washington
4978048 another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices
4978049 we are going to put them to the test on this issue
4978050 during the past eight years our energy policy has been directed by the two oil men in the white house
4978051 their failed policy has increased our dependence on foreign oil damaged our economy and left consumers paying record prices at the pump
4978052 during the past eight years our energy policy has been directed by the two oil men in the white house
4978053 coordinated campaign in ohio to subvert the will of the people in 2004
4978054 i can remember sitting with newt gingrich downstairs in the bar until 2 in the morning talking politics and events of the day
4978055 he went out to the kitchen and wanted to meet the staff
4978056 weve been fortunate to be around for several generations in the same location

4978058 whoever wants to come is welcome here weve prided ourselves on keeping our heads above water in the era of fast foods
4978059 he said the president doesnt eat cheese he doesnt eat chocolate and he doesnt like to drink coffee from a paper cup
4978060 i thought i was going to die he was so good looking then i looked into his eyes and got weak in the knees
4978061 to me they are all the same they are like my customers i dont put anyone on a pedestal
4978062 weve been around since 1951 and its just one of those places that everyone wants to be a part of if youre from out of town and you want to give someone a taste of cincinnati you come here
4978063 but the roads were blocked all i got to see was his motorcade driving by
4978064 political figures have stayed there debated there its been a center for civic and political discussion for over 200 years
4978065 in case this other endeavor doesnt work out i know i can come back to bob evans
4978066 i got a call at 8 45 the night before saying she was coming to the restaurant and dont tell anyone they wanted it to be a low key deal
4978067 the next morning by the time i got to work everybody was talking about it i had to call my staff in to direct traffic
4978068 you couldnt walk through the restaurant people were everywhere standing on chairs on the booths
4978069 i was sitting there at the bar like i do every day at lunch
4978070 of course it ended up on the front page of the akron
4978071 its a technical issue with the rudder that will be rectified overnight

4978080 the fact that ukraine is no longer a party to the 1992 agreement allows it to launch active cooperation with european countries to integrate its information

4978084 la chiesa anglicana dirlanda non accetter mai le unioni gay
4978085 la chiesa dirlanda non potr mai sostenere le relazioni omosessuali anche nel caso in cui la scienza dimostrasse che sono naturali
4978086 non ha alcun senso affermare che per il fatto che si nati con una certa inclinazione allora essa data da dio e si dovrebbe essere liberi di assecondarla nella propria vita
4978087 si dovrebbe allora dire che ci sono molte differenti inclinazioni con cui ciascuno nasce anche se queste fossero un dato essenziale della loro natura e che si spende una intera vita a cercare di dominarle

4978094 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4978095 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4978096 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4978097 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4978098 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4978099 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4978100 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4978101 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4978102 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4978103 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4978104 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4978105 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4978106 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4978107 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4978108 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4978109 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4978110 unless you get off to a really hot start you kind of feel like youre behind the eight ball
4978111 sometimes you can start pressing too much and in golf pressings not really good to do youve got to let the birdies happen let the putts go in you cant really force them in i think its easy to get agitated the day after you made everything
4978112 where we are and where carl is even if carl stumbles and falls back its still going to take a low number sunday for somebody to win the tournament
4978113 i had so many chances today but i just didnt convert the putts like i did yesterday
4978114 ive played that hole terrible all week so ill just keep the trend going
4978115 at that point i got a sense that carl was still putting the pedal to the metal
4978116 so i had to make some more birdies i got back in the hunt
4978117 i told my caddie if i made this i would get in the bunker and do a snow angel
4978118 i shot 28 on the back nine he does something like that the tournament is out of reach
4978119 if he can be friendly and make a bunch of pars it would leave a lot of people back in it

4978125 all the days events at least the ones were allowed into
4978126 the daily show news scraper 117 stories 73 situation rooms 26 news tickers
4978127 you all the news stories first before its even true
4978128 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4978129 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4978130 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4978131 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4978132 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4978133 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4978134 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4978135 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4978136 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4978137 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4978138 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4978139 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4978140 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4978141 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4978142 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4978143 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4978144 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4978145 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4978146 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4978147 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4978148 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4978149 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4978150 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4978151 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4978152 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4978153 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4978154 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4978155 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4978156 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4978157 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4978158 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4978159 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4978160 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4978161 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4978162 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4978163 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4978164 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4978165 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4978166 wir wollen unsere service center modernisieren und kleinere standorte in gr ere wettbewerbsf hige standorte berf hren
4978167 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4978168 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4978169 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4978170 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4978171 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4978172 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4978173 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4978174 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

4978290 identificata pi di 70 anni fa come carattere fondante della vera scienza dal filosofo karl popper la falsificabilit stata sempre vista da molti scienziati come unarma affidabile per tenere lontana la minaccia della pseudoscienza il vecchio pensatore viennese stato acclamato come il pi grande filosofo della scienza da personaggi del calibro di steven weinberg vincitore del premio nobel per la fisica e il celebre libro di popper logica della scoperta scientifica stato definito dal cosmologo frank tipler il libro pi importante del secolo per i tempi cambiano la definizione di scienza data da popper stata messa a dura prova dallemergere di idee scientifiche che sembrano sconfessarla dai tentativi di comprendere la natura fondamentale dello spaziotempo alle teorie che tentano di descrivere gli eventi precedenti al big bang le frontiere della scienza stanno generando una quantit di idee apparentemente impossibili da falsificare
4978291 perci non ho problemi ad ammettere che per pervenire alle mie proposte sono stato guidato in ultima analisi da giudizi di valore e predilezioni personali ma spero che le mie proposte possano apparire accettabili a coloro che attribuiscono valore non solo al rigore logico ma anche alla libert dal dogmatismo che ricercano lapplicabilit pratica ma sono attratti anche di pi dallavventura della scienza e da scoperte che incessantemente ci costringono a confrontarci con nuove e inattese domande sfidandoci a sperimentare risposte finora mai sognate
4978292 gran parte dellattrattiva di popper risiede nella logica tagliente che sta alla base del concetto di falsificabilit popper la illustra attraverso lormai celebre esempio del cigno nero supponiamo che una teoria ipotizzi che tutti i cigni sono bianchi il modo pi ovvio di provare questa teoria di andare a verificare se ciascun cigno sia realmente bianco ma c un problema non importa quanti cigni bianchi si possano trovare non si potr mai essere certi che non esista un cigno nero nascosto da qualche parte dunque non sar mai possibile dimostrare che la teoria vera viceversa il ritrovamento anche di un solo cigno nero sar la prova che la teoria falsa questo il potere fondamentale della falsificazione la capacit di rendere falsa unaffermazione universale con un singolo esempio una capacit sottolineava popper che discende direttamente dai teoremi della logica deduttiva
4978293 convinto che sia tempo di abbandonare lidea di popper che sia possibile definire il procedimento scientifico utilizzando la logica deduttiva al contrario occorrerebbe concentrarsi su ci che gli scienziati fanno nella realt mettere insieme gli elementi di prova delle diverse teorie valutando la loro plausibilit relativa howson tra i principali sostenitori di una visione alternativa della scienza fondata non sulla semplicistica logica vero falso ma sul concetto assai pi sottile di gradi di credenza alla base di questo concetto vi la fondamentale connessione tra il concetto soggettivo di credere e il freddo sterile computo delle probabilit
4978294 a prima vista potrebbe sembrare sorprendente che un banale risultato matematico ottenuto da un oscuro ministro presbiteriano vissuto pi di 200 anni fa possa esercitare ancora tanto interesse riguardo a cos tante discipline dalleconometria alla biostatistica dallanalisi del rischio finanziario alla cosmologia
4978295 un saggio sulla risoluzione dei problemi nella dottrina delle probabilit
4978296 gli scienziati iniziano con lesame di una serie di spiegazioni contrastanti riguardo un determinato fenomeno poi vengono le osservazioni e infine la matematica bayesiana viene utilizzata per calcolare il livello di attendibilit guadagnata o perduta da ciascuna delle teorie rivali in parole povere essa mette a confronto le probabilit di ottenere i risultati osservati da parte di ciascuna delle contrastanti teorie la teoria che ottiene le probabilit pi alte verr considerata quella che ha ricavato il maggior livello di attendibilit a partire dai dati
4978297 le probabilit di ottenere i risultati osservati da parte di ciascuna delle contrastanti teorie
4978298 le osservazioni empiriche stabiliscono se una teoria va presa sul serio
4978299 comunque un matematico che riuscisse a sostenere la sua profezia con terminologia e formule matematiche non verrebbe capito da nessuno ma sarebbe creduto da tutti
4978300 iniziato ad accumularsi in modo cos massiccio che i metereologi fanno fatica a tenerne il conto
4978301 stanno conducendo indagini su larga scala per stabilire come mai il clima dellartico stia diventando pi freddo e perch alcune zone del mar glaciale artico siano diventate negli ultimi tempi minacciosamente pi spesse e se lestensione di questa coltre ghiacciata contribuisca a preparare nuove ere glaciali
4978302 gli scienziati sempre loro temono che lequilibrio climatico nel mondo stia per finire
4978303 dallo studio di campioni di ghiaccio estratti dalla calotta groenlandese sembra che 89 500 anni fa qualcosa di catastrofico abbia modificato il clima portandolo da una temperatura maggiore di quella odierna a quella di una piena era glaciale
4978304 il clima del mondo sta cambiando di questo gli scienziati immancabili sono fermamente convinti ma perch e in quale direzione lo stia facendo oggetto di un acceso dibattito
4978305 questinverno chicago rimasta paralizzata dalla neve linverno scorso fu boston europea ha visto il dicembre pi freddo da un secolo a questa parte
4978306 gli scienziati arieccoli hanno resuscitato la controversa idea che milioni di miglia cubiche di ghiaccio antartico possano in certi casi scivolare improvvisamente dal continente nel mare col risultato di incrementare spaventosamente il livello degli oceani e accelerare il drammatico raffreddamento del clima mondiale
4978307 alcune scoperte nellartico confermano la teoria dellinnalzamento delle temperature globali un misterioso riscaldamento del clima si sta lentamente manifestando nellartico dando vita a un serio problema internazionale lo ha detto oggi il dr hans ahlmann noto geofisico svedese
4978308 la teoria che il mondo si stia lentamente riscaldando ha ricevuto nuove conferme dai dati delle temperature
4978309 il nostro clima sta forse cambiando il succedersi di estati temperate e di inverni miti da diversi anni a questa parte culminato lo scorso inverno nella quasi totale assenza di croste di ghiaccio nella valle dellhudson rende questa domanda pertinente i concittadini pi anziani ci dicono che gli inverni non sono pi freddi come quando loro erano giovani e noi tutti abbiamo potuto notare una notevole diminuzione media del freddo in questultimo decennio

4978339 so i wish all the best all the happiness all the joy that comes with that certificate just the joy of being able to stand up and say that in front of everyone you love and care about in front of each other and to walk away legal is huge
4978340 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
4978341 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
4978342 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
4978343 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
4978344 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
4978345 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
4978346 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
4978347 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
4978348 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
4978349 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
4978350 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
4978351 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
4978352 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
4978353 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
4978354 the monkey chants that greeted englands black footballers in a friendly game in spain and the blacking up of some local fans when lewis hamilton was competing in the spanish grand prix
4978355 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4978356 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4978357 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4978358 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4978359 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4978360 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4978361 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4978362 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
4978363 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
4978364 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
4978365 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
4978366 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
4978367 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
4978368 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
4978369 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
4978370 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
4978371 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore

4978373 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4978374 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4978375 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science

4978378 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4978379 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4978380 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4978381 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help

4978388 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4978389 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4978390 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4978391 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4978392 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4978393 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon

4978399 the chief justice takes precedence over all other judicial officers his appointment and removal is a constitutional matter and can only be done as stipulated by the constititution
4978400 the search for happiness is one of the chief sources of unhappiness
4978401 one cannot divine nor forecast the conditions that will make happiness one only stumbles upon them
4978402 we are never happy we can only remember that we were so once
4978403 ask yourself whether you are happy and you cease to be so
4978404 happiness is a mystery like religion and should never be rationalised
4978405 there are no chains of houses there are no crowds of men the colossal diagram of streets and houses is an illusion the opium dream of a speculative builder each of these men is supremely solitary and supremely important to himself each of these houses stands in the centre of the world there is no single house of all those millions which has not seemed to someone at some time the heart of all things and the end of travel
4978406 there is no duty we so much underrate as the duty of being happy
4978407 martha martha thou art careful and troubled about many things but one thing is needful and mary hath chosen that good part which shall not be taken away from her

4978409 what a wonderful life ive had i only wish id realized it sooner
4978410 it is easy to be heavy hard to be light
4978411 a mans first care should be to avoid the reproaches of his own heart
4978412 for the love of god and my sisters so charitable toward me i take care to appear happy and especially to be so
4978413 all severity that does not tend to increase good or prevent evil is idle
4978414 i must do the work that i am best suited for
4978415 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4978416 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4978417 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4978418 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4978419 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4978420 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4978421 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4978422 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4978423 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4978424 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker

4978434 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4978435 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4978436 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
4978437 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4978438 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4978439 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4978440 were just a local family trying to make the future better
4978441 we have to push forward for protection for our community
4978442 background noise levels at your residence represent the expected measured noise level when all of the transient intruding noises produced by vehicle traffic helicopters airplanes snowmobiles dogs barking and so forth are not present
4978443 north country background noise levels are extremely low especially at night typical levels are near 25 decibels
4978444 they need to get realistic and unbiased background noise levels measured
4978445 excess low frequency noise can affect both mental and physical functioning of our bodies
4978446 but we have to look at how that infrastructure can impact adjoining property owners
4978447 there are certainly better economics when you build a larger turbine but as a school district were not looking to produce more energy then we can consume
4978448 whatever one we ultimately settle on it would likely fall into that intermediate range
4978449 in creating a competitive electric market the commission has viewed divestiture as a key means of achieving an environment where the incentives to abuse market power are minimized
4978450 the market rules work iberdrola should be required to adhere to the rules
4978451 we certainly hope they the psc commissioners have the conviction to hold to his recommendation
4978452 they cant have it both ways the psc policy is pretty clear
4978453 if the commission determines that the presumption has been overcome in this case it would be my hope that it would include measures to mitigate any vertical market power created as well as restate the commissions commitment to maintaining competitive divested wholesale markets in new york

4978491 een prepaid kredietkaart is een eenvoudig effici nt en veilig betaalmiddel
4978492 men laadt de kaart op met een betaalwaarde en gebruikt ze daarna voor de aankoop van goederen in het geruststellende besef dat men zijn limiet nooit kan overschrijden en dus nooit in schulden kan raken prepaid kredietkaarten werden vroeger altijd in verband gebracht met mensen die een beladen kredietverleden hebben en moeilijk aan een normaal krediet konden komen maar steeds meer consumenten kiezen bewust voor de flexibiliteit en de gebruiksvriendelijkheid van dit soort betaalmiddel
4978493 het eniger risico dat men loopt is het bedrag dat op de kaart staat
4978494 mensen raken immers steeds meer bevreesd dat hun bankgegevens in de verkeerde handen zouden kunnen vallen wanneer ze online betalingen verrichten met een prepaid kredietkaart hoeft men zich weinig zorgen te maken over fraudeurs bovendien zijn prepaid betaalkaarten ook een uitstekend budgetinstrument aangezien de gebruiker zelf zijn limiet kan bepalen
4978495 i want to spell it out for you the whole state policy revolves around people and their well being the most important objective therefore is to secure a rapid growth of the real earnings of the population wages and salaries first and foremost
4978496 it is the penultimate year of the current five year plan so all the developed plans should be implemented this is the perspective from which the documents presented today should be analyzed
4978497 it is worrisome that the government makes a focus on the quantitative indicators of the economic development which are generally fulfilled as for the quality of the development which is a number one task it cannot but worry me that in q2 2008 the growth of the major branches of the economy was slower than that of q1
4978498 unfortunately the results do not respond to the modern challenges yet neither do they justify the financial resources spent on theses programmes
4978499 revealed the necessity to work out measures to raise the investment efficiency of all the branches of the domestic economy
4978500 does the government see these problems and what is it going to do to solve them in the future
4978501 we are also appealing to the heads of international parliamentary organizations to give a proper assessment of the policy pursued by georgia leadership
4978502 in recent times the actions of the georgian leadership contradicted the opinion and position of the majority of the cis member states the military operation in south ossetia was undertaken without notifying the cis where georgia is also a member
4978503 the belarusian side has repeatedly voiced its position on the issue including at the highest level we believe there is no objective necessity to deploy air defence installations in eastern europe
4978504 the cargo will be delivered to south ossetia within 2 3 days it will be handed over to the administration of south ossetia the belarusian and russian emergencies ministries are in close cooperation the russian emergencies ministry will help us to protect and transport the cargo via the territory of the russian federation
4978505 in view of the illegal detention of underage belarusian citizen tatiana kozyro who stayed in the city of petaluma california for recreation in order to rule out such situations in the future belarus suggests signing an intergovernmental agreement on conditions of recreation of underage belarusian citizens in the united states of america the draft agreement will be forwarded to the us side soon
4978506 now we show to investors that the country is ready to sell its assets we also made it clear that we are ready to sell shares of our companies the information is available to investors now and will allow holding tenders for those willing to acquire property in belarus in a fair and open manner
4978507 we create favourable conditions for investors and also offer interesting objects one can put money into
4978508 it is what we have tried feverishly to avoid by taking necessary steps to facilitate tanyas safe and expeditious return to her grandma in belarus
4978509 when an agreement is concluded the trips may be recommended again
4978510 its very unfortunate that this petaluma family has decided to keep this girl and for tanya not to return home
4978511 certainly it will have an impact on all the other belarusian children who have enjoyed health respites they may no longer get to do that
4978512 i would just say the family believes its a shame if the belarusian government takes any actions against existing or future programs for young children based on the decision of one girl
4978513 its a shame and a tragedy and theres no reason for it
4978514 if she returns she will not be subject to any persecution and she can return to the u s after she has her documents processed and receives a proper visa
4978515 a person cannot solve his or her immigration aspirations by coming to the u s in this type of group
4978516 the situation with belarus and the u s is so tenuous right now that this in fact may be the end
4978517 they may have found the opportunity to say no more
4978518 was an important step in improving the human rights situation in belarus
4978519 one or two countries can be mistaken in their policy regarding a certain state but since the entire european community sees that there is something wrong with belarus attitude to our common values i think that all these countries cannot be mistaken
4978520 for example there exists a list of 41 belarusian officials who are banned from entering the eu
4978521 the european union considers these people involved in some events in belarus that are not only unwelcome but also intolerable in europe at present in particular these are disappearances of people and violence against opposition politicians
4978522 the eu member countries may not have contacts with belarus at the level of ministers but we are ready for contacts at the level of deputy ministers or state secretaries in order to develop relations
4978523 as soon as the belarusian side has a real intention to cooperate and establish contacts and makes the necessary steps for this we are ready to begin a dialogue
4978524 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4978525 they can use their overwhelming regional military power to beat up on a small neighbor
4978526 i dont think thats actually a very good place from which to proceed on an argument that russia ought to be considered a responsible member of the international system
4978527 so from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4978528 allows ukraine to establish active co operation with european countries
4978529 foreign countries interested in getting information about the situation in space
4978530 the fact that ukraine is no longer a party to the 1992 agreement allows it to launch active co operation with european countries to integrate its stations with governments with an interest in receiving data of the situation in space
4978531 they were looking for that long three each time down the court
4978532 but it wasnt their night tonight its lucky for us because those shots are hard to defend
4978533 they are taller than us and their offense in the paint zone is good
4978534 also our stamina cannot match up with theirs it was already late when the game started and this affected us as well

4978544 the place that has suffered most is south ossetia which is home to both ethnic ossetians and georgians the latter accounting for about a third of the population
4978545 ossetians fleeing the conflict zone talk of georgian atrocities and the indiscriminate killing of civilians
4978546 on august 7 after days of shooting incidents in the south ossetian conflict zone georgian president mikheil saakashvili made a speech in which he said that he had given the georgian villagers orders not to fire that he wanted to offer south ossetia unlimited autonomy within the georgian state with russia to be a guarantor of the arrangement
4978547 both sides said they were discussing a meeting the next day to discuss how to defuse the clashes
4978548 that evening however saakashvili went for the military option the georgian military launched a massive artillery attack on tskhinvali followed the next day by a ground assault involving tanks
4978549 this was a city with no pure military targets full of civilians who had been given no warning and were expecting peace talks at any moment
4978550 the attack looked designed to take everybody by surprise perhaps because much of the russian leadership was in beijing for the opening of the olympic games it also unilaterally destroyed the negotiating and peacekeeping arrangements under the aegis of the organization for security and cooperation in europe that have been in place for 16 years russian peacekeeping troops based in south ossetia were among those killed in the georgian assault
4978551 many had traveled in their nightclothes on rocky roads through the mountains and gave bloodcurdling accounts of georgian atrocities i came in the boot of a car georgian snipers were firing at us from the forest my brother stayed to fight our grandparents home was reduced to rubble we dont know where they are nothing is left of their village it was totally destroyed by rockets and tank fire alisa mamiyeva 26 a teacher in tskhinvali said from the safety of vladikavkaz in north ossetia
4978552 russia failed to back up its claims of georgian atrocities
4978553 coverage in the u s and europe is leaning heavily toward reports on the georgian casualties of russian bombing over the weekend few details are being given about the thousands said to have been killed when georgia attacked tskhinvali the capital of south ossetia on thursday and friday
4978554 the figure of 2 000 people killed is very doubtful our findings so far do not in any way confirm the russian statistics on the contrary they suggest the numbers are exaggerated
4978555 one woman told how a family of four including two children tried to flee from a georgian tank but it fired on their car and they were all burned to death said angela who like all the refugees only gave her first name
4978556 she saw the georgian tanks roll into tskhinvali the soldiers shouting hail saakashvili who is the president of georgia they destroyed the city added inna 33 who said she could not understand how the georgian troops could do that to civilians
4978557 you see your friends home burning and theres nothing you can do you just watch and cry its a genocide inna said an old woman among the refugees said all she had left was the dress she was wearing my house is destroyed she said

4978603 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4978604 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4978605 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4978606 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4978607 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4978608 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

4978615 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4978616 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

4978618 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4978619 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4978620 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4978621 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4978622 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4978623 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4978624 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4978625 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4978626 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4978627 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4978628 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4978629 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4978630 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4978631 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4978632 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4978633 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4978634 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4978635 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4978636 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4978637 it got on its knees and smiled like a donut
4978638 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4978639 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4978640 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4978641 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4978642 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4978643 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4978644 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4978645 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4978646 who are open to doing something on the production side
4978647 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4978648 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4978649 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4978650 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4978651 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

4978656 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects

4978658 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4978659 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4978660 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

4978693 el gobierno tiene la obligaci n de que se vote en urna y si no quiere hacerlo va a generar muchas dudas a mucha gente

4978708 stay to the right of the yellow line the left of the white line
4978709 i hate the old you so much but id give up everything i have right now to get back what the old you had you are a great disappointment not only to yourself but to everyone who matters to you
4978710 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4978711 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4978712 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4978713 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4978714 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4978715 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4978716 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4978717 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4978718 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4978719 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4978720 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4978721 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4978722 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4978723 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4978724 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4978725 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4978726 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4978727 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4978728 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4978729 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4978730 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4978731 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4978732 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4978733 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4978734 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4978735 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4978736 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4978737 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4978738 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4978739 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4978740 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4978741 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4978742 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4978743 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4978744 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country

4978795 das war ein guter start in eine schwierige saison die mannschaft hat nach den r ckst nden tolle moral bewiesen
4978796 es w re sch n wenn die saison jetzt zu ende w re
4978797 im ernst nach einem spiel ber die meisterschaft zu reden macht keinen sinn es ist ein langer weg aber es war ein sehr wichtiger sieg
4978798 viele sind gerade zu beginn der saison sehr motiviert da kommt so was vor aber das bein von lala war schon sehr hoch
4978799 wir haben gute schiedsrichter die so etwas entsprechend ahnden werden
4978800 wir haben einen gro en kader jetzt m ssen andere einspringen

4978830 it seems we dont find out until they walk in the hospital door
4978831 if i as the mayor cross the border it takes me a lot longer than its taking some of these wounded folks clearly some deals have been made at a higher level of government and we didnt know about them
4978832 if i got shot down there do you think id get this kind of an escort id be lucky to come back in a garbage truck
4978833 we dont know whether some of the people being brought here are bad guys or good guys but the history south of the border is that these people hit men will go to the hospital to finish the job if they need to were not equipped to deal with threats like that
4978834 ice agents and officers routinely share intelligence and resources with other law enforcement agencies as needed we will continue working with our partners to ensure public safety in and around el paso
4978835 thats why i left juarez to get away from things like that
4978836 it looked like colombia during the reign of pablo escobar
4978837 bordering on juarez the most violent city in mexico and one of the most violent cities anywhere besides iraq youre always vigilant
4978838 but those people hit men down there know who theyre after and they know how to get them
4978839 there is no doubt that in at least some of these cases folks were fleeing mexico to be under the safe umbrella of the united states and i cant blame them for that but that poses problems we never had to deal with before
4978840 we may be on the front end of a trend here
4978841 jayasuriya in form is always a great thing because he can contribute with both bat and ball
4978842 the start he gives makes a huge difference if he stays for 10 or 15 overs you are guaranteed a good start he is a bit like sehwag for india that gives a different dimension to our set up
4978843 whenever he sehwag gives us a good start we have a fair chance of winning the match
4978844 a good start is very important in any form of cricket but it does not mean the entire pressure is on the openers sehwag is a sort of player who takes a fair amount of risk he is a stroke player
4978845 he is in a very good nick and so is gautam gambhir they did well in the tests also and will have added responsibility but no pressure
4978846 jayasuriya can be compared with sehwag or retired australian adam gilchrist it is important not to let them have a good start
4978847 they are the batsmen who take chances they can commit mistakes if you try to restrict them all these players are very different but for someone like jayasuriya its important to get him out early
4978848 bij momenten was het superdruk maar er gebeurden geen incidenten dat zo veel mensen voor het openbaar vervoer kiezen in plaats van de auto heeft uiteraard een effect op het milieu de co2 uitstoot werd met 88 538 804 gram verminderd
4978849 twintig knopen wind en bijna geen zichtbaarheid ik ging bij de boot van start en klapte gelijk naar rechts het kwam echter slechter dan slecht uit halverwege het eerste kruisrak moest ik vijftien boten voor mij laten van links de motor ging erop ik hing de longen uit mijn lijf en maakte een grote comeback om als 5e de bovenboei te ronden voor de wind was het zoeken naar de boei
4978850 in het tweede kruisrak ging ik links maar nu bleek rechts beter te zijn ik verloor twee plekjes en kwam als 7e rond de bovenboei in het laatste voor de windse rak sloeg de canadese om en daardoor won ik nog een plekje 6e het regende flink en de zichtbaarheid was niet opperbest maar er stond wind en ik keek uit naar de volgende race er kwamen opklaringen de mist trok op en we werden naar binnen gestuurd uitstel op de kant onvoorstelbaar
4978851 de star de tornado de yngling finn en zelfs de 49er waren wedstrijden aan het zeilen na een half uurtje op de kant werden onze races afgelast iedereen stond perplex waarom lassen ze de wedstrijden in godsnaam af voor eens dat er wind staat

4978860 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4978861 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4978862 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4978863 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4978864 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4978865 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4978866 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4978867 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4978868 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4978869 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4978870 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4978871 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4978872 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4978873 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4978874 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4978875 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4978876 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4978877 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4978878 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4978879 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4978880 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4978881 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4978882 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4978883 if we dont lose 3 0 it will be a bonus
4978884 all my best times winning every race to be able to accomplish really everything youve dreamed of its fun
4978885 it really shows no matter what you set your imagination to it can happen

4978900 its not just fitting into clothes its just being healthy for the next 20 or 30 years
4978901 tuned in we think we are to eating behaviors and choices we are a nation of mindless eaters
4978902 we still see politicians playing race and religious issues and this is not good for the country
4978903 such ways cannot be accepted by members of gerakan which practises a non racial and non religious approach
4978904 as this is the first state to hold its conference we will have to find out the mood among delegates of other states
4978905 this is not healthy for the country it has created dissatisfaction among the grassroots and we are considering how such matters could affect us in gerakan
4978906 no this is a perak matter and we have to wait for perak to put in its resolution formally for discussion at the central level
4978907 that is healthy positive competition the window of opportunity should not be a window of opportunism for both sides
4978908 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4978909 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4978910 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4978911 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

4978914 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4978915 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4978916 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4978917 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4978918 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4978919 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4978920 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4978921 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4978922 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4978923 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4978924 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4978925 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4978926 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4978927 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4978928 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4978929 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4978930 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4978931 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4978932 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items

4978934 this issue should be viewed objectively after the federal government opened the mara junior science colleges mrsm to non bumiputeras in 2000 we got very good feedback
4978935 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4978936 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4978937 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4978938 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4978939 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas

4978944 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4978945 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4978946 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4978947 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4978948 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4978949 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4978950 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4978951 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4978952 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4978953 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4978954 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4978955 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4978956 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4978957 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4978958 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4978959 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4978960 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4978961 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4978962 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4978963 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4978964 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4978965 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4978966 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4978967 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4978968 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4978969 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4978970 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4978971 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4978972 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4978973 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4978974 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4978975 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4978976 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4978977 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4978978 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4978979 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4978980 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4978981 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4978982 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4978983 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4978984 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4978985 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4978986 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4978987 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4978988 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4978989 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4978990 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4978991 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4978992 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4978993 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4978994 the ioc does disapprove of any attempts to hinder a journalist who is going about doing his job seemingly within the rules and regulations
4978995 this we hope has been addressed we dont want to see this happening again
4978996 i think ill wear the blue socks today and i might just have some toast with jam for breakfast

4979147 the dangerous dimensions taken by the agitations in the jammu region and the valley plainly indicate the jammuites want secession from the valley and the valley wants secession from the rest of the country
4979148 mirwaiz umer farooq and syed ali geelani two iconic leaders of the separatist movement in kashmir were taken out by crowds to lead the funeral procession of the slain hurriyat leader sheikh abdul aziz
4979149 the huge crowds defied both the restrictions imposed by the authorities and also the appeals by the separatist leaders to remain peaceful
4979150 they continued curfew in jammu for days and only four people died there in firing by the security forces in just two days more than 17 people have been killed here by the security forces and dozens injured with bullets who are now admitted in various hospitals do you call this even handed treatment
4979151 there is a bandh called by the vhp vishwa hindu parishad in force outside the valley today what does this mean i dont think it would be easy for anybody to reinstill the previous confidence between the two regions of the state
4979152 let us not indulge in self deceit jammu wants to break from the valley and the people here want to break from the rest of the country if journalists do not give the real picture they would only be cheating themselves and those who read them
4979153 azad is speaking as if he never ruled the state to have been able to think and implement such a solution if he had one in mind

4979167 in any form of cricket whether in test cricket or one dayer the start is very important
4979168 sehwag is sort of a player who takes a bit of risk he is a stroke player and there is a fair amount of risk involved
4979169 india had a morale boost when they crushed a sri lankan board xi team by 92 runs in the only warmup game for the one day series dhoni said indias morale was strong despite the test series defeat and the warmup match was encouraging
4979170 you can say we have got used to the conditions a bit to the wickets in sri lanka overall the warmup was good but an international game is completely different from any side game
4979171 i am a great believer in hard work doing little things right
4979172 in odi cricket in general putting runs on the board is crucial but having a bowling attack that picks up wickets you can fall back on that but not everyday we need to be very consistent
4979173 now in the middle they have two bowlers previously it was muttiah muralitharan and we look to score from the other side but now they have two specialist bowlers who dont really give loose balls to cash on

4979181 i would like the immediate opening of humanitarian corridors between south ossetia and the rest of georgia so that the dead can receive a dignified burial the wounded can get access to care and those who want to rejoin their dear ones can do so

4979216 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honouring their word
4979217 russias elite value their ties to europe their shopping and their luxury weekends we should look at the visa regime for russian citizens

4979226 following on from the precedents of the past two years of the translation prize competition this years submissions were overwhelmingly in fictional form and specifically novels
4979227 mahmoud darwish is needless to say in no need of introduction as an author in that he has long been acknowledged as one of the two or three most prominent poets in todays arab world and internationally and has been for over half a century the predominant poetic voice of the palestinian people
4979228 the runner up is ghassan nasrs translation of the late jabra ibrahim jabras last novel the journals of sarab affan published by syracuse university press
4979229 a third submission wins commendation the translation by nancy roberts of salwa bakrs the man from bashmour published by the american university in cairo press the jury was deeply impressed by bakrs courageous novelistic exploration of egypts complex relationship with its christian coptic community during the 9th century ad the man from bashmour is a historical novel that clearly involved its author in a large amount of research into the life of the community the language of its liturgies and the history of its status within the muslim communities of egypt the text uses highly complex levels of discourse and the translation project has therefore been a significant challenge one that has been met with great success by the translator this novel is an important contribution to the continuing tradition of historical fiction writing in arabic especially within the egyptian context and its translation into english in such an accomplished fashion is to be welcomed
4979230 joudahs brilliant translation and presentation of recent works by the renowned poet mahmoud darwish she added
4979231 captures beautifully the intense delicacy of human intimacy that this leading writers fiction traces
4979232 itself a tour de force in its imaginative retracing of a turning point in egypts history and one that carries great political sensitivity in contemporary circumstances is a translation that conveys the double language of a historical moment and a contemporary resonance with its careful use of archaisms and its respect for bakrs intensely historical archival language
4979233 the quality of the majority of submissions to this years competition was extremely high an indication of the ever increasing skills exhibited by the still relatively small number of translators who are devoting themselves to the transfer of the treasures of the modern arabic literary tradition to an english readership
4979234 i am stunned with joy i had no idea that i was up for the translation prize translating darwishs poetry was a dream of beauty of art with the glimmer that art will lead to cultural and mutual respect among peoples and in making the translations i focused as much on the strange in the poems as on the familiar and the universal
4979235 four key deficits budget savings balance of payments and leadership
4979236 our nation suffers from a fiscal cancer that threatens the future economic well being of our country children and grandchildren
4979237 this isnt just a financial issue its a moral issue its immoral to keep kicking the can down the road for younger generations to grapple
4979238 did you know richard nixon is the only president whose formal portrait was painted by a police sketch artist
4979239 not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
4979240 people werent creating and posting videos online there was jibjab a website but that was done by a production crew what youre seeing now are individuals participating in the process and thats really exciting
4979241 so often with these its not the huge production values that make them work
4979242 in a couple of hours we can turn something around its the ideas behind them not the money
4979243 what makes this such a fun election is that there is so much awareness its like when youre at the water cooler and everybody watched the same television show the night before people are just really ready to be engaged
4979244 then of course theres just so much to rip on
4979245 the guy who sits on the sidelines teaching the white guy valuable lessons like bagger vance the big magical brother from the green mile or when shaq played kazaam
4979246 i want to bomb iran using solar powered nuclear weapons
4979247 apple butter will no longer be a second class condiment dinner shouldnt be so spicy sen mccain promises never to negotiate with prussia and yes if elected sen mccain will vote yes on cats being soft
4979248 whenever i get on a plane i know who the air marshal is its always the guy holding the people magazine upside down looking right at me
4979249 looks like the guy at the hardware store who makes the keys
4979250 i have the oldness it takes to protect america honor her love her and tell her what cute things the cat did
4979251 act now and dont delay we know he doesnt have much experience and isnt ready to lead but that doesnt mean he isnt dreamy
4979252 we can start up that rumor about you having a black baby with a prostitute
4979253 but sir it would be healthier for the two if they were separated
4979254 mccain supports universal health care for all current and former pows
4979255 john edwards presidential aspirant and author of the famed claim that there are two americas was apparently only faithful to his wife in one of them apparently he didnt realize that the national enquirer had reporters stationed in the other america where he was in fact having an affair with his videographer
4979256 obamas camp initially agreed that the cartoon was quote tasteless and offensive really you know what your response should have been its very easy here let me put the statement out for you barack obama is in no way upset about the cartoon that depicts him as a muslim extremist because you know who gets upset about cartoons muslim extremists
4979257 barack obama heading to hawaii for a vacation with his family
4979258 republicans say that john mccain will be good for business they didnt say what business but im guessing probably the scooter store doans pills craftmatic adjustable bed and the miracle ear
4979259 people are now talking about the ticket barack obama and hillary clinton would that be a good ticket and i think this would be the first if you think about it first combination of an african american man and a white woman since well michael jackson
4979260 barack obama gave a speech in germany and 200 000 people showed up there were so many germans shouting and screaming that france surrendered just in case
4979261 barack obama said today that he is going to fight for votes in all 50 states yeah thats what he said meanwhile john mccain said hes going to fight for votes in all 13 colonies
4979262 ralph nader in the news this week ralph nader announced that he is certified to be on the presidential ballot in 12 states however doctors say that nader is certifiable in all 50 states
4979263 barack obama still continuing to dominate media coverage the new york times just did a big piece they say that barack obama has been successful in politics because hes a black man who doesnt make white people feel threatened yeah yeah which explains obamas secret service code name al roker
4979264 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4979265 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4979266 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4979267 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4979268 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4979269 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4979270 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4979271 un choc entre le moyen ge et le 21e si cle
4979272 vous les juifs devez tre au courant vous naurez jamais mais jamais la paix avec le hamas cest lislam comme id ologie qui les guide et qui ne leur permettra pas de parvenir un accord de paix avec les juifs
4979273 ils estiment que la tradition dit que le proph te mahomet sest battu contre les juifs et que par cons quent ils doivent continuer les combattre jusqu la mort
4979274 we really wish theyd recognize whats happened in other states
4979275 is really not going to cut into the lcbs profitability or revenue
4979276 the question you as legislators must ask yourself is whether it is a wise policy to create or perpetuate an unregulated unaccountable non face to face channel of access for our kids
4979277 we do not believe the direct ship program has had a negative impact on revenues
4979278 both a regulatory challenge and concern however we have not found these two issues to be of significant negative consequence
4979279 not done the research on what other states are doing
4979280 it is a state we will be looking at but it is only about the size of allegheny county so theyre operating on a much smaller scale
4979281 it goes completely counter to what you read that everybody is selling everybody is bearish everybody is shorting financial stocks
4979282 when people say its the worst its ever been its usually the bottom and the time to start to buy
4979283 the average investor is buying into etfs and financial sector funds
4979284 normally investors shy away from groups that are getting clobbered
4979285 korean war lasted over 3 years ending on july 27 1953 without any winners and losers however the war ended with the cease fire agreement and the resulting of dmz which separated the country left korean people the pain of division until today
4979286 he dugger came up to me and was like what do you feel about missing a start
4979287 he had to convince me a little bit but in the long run i knew that if id kept going out there something worse could happen
4979288 theres a lot of stuff i think could be part of it
4979289 definitely the all star game could be a little bit why it happened
4979290 theres a lot of stuff that can contribute but the fact is ive thrown a lot of innings and this is the first wall ive hit
4979291 i clenched my teeth the entire time through the outing
4979292 as the manager of the team youve got two fold responsibility
4979293 one of them is to win the game with the value thats put on it the attention the home field advantage and the second that i felt was just as important was to get everybody home safe
4979294 knock on wood i havent had any arm issues since ive been playing baseball
4979295 its always been oblique or blood clots or something weird
4979296 the fact that 2008s extent isnt significantly below the 2007 number because of the aforementioned claimed problem of lacking multi year ice is simply remarkable so much for the predictions of a worse year
4979297 the agw alarmists 2008 predictions werent merely just wrong they were in a class of abysmal prognostication skill that ranks up there with psychics
4979298 witch doctors with chicken guts or orangutans with darts could have fared better
4979299 oh and it wasnt the skeptics claiming things about wind and current they got that from this outfit called nasa you may have heard of them
4979300 esta oligarqu a enferma de aqu todav a me est atacando porque aprobamos unas leyes para qu son las leyes para igualarnos y vuelvo a tomar a bol var bol var dec a nosotros nacemos desiguales y luego vienen las leyes la educaci n la cultura la industria y nos coloca en condiciones de igualdad la igualdad la igualdad la igualdad para eso es el gobierno
4979301 no hay ning n indicio de que estas leyes cambien la estructura distributiva del pa s
4979302 la igualdad hace a los desiguales menos desiguales a trav s de las distintas pol ticas p blicas del gobierno el igualitarismo coloca a todo el mundo en un mismo rasero decidido arbitrariamente por un poder en este caso el gobierno
4979303 ch vez quiere castrar las posibilidades de aspirar del colectivo porque cualquier cosa que genere diferencia pluralidad lo considera subversivo pretende que todos nos conformemos con un m nimo de cosas que da el estado mercal barrio adentro alguna misi n educativa un carrito iran un cupo en d lares
4979304 socialismo significa justicia social e igualdad pero igualdad de derechos de oportunidades no de ingresos igualdad no es igualitarismo este en ltima instancia es tambi n una forma de explotaci n la del buen trabajador por el que no lo es o peor a n por el vago
4979305 a lo mejor el vecino es m s talentoso que yo y aprovecha la educaci n y genera una diferencia entre nosotros eso es inaceptable para el gobierno
4979306 todos tenemos un rasero independientemente del talento bolsitas de mercal un viaje social 400 d lares para compras por internet
4979307 defendamos no la igualdad de oportunidades defendamos la igualdad de condiciones
4979308 muchas de estas leyes sencillamente no se pueden aplicar solamente sirven para tener retaliaciones contra personas o empresas o en particular esa inaplicabilidad conlleva a que la defensa o ataque de las normas se haga sobre la base de categor as abstractas cuando el presidente habla de igualarnos a trav s de las leyes es porque la igualdad es un valor socialista y el gobierno se maneja con categor as que si bien satisfacen su est tica socialista tienen dificultades para aplicarlas
4979309 mucho menos va a funcionar en venezela donde hay ciertos valores como el progreso que forman parte de la conciencia colectiva
4979310 en abstracto los venezolanos quieren la igualdad piensan que los bienes deben estar mejor repartidos pero de all a decir que la idiosincrasia del venezolano es socialista hay un trecho muy grande cuando se les plantea que la forma de alcanzar la igualdad es siendo todos modestos casi muy pobres y que los m s adinerados deben repartir sus bienes entre quienes menos tienen empiezan los conflictos y el colectivo acciona en contra
4979311 el gobierno considera que est lanzando las bases para construir el modelo socialista y las va a ir desarrollando en la medida en que tenga fuerza si sale bien en noviembre con las elecciones de gobernadores y alcaldes avanzar m s en su aplicaci n ahorita seguir con su estrategia de trivializarlas para que pasen por debajo de la mesa pero si salen victoriosos en noviembre avanzar n en ese modelo de igualaci n en un solo rasero
4979312 hacer much simas leyes y cambiarlas en reiteradas oportunidades con el nico fin de ser discrecionales bajo un barniz de legalidad
4979313 el leguleyismo gubernamental es una forma de ocultar cierta dsicrecionalidad
4979314 el tema del hombre nuevo la nueva conciencia socialista la inversi n de los valores es uno de los trasnochos m s grandes que tiene el gobierno
4979315 dinner pail was a communication of the time meaning lunch box when dinner was lunch time supper was the evening meal

4979317 we simply must do everything we can in our power to slow down global warming before it is too late the science is clear the global warming debate is over
4979318 americans are coming to understand that global temperatures have actually cooled over the last 10 years and are predicted to continue cooling over the next 10
4979319 if you look from 1995 you dont see any change that could be regarded as statistically significant for the last 13 or 14 years nothing has been happening
4979320 if you take the last 30 years its completely evident that its going up
4979321 if this helps anyone out there who is in their middle aged years and has put off what they wanted to do because they thought they were too old or because they have a child and that they cant balance what they want to do with being a parent then thats great what ive done is show them that they can do it
4979322 it was thought that if youre getting to 16 17 or 18 youre getting to the end of your career dara has done a fantastic job in proving that you can continue to improve and that women can have children and get back into the sport she has gotten rid of a mythology in swimming that has been there for so long

4979326 concept behind the creation of jpmorgan chase has broken down
4979327 theres a lot of stuff that can be part of the soreness the all star game is a bit of why it happened and i also pitched out of the break on three days rest
4979328 this is the first wall i have hit and if didnt come until 172 innings then i think i have done something right
4979329 i am not so sure theres not residual effect from that there are a number of guys who havent pitched well after the break who threw more than one inning
4979330 if theres a good movie we have to see it together
4979331 usually we welcome prince charless contributions to various debates but on this issue he seems to have overstepped the mark
4979332 government ministers have a responsibility to base policy on science and i do strongly believe that we have a moral responsibility to the developing world to ask the question can gm crops help
4979333 its easy for those of us with plentiful food supplies to ignore the issue but we have a responsibility to use science to help the less well off where we can im asking to see the evidence if it has been a disaster then please provide the evidence

4979356 respetando siempre nuestra lengua propia el valenciano tenemos que trabajar para mantener un alto est ndar de castellano y un est ndar aceptablemente alto en ingles porque eso es estar en el presente y el en futuro sin olvidar nuestra ra ces

4979368 it is apparent that the old mosques need a new lease of life this can be done by upgrading and adding new facilities to our old mosques for example we can provide activity rooms for youths and lifts and ramps for the elderly the community can then enjoy mosques which are up to date and meet the needs of the modern muslim community

4979418 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
4979419 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
4979420 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
4979421 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
4979422 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
4979423 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
4979424 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
4979425 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
4979426 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
4979427 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
4979428 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
4979429 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
4979430 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
4979431 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit

4979433 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
4979434 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
4979435 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
4979436 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida

4979453 emissions of smog producing pollutants decreased both nationally and regionally between 1990 and 2000
4979454 both decreased substantially nationally and regionally with statistically significant downward trends nationally no levels in 2005 were about 50 lower than in 1991 and no2 about 30 lower

4979462 on august 21 there will be a national premier of the film in 400 theaters across the nation the film purports to be an entertaining analysis of the serious financial situation facing america regarding its national debt and fiscal irresponsibility
4979463 from its trailer and description it sounds suspiciously like a hokey concoction ala al gores an inconvenient truth put together by louis xvis financial ministers on the eve of the storming of the bastille blaming all our troubles on sunspots or the humble snail darter
4979464 the premier will also feature a live panel discussion after the film of distinguished experts filling in to the suckers who viewed this fiasco what they just saw they include peterson walker billionaire investor warren buffet and cato institute chairman william me too niskanen

4979476 everyone thinks samantha is lindsays first lesbian love but we were very passionate until her fear of being found out drove us apart
4979477 at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies
4979478 but then samantha came on to the scene and i was dropped
4979479 she met lindsay in the summer of 2006 at a party in malibu
4979480 from the start lindsay was very confused about her feelings for courtenay so did more and more drugs to stifle the sexual attraction she was experiencing
4979481 but eventually she just gave in and at every party theyd kiss and touch each other in the corner its a miracle nobody found out
4979482 both of them would do lines of cocaine in the toilets then head home and fall into bed together
4979483 back then samantha and lindsay didnt have a physical relationship
4979484 apparently samantha acted in a paternal way towards her giving her advice and cuddles
4979485 by now lindsay was sending i love you notes to samantha and signing them lindsay ronson but telling courtenay she loved her too
4979486 courtenay would throw fits of rage writing her hundreds of angry e mails from another room in the house
4979487 the sexual attraction between them was electric though and theyd still kiss and make up
4979488 courtenay still cant understand how lindsay is now so open with samantha
4979489 do come in its ever so cold outside have a cup of tea im glad you came im ever so hungry

4979506 ive been awfully lucky to get the armband in the past and thats something that will never leave me im sure whoever mr capello announces as the captain will have the best day of his life next week whether it be myself rio stevie g or lamps the main thing is that england as a team move forward and the captain helps drag them together to have the captaincy for a short period of time meant an awful lot i want those memories back and want to lead the team out of course i want the england captaincy maybe i do deserve another chance
4979507 id love to have the job on a permanent basis definitely its a fantastic honour to be named the captain of your country if theres a god up there i hope he can make me last another two world cups if not three but maybe thats being greedy

4979543 for me it is not a problem and im not going to worry about it because he is going to be our player it is not a concern

4979566 keeping him on an even keel at all times and not letting the situation rattle him in any way
4979567 he very seldom lets his emotions get the better of him which i think is very helpful

4979578 my hunch is that if there is a democratic wave nationally reichert will be one of the incumbents who is swept away by it
4979579 but the race is a toss up if the national pattern is more competitive
4979580 my sense is that 2006 might have been a peak for democrats in washington
4979581 at least our polls showed the war was a bigger issue then versus now and that had to help burner in 2006
4979582 if theres an obama mobilization effect this year or an anti incumbent vote due to the economy there might be a trend toward democrats in the 8th the big question is will that trend be as large as the anti war spike in 2006
4979583 while the district has a republican partisan leaning it has been a swing district for some time
4979584 the split ticket voting indicates that party preferences are soft at the margins and the district could go either way
4979585 long before the democratic party was returning my phone calls
4979586 we didnt want to change what was working what was working was our message and what was working was the grassroots approach
4979587 kirks been more active in the district emphasizing case work a bit more and raising money more than he did in 2006 when seals seemed to have surprised him
4979588 kirk is taking nothing for granted so this is going to be a tough close race
4979589 the interest in change is bigger than it was in 2006
4979590 what we are seeing is record turnout at our events and if you look at the election turnout for the primary
4979591 its so easy to get overwhelmed by the disaster that overtook india in the test series but the beauty of the sport is things can change overnight
4979592 a few of the advantages i can straightaway see with the indian odi squad is the athleticism and speed which youngsters would bring across
4979593 the daredevilry so shockingly missing from the test squad would hopefully be exhibited by the younger lot also i have always believed that india play better in one dayers when they tend to be more relaxed with the cushion of games in hand as opposed to a triangular with a final that becomes the most important game
4979594 the biggest issue the indians had in the tests was the lack of initiative from the batsmen in taking on mendis and muralitharan openers gambhir and sehwag were the exceptions and the figures tell the tale indeed they were a principal component in india staying alive till the final test or else it could easily have been 3 0
4979595 local government is supposed to be the closet form of government to the community having an active web presence helps bridge the gap between the council and the community
4979596 it is another tool for the community to use in addition to mobile phones and email
4979597 it also enables young people who may be disengaged with the community to have their say in a way they feel comfortable

4979604 i think it makes a big difference to have the controversy settled and the athletes know who the medalists are very quickly

4979688 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4979689 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4979690 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4979691 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4979692 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4979693 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4979694 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4979695 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4979696 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
4979697 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4979698 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4979699 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4979700 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4979701 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4979702 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4979703 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4979704 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4979705 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4979706 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4979707 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4979708 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4979709 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4979710 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4979711 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4979712 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4979713 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4979714 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4979715 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4979716 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4979717 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4979718 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4979719 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4979720 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4979721 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4979722 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4979723 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4979724 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4979725 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4979726 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4979727 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4979728 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4979729 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4979730 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4979731 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4979732 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4979733 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4979734 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4979735 our 14 offices are part of a highly structured volunteer heavy plan to win in new hampshire
4979736 we are creating neighborhood teams with volunteers who are trained equipped and empowered to build a campaign organization in their own neighborhood
4979737 i think weve built on that grass roots effort from 2004
4979738 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4979739 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4979740 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
4979741 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
4979742 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
4979743 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
4979744 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
4979745 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4979746 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4979747 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4979748 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4979749 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4979750 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4979751 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
4979752 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
4979753 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
4979754 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
4979755 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4979756 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
4979757 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4979758 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al

4979774 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4979775 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution

4979782 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves

4979784 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
4979785 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4979786 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4979787 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
4979788 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech

4979801 board amended the law on alcohol content in prepared foods as long as adults consume responsibly government should certainly not over regulate the inclusion of alcohol in food or brew pops for that matter

4979810 but ultimately he really showed that he cared and that meant a lot to me
4979811 we talked about making sure shawn was ok and that he got the help that he needed
4979812 when we felt that he was in a good place we talked about the football part of it

4979816 he used to work in wipro and he along with mufti abu bashir are the masterminds behind the blasts
4979817 simi split into two parts one was moderate the other hardliner and the hardliners started the indian mujahideen
4979818 in ahmedabad mechanical clocks were used and in surat integrated chips were used but the chips did not work due to some technical fault
4979819 i am a mealy mouthed coward who sits in this room and am afraid of my shadow
4979820 i have no courage whatsoever and no spirit of adventure
4979821 while there we met local historian roy turner who introduced us to the fascinating and little known details of presleys early years turner opened up a world that we didnt know existed
4979822 i live so far below my means that it doesnt really register
4979823 in one fell swoop i pay for the roof over my head the food in my stomach and the lights to read by thats a big advantage
4979824 the economy starts to tank people get tired of it
4979825 its people saying lets get together and help one another and it works
4979826 were pretty isolated from the ups and downs of the regular economy
4979827 you dont have to chase as many dollars to have a quality of life
4979828 it isnt just cutting back on things its about people not needing so many things and putting more attention into their personal interests and their family and friends being creative being of service
4979829 for me to be able to walk out my door and have everybody in the hall know me thats a really great experience
4979830 and if anything happens to me i know theres somebody next door wholl take care of me
4979831 you go to your room shut the door and dont come out
4979832 its a wonderful day for jamaica it was a stunning performance and were so proud of you
4979833 the games are not yet over and we expect a lot more from the team in the days ahead but i can assure you that we are planning a massive welcome home party for all of you
4979834 we have chances in the mens 200m womens 200m the womens 100m hurdles the mens 400m hurdles the womens 400m and all four relays
4979835 so we have a lot of expectations that there are more medals to be won
4979836 i knew he had it in him i cant wait for him to break the 200m record and then run 42 seconds in the 400m
4979837 he has taken jamaica on his back and demolished the whole world that is the respect to be given to the greatest sprinter of all time
4979838 it was euphoria it was the greatest feeling ive had in all my life because jamaica has never had the joy and glory of a gold medal in the 100m sprint in my 60 years
4979839 and in addition to getting our first gold he broke the world record it is an experience that is almost unspeakable it brought me out in goose bumps
4979840 that wasnt just my feeling but the whole of jamaica i got reports from the districts and cities back home where people were out on the streets hailing the victory
4979841 it was good old vintage reggae it was tremendous of the organisers they were able to find a piece of music that helped us celebrate
4979842 we are expecting at least another five medals from the track and we feel very confident if we do that then i would not be surprised if we declared a national holiday
4979843 its ridiculous to say he was disrespectful in the way he finished
4979844 hes a young athlete hes having a great time and this sport of all sports needs that hes carefree hes got the talent he did not do it in a disrespectful way he is just excited about his sport
4979845 when bolt broke the world record at the national championships and at all the championships in which he has participated in between he and the other jamaican sprinters have been tested
4979846 una situaci n de normalidad cualquier d a implica siempre demoras suspensi n de consultas y quir fanos adem s de una grave tensi n laboral porque han de hacer m s guardias y aguantar las reclamaciones de los pacientes que sufren las consecuencias
4979847 what this is designed to do is to reduce the anxiety
4979848 theyre going to have a head start on where to find things
4979849 sooner or later our president is going to say or do something that goes too far and then it will start
4979850 what happened here in the last week certainly came as a shock not only to georgia but to a lot of others as well
4979851 a lot of people will as a result of this want to build a closer relationship with their western partners as quickly as possible
4979852 i would like to believe it will be russia because we are fraternal nations and have to support each other
4979853 russia will not disappear tomorrow as well as in a century or two
4979854 we will always wake up and it will be there not canada
4979855 the assumption of the post 1991 settlement has been that the old russia is in the past that it is not a country that invades its neighbors
4979856 basically the entire european security architecture is based on this premise
4979857 smart russians keep silent and they still think about their fate in ukraine
4979858 ukraine is under the same threat the same kind of damocles sword
4979859 may moderate the relationship between e mail volume and feelings of e mail overload
4979860 e mail is used as a self validation tool by people to procrastinate and to re create activity versus productivity
4979861 if its a multiparty case it may generate maybe 20 e mails from other people
4979862 so as youre trying to focus on it youre getting this ping ping ping as people are chattering about the e mail
4979863 we all felt that information overload was something that was such a big problem that some companies were beginning to be aware of it but a lot of people didnt realize the magnitude of the problem
4979864 distracted the erosion of attention and the coming dark age
4979865 yet were connecting in thinner more faceless ways we experience fewer visits fewer telephone calls fewer contacts all around except e mail were subsisting on this diet of snippets and glimpses of each other socially
4979866 if were having feelings with someone else that we need to confront
4979867 many times well resort to an e mail rather than take the risk of picking up the phone and calling its a very egocentric act its dumping and it is really misunderstood
4979868 less than half a day goes by and youll get an e mail saying why havent you responded to my e mail
4979869 the expectation because youve sent it is the other person is looking at his screen all the time and his job is to look at his screen waiting for e mails
4979870 i want it to be worse conditions bad conditions are good for me
4979871 even though noguchi isnt in the race i approach it in the same frame of mind as always
4979872 it was a bit painful and i was somewhat anxious
4979873 i think its good to have a little anxiety and it wont affect my race
4979874 its only her second marathon so theres nothing you can really compare it to
4979875 naturally she will be nervous on this big stage but that can be a good thing
4979876 we dont have anybody else to turn to but god
4979877 we have to turn these problems over to god and not to man
4979878 immediately the owners came out and changed the gas prices they brought it down we had marvellous success down in st louis missouri
4979879 we believe not just in prayer because we believe that faith without works is dead so weve encouraged people to car pool more and organise their days more because its a combination of faith with these other factors

4979889 es ist dringend notwendig dass wir ein einfacheres niedrigeres und gerechteres steuersystem bekommen

4979891 wir werden uns allerdings nicht so fesseln dass anschlie end wenn es f r eine b rgerliche mehrheit nicht reichen w rde die kommunisten mit herrn lafontaine und den sozialisten das sagen h tten in dieser republik
4979892 ich denke dass es viel kl ger w re wenn sich in deutschland die parteien die f r wirtschaftliche vernunft stehen den parolen von linksau en entgegenstellen
4979893 manche meinen die wirtschaftspolitik der fdp sei nicht auch f r die schw cheren gedacht das ist v llig falsch

4979901 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4979902 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4979903 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4979904 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4979905 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4979906 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4979907 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4979908 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4979909 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4979910 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4979911 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4979912 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4979913 must have been created cause nothing so complex can simply start existing and therefore must be created
4979914 there are times when one would like to hang the whole human race and finish the farce
4979915 we like to have the executive order in place before the storm
4979916 whatever happens happens if we get evacuated that will definitely put a damper on our plans but until we have to were not moving

4979922 we have done everything that had to be done and now we expect the nsg exemption without any change to the draft that was circulated to them recently
4979923 we expect the process to move consistent with the july 18 2005 understanding and any change in their nsg position is problematic
4979924 we can not agree to further demands and there is no way we can
4979925 would it excite you if an attractive man spanked you

4979928 we hope our republican colleagues will join in a bipartisan effort not only to increase domestic supply but also to help consumers and to protect the environment
4979929 if speaker pelosi and her democratic colleagues were truly serious about increasing production of american energy and lowering the price of gasoline they would call congress back into session immediately to vote on our all of the above energy plan rather than taking a five week break away from washington
4979930 another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices
4979931 we are going to put them to the test on this issue

4979947 we are going to die and that makes us the lucky ones most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born the potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of sahara certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than keats scientists greater than newton we know this because the set of possible people allowed by our dna so massively outnumbers the set of actual people in the teeth of these stupefying odds it is you and i in our ordinariness that are here
4979948 if it turns out that these carbon sequestration technologies dont advance and the only way to produce these resources would be at a significant penalty to climate change then we dont believe that those resources are going to be part of the long term future

4979965 those on whom he has passed the decree of death he keeps back from returning to life but the rest he sends to their bodies for a term appointed verily in this are signs for those who reflect
4979966 sleep being twin brother to death our souls are for the time being released from the bondage of the flesh allah takes them for the time being if as some do we are to die peacefully in sleep our soul does not come back to the physical body and the later decays and dies if we still have some period of life to fulfill according to allahs decree our soul comes back to the body and we resume our function in this life

4979974 many people are turning to us because theyve worked with agents for six to 12 months and they need to change direction
4979975 hiring an agent is a luxury that many people cannot afford
4979976 the odds have not been worse in my memory for someone to try and do it themselves
4979977 if i were going to list with an agent i would have added another 10 percent to the price
4979978 but i realize by doing that it would put me in a price bracket thats higher and would eliminate some potential buyers who wouldnt qualify for the higher mortgage
4979979 ive done my homework i know what else is out there and i know i have the best value on the market
4979980 if it takes 10 weeks of open houses every sunday then so be it
4979981 the reason we went on our own was to save ourselves the margin the commission

4979995 youve given a financial planner all your financial data and probably invested quite a bit of time and effort
4979996 so be careful make sure youre changing for the right reason
4979997 the correct strategy is not to sell out and go to cash its to say this too shall pass and say what your strategy is for the next time the markets up
