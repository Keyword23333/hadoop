5310002 with the wreck of john kerrys swiftboated 2004 campaign in his rearview mirror barack obama and his surrogates are wasting no time mounting a counterattack against wnd staff writer and columnist jerome corsi the co author of the swift boat veterans for truths unfit for command and the author of current no
5310003 let me say clearly that i am not progressing that recommendation at this stage
5310004 that matter is not a priority for me but it is something that i will speak to my colleagues about
5310005 i think there are two reasons why it would have a big impact
5310006 first there will be stories that wont be able to be told for fear of being sued full stop the second one is the stories the media wont even know about or find out about because media outlets will be more reluctant to pour resources into investigative journalism
5310007 to expose sexual conduct that does not involve any significant breach of the criminal law
5310008 our regulatory bodies receive relatively few complaints of an improper invasion of privacy
5310009 if these proposals are introduced there is no doubt it will limit what the media can publish will limit investigative journalism and will result in the publics right to know being impaired
5310010 i think one of the myths is that this will undermine the right of journalists to access information and allow the rich and powerful to cover up the activities they dont want disclosed
5310011 i think the media can on occasions go over the mark
5310012 knocking on peoples doors at 10 or 11pm particularly those with families can be very very distressing theres got to be some limitation on it
5310013 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
5310014 in any contest between privacy and free speech i think we should err on the side of free speech allowing people to speak their minds has very good consequences
5310015 privacy laws tend to kick in when people have said things that are true its a fairly dangerous thing to prevent people saying things that are true my view is that we live with the law of defamation you say something untrue and you pay the consequences but if its embarrassing so what
5310016 i would copy nothing coming out of canada in relation to free speech
5310017 the americans have a pretty strong emphasis on letting people speak and i dont see too many people opting out of the limelight

5310022 the sport combines beauty and grace with an inordinate amount of athleticism the degree of coordination required by these ladies is difficult enough on land let alone in water akin to similar qualities required in artistic gymnastics another popular sport among women it would seem the significant female fan following for the sport can be attributed to the female ideal of combining strength and beauty
5310023 the quality of the athletes participating at the beijing 2008 olympic games is phenomenal synchronized swimming is a relatively new event as it was introduced to the olympic games in 1984 and this years event is shaping up to be the best that we have ever seen as it makes its debut appearance in the spectacular national aquatic centre also known as the water cube

5310253 i saw a plane travelling east coming down sharply straight towards the woods
5310254 i immediately thought it looked like something was wrong then at the last minute just 50ft up the pilot managed to pull up the nose of the plane it looked like he was trying to save the plane from the trees but then i realised that the plane was going down and it disappeared into the woods
5310255 unfortunately when the emergency services got to the casualties nothing could be done for them
5310256 the team wants to get the ball down and pass it those who werent in the original squad have already hooked on to that message from george burley and that is to play good football
5310257 weve got a young squad of the original 24 18 were 26 or under but when it comes to world cup qualifiers youve got to have the experience to get you through to those major tournaments

5310268 i definitely think that when i first heard the song from the beginning of the record you kind of feel like you know im leaving it up to you
5310269 and by the time it gets to the second verse and makes it to the end of the song it just feels like im saying i dont want to put up with it anymore
5310270 it was a great first single for me because it said something i fell in love with records like beyonc s irreplaceable where you could emotionally attach yourself to the record as soon as you heard it

5310286 at the same time the expansion in stand size shows weve been on the right track it confirms that our exhibitors are also making a bigger commitment than ever to ons while we seem to have reached our optimum size
5310287 since conference registrations normally peak between now and the opening of the show were naturally awaiting the final outcome with some suspense
5310288 but there is no sign that sales will slacken quite the contrary

5310299 i would not have nominated clarence thomas i dont think that he i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation of a lot of the constitution
5310300 thats the first sign that theyre going to have difficulties in the fall he said
5310301 maintaining local offices is really expensive and if you have to close one it can become a huge local news story
5310302 any political operative obamas included will tell you that a big field operation is good for three or four points and in a close state that could be enough he said
5310303 we are encouraged by our results and our continued market share gains but the macro economic factors pressuring consumers and the ongoing challenges and uncertainty of the financial markets suggest a cautious sales forecast for the balance of fiscal 2008 is prudent

5310444 he that is of god heareth gods words ye therefore hear them not because ye are not of god
5310445 this years report card shines a harsh and frankly unflattering light on the attitudes we canadians have concerning mental health
5310446 in some ways mental illness is the final frontier of socially acceptable discrimination
5310447 can you imagine the public uproar if mental health was replaced with race gender or religion
5310448 these figures show clearly the insidious stigma still associated with mental health and mental illness
5310449 these are the attitudes that have kept mental health on the outside for far too long
5310450 these findings indicate that the worrying trend of have and have not patients continues
5310451 ensuring canadians have access to a family physician is a key area for action
5310452 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5310453 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5310454 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5310455 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5310456 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5310457 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5310458 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5310459 probably the most under recognized blog in the jblogsphere as far as i am concerned
5310460 just out of curiosity and i dont mean any disrespect
5310461 these guys are animals if they saw a female dog they would harass it
5310462 i think a woman who wears hijab can be more provocative to them
5310463 the more covered up you are the more interesting you are to them
5310464 i feel like with the hijab it makes them wonder what are you hiding underneath
5310465 the more women veil the less men learn to behave as decent and civilized members of society
5310466 and the more women are harassed the more they veil thinking it will protect them
5310467 it makes a woman happy when i call to her it makes her know shes attractive
5310468 the woman herself is the one who makes men harass her
5310469 if shes walking swinging as she goes of course it will happen
5310470 upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it
5310471 the need to engage in a third major round of budget reductions will mean by necessity that all programs including those previously held harmless and all available strategies will be on the table for review
5310472 we will continue to do all we can to protect core services but the need for tough decisions will require examination of all areas of state spending
5310473 the task that lies before us will not be easy the cuts we have made over the last year cuts based on solid data and careful prioritization have been tough the next round will be more difficult however we have met these challenges in the past and i know that we will work together again to do the right thing thats what the best managed state does thats what a triple a state does its the virginia way
5310474 thats a first step the other thing is we always get a bump in december even when theres a downturn because of the holidays and the christmas season
5310475 i dont think any of us think that the real estate market is going to pick up anytime soon it may the first quarter of the year thats what well really be looking at is how the home sales are and if that starts going back up and theres a good chance that we can weather the storm or at least minimize what we have to do
5310476 gas prices are starting to come down and money is starting to get into peoples pockets its going to take some time for people to realize that but i think weve bottomed out and there are some good signs out there that the economy is going to turn around in the third and fourth quarter of this year which is the first and second quarter of our fiscal year
5310477 anything can happen with respect to the economy turning around were not in a recession and if oil prices continue to trend down we can fend off any recession from happening and thats good news
5310478 sonian was looking for both cost effective and scalable computing power that reduced time to market for their digital content archiving offering
5310479 having the vertica analytic database available on demand in amazon ec2 enables software as a service innovators like sonian to give customers faster more affordable and more scalable access to business analytic data
5310480 sarbanes oxley and other federal and industry mandates are going to continue to drive the need to effectively archive digital content
5310481 so we knew we were going to need a cloud database that not only delivered fast query response but also easily scaled to meet demand the vertica analytic database for the cloud was the obvious choice it offered unbeatable performance with no administration overhead and will scale within the cloud as our customer base and their archives grow
5310482 sonian is a progressive company that knows the significant potential that cloud computing presents
5310483 by combining affordable flexible digital archiving with scalable hyper fast querying against enormous databases sonian is providing a remarkable security and compliance solution to its customers together sonian vertica and amazon give companies confidence that they will find the answers they need on demand
5310484 the government takes the protection of personal data extremely seriously and we are committed to ensuring that information is shared in a safe and secure way
5310485 a dedicated information assurance program has been established for the coming year to address information risks and inspire public trust and confidence
5310486 i have what some may call a na ve belief that kenya is a haven of untapped potential
5310487 look around at kenyans making it in the diaspora i am a firm believer that restrictions of the mind result in restrictions in performance i am hoping that my belief that a compelling idea can come from kenya will fuel the right developer to see beyond themselves as a kenyan developer and more as a developer who the world is demanding a service from
5310488 committed to continuing the successful implementation of the offender management model and to ensuring that offender managers have access to the necessary information to allow them to effectively manage offenders within custody and in the community
5310489 replace unstable at risk it systems across the probation and prison services
5310490 a program of work will begin to replace those case management systems which are most at risk in the short term with a system delius already successfully in use in the two largest probation areas and then to address the technical assistive technology and ergonomic problems with the legacy system crams that most areas now use
5310491 given the scale of the implementation and technical issues with performance implementation has led to courts experiencing slowness and downtime
5310492 although on launch the sms supplier management system operated well with low user levels problems arose as the users increased and as a result was withdrawn for external users
5310493 before the scope of the schemes and processes had been settled
5310494 i would love one or two new faces in by saturday but if you were to ask me will we have them in by saturday my honest answer would have to be maybe
5310495 it has been a good start but there is obviously room for improvement we are not world beaters by any means
5310496 well keep plugging away and working hard on the training ground
5310497 hes out of manchester united and then through our academy so hes going to have a good career
5310498 hes just hindered by the fact that julian bennett is the left back ahead of him who was in the team of the season for league one last year
5310499 we are speaking to southampton and we have agreed a deal with them
5310500 hes got good experience but is also a young lad with good legs you need that in the premier league but we will see because the deal is not finalised yet
5310501 it is important we get the right person in gibbs is the sort of player arsenal will loan out
5310502 its nice to get my first goal so early it gives you confidence
5310503 you want to get that first one or the pressure builds as time goes on i am hoping to be more consistent and get into double figures this season
5310504 i was really satisfied with my performance and especially with the team we played really well in the first 45 minutes
5310505 stoke were tough and dangerous at corners and with throw ins but i think we played a good defensive game
5310506 shed get on kicks where she only wanted hard boiled eggs shed watch everything i did no butter or certain seasonings and i couldnt fry anything anorexics become very manipulative with their families it was like walking on eggshells
5310507 one goes right at the eating disorder while the other works to navigate adolescent stressors
5310508 we tell mom and dad that we need to get them on board they are an important part of the solution this study will determine which form of counseling works best
5310509 the behavioral therapy is designed to help families find ways to break that cycle
5310510 it encourages and structures the family situation so that eating is expected
5310511 but we tell the parent we realize you have been through an incredible amount already
5310512 so its teaching the parents to talk in a positive manner thats supportive again it helps the parent become part of the solution in that regard
5310513 i would come out of the hospital and immediately stop eating again because i would be put back in the same environment that triggered it
5310514 as we found out with her illness youre afraid to talk about it and open up about things
5310515 communication completely breaks down because you dont want to upset her
5310516 if we would have had help as a family i think it would have made a big difference
5310517 it may not have sped up her recovery but it would have helped us know how to react to what she was going through

5310521 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
5310522 kurdish prime minister negervan barazani expressed his belief with the importance of the project as the it and communication represent strategic elements for the development of the region
5310523 the importance of the project is to put and implement strategic plans for three governmental bodies to develop the it system in these bodies
5310524 i am delighted that we now have a drilling rig contracted for kurdistan with firm plans for a minimum of two wells the first well on the shaikan block is scheduled to spud in early 2009 this rig contract is a tangible benefit of our recent successful fund raising and the demonstrably rapid progress which we and our partners are making in kurdistan is testimony to our close working relationships
5310525 refraining from following up on the recent developments in the post saddam iraq and allowing regional non arab and international interference in iraqi affairs have reached their final stage
5310526 some people believe that the arab role came too late ignoring the fact the arab capitals needed a monitoring period to fully understand that complicated and difficult situation
5310527 king abdullah will visit iraq soon to boost bilateral relations between the two countries
5310528 the flowing liquidity was illegal and illegitimate which resulted in serious inflationary consequences that particularly affected the banks that were used to launder dubious money

5310532 the department of emergency services is risking peoples lives by taking firefighters off the front line to do corporate training which is not high in urgency
5310533 in this particular case of the two officers deployed to the whyte island training centre only one was able to be replaced by a day worker despite all attempts to find a replacement for the second officer on overtime
5310534 its one of the hardest things ive ever done but its been very very interesting
5310535 enormous challenge it might be called a quick read but its been far from a quick write for me
5310536 for readers of labyrinth and sepulchre this is similar territory but what i wanted to do was make available for emerging readers the sort of fiction i write
5310537 i was inspired by a piece of history id read which id not been able to use in labyrinth or sepulchre i hadnt completely decided whether sepulchre would be the end of my writing about southwest france but this has made me realise that there will probably be a third book in the languedoc trilogy
5310538 the idea of producing a book for adults as part of a literacy programme rather than saying to them here read a childrens book seems so logical and sensible
5310539 i know it was wrong ill go to jail for a long time
5310540 i wanted to tell her the truth but she didnt want to listen
5310541 clearly there has been recent debate about the jury system here in queensland arising out of a couple of cases
5310542 while these amendments have not been designed with any particular case in mind they will apply to any case where an application is heard from the time that the amendments become law
5310543 intolerable prospect of retrials in situations where one intransigent juror had refused to do his or her duty in accordance with the law
5310544 reform of the justice system is needed but whether these proposals are the right reforms remains to be seen

5310566 hey i got this friend youll never believe who it is i think he might be coming around on your issues
5310567 i think its fair to say that bob has never been afraid to embrace controversial issues or positions and always had a knack for turning his actions into ink
5310568 the curse is that people view him as being this bombastic character who really is more thoughtful and has a greater degree of moderation
5310569 change the nature of the debate and raise the issue in the publics eye
5310570 it could enhance the things he enjoys doing speaking pontificating writing
5310571 whatever step would be required for bob barr as president to cut back by 10 percent the executive office of the president would be done

5310618 well have a good chat with shane sutton tomorrow cos hes the master tactician and well be waiting firing for gold a medal wont do now tomorrow its got to be gold
5310619 the madison is the hardest track race of the lot
5310620 we could be the strongest and have a crash early on so well see
5310621 well be careful were current world champions we just have to make sure we play it right
5310622 physically its possible to combine so many just sometimes these things are hard to put into practice
5310623 for me the big pressure events are over now the individual and team pursuit all that getting up on that line and facing the countdown
5310624 i enjoy the madison and thats that it is difficult going from two kind of steady state race like the team pursuit to one which is stop and go but we do 70 kilometres an hour here in the team pursuit and theres not many people going to faster than that
5310625 most of the six day guys just pose around on the blue line at the bottom of the banking when theyre training and you come in and watch them you get them in the race and theyre really going good
5310626 chris has been preparing for this all along and chris was going for that it looks like australian jason kellys going to be his strongest opponent and its a bit more of a lottery but even if we didnt two medals is not bad
5310627 i think its just the level weve got to winning the indiviudal was quite surreal i spent an hour on it and then put it away in a drawer
5310628 then i was thinking if i didnt win tonight what a huge disappointment it would be and then i thought hang on youve already got one gold i was quite confused actually

5310630 she looks like she feels good shes got that look about her that she just feels really good

5310641 i dont think the u s needs to be even handed in the middle east it needs to stand with and behind our only ally israel
5310642 as the election approaches it will be a time of choosing americas role is not to be an honest broker in the middle east it begins with standing for the security and interests of israel
5310643 when ahmadinejad says he wants to wipe israel off the map he means it hed do it to the u s and europe if he could
5310644 we need to look at the world as it is theres no way we can sit idly by and allow iran to build a bomb iran is not doing this for peaceful reasons iran is the largest sponsor of terror in the world in lebanon syria
5310645 we find iranians making inroads in south america with bolivia and venezuela iranians have no business in the western hemisphere
5310646 this is a perilous time with the menacing pronouncements of ahmadinejad god forbid the next holocaust will not require camps but one missile and one bomb and 17 minutes of flight americans democrats and republicans are coming together to place more pressure on iran until it abandons nuclear weapons
5310647 were on the verge of winning the war on iraq

5310692 our job was to produce a sales presenter that would get the team excited about stella artois and make it easier to sell the beer to pub and bar managers
5310693 the psps were delivered in hand stitched black velvet drawstring bags the machines were rebranded with a stella artois logo on the reverse of the case and we also modified the operating systems and icon sets to reflect the brand
5310694 yes every sales representative who was given a psp met all their sales targets for the relevant quarter and anecdotal feedback also confirmed that without exception the psp was regarded as the best sales presenter ever received as a result fosters is now reviewing further rollout of the tool

5310696 cine a raspuns in mod stupid absurd raspunsul rus a fost disproportionat
5310697 l a tot provocat in ultimul an si si a pregatit raspunsul la actiunea georgiana
5310698 unii spun ca au existat semnale amestecate din partea americanilor iar europa a fost divizata insa saakasvili ar fi trebuit sa stie asta poate s a gandit ca sunt jocurile olimpice si rusia nu va reactiona sau ca in acest context rusia fiind gazda urmatoarealor jo nu va reactiona este greu sa stii cum a gandit si e greu sa crezi ca el s a gandit ca va castiga
5310699 opozitia georgiana vrea sa il inlature dar cat de repede se va intampla asta nu se stie opozitia nu se va misca prea repede pentru ca nu vrea sa para lipsita de patriotism
5310700 rusia nu trebuie sa aiba drept de veto asupra unor asemenea proiecte
5310701 rusia a vrut sa si manifeste sfera de influenta in vecinatatea sa sa arate ca este o putere cheie mesajul pe care vrea sa il transmita tarilor vecine ucrainei moldovei este rusia s a intors rusia este din nou la putere
5310702 iar bush aflat la final de mandat nu va avea puterea sa ii influneteze trebuie sa asteptam sa vedem ce va zice noul presedinte american
5310703 trebuie ca rusiei sa i se puna conditii nu trebuie sa o eliminam din g8 dar trebuie sa ii punem conditii sa ii spune ce s ar putea intampla daca nu ia anumite masuri
5310704 numai ca ue si nato au pozitii divergente in privinta rusiei iar multe state membre ale nato si ue trebuie sa isi regandeasca politica in ceea ce priveste rusia faptul ca ne gandim ca rusia nu trebuie provocata este o greseala

5310719 my goal for the race was to be the first michelin rider home which is what i have achieved but things were too difficult to do better i started fully motivated and wanting to give the maximum and exploit fully the material at our disposal but today i cannot be satisfied with the result
5310720 i had difficulty with the front tyre and was forced to change my style of riding which meant not being able to exploit my speed in the corners i had to stop hard and fire the bike out of the corners rather than have a smoother style this difficulty penalised us in the race

5310724 the seat of government and the bulk of public funds are here in metro manila so it is not unimaginable that it would register the highest number of graft cases with the sandiganbayan
5310725 we also dont have enough field investigators to monitor them
5310726 we welcome ea into our formal process and look forward to demonstrating to their board the significant strides made by take two since they last undertook a detailed review of our business in early 2007
5310727 our board remains unwavering in its belief that eas unsolicited conditional tender offer of 25 74 per share was inadequate and undervalued world class entertainment franchises and our strong operational and financial performance
5310728 we are continuing to consider all alternatives that will maximize value to our stockholders
5310729 as part of that commitment we are engaged in discussions with other parties as part of a formal process to generate greater value and will act quickly to assist ea in moving expeditiously through our process
5310730 in the meantime we remain focused on executing on our business goals and creating value for stockholders and consumers of our products

5310733 the campaign you have here is basically bill cassidy against the entire national democratic party
5310734 coming back after bad shots is what got me through today
5310735 i only had two birdies today and they were on the front nine luckily it was enough to post a decent round
5310736 i just had a really good week out here and was able to play very steady golf
5310737 i played it safe when i could and was aware of where i was and it all worked out
5310738 there are a lot of nasty rumors and smears about him going around
5310739 there are going to be many districts where the obama campaign helps our candidates but our candidates are going to bring out people and we want to be sure they vote for obama as well
5310740 we hope to call them three times and knock on their door at least two times between now and election day
5310741 a lot of people tell me they are going to vote a straight democratic ticket except for president
5310742 democrats are prospecting for votes in places where they know their liberal party message of higher taxes and opposition to drilling could have a detrimental effect on their down ballot chances
5310743 its no coincidence that they are doing so in blue collar districts where republican congressional candidates are already running strong
5310744 we are in a position where we are able to do both
5310745 but i wouldnt say it is a two woman show
5310746 everyone played very well for example formiga who was injured during the world cup but she made a lot of contribution to the team and theres our captain tania she made a lot of opportunities all the players played really well
5310747 at the start the team was a little bit tense and i didnt know why perhaps it was because they met germany in the group stage but they changed their position which enabled the pace of the game to come and after that it went pretty well
5310748 we kind of feel that we had it in our hands we led 1 0 and missed some other chances to score the second goal
5310749 after that we didnt work well in front of our defense and we surrendered the equalizing goal at a bad time just before halftime we were on the wing with two players covering cristiane and we just couldnt manage to get the ball
5310750 the second and third goals were situations that started with a corner on the other side marta had a lot of space and handled the ball very well and you saw the result after that it was difficult to get back in the game we are disappointed with the loss but we cant change it
5310751 were approaching a pull the plug kind of decision this is like a last stand for webcasting
5310752 i was on the bus when i get this message on my treo
5310753 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5310754 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5310755 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent senator obama
5310756 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5310757 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5310758 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5310759 some of these things come back right away and theyre ready to go
5310760 this is a major public health concern that should be given serious consideration in future urban development transportation planning and environmental policies
5310761 health risk can be mitigated through proper urban planning but that doesnt erase the immediate risk to school age children attending schools that are too close to highways right now
5310762 existing schools should be retrofitted with air filtration systems that will reduce students exposure to traffic pollutants
5310763 for many years our focus has been on homes when it comes to air pollution school attendance may result in a large dose of inhaled traffic pollutants that until now have been completely overlooked
5310764 major roads play an important role in the economy but we need to strike a balance between economic and health considerations as we break ground on new areas
5310765 policymakers need to develop new effective strategies that would encourage urban planners to reconsider our current infrastructure particularly when it comes to building new schools and maintaining existing ones

5310774 there were plenty of large screeners on the market at the time ranging from 75 000 to several hundreds of thousands of dollars but there was nothing to meet the needs of the small landscaper or contractor
5310775 ez screen topsoil screeners are used in places all around the world

5310828 we hear that readers want education news it always ranks in the top five things they read both online and in hard copy but with newsroom cuts or empty slots that take forever to fill got to keep the bottom line down good stories and packages and good watchdog reporting are becoming more difficult to do
5310829 my blog certainly could not survive on its own even with strong and loyal readership the blog is a narrow enough niche that it would be hard to sell enough ads to support it and some of my pageviews are solely as a result from being featured at ddn com so id probably lose pageviews also making it even harder to sell to advertisers
5310830 i personally do believe that eventually there will be opportunities for self supporting niche websites especially as newspaper resources continue to erode and more communities are ignored
5310831 could bloggers take up the slack as papers cut education reporters not unless the bloggers are education reporters themselves sure there are the policy wonks who like to opine on all the national trends
5310832 but more mainstream readers like the ones we write for want to know about the local schools and the states policy directives and these reports dont just materialize out of thin air thats what we as education reporters provide and blog about
5310833 a very smart blog if youre trying to separate the demagogic attacks on nclb from the serious criticism this is the site to read

5310845 the olympics is truly about participation but its also about your moment in time today my moment in time was with my sister who i love almost more than anyone in the world
5310846 its just amazing to think that we could participate and bring home a gold medal and i am so excited i cant even speak
5310847 i went from hitting my head on the wall to win by one hundredth of a second to doing my best time in every event its been nothing but an upwards roller coaster its been nothing but fun
5310848 my coach bob always said to me that it was like putting money in the bank i guess i put a lot of money in the bank for the last four years and we withdrew pretty much every penny of it

5310850 in my opinion well never ever see it again it will never be emulated

5310854 weve assisted them to walk out of our doors empowered and effectively skilled
5310855 no matter how much power government has it never has enough
5310856 the most difficult thing about politics is dealing with people with really bad breath
5310857 never run a 100 yard dash in a 90 yard room
5310858 once you create a bureaucracy it is near to impossible to ever get rid of it
5310859 the flames of hedonism licking at the very foundation of our society

5310861 if not 180 degrees from that about 178 1 2
5310862 hey i got this friend youll never believe who it is i think he might be coming around on your issues
5310863 i think its fair to say that bob has never been afraid to embrace controversial issues or positions and always had a knack for turning his actions into ink
5310864 the curse is that people view him as being this bombastic character who really is more thoughtful and has a greater degree of moderation
5310865 change the nature of the debate and raise the issue in the publics eye
5310866 it could enhance the things he enjoys doing speaking pontificating writing
5310867 whatever step would be required for bob barr as president to cut back by 10 percent the executive office of the president would be done
5310868 what is the position about the poor and helping the poor

5310870 i would like somebody to accuse us of being flip floppers
5310871 lets say that barack obama is elected president of the united states and lets just say its because of bob barr and wayne root
5310872 youre not gonna feel guilty the morning after election night
5310873 theres never an excuse to not be pleasant and civil

5310881 i think it would be better sorry heidi i cant come to
5310882 barr says he means this playfully although even bob barrs playful sounds a little bit stern he walks off to do his thing for the camera
5310883 there cannot be true freedom if women are still disempowered there could never be true wealth if women remain trapped in the chains of poverty women represent the majority of the population and if economically empowered more than half the problem of poverty is solved
5310884 this form of unemployment emerges when women and girls have to care for families particularly infected and affected by hiv and aids without any financial recognition and acknowledgement of this role
5310885 unpaid care work is a new challenge that needs to be addressed this work needs to be quantified qualified and remunerated
5310886 remunerating this kind of work though should not mean it still remains an area for women and girls only to participate in men and boys should be involved too
5310887 south africa has been identified as a country of destination where trafficking is concerned but linked to this is the challenge of drug trafficking and drug abuse a problem that is ravaging our communities and needs intensified efforts to fight it
5310888 during the annual budget the department allocates funding for the shelters the strategy is to increase them and urged private sector to make victim support part of their social investment programmes
5310889 dont believe that you deserve being abused stand up and seek help police and social workers are there to assist you
5310890 do we still have family values to instill to our children to become leaders its high time to address ourselves and talk about this problem to move away from the cruel past
5310891 during the conference minister dlamini zuma will brief south africas envoys on regional continental and international issues including the outcomes of the sadc summit concluded over the weekend
5310892 the minister will also meet with the minister of foreign investments and economic cooperation marta lomas morales on 26 august 2008
5310893 i am proud to say that as a government and as a people we rose to the challenge and we worked in cooperation with everyone including international organisations and local non governmental organisations to ensure the safety of our fellow brothers and sisters from africa who reside in south africa
5310894 the outpouring of generosity the spirit of well being and the humanitarian assistance provided by ngos faith based organisations as well as by south africans from all walks of life is proof that our people will not tolerate the criminal acts of a few
5310895 this challenge is magnified under conditions where there is a continual influx of migrants
5310896 in multicultural diverse heterogeneous societies this is played out as a tension between a national identity and a specific group identity
5310897 for us in south africa it is important to articulate and embrace an inclusive vision that suggests common purpose and shared community can be achieved through inter group solidarity
5310898 we will fulfil our obligation to protect all people from other countries
5310899 through the work of the intergovernmental task team a coherent systematic and clear way forward was developed
5310900 all three spheres of government worked cooperatively to provide assistance engage with community based organisations in the overall effort and worked to ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice and that law and order was quickly restored and that process of community healing and building community cohesion began
5310901 is pleased with the level of interest generated and the progress made to date
5310902 i believe there are a lot of supporters for hillary among the superdelegates especially now that theyve agreed to place her name in nomination i think half the house democrats would probably be hillary supporters especially women
5310903 it could backfire and show that her influence is waning chances are shes not going to have as many delegates vote for her on the floor as she had in the primary
5310904 it is time for a fan driven ticket site that was truly created with the needs of the fans both buyers and sellers in mind
5310905 by offering a platform that quickly and efficiently connects buyers and sellers based on location and does not attach inflated fees for either party livestub will help grow the secondary ticket market amongst the general public

5310910 the cav was formally established in 2006 in response to the urgent need for the creation of an aerospace supplier park to support south africas innovative manufacturing processes
5310911 this supplier park is not only modelled on the successes of the local automotive industry but also mirrors similar international parks such as the silicone valley in california and toulouse in france
5310912 not only will the project lead to increased job creation but would also serve to accelerate the integration of small companies in the industry
5310913 the objectives of the cav include the development construction and full operation of an aerospace supplier park the upliftement of small medium and micro enterprises smmes and for the repositioning of the aviation sector
5310914 the cav has been designed to unlock the growth potential of the local aerospace and aviation industries where local original equipment manufacturers suppliers of components parts and tools as well as service providers stand to benefit equally from synergistic and economy of scale applications
5310915 the cav concept was not however limited to manufacturing but also offers opportunities in service related activities including logistics training and technology centres shared services and co ordinated education
5310916 in deciding whether to support the aerospace sector we were also acutely aware that technology and knowledge are crucial factors of production in modern advanced economies and those new technological developments can create platforms for further innovations
5310917 at the time based on discussions between government and leading defence and aerospace companies i committed to the implementation of support programmes to this industry
5310918 we need to resuscitate that shared vision and commitment the unity and cohesion that have characterised sadc from its inception as we consider the next step that will be required further to advance our regional integration efforts in southern africa
5310919 the increase in intra sadc trade requires a vibrant transport infrastructure while seamless network are needed to interconnect land locked countries as well as link them to the major ports
5310920 it is my strong belief that the private sector has a key role to play especially in the area of regional infrastructure
5310921 a strong amalgam of nostalgia feminist history astute insight beautiful music and irresistible gossip
5310922 both scholarly and dishy a superb journalist weller has managed to uncover a trove of unreported facts on her subjects

5310926 we had a wonderful day of golf and the proceeds will go a long way in helping southern californias most abused and neglected children
5310927 i think we can do a much better job and not increase taxes
5310928 a man who knows what he thinks believes he is right and will lead according to those beliefs
5310929 i believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman now for me as a christian its also a sacred union gods in the mix the reason that people think there needs to be a constitutional amendment some people believe is because of the concern about same sex marriage i am not somebody who promotes same sex marriage but i do believe in civil unions
5310930 union a union between man and a woman between one man and one woman thats my definition of marriage
5310931 we continue to have concerns in particular for these eight children which is why we have asked the judge to review the case
5310932 a ministerial commission which met on monday approved the list of 200 palestinian prisoners who are to be released as a goodwill gesture toward palestinian president mahmoud abbas

5310937 we will continue to work with the pakistani government and political leaders and urge them to redouble their focus on pakistans future and its most urgent needs including stemming the growth of extremism
5310938 what kind of changes does this bring to the war on terror and the afghan situation i dont expect any significant change for now
5310939 i would expect different things would occur later but it is not a time for us to make predictions and share them with you
5310940 we hope that the resignation of president musharraf leads to a strengthening of the civilian government and democracy in pakistan
5310941 afghanistan is in favour of a democratic and stable pakistan which is based on the rule of law
5310942 russia hopes the departure of pakistani president pervez musharraf will not have negative consequences for the internal political stability of this major asian nation
5310943 but reform depends above all on legitimacy and that is why the united kingdom has been at pains to stress the importance for pakistan of strong institutions rather than strong individuals and why we believe a strong democracy is key
5310944 i look forward to the early election of a new president in pakistan to take forward the important shared work that binds our two countries together
5310945 i am heartened by the presence of so many women senior managers in the public service who represent a clear testimony that south africa is taking the right direction to recognise women for their abilities expertise and talents
5310946 to date the number of women in government across all salary levels totals more than 600 000 compared to men at more than 500 000
5310947 as women we must take pride in the fact that empowerment in south africa is seen as translating to active participation and that the pursuit for transformation has presented remarkable opportunities for us
5310948 government takes pride in leading by example in the process of transformation and gender equality compared to other sectors in our country
5310949 i would like to thank former president nelson mandela and president thabo mbeki for the confidence they bestowed in the women of our country
5310950 we need to eradicate all patriarchal impediments in the public service which include discrimination against pregnancy race ethnicity disability sexual orientation and age
5310951 we need to ensure that there is not a single area that women are not involved in this country
5310952 i have been to mosques i have been to synagogues i have been to churches all over the world but i felt god when i held that stick you will get your college
5310953 as more and more students pursue science degrees we find that the tcus are producing research both in areas of their tribal communities and in the area of basic research
5310954 for too long we have allowed non indians from mainstream institutions to be seen as experts on indian education and issues
5310955 our challenge now as a movement is to maintain our infrastructures
5310956 the tribal college movement began with prayer and ceremonies forty years later one can still hear those prayers singing in colleges today
5310957 the record keeping were finding with noah is not that good
5310958 free two day shipping with a free trial of amazon prime
5310959 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
5310960 free two day shipping with a free trial of amazon prime
5310961 we think its a good sign it shows people with principles with the bn will finally choose a pakatan with principles
5310962 he always told me that he thought school was a waste of time
5310963 i wasnt really good at anything else that i liked
5310964 i cant have tournaments for that anymore i might as well just give him the prize
5310965 when you want to go somewhere with this gaming stuff youve got to be in the top 1 percent
5310966 youve got to win these major tournaments otherwise you dont get noticed by advertisers and sponsors
5310967 the next big game that comes out im just going to focus on that one
5310968 the mechanical properties are similar to other polymers but the inexpensiveness of waste pcbs mean this technology has good potential
5310969 if that is how they deal with family problems how are they dealing with the public
5310970 to have 69 complaints and only a few sustained that is reflective of successful use
5310971 we need to make policy changes to ensure that this never happens again
5310972 the question is how to best fight an administration policy that permits such practices
5310973 serve in consultative roles to interrogation and information gathering processes for national security related purposes
5310974 others maintain that you have to be present to make it clear that these acts are never permissible
5310975 behavioral science teams make sure everything a detainee sees or hears enhances the interrogation process they are involved in the whole effort to break detainees down
5310976 its not enough to say that you cant participate in torture its the interrogations
5310977 nobodys come up with a way to prevent this from happening even here in the u s
5310978 the u s is probably more internet dependent than any place in the world so to that extent were more vulnerable than any place in the world to this kind of attack
5310979 so much of what were doing in the united states is out there on the internet and all of that can be taken down at once
5310980 this is such a crucial issue at every level our security now is dependent on computers
5310981 its a whole new era political and military conflicts now will almost always have a cyber component the chief targets will be critical infrastructure and the attacks will emerge from within our own computer systems
5310982 it only takes a couple of experts it doesnt take a whole cyber infantry division to pull something like this off
5310983 for a very small investment in resources you can have a huge impact
5310984 when it comes to our government it security were pretty strong in protecting against attacks
5310985 we can command so much bandwidth that its hard to overwhelm our servers
5310986 we are vulnerable to more sophisticated attacks but right now most of the people who want to do us harm dont have those capabilities
5310987 youd see some disruption of essential services like electricity youd definitely see espionage
5310988 would it be decisive no nobodys going to win a conflict with the united states in cyberspace but would it be disruptive and irritating yes
5310989 we dont know quite what the rules are for this kind of conflict if its spying its illegal but is it an act of war and who do you arrest
5310990 were much safer in the u s than we were a year ago but we still have a long way to go
5310991 i was having a hard time at school in terms of being c p at everything with no discernible talent
5310992 i sometimes think why oh why has velcro not taken off
5310993 yes dan radcliffe does have dyspraxia this is something he has never hidden thankfully his condition is very mild and at worst manifests itself in an inability to ties his shoe laces and bad handwriting
5310994 movie radcliffe talked about the media backlash for leaping from the safe confines of potter to the provocative role in
5310995 apparently senator obama said yesterday that the supreme court justice he liked least was clarence thomas ive met justice thomas senator and you are no clarence thomas he is a great man a humble man a friendly person who truly wants the supreme court to work for the people of this nation when i met him he was cordial and shook hands with me but really wanted to talk to my son who is in his 20s he understands how our country needs to grow and develop with young people with good hearts i was kind of amazed at how he zeroed in on my son senator obama you should talk to justice thomas get to know him get to know more people like him then someday you might be qualified to be president right now youre listening to the wrong people if we were to elect an african american as president this year justice thomas would be a far better president than senator obama
5310996 ze hebben een heel goede telefoon maar kunnen er niet uithalen wat erin zit door een gebrek aan geheugen

5311000 suddenly inflammation has become one of the hottest areas of medical research hardly a week goes by without the publication of yet another study uncovering a new way that chronic inflammation does harm to the body it destabilizes cholesterol deposits in the coronary arteries leading to heart attacks and potentially even strokes
5311001 for the first time we have hard clinical evidence that lowering inflammation lowers the risk of heart attack and stroke and cardiovascular disease
5311002 rather than concentrating only on lowering cholesterol you need to understand the necessary steps to decreasing the cause of inflammation in your arteries this approach could have significant and dramatic implications in the prevention and reversal of heart diseases
5311003 elevated serum homocysteine is an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease and heart attack
5311004 40 major clinical studies now confirm that homocysteine levels are a predictive marker for heart disease stroke and peripheral artery disease
5311005 wij doen wat we willen en ontwerpen wat we zelf willen dragen
5311006 dit hebben we onder meer gedaan in amsterdam antwerpen lyon en toronto met zon 100 mensen liepen we in de nieuwste collecties door de stad iedereen die mee wilde doen kon zich aanmelden

5311009 licht de aankomende studenten goed en eerlijk in over de opleiding
5311010 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5311011 was not in a cone of silence on saturday night
5311012 secondly not everyone who applies for a gun permit receives one so an illegal gun would have gotten her in double trouble had she killed him

5311039 after witnessing huge crowd in congress rally at baba bakala sukhbir has lost his mental balance and thus giving baseless statements against senior congress leaders to get over his frustration
5311040 after watching the congresss huge show in baba bakala sukhbir badal is definitely a man haunted by nightmares and hallucinations and his statement reflects his state of mind and frustration instead of advising capt singh sukhbir badal should himself undergo for psychiatric treatment
5311041 ill take the fight wherever i feel i have an advantage over my opponent
5311042 if they can be submitted ill work hard to get into position and submit them if they can be beaten in the stand up ill stand with them and beat them there it all depends on who im fighting and what they are specialists at i try to be an all round fighter
5311043 hes real tough a good competitor and is very well rounded

5311045 his strongest point is his ability to fight in all different areas hes very well rounded and can do a bit of everything hes one of the best fighters in the ufc and im really looking forward to fighting him
5311046 i think he might have the advantage on the ground but i think ill be stronger in the standup
5311047 i think marquardts probably the toughest guy ive fought so far
5311048 i take one fight at a time i dont want to get into a position and then everybody says i dont deserve it im happy to beat who ive got to beat to get my title shot

5311053 they didnt play that well we conceded four silly goals
5311054 maybe the one for deco was a great strike but the others before were very poor
5311055 if we all do our job and follow our men there would be no problem

5311061 there is tremendous opportunity for the movie industry to benefit from capturing the purchasing power of the hispanic market segment
5311062 this movement is about more than spanish speaking movies the impact of attendance of hispanics at movie theaters across the country affects the profitability potential of all mainstream blockbusters
5311063 less than a handful of years ago in 2004 there were an average of 4 2 persons in this demographic per hispanic household these figures are definitely higher today just since 1990 the hispanic population has increased by more than 50 percent
5311064 whats important to note about hispanics consumer habits regarding the entertainment industry is that when hispanics go to the movies the event is a whole family affair
5311065 hispanics dont leave kids at home with babysitters they bring them along this approach to entertainment means more tickets get purchased at the box office and a greater number of accompanying popcorn and soft drinks sales in theaters
5311066 the purchasing power of hispanics in the entertainment and movie industry is quite simply impressive
5311067 in the last five years there have been more movie trailers exposed through the spanish broadcasting media than ever before
5311068 as the hispanic population continues to grow according to u s census projections we anticipate further rise in these figures and influence in years to come

5311089 look here is how i think bit here is how i think bit and this is reflected in my tax plan if you are making 150 thousand a year or less as a family then are you middle class or you may be poor but 150 down you are basically middle class i would argue that if you are making more than 250 000 then are you in the top 3 4 percent of this country are you doing well now these things are all relative and im not suggesting that everybody that is making over 250 000 is living on easy street but the question that i think we have to ask ourselves is if we believe in good schools if we believe in good roads if we want to make sure that kids can go to college if we dont want to leave a mountain of debt for the next generation then weve got to pay for these things they dont come for free and it is irresponsible i believe it is irresponsible inter generationally for us to invest or for us to spend 10 billion a month on a war and not having a way to pay for it that i think is unacceptable nobody like to pay taxes what im saying is under the approach that im taking if you make 150 thousand or less you will see a tax cut if you are making 250 000 or more you will see a month defendants increase what im trying to do is create a sense of balance and fairness in our tax code one that we can all agree on it should be simpler so you dont have all these loopholes and big stacks of stuff that youve got to come through which waste a huge amount of money and allows special interest to take advantage of things that ordinary people cannot take advantage of
5311090 some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy i think that rich is should be defined by a home a good job and education and the ability to hand to our children a more prosperous and safer world than the one that we inherited i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich i dont believe in class warfare or redistribution of the wealth but i can tell you for example there are small businessmen and women who are working 16 hours a day seven days a week that some people would classify as quote rich my friends who want to raise their taxes and raise their payroll taxes lets have keep taxes low lets give every family in america a 7 thousand dollar tax credit for every child they have lets give them a 5 thousand dollar refundable tax credit to go out and get the health insurance of their choice lets not have the government take over the health care system in america so so i think if youre just talking about income how about five million so but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is the point is the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues and my friend it was not taxes that mattered in america in the last several years it was spending spending got completely out of control we spent money in a way that mortgaged our kids futures my friends we spent 3 million of your money to study the dna of bears in montana now i dont know if that was a paternity issue or a criminal issue but the point is but the point is it was 3 million of your money it was your money and you know we laugh about it but we cry and we should cry because the congress is supposed to be careful stewards of your tax dollars so what did they just do in the middle of an energy crisis when in california we are paying 4 a gallon for gas went on vacation for five weeks i guarantee you two things they never miss a pay raise and a vacation and we should stop that and call them back and not raise your taxes we should not and cannot raise taxes in tough economic times so it doesnt matter really what my definition of rich is because i dont want to raise anybodys taxes i really dont in fact i want to give working americans a better shot at having a better life and we all know the challenges my friends if i could be serious americans tonight in california and all over america are sitting at the kitchen table recently and suddenly lost a job cant afford to stay in their home education for their kids affordable health care these are tough problems these are tough problems you talk to them every day

5311136 i thought it was just tendons they get hyper sensitive leading up to the marathon i was icing it this week it didnt affect how i was training
5311137 it was a bit sore when i woke up but had no affect on my running it was tight most of way i felt a pop in my foot i couldnt stand on it
5311138 i didnt expect to be finishing the marathon in a bus
5311139 i was excited to get out i made my country proud and tried to win another medal as athletes we have ups and downs unfortunately you cant pick the days they come on
5311140 i had no idea what was going on with magdalena lewy boulet and deena
5311141 i was bummed to hear it didnt work out for them today
5311142 it was tough out there the lead pack kind of pulled away right after the half i just tried to relax and stay tough and run my own race i kind of thought more people would come back to me i didnt really end up passing that many people so im kind of glad i got a good start
5311143 as soon as i hit it it was hurting and it limited by training
5311144 the swelling is all gone theres just a bruise that prevents me from proper range of motion
5311145 if such a document is lost what kind of court is this
5311146 facilitate the settlement to take place with the judge to have a fast trial
5311147 i from this place ask you to cancel the file that is personal to me
5311148 it shows when you set your imagination to doing something anything can happen
5311149 not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympic athlete of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
5311150 she said that looks cool i want to do that
5311151 when youre back in your room and you try to sleep and youre lying there and you think about all the dreams and the aspirations for the last 12 years you get to the point where you go over what happened
5311152 we look at michael phelps and were so happy with what he achieved
5311153 but you look at alicia and she ends up almost being like the goat of the olympics thats a tough thing to handle
5311154 the judges hold back scores because of what might come later
5311155 when she lands on her knees she should get more of a deduction
5311156 it was really stressful but it was a great learning experience
5311157 i was the only athlete but thats how it goes
5311158 when he walks down the street people say to him hey champ
5311159 when i was at my last olympics i had a teammate with me in yukio
5311160 but now its only me i just hope that i can have a good performance
5311161 hopefully i will get in the top 10 i think i will be all right
5311162 i was the one left behind to carry the flag
5311163 we now have a shot to play for a gold medal
5311164 that was the focus of today the germans have stood in our way the last two major championship from us advancing into medal rounds so there was a little payback as well
5311165 and now were two games away from a gold medal its a huge accomplishment for these guys
5311166 when i came on board it was as close to a dysfunctional family as you could find
5311167 wed been through three coaches in three years there were a lot of individuals a lot of good pieces but they just didnt believe in themselves and they werent really a team
5311168 so to witness and just be a part of how far these guys have come it gets me in my heart seeing how much they believe now that they can beat anybody in the world
5311169 its huge its magnificent to see the human spirit and how much a team can come together
5311170 the referees didnt want to give us a chance to win the game
5311171 i think it is a fair decision and we should just accept it
5311172 they hold a lot and if we could drive and move and get open we could open up some of those things one of our biggest things was to be mobile
5311173 when we scouted germany we knew they were a bit slower than some teams so we knew we could get some of those quick passes in there and we put them away
5311174 its been nothing but an upwards rollercoaster its been nothing but fun
5311175 when so many people say it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination
5311176 without the help of my relay teammates this wasnt possible
5311177 the teamwork we had is the difference in it all
5311178 that should be the safest place in the world for a child
5311179 hes not afraid to go back to school but im afraid for him
5311180 daddy please dont make me go back to that school theyre trying to kill me i want to go to school with civilized nice children see how sad and depressed i look oh daddy please dont send me back there
5311181 i dont want to say anything while this is under investigation i dont want to comment about other peoples children
5311182 its a bullying issue you hear me bullying i say
5311183 they think we will see the trees and not the forest why was this kid singled out sure looks like he might be in the minority where he goes to school and tell me race has nothing to do with it
5311184 hampered by continuous staff turnover particularly in the area of finance
5311185 its one of the hardest things ive ever done but its been very very interesting
5311186 enormous challenge it might be called a quick read but its been far from a quick write for me
5311187 for readers of labyrinth and sepulchre this is similar territory but what i wanted to do was make available for emerging readers the sort of fiction i write
5311188 i was inspired by a piece of history id read which id not been able to use in labyrinth or sepulchre i hadnt completely decided whether sepulchre would be the end of my writing about southwest france but this has made me realise that there will probably be a third book in the languedoc trilogy
5311189 the idea of producing a book for adults as part of a literacy programme rather than saying to them here read a childrens book seems so logical and sensible
5311190 el premio es la camiseta de la selecci n espa ola con una frase comprometidos y algo m s que viene a recompensar el esfuerzo limpio por superarnos personalmente

5311198 whether i win or lose the impeachment the nation will lose
5311199 they dont realize they can succeed against me but the country will undergo irreparable damage
5311200 nobody has been arrested or charged at this stage and we do not have any suspects
5311201 so wed like to speak to any person who may have some knowledge of this incident
5311202 he said you have got an amazing amount of sunshine and said he was interested in setting up a sunlovers club he said
5311203 he was asking me if i thought alice springs would be a friendly town that would welcome something like this
5311204 he has two injuries one to the leg and one to the foot
5311205 the one to the leg has been an accumulative injury for years but it was cured the major problem for his withdrawal is his heel i dont know when it was hurt probably six or seven years ago before athens the injury has been back and forth between intensive training and rest and this is the main problem
5311206 he only went out there to show off his shoes
5311207 i would probably ask to take a picture with him
5311208 and tell him good luck because im pretty sure he has a little bit of pressure on him as well
5311209 it is impossible to overstate the amount of pressure that liu xiang was under before he withdrew
5311210 the hopes of 1 3 billion chinese people were on his shoulders and quite literally weighing him down as a great runner not at his peak he had to choose between competing but not winning or withdrawing to save face
5311211 chinas nothing less than gold strategy and billion dollars of funding for athlete development have yielded olympic results but have also placed monumental pressure on chinese athletes to perform not just for themselves but for the nation liu xiang is a product of this system and may also prove to be its victim
5311212 other runners might have just given it their best shot like tyson gay but this was not an option for liu because of the broader set of circumstances
5311213 i feel very sad i really dont want to quit
5311214 sonian was looking for both cost effective and scalable computing power that reduced time to market for their digital content archiving offering

5311216 sarbanes oxley and other federal and industry mandates are going to continue to drive the need to effectively archive digital content
5311217 so we knew we were going to need a cloud database that not only delivered fast query response but also easily scaled to meet demand the vertica analytic database for the cloud was the obvious choice it offered unbeatable performance with no administration overhead and will scale within the cloud as our customer base and their archives grow
5311218 sonian is a progressive company that knows the significant potential that cloud computing presents
5311219 by combining affordable flexible digital archiving with scalable hyper fast querying against enormous databases sonian is providing a remarkable security and compliance solution to its customers together sonian vertica and amazon give companies confidence that they will find the answers they need on demand
5311220 were looking forward to meeting students to talk about google apps and hear how theyre usi
5311221 we are just so focused we want to defend our gold medal and each team is just one more step we have to climb to get to that podium
5311222 whatever we have when we play we feel like we are in it zone a lot we feel like were jelling were calm and were confident i guess thats our zone
5311223 watching him swim his gold medal feat the other night i took that in with me in this game today he came in so hard and was giving nothing for granted
5311224 he works his butt off and i respect so much the heart and soul in that guy
5311225 he is such a competitor with the drive that he has you get goose bumps thinking about somebody who wants something so bad and you know he wanted it all the work and the tears and the sweat that he has put into this to see him succeed the way he has is incredible
5311226 people have just been really kind to us and to have people embrace me that day was just wonderful
5311227 we have fun out there and i think people kind of gravitate toward us
5311228 currencies move not because they ought to but because they are allowed to previously rigid currencies are going to become more flexible because it is in their own interest
5311229 a stronger dollar if sustained over a longer term could put the u s economy on shakier ground by raising the cost of exports without the improving u s trade position the u s economy would have contracted in the second quarter exports grew at a robust 9 annual rate during the quarter helped along by the cumulative effects of the dollars weakening in recent years
5311230 im ready hes ready its time to showdown and throw down
5311231 hes going to bring his a game and so am i its going to be a dogfight let the best man win
5311232 there are other athletes out there that can run just as fast as we can you saw that in the first round with a lot of 44s it looks like its going to be a fast final
5311233 i feel that eight of the best in the world are going to line up in the finals and you cant county anybody out
5311234 i train to win and when i do win i get a big confidence boost but when i dont do so well it motivates me also every time when i get off the track i am hungrier than when i was before i got up there
5311235 i knew what i could do in the races i lost i didnt execute the right way thats all i have to do execute and ill be fine
5311236 i dont call him and say do you want to go here or go there but the respect is there
5311237 we know each others style hes a great athlete and he knows im coming he knows im great
5311238 hes not going to count me out and im not going to count him out neither of us are poor sportsmen we are both americans love and respect are there
5311239 it helps to have a competitor who runs just as fast and just as strong hes a great competitor
5311240 hes fierce and hes out there to win it helps me to go out there and work harder than what i would before just to stay on top
5311241 we want to set ourselves apart in a world saturated with media
5311242 worried about whether someone on my staff had supported georgia or not
5311243 the fact that john mccain is proud of the lobbyists running his campaign and doesnt understand the conflict of interest his lobbyist advisers represent shows that he simply cannot be trusted to bring change to washington
5311244 the same old folks that brought you george w bush the same team

5311253 move to an online model as fast as it possibly can
5311254 goods in this category are easily compared across suppliers and therefore switching costs from one source to another are lower
5311255 hence the increased competitiveness of us production might be expected to show up here first
5311256 were very happy that we have been blessed with a baby but he wont replace the children whom we lost in the fire

5311260 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5311261 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5311262 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5311263 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5311264 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5311265 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5311266 high level life business coaching for individuals and businesspeople interested in learning ways to legitimately and significantly increase their businesss profitability their salary at their company or their ability to climb the proverbial corporate ladder
5311267 the way that tours are structured now and the way it works is a ridiculous consumption of energy i would consider refusing to tour on environmental grounds if nothing started happening to change the way the touring operates
5311268 some of our best ever shows have been in the us but theres 80 000 people there and theyve all been sitting in traffic jams for five or six hours with their engines running to get there which is bollocks

5311271 i think that the olympics games comitte must give two golds medals in this competition it was very close
5311272 these pics look like the guy on the right touches there s light between phelps s right hand and the wall
5311273 100th of second difference shouldn t there a run off or at least giving golds to both of them

5311496 neighbourhood bloody watchers and im not canadian im american well sort of
5311497 and i certainly wasnt dry that day had to make that appalling show more palatable somehow
5311498 the paintings were how can i put it a little bacterial werent they
5311499 now that youre here youd better come inside no use in standing in the driveway all morning
5311500 i only came down to introduce myself i dont want to keep you from what youre doing if youre busy
5311501 i think that the pruning can wait its a losing battle anyway
5311502 us new world types we go crazy for history like this
5311503 my late husband bought it before we were married i cant seem to let it go just yet
5311504 i can offer you tea coffee or something stronger if youd like
5311505 i suppose i thought that curiosity would get the better of you people around here are very curious about me because i live alone down here in this somewhat noticeable house
5311506 id love a coffee milk no sugar please its a little early for a drink isnt it
5311507 so how does a quiet american end up living on his own in an out of the way gloucestershire village
5311508 thats a long story basically i like it here and i married an english girl
5311509 i must have been coming to stroud for almost as long as youve been alive
5311510 my parents worked over here and bought the stone house when i was in my early teens
5311511 i meant british not part of the local menagerie but i did as it happens in cheltenham
5311512 its not all regency houses and spa water it has its rough underbelly as well
5311513 yeah im sure like south central la or crown heights
5311514 i show a small group of contemporary artists but make my living by finding things at auction and selling them on at a profit to my clients i just need a couple of hits a month to keep going depending on the margins
5311515 talking of taking off id better get going soon im meeting someone in stroud at five
5311516 well its been nice to meet you again ill come and surprise you up at the stone house some time
5311517 id like that a good neighbour is a friend for life as they say
5311518 by the way you havent told me your first name
5311519 mum said that i could have it cut in a bob
5311520 it makes you look like the girl from the film
5311521 you havent seen it its called l on and it has a girl in it whos about your age and also has a bob shes very beautiful like you
5311522 are disproportionately white female and middle aged an indication that it could be former supporters of hillary clinton who are holding out
5311523 there is a sense of entitlement that almost seems to be inbred
5311524 they are convinced hillary is the one who should be assuming the mantle and its tough to crack that
5311525 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
5311526 was the cone of silence comfortable that you were in just now

5311528 todays sentence recognizes the significant threat that gorbey posed to the public at large and to those government officials he believed had offended him
5311529 as the court noted today but for the professionalism and patience of the uniformed members of the u s capitol police this could easily have developed into a deadly confrontation this case serves as an important reminder of the risks that law enforcement officers take each day to protect the citizens employees and institutions of the nations capitol
5311530 i am very proud of the u s capitol police officers who successfully prevented a dangerous felon from inflicting harm to our community
5311531 we also want to thank the assistant u s attorneys for their outstanding work and prosecution of gorbey these outstanding efforts and the combined teamwork have resulted in getting a felon off the streets

5311536 we will not be competing with the large park avenue based hedge funds and wall street investment banks for deal flow
5311537 our sweet spot is reo and non performing portfolios under 10 million the larger funds and institutions really need to take down more sizable deals to move the performance needle
5311538 anecdotally we have seen may funds launched by accomplished and respected rmbs and cmbs trading professionals
5311539 we believe our combination of mortgage firm operating experience and reo property management expertise offer us a distinct advantage and unique view of the current distressed real estate environment
5311540 our investors are still uncomfortable with the lack of transparency and minimized liquidity of securitized paper
5311541 however they like the tangible and transparent nature of purchasing whole loans
5311542 there are unemployed mortgage brokers brokering reo tapes to cowboy hedge funds with a buy and hold or buy and flip approach
5311543 im baffled as to how these types of strategies funds will add incremental value and generate alpha without whole loan servicing expertise
5311544 if you acquire detroit reo at 30 cents on the dollar what makes one think they will be able to flip the tape for 35 cents in three weeks if the seller of the real estate knew they could get 35 cents in three weeks they would hold onto the paper or property themselves and sell

5311553 i remember him telling me back in the day that if you wanted to know real estate youve got to hang out with real estate investors if you wanted to know sports youve got to hang out with athletes i wanted to know tv so i hung out with bob and learned the tv game from one of the best in the business
5311554 we believe tv content can be positive and responsible and still have good ratings
5311555 im shocked so thrilled with the way we did so exciting
5311556 what we did was already amazing so were already very happy
5311557 the houses were damaged by flooding theyre right on the flood plain from the highway

5311565 just leave him alone and hell go away there are fanatics among christians there are fanatics among muslims there are fanatics among jews if we pay attention to fanatics we become fanatic dont forget we have freedom of speech here no one can silence another by force
5311566 we have wonderful relationships with our muslim brothers and sisters here
5311567 they dont need us to legitimize their faith and we dont need them to legitimize our faith they know who we are if somebodys on the radio turn it off
5311568 they know this is not the first time someone has done this
5311569 its not so much about some guy making noise their concern was the average guy on the street its not good for relationships we need to stop these kind of divisions that are being created its not healthy for the community
5311570 when hes defaming all those people in this community they want to speak out we cannot just close our eyes to it
5311571 and we would do the same thing if someone comes out demonizing jesus or denying the holocaust
5311572 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view

5311574 after years of watching the debate over faith and values in america play out with all the finesse of mtvs celebrity deathmatch we will now get to see what happens when a thoughtful adult takes over from the goofballs windbags con artists and media whores who have led most of the battles until now
5311575 mccains knowledge and strong stance for what is just and right he also expressed a sense of humor that i have not seen before
5311576 senator obama spoke to the heart and mind where senator mccain spoke from the heart and mind
5311577 theres some question is mccain really a conservative really a social conservative
5311578 i felt more comfortable with barack obama in terms of his genuine desire to do good

5311584 the pursuit of freedom as defined in an age of consumerism has induced a condition of dependence on imported goods on imported oil and on credit the chief desire of the american people
5311585 is that nothing should disrupt their access to these goods that oil and that credit the chief aim of the u s government is to satisfy that desire which it does in part of through the distribution of largesse here at home and in part through the pursuit of imperial ambitions abroad

5311717 no evidence sufficient to support the claim that an observed association between abortion history and mental health was caused by the abortion per se as opposed to other factors

5311721 appears to be associated with negative psychological reactions equivalent to those experienced by women who miscarry a wanted pregnancy or who experience a stillbirth or death of a newborn
5311722 the differing patterns of psychological experiences observed among women who terminate an unplanned pregnancy versus those who terminate a planned and wanted pregnancy highlight the importance of taking pregnancy intendedness and wantedness into account when seeking to understand psychological reactions to abortion
5311723 it may give more choice in the primary election but less choice in the general election and thats where we elect our leaders were not sure what the disease is but the cure is obviously worse than the disease

5311730 a slow food surgiu como uma forma de influenciar o sistema por meio de pequenos grupos esclarecidos
5311731 para mim qualquer esfor o ou movimento que ajude a motivar as pessoas a perguntarem de onde vem isto e onde foi plantado muito importante
5311732 mas acho que uma forma muito boa de promover comida italiana

5311780 the chase of a dream the fire burns inside me passionately the shackles of mediocrity have been broken every step i take from henceforth pushes me closer to my goals i start with nothing but a great idea and my relentless knack for success i have been spurned numerous times told that dreaming will get me nowhere i have faced disappointments often wondered when will things get better of late though i have been seeing subliminals all around me they all tend to be urging me forward dont stop reach for the stars it invigorates me more than ever my spirit stirs i am fully awake now every thinking moment is geared towards achieving my dreams i keep this record to remind me of what once was and what is yet to be
5311781 the first cd im doing is called stress its all in the mind through my growing up as an athlete i was always taught to be positive its kind of ingrained in me
5311782 we can never be totally free of stress but in this cd what i do is i explain a little bit and then i work on deep breathing exercises and relaxation exercises making people aware of their internal feelings and external feelings muscle relaxation
5311783 i feel having become a citizen in 2005 and the way the world feels about america at the moment theres a lot of negativity in the world about america being the big bully from my point of view as an immigrant ive put it onto cd how i see it through my eyes

5311787 behind the world food crisis is a global freshwater crisis expected to rapidly worsen as climate change impacts intensify
5311788 irrigation fed agriculture provides 45 per cent of the worlds food supplies and without it we could not feed our planets population of six billion people
5311789 millions of people depend on freshwater fisheries as a major food source
5311790 freshwater food stocks can provide up to 80 per cent of dietary protein for the 60 million people of the mekong basin for example and thats just one river
5311791 freshwater systems are home to around 40 per cent of all the species on earth
5311792 and our impact is shown by the fact that we are losing these species faster than any other
5311793 a global treaty for co operatively managing rivers and lakes that cross or form borders is still languishing in limbo more than a decade after being approved by a clear majority in the united nations
5311794 water management for human needs alone is damaging the natural systems we all depend on
5311795 maintaining the health of freshwater ecosystems has to become one of the major aims of freshwater management generally
5311796 we are also concerned that the world continues to mainly discuss adaption to climate change rather than doing it
5311797 we have been doing it all over the world and we have found that that improving the health of freshwater ecosystems now makes a great contribution to improving their resilience to climate impacts in the future
5311798 it is ironic that currently it is not foresight and planning but major natural disasters that lead to significant efforts to repair damaged rivers and wetlands foresight and planning now will reduce the risk and damage from future extreme weather events while having many economic social and environmental benefits
5311799 even this tiny proportion however would be enough for humans to live on earth if the water cycle was properly functioning and if we managed our water use wisely
5311800 we have no right to exterminate the species that evolved without us
5311801 we have the responsibility to do everything we can to preserve their continued existence
5311802 the small patch of moist forest is surrounded by caatinga dry shrubland and thorn forest
5311803 around one million people depend on the forest for their water supply but the moist forest is shrinking every day because of fires the spread of agriculture and the development of leisure homes for people who want to escape the hot dry climate people have not yet realised that their quality of life and economic activities such as agriculture depend on the preservation of the forest they think water comes from the water company
5311804 we believe that the water issue will ultimately save the araripe manakin if we can convince the one million city dwellers that their water supply will be guaranteed if they preserve the moist forest
5311805 hannah montana miley cyrus best of both worlds concert tour in 3 d
5311806 basically what we found is that things are more complicated than previously thought
5311807 our study shows that there is a large genetic component to caste determination but that there is also a very strong environmental component
5311808 flexibility in caste determination is essential as it allows the colony to respond to changes in need or environmental fluctuations
5311809 differences in the nutrition that an individual assimilated during larval growth are strong predictors of caste
5311810 but there are still haves and have nots in the colony those genetic variants who have a reproductive advantage and those that dont
5311811 the history of all past society has consisted in the development of class antagonisms the exploitation of one part of society by the other
5311812 this new national center will help move schools universities and training facilities nationwide into the 21st century
5311813 americas reputation as an international leader rests in the hands of our youth and it should be among our top priorities to provide our students with the tools they need to maintain and build upon this standing the national center will help future american workers compete in the global marketplace
5311814 the national center couldnt come at a more critical time
5311815 american businesses know that they need a well educated workforce to face growing competition from china india and europe americans need to constantly upgrade their skills to keep pace with technology and international competition and people who are losing their jobs often need to acquire new skills to rejoin the workforce
5311816 for the first time education research will benefit from the kinds of creative research management that has been so effective in driving innovation in other parts of the economy

5311825 value investors have to go against the herd and are slightly mad because they are buying something and more of it as the price falls and that is not easy to do
5311826 it has been explained to me that it was obvious we should not have owned house builders or retailers or banks and that i should have known better than to invest in such things it was also obvious that growth in china and india and other developing countries would drive oil and other commodities to record levels and that related equities were the thing to own dont you read the papers was the common comment
5311827 a group of us known as the value support group were standing around a few weeks ago when warren buffett wandered over we were commiserating over how badly we had done in this market how valuation appeared not to matter and had not for the past couple of years how it was all about momentum and trend and how we were losing clients and assets over and above our losses in the market we needed a 12 step programme to cure us of our addiction to buying beaten up stocks trading at large discounts to our assessment of their intrinsic value
5311828 the markets are quite heavily dominated by hedge funds which account for a large amount of the trading volumes at the moment these are not focused on value they have been selling consumer cyclicals and financials and buying emerging markets
5311829 these deals have come irrespective of valuations the lowly valued have become even more lowly valued as a result it has been a doubled edged sword for those who focus on value
5311830 in a world dominated by investors with chronic adhd attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in which the majority of investors end up chasing their own tails taking a long term view will generate periods of underperformance
5311831 at the up turn of the economic cycle profitability is abundant and so growth opportunities are no longer the scarce resource also smaller often more risky value companies benefit most from the upward reversal in sentiment also at the unnerving top of the rollercoaster where you cant yet see the bottom worried investors huddle in value but growth generally requires a gestation period of economic calm to encourage investors and entrepreneurs to explore longer term pay off opportunities
5311832 it was put in the uk all companies sector which was a mistake in hindsight in the uk investors see value as equity income and that is where the fund now sits but in europe it has proved popular with value outselling growth considerably over the past five years although growth is more recently gaining sales
5311833 it has been a difficult market and there are some extreme valuation differences in the market the lowly valuations have had a torrid time whichever way you cut the market lowly valued companies have fallen faster then the market it is no surprise that equity income has suffered
5311834 the flipside is that we are seeing some amazing opportunities the mistake people are making is this is not about six month performance the outlook is still poor in the short term i am mindful to harp back to the technology bubble but the ingredientsare there the markets are as dislocated as they were back then and that created the environment for income funds to do well
5311835 we have been thinking for a while now that as long as commodity prices dont lurch higher and wage pressures remain under control the bank of england may cut interest rates in the first quarter in 2009 this will be good news for banks industrials utilities and telecoms four of the highest yielding sectors in the market
5311836 meanwhile the select band of truly sustainable growth stocks will become ever more select as the economy reaches its nadir and supposed growth stocks that fail to deliver because they are cyclicals will get severely punished by the market this suggests to us that income funds should resume their long term outperformance of growth
5311837 for those with patience this pain is more than compensated following periods of poor value performance value tends to rebound strongly delivering about 17 a year over glamour for an average of seven years
5311838 the experience of the tmt bust may hold some lessons as to when to expect deep value to return to grace it wasnt until investors had totally lost faith in the cyclicals masquerading as growth that value started to return to grace this time it is the mining and emerging market related plays that are cyclicals pretending to be growth their time in the spotlight may be drawing to the end
5311839 theres more of a move to value than there was but there is not a clear wholesale move to that style it is still very much neutral
5311840 is it obvious energy stocks should be bought on this correction in oil prices from 147 to 123 a correction that has wiped 25 points off the prices of companies like xto energy and chesapeake energy in just a few weeks
5311841 i do think some things are obvious the credit crisis will end the housing crisis will end and credit markets will function satisfactorily and house prices will stop going down and then start moving higher it is obvious that the us economy already the most productive in the world will get even more productive and will adapt and grow it is obvious stock prices will be higher in the future than they are now
5311842 if you have been a deep value investor over the past 12 months you would have lost a lot of money on a five year view it might be the place to be but on a one year view who knows so i am sitting on the fence a little
5311843 i recall m amp g in the early 1990s they had a really bad time but once we were out of the erm exchange rate mechanism there was a bounce and suddenly they were at the top again
5311844 if we thought we were seeing a bottom we would go into deep value it is not yet a drop in the oil price would be helpful and we have got to get the bottom in the us housing market because until you have had that there will be no stability in the us financial system
5311845 if value does come back into play i would look at henderson equity income and the lowland investment trust fidelity special situations would also suit a value investor as would jupiter uk
5311846 our fund we launched at the end of april has a growth bias partly because value had led the way for much of the previous six years growth tends to work late in the cycle because investors are prepared to pay for the reliability of earnings there has been a market switch to large cap growth since the financials fell out of bed growth funds include liontrust first growth and nigel thomas axa framlington fund if you are looking at value calls i would look at jupiter global financials artemis income and henderson uk equity income the market is very painful and in panic mode and it is not time to go value yet but to be extreme underweight value is not sensible just know there is a change ahead it is a question of when
5311847 style is a big driver of return we dont have much value in our portfolios but we are not saying that would change a lot of banks would be classified as value and we couldnt see why we should hold them we like liontrust first growth and blackrock uk alpha if i was looking at an equity income fund i would look at threadneedle equity alpha managed by leigh harrison as it is less deep value than its peers if value came back into play i would look at psigma equity income fund and new star uk growth which was massively overweight banks
5311848 you only have to look at europe to give you an indication of how value versus growth has changed direction or large versus small cap for that matter
5311849 there is no doubt where the value is over the longer term but the same cannot be said over one three six months or a year
5311850 we need clarity before we make the jump to value if the price of oil falls below 100 that will be significant that is when the likes of bill mott at psigma income will come into his own i do believe there could be a champagne moment and when the cork pops markets will fly

5311863 an international security mission should be deployed to help protect civilians and create a safe environment for the displaced to return home and international organizations should also send fact finding missions to establish the facts report on human rights and urge the authorities to account for any crimes
5311864 on august 9 or 10 massive bombing started and the village administration building and a hospital building were destroyed bombing took place day and night it looked like they were targeting big buildings that could be housing the georgian military
5311865 during the bombing on august 9 my uncles neighbor was killed my uncle buried him in his backyard
5311866 we had to walk through the woods to gori district villages and then our military helped us to evacuate when we were walking through the woods the bombing continued i had to lie in swamps and crawl for hours i was afraid to get up
5311867 there were five people in our car suddenly there was an explosion perhaps four or five cars were hit i saw that people were injured and killed there was blood
5311868 there were many wounded i had to decide who had better chances of survival and stuff them into the ambulance we buried the dead in the yards and fled the village
5311869 any comprehensive investigation takes time but we continue to gather information that points to indiscriminate attacks by georgias forces
5311870 during the shelling a grad rocket hit the house setting the roof on fire my father went outside to try to put out the flames and at that moment another rocket hit he was wounded in his thigh by a piece of shrapnel our mother dragged him to the basement and spent several hours trying to stop the bleeding but she had nothing to bandage the wound with he slowly bled to death in her arms
5311871 we all rushed to the basement but an elderly man some 80 years old who lived on the fourth floor didnt manage to make it to the basement in time his apartment was hit by a shell and caught fire when the attack was over we went upstairs and saw that the old man burned to ashes we buried his remains in the yard
5311872 have you been here the whole time during the shelling and everything we thought the civilians had all fled
5311873 we are not sure who managed to flee and who died the village is virtually deserted now it will take time to find out the exact extent of the losses
5311874 it is with great sorrow that we must announce this brave soldiers death as we offer our sympathies to this soldiers loved ones
5311875 we have the utmost respect and admiration for the isaf troops who operate in this challenging environment
5311876 were looking at critical infrastructure such as air traffic control things that can cause real harm to life and limb
5311877 the biggest cyber threats come from two types of group those who are financially motivated and pseudo or actual terrorists doing it for ideological reasons
5311878 of these two groups id say the financially motivated groups are better organized
5311879 its almost futile for any government to try and deal with cyber threats alone
5311880 in the cyber world there has to be engagement internationally to ensure regional security
5311881 we need to bring in not just states but the private sector and individuals as well
5311882 focusing on cyber attacks is important but its also important to look at overall awareness
5311883 so japanese industry is playing a strong role and were also promoting public private partnerships
5311884 between china and japan china and taiwan and between korea and japan there is a pattern with nationalism issues whenever we see these issues come up there is always a flare up in cyber attacks
5311885 the divisions we see in terms of economics and politics really do permeate down to cyberspace
5311886 a ttribution becomes really hard because even though an ip address may be in beijing that doesnt necessarily mean that it is a chinese citizen or military or government official sitting behind that keyboard
5311887 they have the same problem we do here with bots and malware
5311888 in japanese universities each school is its own fiefdom this is a problem
5311889 we need to continue education how many lawyers prosecutors and judges understand this subject we need to help the judges to understand these issues and maybe train legislators
5311890 judges need definitions if someone is going to find someone guilty of a crime you have to first have defined the crime
5311891 the international telecommunications union has been about the tech side but recently has gotten into the law side
5311892 the problem is when they talk about their work at meetings and conferences they talk in acronyms that only they understand theyre talking only to their circle so theres a problem of communication across disciplines
5311893 itu also has a working group putting together a standard on what cyber security is but i dont think theyve done it so the itu is putting the cart before the horse by holding meetings on cyber security and not defining what theyre talking about
5311894 australia is very very advanced they have laws and they have the tech side people
5311895 and korea is one of the leaders in this part of the world and they want to take a lead internationally
5311896 singapore has been very active in terms of training people and raising awareness
5311897 asian nations have started developing common capacities and are not just building links within the region but also looking outside the region
5311898 the thing with china is that it has a dilemma there are coastal provinces and some places inland that have developed but to expand this requires information flows
5311899 but unless they liberalize web access there will be bottlenecks which will also mean chinese companies will be disadvantaged
5311900 whatever you do for the least of my brother you do for me
5311901 you shall use as much force as you can gather to steal and take from anyone who works and you shall give that money to those who you personally like and who will vote for you
5311902 involved a complex restructuring which in practical terms is not achievable
5311903 we are pleased with all key operating indicators for the first six months of 2008 and the significant improvement over 2007
5311904 we are also seeing the trend towards adoption of multi mix r technology by our key oem customer base the technology mix of products we have in our backlog today is also encouraging as we have seen growth over the last several quarters in all our product types and a significant percentage increase for multi mix r
5311905 our military and space systems customers have brought new design projects to us that upon successful completion can translate into future production backlog
5311906 on the technology development side we have made significant progress in our characterization and implementation of bare die gan transistors in multi mix r amplifier applications allowing for high power and linearity in a very small footprint additionally development of certain design and manufacturing techniques in our multi mix r passive product line has given us the ability to meet tighter and more difficult specifications than ever before in a mass production environment
5311907 overall i am encouraged by the results we are reporting today we are extremely busy and there is much hard work ahead for us but based on the results of the last few quarters my confidence is high that merrimac is positioned for more positive results
5311908 our financial highlights include second quarter income from continuing operations of 439 000 or 15 per share orders booked for the second quarter of 2008 were 7 2 million orders booked were 15 4 million for the first six months of 2008 continuing solid second quarter end backlog of 20 1 million book to bill ratio of 1 16 to 1 for the first six months of 2008 working capital of 10 7 million and current ratio of 3 5 to 1
5311909 the lack of an unambiguous population policy reflects a lack of seriousness in promoting long term economic growth and poverty reduction
5311910 our studies show that if the philippines had followed the population growth trajectory of thailand between 1975 and 2000 the per capita income would have been at least 22 percent higher and there would have been 5 million less poor people

5311916 for all the elements in this film it is a terry gilliam picture and as much as you want a movie of his to be good you have to be careful
5311917 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5311918 i think the russians will pull out but will damage georgia strongly
5311919 georgia will survive but russia has lost its credibility in the eyes of the world
5311920 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5311921 i wouldnt say theres a humanitarian catastrophe but theres an urgent need for primary products
5311922 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5311923 today the shadow of dictatorship that has prevailed for long over this country that chapter has been closed
5311924 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5311925 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5311926 i pray the government stops this downward slide and takes the country out of this crisis
5311927 the crimes of musharraf against the nation against the judiciary against democracy and against rule of law in the country cannot be forgiven by any party or individual
5311928 that is a decision that has to be taken by the democratic leadership

5311940 an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
5311941 deep concerns about the news standards and level of objectivity
5311942 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they wanted to in that context
5311943 because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5311944 we are extremely disappointed to see that the level of objectivity at nbc news has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut john mccain
5311945 what happened last year with me and shilpa shetty is in the past and i am not proud of it
5311946 i know i have behaved wrongly but that was my yesterday today i have changed for the better and i am here to prove it i am determined to be myself and win everyones heart
5311947 lets welcome our next guest with the warmth that is our true indian tradition
5311948 there has been a curiosity factor about jade goody ever since her rivalry with shilpa shetty in uk last year and we thought she would make a good participant
5311949 i particularly hope he strengthens his economic message even senator obama can speak more clearly and specifically about the kitchen table bread and butter issues like high energy costs
5311950 its fine to tell people about hope and change but you have to have plenty of concrete pragmatic ideas that bring hope and change to life
5311951 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5311952 india is the cradle of the human race the birthplace of human speech the mother of history the grandmother of legend and the great grandmother of tradition our most valuable and most instructive materials in the history of man are treasured up in india
5311953 if you do not trust in god then we do not think of you as being one of us
5311954 i totally lack respect for any who fight and die for liberty and justice for all
5311955 i thought it was just tendons they get hyper sensitive leading up to the marathon i was icing it this week it didnt affect how i was training
5311956 it was a bit sore when i woke up but had no affect on my running it was tight most of way i felt a pop in my foot i couldnt stand on it
5311957 i didnt expect to be finishing the marathon in a bus
5311958 i was excited to get out i made my country proud and tried to win another medal as athletes we have ups and downs unfortunately you cant pick the days they come on
5311959 i had no idea what was going on with magdalena lewy boulet and deena
5311960 i was bummed to hear it didnt work out for them today
5311961 it was tough out there the lead pack kind of pulled away right after the half i just tried to relax and stay tough and run my own race i kind of thought more people would come back to me i didnt really end up passing that many people so im kind of glad i got a good start
5311962 as soon as i hit it it was hurting and it limited by training
5311963 the swelling is all gone theres just a bruise that prevents me from proper range of motion
5311964 i just wanted to make sure i took every single moment in and every single swim in every single moment with my teammates so i would remember them
5311965 to swim in the same era as him has been awesome

5311979 mccain will have problems getting a high turnout among those voters unless he finds some way to identify with them some way to make them think that a hes not connected to bush and b his economic plan is superior to obamas
5311980 john mccain continues to hear the concerns of rural families thats why he has made every effort to engage these voters on his plans to create jobs and provide relief for working families
5311981 were getting a great response in rural communities that have been ignored by washington and left behind in the bush economy

5311992 its hard to tell numbers there will be some promotional efforts on our own channels but theres not going to be a massive promotional blitz its got to take off on its own its an experiment
5311993 eu via o pessoal saindo desesperado at a rua para atender o celular porque n o queria que a mulher descobrisse que ele estava em um bar

5311997 im ready hes ready its time to showdown and throw down
5311998 hes going to bring his a game and so am i its going to be a dogfight let the best man win
5311999 there are other athletes out there that can run just as fast as we can you saw that in the first round with a lot of 44s it looks like its going to be a fast final
5312000 i feel that eight of the best in the world are going to line up in the finals and you cant county anybody out
5312001 i train to win and when i do win i get a big confidence boost but when i dont do so well it motivates me also every time when i get off the track i am hungrier than when i was before i got up there
5312002 i knew what i could do in the races i lost i didnt execute the right way thats all i have to do execute and ill be fine
5312003 i dont call him and say do you want to go here or go there but the respect is there
5312004 we know each others style hes a great athlete and he knows im coming he knows im great
5312005 hes not going to count me out and im not going to count him out neither of us are poor sportsmen we are both americans love and respect are there
5312006 it helps to have a competitor who runs just as fast and just as strong hes a great competitor
5312007 hes fierce and hes out there to win it helps me to go out there and work harder than what i would before just to stay on top
5312008 he has two injuries one to the leg and one to the foot
5312009 the one to the leg has been an accumulative injury for years but it was cured the major problem for his withdrawal is his heel i dont know when it was hurt probably six or seven years ago before athens the injury has been back and forth between intensive training and rest and this is the main problem
5312010 he only went out there to show off his shoes
5312011 i would probably ask to take a picture with him
5312012 and tell him good luck because im pretty sure he has a little bit of pressure on him as well
5312013 it is impossible to overstate the amount of pressure that liu xiang was under before he withdrew
5312014 the hopes of 1 3 billion chinese people were on his shoulders and quite literally weighing him down as a great runner not at his peak he had to choose between competing but not winning or withdrawing to save face
5312015 chinas nothing less than gold strategy and billion dollars of funding for athlete development have yielded olympic results but have also placed monumental pressure on chinese athletes to perform not just for themselves but for the nation liu xiang is a product of this system and may also prove to be its victim
5312016 other runners might have just given it their best shot like tyson gay but this was not an option for liu because of the broader set of circumstances
5312017 i feel very sad i really dont want to quit
5312018 we believe that a negotiated transaction with nuance would be the best way for zi corporation to maximize shareholder value and in particular to offer substantially superior value relative to any available alternatives
5312019 the nuance proposal does not recognize the full value of zi
5312020 perplexing and inappropriate given the compelling premium our proposal represents to zis market price and the liquidity opportunity it will create especially in light of the disappointing financial performance and cash outlook zi reported last week
5312021 however nuance would welcome and believes it is incumbent upon zi to provide any additional information that supports the zi boards contention that nuances proposal does not fully value zi corporation
5312022 its been nothing but an upwards rollercoaster its been nothing but fun
5312023 when so many people say it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination
5312024 without the help of my relay teammates this wasnt possible
5312025 the teamwork we had is the difference in it all
5312026 it shows when you set your imagination to doing something anything can happen
5312027 not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympic athlete of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
5312028 she said that looks cool i want to do that
5312029 when youre back in your room and you try to sleep and youre lying there and you think about all the dreams and the aspirations for the last 12 years you get to the point where you go over what happened
5312030 we look at michael phelps and were so happy with what he achieved
5312031 but you look at alicia and she ends up almost being like the goat of the olympics thats a tough thing to handle
5312032 the judges hold back scores because of what might come later
5312033 when she lands on her knees she should get more of a deduction
5312034 it was really stressful but it was a great learning experience
5312035 this will be a showcase bioenergy facility which harnesses a variety of green technologies in a project of an unprecedented scale it is without question the right way forward in terms of environmental benefits and secures the long term sustainability of our operation moving the site away from reliance on fossil fuels
5312036 we now have a shot to play for a gold medal
5312037 that was the focus of today the germans have stood in our way the last two major championship from us advancing into medal rounds so there was a little payback as well
5312038 and now were two games away from a gold medal its a huge accomplishment for these guys
5312039 when i came on board it was as close to a dysfunctional family as you could find
5312040 wed been through three coaches in three years there were a lot of individuals a lot of good pieces but they just didnt believe in themselves and they werent really a team
5312041 so to witness and just be a part of how far these guys have come it gets me in my heart seeing how much they believe now that they can beat anybody in the world
5312042 its huge its magnificent to see the human spirit and how much a team can come together
5312043 the referees didnt want to give us a chance to win the game
5312044 i think it is a fair decision and we should just accept it
5312045 they hold a lot and if we could drive and move and get open we could open up some of those things one of our biggest things was to be mobile
5312046 when we scouted germany we knew they were a bit slower than some teams so we knew we could get some of those quick passes in there and we put them away
5312047 continued enhancement to the popular htx specification reflects the consortiums commitment to lead in the support of compute intensive applications and system development
5312048 applications such as financial processing real time data analysis and hpc server clustering continue to drive the need for higher performance solutions and will be enhanced by the low latency and performance headroom delivered by htx designs the htx3 specification embodies the on going learning that the consortium continues to gather from its large membership and extended product ecosystem
5312049 our recently announced stratix iv family of fpgas was designed from the start to support ht3 0 and will enable strong performance for htx3 board designs
5312050 let me go back over what we just talked about
5312051 is it still a long way to go to the ovaries cause i am knackered
5312052 well still quite a way to go we only just passed the tonsils

5312054 it will take away a symbol of hatred but the essential issues dont end with musharraf
5312055 its a virulent cancer that is eating into our society
5312056 the terrorists are not going to surrender they have long term objectives in the region
5312057 this is a positive change but it is just the beginning
5312058 if the government ends these policies the taliban will stop their activities immediately
5312059 he should also be awarded strict punishment because he is a culprit of the whole country
5312060 its one of those things that are more complicated than it seems at first blush said allen fishbein director of housing and credit policy for the consumer federation of america
5312061 consumers have to make sure they understand the credit thoroughly
5312062 breaking the log jam of unsold homes is something we are very much behind
5312063 it will help chip away at inventory levels stabilize prices and spur sales activity
5312064 buyers flocked to market and cleared out a then record inventory of homes
5312065 the 7 500 reserve will make borrowers less likely to fall into default
5312066 its not going to provide first time home buyers with cash up front
5312067 you have to apply to get the credit after the fact theres a delay before you get the financial advantage
5312068 consumers have to have their eyes open open about how this works
5312069 given the economy it will only push a precious few first time home buyers over the edge right now
5312070 we believe there is no better person to now lead first marblehead than our co founder dan meyers
5312071 dan provides extraordinary strategic market and product leadership and is uniquely qualified to guide the company through this challenging operating environment
5312072 as long as we have a common ground that is where we have to meet
5312073 my heart really breaks when i think that all this killing took place without any judicial process and by our own forces
5312074 after the war even the slightest suggestion that your family had leftist sympathies would leave you open to hostility and hatred
5312075 there is proof that it was reported to the very top
5312076 us soldiers took pictures and reported back to their superiors
5312077 on two occasions my unit was told to collect suspected leftists from the police and we conducted group executions
5312078 but you have to understand the situation at the time our forces were in a very disadvantaged situation and cornered
5312079 that will hurt a lot of families who work in jobs that cant have a 4 day workweek as now they will have to find and fund more child care
5312080 i currently work a 12 hour work day which equals out to a 3 day week working 36 hours and a 4 day week working 44 hours which adds up to an 80 hour schedule the upside i get the same amount of days off the week i work 3 days i get 4 days off the week i work 4 days i get 3 days off i love my job
5312081 on the transcendent issues the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush
5312082 imagining and then fighting for and then working for struggling for what did not seem possible before
5312083 i just dont even know how he holds himself together
5312084 politics on the other hand is not something people usually enjoy so what do you do you make yourself more visible to the public in a more entertaining way
5312085 its nice to see a democrat blow something besides the election
5312086 we feel that these people in hollywood have made a fortune having a good time
5312087 people like to see them take a fall and get their comeuppance
5312088 neither mccain nor obama want to be seen as celebrities yet both of them are so what we have here is both hypocrisy and absurdity
5312089 mccain needs to paint obama as a harvard elite egghead celebrity
5312090 now he feels like hes ringing the pinball machine the last thing obama needs is to be seen in a photograph with a celebrity
5312091 adheres to the principle that sport is separate from politics and will surely not yield to political pressure
5312092 the location of the olympics is not determined by american laws
5312093 we are just so focused we want to defend our gold medal and each team is just one more step we have to climb to get to that podium
5312094 whatever we have when we play we feel like we are in it zone a lot we feel like were jelling were calm and were confident i guess thats our zone
5312095 watching him swim his gold medal feat the other night i took that in with me in this game today he came in so hard and was giving nothing for granted
5312096 he works his butt off and i respect so much the heart and soul in that guy
5312097 he is such a competitor with the drive that he has you get goose bumps thinking about somebody who wants something so bad and you know he wanted it all the work and the tears and the sweat that he has put into this to see him succeed the way he has is incredible
5312098 people have just been really kind to us and to have people embrace me that day was just wonderful
5312099 we have fun out there and i think people kind of gravitate toward us
5312100 i was the only athlete but thats how it goes
5312101 when he walks down the street people say to him hey champ
5312102 when i was at my last olympics i had a teammate with me in yukio
5312103 but now its only me i just hope that i can have a good performance
5312104 hopefully i will get in the top 10 i think i will be all right
5312105 i was the one left behind to carry the flag
5312106 im third generation british i came to america because ive always wanted to come here and now theyve got me so scared that all i want to do is go home were paying for your stupid war anyway

5312113 you folks never let facts get in the way of a good story
5312114 technically the broader bearish head amp shoulders pattern in the wilshire 5000 remains in place thus the long term downtrend remains in place and all rallies are considered countertrend moves
5312115 moreover many indices have now returned to major overhead resistance levels that are consistent with a risk reward for returning to an aggressive short position
5312116 were going to a long energy position which we consider oversold while also taking a short position in financials
5312117 the bear stearns takedown marked the low for the financials in terms of market cap at 270 billion which was broken as concerns about fannie and freddie came to the forefront
5312118 now with the rules having been taken off we find goldman sachs and jp morgan under attack by downgrades and short selling
5312119 perhaps this will mark the highs in the big 19 and the financials in general certainly it removes a bullish floor from the financial stocks after such a larger run up thus we are sellers of the financials for at least a test of the lows
5312120 further we would look to be more overweight energy given the oversold condition as there is quite a bit of leverage in doing so given the enormous 6 week decline
5312121 the tactical move out of energy has been far overdone in fact we now see of the s amp p 500 stocks the financials have regained the lead in terms of market cap for all of the s amp p 500 at near 15 as they have rallied sharply recently whereas the sharp decline in energy has pushed the percentage to 12
5312122 during the early 1980s we saw energy stocks make up about 22 of the s amp p 500 whereas recently the financials made up 22 before their fall from grace

5312156 i believe we must and will take the appropriate steps to ensure that does not happen

5312256 emis relationship with 30stm has been extremely rewarding and successful for both the band and the company the hard work of emis global team and of the band has resulted in sales of three million albums and singles multiple awards and a growing global fan base

5312283 the problem in applying stereotype threat to uk medical students is that the majority of ethnic minority medical students here are from south asian backgrounds and it is not fully clear whether negative stereotypes exist about that group
5312284 the aim of the study was to establish if negative stereotypes about that group do exist and thus if stereotype threat might be one reason that uk ethnic minority medical students are underperforming academically
5312285 the fact that these negative stereotypes exist raises the possibility that stereotype threat may be occurring
5312286 its clear from our results that more research needs to be done into the effects of stereotype threat in uk medical schools and in fostering positive educational relationships between all students and their clinical teachers

5312364 only five laboratories so far have been found to have spores with perfect genetic matches to those in the senate letters
5312365 the only site in the united states where weapons grade anthrax has been made in recent years
5312366 dugway is the only facility known in recent years to have processed anthrax spores into the powdery form that is most easily inhaled
5312367 army officials in washington said yesterday that fort detrick does not have the equipment for making dried anthrax spores
5312368 over the past several years the united states has embarked on a program of secret research on biological weapons even the clinton white house was unaware of their full scope the projects which have not been previously disclosed have been embraced by the bush administration which intends to expand them
5312369 t he need to keep such projects secret was a significant reason behind president bushs recent rejection of a draft agreement to strengthen the germ weapons treaty the 1972 biological weapons convention which has been signed by 143 nations
5312370 in my opinion there are maybe four or five people in the whole country who might be able to make this stuff and im one of them
5312371 and even with a good lab and staff to help run it it might take me a year to come up with a product as good
5312372 a startlingly refined weapons grade anthrax spore preparation the likes of which had never been seen before by personnel at fort detrick
5312373 it is extremely improbable that this type of preparation could ever have been produced at fort detrick certainly not of the grade and quality found in that envelope
5312374 able to narrow the focus even further exclude individuals and that left us looking at dr ivins
5312375 we now have the ability to purify to one trillion spores per gram

5312386 sonian was looking for both cost effective and scalable computing power that reduced time to market for their digital content archiving offering
5312387 having the vertica analytic database available on demand in amazon ec2 enables software as a service innovators like sonian to give customers faster more affordable and more scalable access to business analytic data
5312388 sarbanes oxley and other federal and industry mandates are going to continue to drive the need to effectively archive digital content
5312389 so we knew we were going to need a cloud database that not only delivered fast query response but also easily scaled to meet demand the vertica analytic database for the cloud was the obvious choice it offered unbeatable performance with no administration overhead and will scale within the cloud as our customer base and their archives grow
5312390 sonian is a progressive company that knows the significant potential that cloud computing presents
5312391 by combining affordable flexible digital archiving with scalable hyper fast querying against enormous databases sonian is providing a remarkable security and compliance solution to its customers together sonian vertica and amazon give companies confidence that they will find the answers they need on demand

5312398 personalising content and delivering relevant advertising online will only succeed for consumers and for advertisers if it is done in a trustworthy and transparent manner
5312399 in addition business and government will need to offer approaches recognising that at certain times personalisation and data use will be welcomed and in other cases users will demand limits on the use of their data

5312403 the rents are certainly much more attractive than they are in red hook dumbo or long island city
5312404 an artists community is evolving here because artists enjoy being in quiet places and there are no distractions here
5312405 the area is considered to be one of the last enclaves of working small industrial businesses and is very likely to stay industrial for the foreseeable future
5312406 unlike neighborhoods like dumbo and williamsburg where residents and artists moved into vacant dilapidated loft buildings most buildings in the area are small one or two story garage warehouse buildings and the vacancy rate is very low
5312407 we want to ensure that artists have a long term space in a place thats undergoing gentrification
5312408 these guys are a waste of our taxpayers money and should never have been brought over
5312409 hey i dont get you people the people on insanely mac were so much nicer
5312410 the latter group women who did not take maternity leave is significantly more likely to have been promoted by june 30 2007
5312411 the figures may also be distorted by the possibility that women having children are at a relatively more senior classification already and simply have less scope for promotion
5312412 having a child brings a great opportunity cost to their career
5312413 i think it is certainly concerning that women are being discriminated against because of their family situation
5312414 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5312415 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5312416 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5312417 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5312418 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5312419 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5312420 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5312421 democrats face a number of imperatives at their convention none trickier than making more voters comfortable with the prospect of putting a candidate with a most unusual background the son of a black kenyan father and a white kansan mother who grew up in hawaii and indonesia and his family in the white house no one his advisers believe makes the case better for senator barack obama of illinois than his wife who will expand her profile by delivering one of the marquee speeches carried by television networks
5312422 the introduction of a candidate is a task facing every presidential campaign but one that carries unique challenges for mr obama because of his race and questions about his patriotism values and faith that republicans have already vigorously sought to raise and exploit
5312423 as solzhenitsyn stared at the cross drawn in the dirt his entire perspective changed he knew he was only one man against the all powerful soviet empire yet he knew there was something greater than the evil he saw in the prison camp something greater than the soviet union he knew that hope for all people was represented by that simple cross through the power of the cross anything was possible
5312424 has gradually morphed from being about the humanity of the guard to being about the christian faith of the guard and john mccain
5312425 individuals arrested at the democratic national convention will be processed at an industrial warehouse with chain link cells topped by razor wire a facility some have compared to the u s prison at guantanamo bay
5312426 i am going to georgia this weekend to get the facts first hand and to show my support for georgias people and its democratically elected government
5312427 i look forward to reporting to my colleagues in the senate and on the foreign relations committee as well as the administration about what i learn
5312428 so much for hugging in church a fter praising the arizona senator as a genuine american patriot the democratic presidential hopeful got back to business methodically tearing into mccains health care tax and energy policies and criticizing his advisers
5312429 the illinois senator also criticized mccains advisers as the same old folks that brought you george w bush the same team he noted many had been lobbyists in washington before mccain asked them to sever all lobbying ties
5312430 new voters alone wont win virginia for obama democrats say but they are a central reason obama has decided to put so many resources into a state that last went for a democratic presidential nominee in 1964 pennsylvania historically a battleground state has just 45 000 more registered voters than it did in 2004
5312431 if this were an election in a neutral environment gordon smith would probably win fairly easily but its just very toxic for republicans
5312432 it will have more to do with the shadow of president bush than the coattails of barack obama
5312433 for a meeting with steve capus the president of nbc news to protest what the campaign called signs that the network is abandoning non partisan coverage of the presidential race
5312434 the trigger was a comment by nbcs andrea mitchell who said on the air sunday that some aides to democrat barack obama thought mccain might have been listening saturday as obama was being questioned during pastor rick warrens
5312435 cone of silence the mccain campaign says the candidate did not hear any of the obama warren exchanges angellight sent monday august 18 2008 9 47 am
5312436 one other thing the fact that mccain wasnt in a
5312437 yes yes and find bad teachers another line of work
5312438 gone through the clinton administration and the bush administration and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are gonna regenerate and they have not so its not surprising then that they get bitter and they cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations
5312439 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
5312440 the insinuation that hillary clinton a woman cheated is outrageous
5312441 the insinuation that barack obama a black man cheated is outrageous

5312489 this is by no means an ozzfest but the live performance is really becoming a big part of everybodys life the fans and the bands its a healthy situation put the right package together and people will come its very important we work with promoters and keep music alive we all know about the free music downloading thats been pretty crippling to say the least it is a big worry for new bands moreso than anything else for new bands to get signed its virtually impossible because the record companies dont have the funding were better off than most because people still buy our records but for new bands younger bands their material just gets downloaded its just really really tough so how do we turn it around its going to be difficult but the main thing is we keep music alive thats what is important and thats why bands are working together promoters to try and make it all work and its looking pretty healthy this time around in north america we just wanted to put together as good a package as we can for people just for once we wanted to put a good classic line up together and have a really good tour some times weve gone out with younger bands on the bill and it hasnt been the best marriage its great to give an introduction to new bands all the festivals we are doing in europe there are tons and tons of new bands we just wanted to have a really good metal tour

5312516 and burst into tears he did however accept his fate with dignity and after he was found guilty said
5312517 masters all i am come hither not to preach a sermon but to die as the law hath found me and to the law i submit me
5312518 trust in god and not in the vanities of the world for if i had so done i think i would not have found myself here before you condemned to die
5312519 on the basis of only one woman you are willing to believe this great evil of me and on the basis of her allegations you are deciding my judgment
5312520 he does seem like a person who would be very trustworthy a very devoted person
5312521 probably faster than he did katherine and anne considering that jane was not as educated or as well read as henrys first two wives the one thing she would have had going for her besides having a son is that henry was getting too old for his famous sexual romps just getting the wife pregnant had become more of an ordeal for him
5312522 i have missed a few episodes a couple from the end of last season and the first few from this season this character is a man he is by queen anns side when she confesses her jealousy in the kings lovers he comforts her tells her he loves her and kisses hugs her please answer me this question anybody how does he fit in i guessed he was her brother but i cant remember what her brother looked like
5312523 one of the things i wanted to briefly talk about is the recent changes in the kansas open meeting law
5312524 anytime you have a meeting whether its face to face or e mail it is subject to the open meeting law that includes what is called a serial meeting
5312525 now thats always been in violation of the kansas open meeting law
5312526 weve had some concerns so now we have new language that simply states we cannot have a serial meeting in which any members participate in something that requires any action
5312527 that may be talking face to face or simply forwarding e mails you need to be very cautious of that you may be a recipient of a serial meeting and not know it
5312528 the person youre talking to may have sent e mails to other people that you dont know about
5312529 as you know intentions are incredibly hard to prove but the burden is on the board of education
5312530 technically you can have a serial meeting if you inform every member of the meeting
5312531 we are pleased that arcsoft has received certification for dts surround sensation
5312532 we are delighted to add arcsoft to the growing list of licensees for surround sensation and look forward to future collaborations and continuing our very successful relationship with them
5312533 if you guys are going to run stuff and run every lie under the sun have somebody stand up for somebody
5312534 im sorry that the storys not interesting but its about time that somebody stands up for that girl and i think shes great
5312535 the most normal thing in the world theres no lying theres no cheating theres no nothing
5312536 why are you asking me that question im being as honest as i can possibly can be
5312537 i ended a relationship because there is no lying i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right i dont waste peoples time
5312538 i guarantee you that 20 percent of the people on this street right now who are in a relationship wish they could get out but they dont know how and im going to be honest on the way in to my relationships and im going to be honest on the way out of my relationships
5312539 maharashtra tamil nadu and karnataka generate over 25 000 tonnes of e waste per day through various industrial activities and dump around 50 percent of it at different places in delhi particularly at turkeman gate shastri park loni seelampur and mandavali
5312540 the e waste sent to mumbai chennai bangalore mostly makes its way to delhi as there is a ready market for glass and plastic in the ncr national capital region in fact wastes from mumbai constitute a bulk of the 60 70 tonnes of discarded electronics that land in delhis scrap yards everyday
5312541 shes taught me lessons about myself and i feel like ive taught her
5312542 weve both changed and grown and we just feel like oh okay this is completion
5312543 if you guys are going to run stuff and run every lie under the sun have somebody stand up for somebody have me as a man who ended a relationship stand here and write some truth have me stand up for somebody and write that jennifer aniston is the smartest most sophisticated person i think ive ever met shes one of the most lovely people ive ever met in my life and im going through something thats a very personal thing and you have to give that up you have to give everything up because you cant have it all and it sucks im sorry that the storys not interesting but its about time that somebody stands up for that girl and i think shes great i ended a relationship because there is no lying i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right i dont waste peoples time

5312546 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5312547 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5312548 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5312549 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5312550 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5312551 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5312552 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5312553 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
5312554 these battles are the white mans and the whites will fight them out

5312562 were growing at a rapid pace and our existing reconciliation methodology is no longer efficient in terms of time labor and control
5312563 with the aim and potential to double in size in the next few years we wanted a scalable solution that will grow with us as well as one that will streamline daily reconciliations speed the identification of exceptions increase resolution efficiencies reduce operational costs and help us improve reporting and gain greater financial controls
5312564 there are three women who are the most beautiful in the world two of them are with me right now i do not need to look anywhere else
5312565 i enjoy working at the community level to prevent the further spread of invading species into our valuable lakes rivers and streams and keep other invaders from even getting a foothold
5312566 other communities have recognized quality of life to be equally important to economic development sault ste marie must follow suit
5312567 other communities such as timmins on and thunder bay on are working to empower the youth build them and support them as future leaders these communities understand that it is the youth who are their communitys future and that by investing in them and understanding their issues they are investing not only in the well being of their children but in the future prosperity of their communities
5312568 the future skateboard park is one of the only recent examples of the community forging ahead for the social cultural development of its youth this initiative has taken years of perseverance from the youth and those acting on their behalf just to be established as a possibility blind river on has had a small skatepark in operation since 2002 which has been enjoyed by local youth and supported by the community sault ste marie must not follow the proactive initiatives of such communities as blind river on but it must surpass them
5312569 it is the quality of life that often is the deciding factor for new businesses to establish in a community an investment in quality of life development can lead to economic development
5312570 our youth can either be the future of this community or the future of someone elses

5312574 what is it its the new camaro thats what it is
5312575 the new camaro well it accelerates like its being chased by the hounds of hell hey i can relate but enough about my love life
5312576 its a whole new kind of car for a whole new kind of people who really dig driving
5312577 its not how young you are its how old you arent
5312578 while the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5312579 no that is not the case the 1970 camaro is in fact the first of the second generation camaros there might be some parts interchangeability with the 69 camaro but a 1970 camaro has more in common with a 1981 camaro or a 1976 nova platform wise than it does with a 1969 camaro
5312580 the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5312581 your point seems to be that they are basically the same car and then you try to explain it away by saying that you meant that they were both f body cars

5312586 you can make these up to one week in advance
5312587 as discussed on friday given the passage of time we have to validate the assumptions used in the model to support our offer price of 25 74 per share in cash in addition we no longer believe we can integrate take two ahead of the important holiday season accordingly we require due diligence to support a transaction and are therefore letting the tender offer expire tonight
5312588 however we are pleased to accept your offer to review your management presentation as outlined in your letter we continue to have great respect for creative teams and products and are hopeful that we can work together to reach a mutually agreed transaction
5312589 the company has made significant strides since ea first expressed interest in the company and this presentation includes material non public information to which you would not otherwise have access including information relating to our three year product release schedule and managements financial projections the presentation also includes information about the underlying factors that have driven our strong operational and financial performance i believe our presentation will enable you to understand better the value of our company to ea
5312590 i hope that in the future the qt port will be a toplevel supported gecko port alongside gtk2 win32 and osx but theres still a bunch of work needed to make that happen
5312591 currently we cannot make a full featured and integrated browser with webkit in mobile but with mozilla we do not need to do anything we can take existing models and apis which are available also npapi support is already in the gecko web rendering engine they are also concerned that webkit is to some extent controlled by apple who are in competition to nokia with their iphone

5312597 googles goal here is to really see more people having access to the internet
5312598 other than burney all of the rest of them are basically unknown commodities
5312599 jordan hemby has never really ever played in a game and johnny white and richie rich are new to the position so theyre battling to compete right now were still a ways from naming starters
5312600 saturday was his actual first full practice in almost a week
5312601 so hopefully as he gets back into the mix hell be competing with the rest of those guys to start
5312602 if theres been one really right spot with our corners in the struggle to figure out who the starters are going to be its that they have tackled really well
5312603 johnny white had some outstanding tackles on saturday richie rich has had some good tackles jordan hemby is not very big probably weighs 185 but hes very very fast and he will come up and put his face mask on the ball i would say that at least two of the fumbles that were forced were caused by the secondary tackling
5312604 tavorris is one of those players that maybe the light is coming on
5312605 sometimes guys kind of languish in a little bit of ambiguity early in their career not knowing exactly how to compete and what to do and what it takes to win hes had a nice camp so silently hes kind of put himself in that mix
5312606 i think t jolly has done a great job of coming up and playing
5312607 i was talking to offensive coordinator john shoop today about guys that were stepping up jolly and johnny white and jordan hemby as well coach davis talks a lot of junk for jordan so he makes jordan have to back it up out there sometimes
5312608 if he gets his hands on you then youre not going to escape him because hes faster than you
5312609 so its just a fact of him being so physical and that he demands receivers to make a move hes still got a couple of things that he has to tweak but we all do you cant coach speed and you cant account for it sometimes so if he lunges out when hes trying to jam someone they may beat him off the ball but he has the ability to catch back up with them
5312610 linus torvalds has given an interview to zdnet co uk about the
5312611 nonetheless torvalds said the patching process in linux was more about human interaction than a quantifiable set of steps such as those listed in official international standards processes
5312612 and it inevitably simply takes time to learn all the rules
5312613 als medewerkers deze professionaliseringsslag gemaakt hebben is het ook hun taak om thuiswerken binnen de organisatie voor het voetlicht te brengen
5312614 he gordon was an instigator of part of a chess club
5312615 he was one of the organizers of the first chess tournament theyve had several years
5312616 unbeknownced to him a disease slipped into his body he was unable to continue his education at butler which was his goal
5312617 one of his goals was that he still wanted that diploma from butler
5312618 i contacted the college dr vietti and others here at the college and butler takes the ball and runs with it thats why im proud to be an alumni i know butler is going to get things done and this means so much to his family
5312619 these awards go out to teams that match their dedication to volleyball with their dedication to academics
5312620 next wed like to recognize more of our brightest and best
5312621 we have a grass roots organization in kansas called colleague to colleague its a great organization for people to share their thoughts
5312622 i would also like to celebrate the leadership butler class of 2008
5312623 we would also like to draw your attention to those who participated in the 2008 association of kansas community college office professionals annual conference and ceu continuing education units recipients
5312624 storm water is a very important issue for us and we want to work with the u s federal highway administration to get it resolved
5312625 it usually goes up 2 or 3 percent but during the last six months things have really increased and our overall food budget has gone up 12 to 18 percent
5312626 but we also try to watch where its going and evaluate our purchases
5312627 the one in buhl is really handing out a lot of food
5312628 they are using about as much as we are in twin falls
5312629 the prices of the meals dont go up during the term of the contract
5312630 sometimes we dont know how we are going to keep everything going
5312631 at the current prices we will save nearly 3 000 a year in gas
5312632 fda is the government agency we rely upon to assess food contact products theyve assessed this issue in great detail and their conclusion is very reassuring
5312633 its ironic fda would choose to ignore dozens of studies funded by the national institutes of health this countrys best scientists and instead rely on flawed studies from industry
5312634 inconsistencies and inadequacies which limit the interpretations of the findings
5312635 for this to come out on a friday afternoon just before california takes action it definitely raises some eyebrows
5312636 there is no need for opec or the oil companies to help us out
5312637 every driver can affect change simply by easing up on their right foot
5312638 the public isnt real excited about going back to a 55 mph national speed limit
5312639 all we would do by establishing another national speed limit is we would generate a lot of tickets a lot of insurance surcharges and give a little boost to the radar detector industry
5312640 saved up to 4 000 lives per year from highway accidents
5312641 the whale is closer to the kattegat a passageway to the north sea and therefore closer to its usual summer habitat the nutrient rich arctic waters
5312642 a religious war going on in our country for the soul of america it is a cultural war
5312643 illegal and they were ordered by rebel leaders to vacate the areas they attacked
5312644 when i was 13 years old the brother of one of my best friends was just about to sign a professional contract with leyton orient and he was walking down the street one afternoon when he saw a fight break out
5312645 he went over to help and ended up getting stabbed in the back and was paralysed
5312646 its been going on for a long time no one wants to see the devastation my friend and his family went through
5312647 as a parent of course you dont expect to pack your kids off to school in the morning and never see them again this campaign is very important it is something that us as footballers can help with
5312648 weve got a voice and weve got a voice that kids listen to its important that we get involved in this its so important that we believe that things can change
5312649 i have three teenage children living in london when i was there and and went to parties it was all right as long as you didnt come back too late and were in a sober state
5312650 nowadays your kids go out and you are fearing that they might come back hurt or damaged or worse
5312651 when we were growing up we all had releases in sport which meant we could focus on something and not get bored too many young people are bored and this is where the problems start
5312652 if someone thinks they are going to go to prison for a year or two of their young lives it might make them think twice about carrying a knife in the first place
5312653 some young people may think that carrying a knife makes them safer in fact the opposite is true if you carry a knife you risk it being used and possibly against you
5312654 it doesnt have to happen families grief doesnt have to happen and communities shouldnt have to live in fear
5312655 whether i win or lose the impeachment the nation will lose
5312656 not a single charge in the impeachment can stand against me
5312657 no charge can be proved against me because i never did anything for myself it was all for pakistan
5312658 maar jong we zaten daar echt volledig alleen in een huisje in de bergen en sch n ge kunt u dat niet voorstellen
5312659 it will make it such a heightened experience for the audience and for us to cast a real life soldier a veteran and bring him into our created drama
5312660 the audience embraces it because they relate to the people involved who they care about
5312661 its a very delicate subject to begin with theres so much about the individual person thats going to help us create the character and whatever they bring and whatever their challenge is will be fit into the story
5312662 this disastrous proposal makes about as much sense as eliminating homeland security at airports
5312663 sure it would make air travel more convenient but it would put passengers at greater risk just as this proposal would put wildlife at greater risk
5312664 he was on the horns of a dilemma and he finessed it
5312665 such action necessary to ensure the actions authorized funded or carried out by them do not jeopardize the continued existence of endangered species
5312666 the proposed regulations will continue to protect species while focusing the consultation process on those federal actions where potential impacts can be linked to the action and the risks are reasonably certain to occur the result should be a process that is less time consuming and a more effective use of our resources
5312667 thats a waste of time that stops positive things from happening on the ground
5312668 dirk kempthorne as governor as senator and as interior secretary has always stood for incentive based moderate approaches to protecting species
5312669 now is a terrific time for renewables to launch i hope they get all the capital they need and all the great minds and talent but i dont want it to come at the expense of the oil and gas industry
5312670 as goes colorado so goes the west as far as this energy policy debate
5312671 the future in colorado is building wind farms in wheat fields
5312672 quite frankly its how we should have been thinking for 10 years
5312673 i have a lot of hope that we are going to outshine north america and be kind of that catalyst that will take everybody to the next level of thinking
5312674 we share a lot of our information with certain developers in town that really want to get into this
5312675 people grab onto this thing leed they start talking about things being a leed building and the general consensus is its a positive thing
5312676 and its a very good thing its being talked about is it a marketing tool yes but i think if that raises the level of awareness and people then proceed and do things better the next time round then its good news
5312677 you can assume that each 5 mph you drive over 60 mph is like paying an additional 0 30 per gallon for gas
5312678 are trying to turn an energy shortage into an asset
5312679 i get rewarded for how hard i work and for how smart i work
5312680 its amazing how fast the technology is changing the way we work
5312681 basically you can log on anywhere you have internet access
5312682 these guys at fwp can sit in their office sit in their truck and watch video of the trap site
5312683 this knowledge contributes to our ability to move the bear in a timely manner
5312684 this bear stuff its just the tip of the iceberg
5312685 we have a fish cam up in condon and a bird cam that uses voice recognition software to tell you which birds are singing in the area
5312686 in the past youd be after a particular grizzly but youd catch three or four black bears maybe a male grizzly or two before you got the one you were after
5312687 were really experimenting with new ways of looking at animals on their turf
5312688 its a real future consideration this technology is very cutting edge so who knows whats possible
5312689 can really serve as a viable park on its own
5312690 i would be a mistake for israel to surrender even an inch of territory
5312691 i dont know what my parents were thinking at the time
5312692 but i spent the summer there with a friend from school and it was one of my most wonderful experiences
5312693 i see the idea of israel giving up land as israel surrendering security and a sovereign country just does not do that today
5312694 walking the streets of jerusalem with a great friend like mike huckabee
5312695 israel is the only true democratic state in the middle east and a country whose citizens share the values and priorities of american citizens
5312696 we can understand and relate to one another we share many priorities and have many common interests
5312697 i may have been the first of the candidates to talk forcefully about our need for energy independence and i was the first to say that the way things were going our economy was in trouble
5312698 several years ago we tried to do the plastic or aluminum recycling but people werent as educated as they are now it just plain didnt work
5312699 now so many more people are aware of it that they will look for the bins to drop items in
5312700 because were a fair we like things bright and shiny lights running and colorful
5312701 a lot of them used to just leave them running all night because it looks nice
5312702 we still had to use regular electricity to work the fans the misters to keep all the animals cool
5312703 its hard to go completely green but thats not to say that little things cant be done here or there
5312704 if we can find suitable habitat they will allow us to relocate were hiring a consultant to help us find sites and to help us with our options
5312705 the public would like to see the relocation option as a last resort and we would too
5312706 the food donated by a store stays in the specific community it was donated in
5312707 right now we are trying to seek funding for a second truck
5312708 theyre trying to reduce their costs for dumping waste at landfills and also reducing what theyre putting into a landfill
5312709 i want to get a little fresh air and exercise and cut my carbon footprint and spend less money on gas and where i live i can ride my bike seven months out of the year
5312710 fifty percent of that increase is probably because of gas prices and the rest is that theres just more bikes out there
5312711 when i started there was only one bike that had a nickel metal hydride battery everything else was lead acid and was 80 or 90 pounds
5312712 a year ago when you mentioned the word electric bike people looked at you and they really werent sure what it was
5312713 today what were finding is were actually having dealers call us seeking an electric bike to meet the demand
5312714 the public at large needs to understand that it is the right thing to do to move to electric transportation and electric bikes and electric scooters will allow you to do that to get that familiarity
5312715 are we going to get back to the importance of supreme court justices
5312716 go back to your cell its going to be very tough on you now
5312717 cheating at saddleback mccain appparently knew question about supreme court in advance
5312718 a retirada das for as de paz russas foi iniciada nesta segunda feira

5312720 n s pedimos a retirada das for as de ocupa o russas para que possamos come ar a refletir e negociar sobre como poderemos evitar a indiferen a entre nossos pa ses de forma definitiva
5312721 theres so much opportunity to accommodate new growth in areas like this and put together all the pieces that make a complete community
5312722 we really see in the development of the first street corridor how other counties and cities around the region could do in fill development
5312723 there are no cities in this region with the capacity for growth like san jose
5312724 we need to think carefully now about how we plan for it knowing that the suburban sprawl model is an environmental and fiscal dead end
5312725 when you have that type of density you make it a lot more friendly for walking
5312726 the decision was lets not build out anymore lets build up
5312727 proposed new land use development shall primarily serve the needs of existing residents and businesses citywide and regional needs are subordinate to existing local needs
5312728 the city is constantly tempted to turn its back on the region and only pay attention to protecting whos here now
5312729 the overriding environmental imperative of our age is to stop sprawl we do that by concentrating growth inside already urbanized areas
5312730 it gives us the opportunity to treat areas with natural fire that before we couldnt
5312731 right now these things are creeping around cleaning up those heavy piles of downed material its going to create more grasses its going to reduce the risk of losing those stands
5312732 more forests are creating their implementation direction so well see this tool in use on more forests in the future
5312733 uma meta que vamos perseguir sabendo que algo muito dif cil s v o estar nove na final vai depender do nosso desempenho e de alguma sorte na eliminat ria e semifinal em que calharmos vamos lutar em cada uma das provas e ver o que acontece
5312734 families are barely making it they cant even afford the basics for their kids
5312735 fda has concluded that an adequate margin of safety exists for bpa at current levels of exposure from food contact uses
5312736 fda is the premier agency responsible for the safety of our food
5312737 fdas thorough analysis confirms that food contact materials containing bpa can continue to be used safely
5312738 clearly their effort was to minimize people being concerned about this
5312739 it just seems that whenever there is an opportunity to look at a new important issue they just seem to be siding with industrys point of view
5312740 create more opportunities to experience nature in urban areas across the region improve our quality of life and enhance water quality and wildlife habitat
5312741 i really feel optimistic that well demonstrate some really good projects and get a huge bang for our buck
5312742 the national parks in general and glacier park in particular have become the poster child for climate change and that means they really are stepping up as leaders in both research and education
5312743 is were going to have to make new choices this is huge and rapid change far faster than we can account for through natural cycles and it leaves the mountain ecosystem very vulnerable
5312744 and its prompting the park to step up and lead by example
5312745 people want to know when the glaciers will finally disappear
5312746 but if the parks going to be an educator and not just the evidence then man theyd better have their own house in order before they take on that role
5312747 were definitely on the forefront in terms of education in the parks
5312748 climate change is the biggest challenge our land management agencies have ever faced
5312749 and glacier has become a real leader there are some really visionary thinkers in the park service and the hub for that thinking is glacier park
5312750 no beginning is too small and every individual makes a difference the problem we have now is that no single snowflake ever feels responsible for the avalanche
5312751 the best part of it is that its relatively cheap and it leads to a much more compelling pedestrian environment and real estate values go up because its permanent
5312752 critics say lets put in a dash system but a dash bus can always go away a streetcar if done correctly comes with landscaping shelters trash cans and because its putting eyes on the street it makes neighborhoods safer
5312753 i like that they understand the value and are willing to have free service in the downtown area theyve somehow learned that its not a subsidy its an investment
5312754 related to rabbits actually a pika would fit in your hand although he wouldnt stay there very long
5312755 thats the big story here i think that we dont have very good baseline data for most of the species in the park
5312756 because they just might be the canary in the coal mine to warn us about climate change
5312757 get a baseline sense of what defines suitable pika habitat and pika conditions
5312758 it could allow us to compare different kinds of sites so we can predict where to expect future declines
5312759 the entire park ecosystem is undergoing an incredibly rapid shift
5312760 and some species wont fare very well the first thing we need to be doing from a research standpoint is gathering this kind of baseline data because without the baseline you cant measure the change
5312761 personally i see it as an opportunity its an opportunity to make a real connection with the public and to educate them about science and how science works
5312762 i came to the birds nest to lay a golden egg and thats what i did
5312763 i am surprised we havent won more gold but you know what i hope this sets a trend
5312764 that the us could convincingly deny any involvement with the destruction it causes
5312765 further there would be no munition fragments that could be used to identify the source of the strike
5312766 this is a major step toward providing the ultra precision engagement capability that the warfighter needs to dramatically reduce collateral damage
5312767 bei far cry hatten wir jetzt die situation der ist also ab 16 und wir haben 2 einstellungen rausgenommen also ich nicht freiwillig aber eben aufgrund von voreiligem gehorsam so nach dem motto wenn die drin bleiben ist der film bestimmt ab 18 und dann m ssen wir nochmal zur fsk nehmen wir sie lieber raus

5312771 the idea that you just buy medical insurance on the one hand and invest in financial securities on the other will vanish
5312772 people estimate well lose half of the earths life forms in our lifetime
5312773 if you put yourself in the shoes of a poor government its hard to turn down the cash deal
5312774 its hard to put a value on these services thats what daily is trying to map out
5312775 that revolutionized the way we look at biodiversity and the consequences of the losses of biodiversity
5312776 the best way to overcome this problem is to drive up the worth of nature by increasing our appreciation for its greatest values its beauty its history its relationship to our biological and cultural histories
5312777 heres how i often think about it if you look at nature today its almost like an all you can eat buffet unless you set a price tag on the different things on the table people are going to go whole hog like we are now and eat all they can as fast as they can

5312832 they came close to elimination in the middle round and then came back and got back into contention for the medal round theyre beatable but not too often were hopeful that the other teams get better so that they have that chance of being up at the top
5312833 i cant really say that the best thing to happen is for them to lose its up to them they want to win we dont want to say that we want the u s to go out and lay down thats not fair to the athletes
5312834 by no means are we absolutely running over everyone i think people need to take notice of that more
5312835 theres no athlete in the olympic village on the planet that goes in hoping to lose would that help the cause who knows were going for a fourth gold medal

5312842 the historical data tell us clearly dont get too used to commodity export booms as any third world country will tell you they tend to go away pretty quickly
5312843 is that we have been able to greatly increase corn exports while also using it for ethanol only by increasing the acreage devoted to corn have we been able to do this and by squeezing down the use of corn for domestic livestock feed

5312868 we knew we were going to win but to actually do it while youre under a bit of pressure is just so great
5312869 we didnt realize what kind of time we had we thought we might beat the record but not by three seconds
5312870 we knew the gold wasnt ours by right and that we had to give our best performance
5312871 we gave 100 percent and thats what you get to me the medal is more important than the record

5312886 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5312887 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5312888 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5312889 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5312912 with this new process we are reducing the travel distance of a space vehicle from 12 000 feet to 10 000 feet
5312913 we are really excited about this new build process for space vehicles and its impressive results and our air force customer is pleased to have the gps spacecraft used for this new process
5312914 with 12 satellites on order the gps program is ideal for a manufacturing pulse line because similar satellites can easily adapt to a process that mirrors mass production
5312915 the value of a pulse line is that it increases efficiency and therefore enables us to reduce costs as we continue to simplify our satellite designs in order to standardize the items that are inherent in every spacecraft built by boeing the implementation of a pulse line will yield tremendous benefits in the areas of efficiency and cost savings

5312918 haimar is a perfect addition for our team hes a good time trialist can climb very well and will be an excellent all around teammate in the grand tours a rider like haimar who has finished in the top ten in numerous grand tours also has the ability to win some stages and races he may be a veteran but i think he has an exciting two years ahead of him with team astana
5312919 the astana team is the best stage racing team in the world ive always admired johan bruyneels teams and to race for him and the best riders is a special honor i am thankful for the past eleven years but im also excited for the new opportunities and challenges that lie ahead
5312920 we were even short handed for this race not having moises aldape so we lost a guy who could have been a real difference maker
5312921 jeff louder was a favorite because this is his state two years ago i probably cost him the race when i towed his teammate scott moninger to the finish line on the last day
5312922 this is what the olympics is about having extraordinary performances
5312923 its been incredible to watch and it has made a lot of teams sit up and take notice
5312924 even with half the budget they would still get the same results
5312925 weve kind of just been preparing for this all this year chris as well he knew he was going for three
5312926 i suppose you do get greedy in a way but its not wrong to be greedy when it comes to sport all along the focus has been three gold medals so if we came away with one each wed probably be a bit disappointed
5312927 there is definitely some significance to it perhaps we wont see it now but in the future it will carry some weight
5312928 i dont think theres another team in the world that would allow and promote and support these individuals to the level that they have attained
5312929 whether it be rahsaan bahati justin williams oscar sevilla tyler hamilton or kayle leogrande if it wasnt for the program we put together collectively they could not have had these results it is really really special
5312930 it was a huge relief to come across the line with my arms up
5312931 candelario hekman and i came into the last turn nascar style pretty much stacked three wide with me in the middle but once we got into the straightaway and i got the gear going i knew i had it

5312941 the latter group women who did not take maternity leave is significantly more likely to have been promoted by june 30 2007
5312942 the figures may also be distorted by the possibility that women having children are at a relatively more senior classification already and simply have less scope for promotion
5312943 having a child brings a great opportunity cost to their career
5312944 i think it is certainly concerning that women are being discriminated against because of their family situation
5312945 this doesnt happen very often where theres a tragedy like this and very famous very successful actors suddenly say ok well do whatever it takes to help

5312951 we are so impressed with fujikuras leadership position at the jeld wen as this continues to demonstrate how our shafts are trusted by players for their superior performance in the most demanding major championships
5312952 winning the driver count at these most important and challenging competitions continues to reinforce the power of our technology and teamwork by our tour representatives and our oem clubmaker partners
5312953 our team is thrilled with these outstanding 2008 results because these talented golfers on all tours have proven that precisely fitting shafts can improve performance in their most valued tournaments
5312954 were excited that these pros continue to demonstrate their confidence in the innovative material design and technology and superior performance of fujikura shafts when matched with our oem clubmakers
5312955 due to the incredible response we received when we first offered this value laden package weve brought it back so our guests can enjoy the nicklaus signature course from sun up to sun down

5313013 the mayor feels that the city can no longer afford to run a zoo
5313014 i agree its not a mission critical function for a city to run a zoo
5313015 well see whats out there where we could put them where they would fit in that will send a signal to the people that the zoo is in the process of renewing itself and worthy of their support
5313016 not all projects get funded every year but they get in a queue
5313017 so if the city came back in 2010 and said this is our top priority it is very likely that it would get funded
5313018 if that passes the zoo would get a dedicated amount perhaps more than 200 000 out of that every year
5313019 there is a shared feeling of disappointment that this has become necessary
5313020 but even as people share their disappointment the vast majority also recognizes the necessity for difficult decisions and hope by addressing these lingering issues head on that we will get to the point where the city will be more stable financially

5313050 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way

5313055 adding a thinner sentryglas helps us expand the range of applications we can serve
5313056 beyond storms people worry about intruders home safety and health and energy efficient living sentryglas can make a big difference in all these areas
5313057 laminators and window companies wanted a thinner grade of sentryglas to help replace thicker constructions using pvb
5313058 they report that more and more architects and engineers are asking for sentryglas and looking for thinner choices to meet a wider range of protection needs
5313059 i suspected something when i found the first bird in gabon since it didnt exactly match any of the species descriptions in the field guides
5313060 once i was able to compare them side by side to other specimens in our collections it was clear that these birds were special you of course have to be cautious but i was still very excited at the prospect of possibly having found a new species of bird
5313061 finding the olive backed forest robin strongly underscores the importance of our research this helps us show the conservation importance of the area
5313062 although finding an unknown species like the olive backed forest robin was not the goal of the mab project
5313063 it is definitely a reminder that the world still holds surprises for us
5313064 lobsters know when their shell is damaged and thats probably the reason when they have shell disease why they molt more quickly
5313065 but ultimately they still come down with the disease and we think the presence of alkyphenols contributes to that
5313066 plastics last a long time but breakdown products last even longer perhaps shell disease is only the tip of the iceberg of a more basic problem of endocrine disrupting chemicals in marine environments
5313067 we believe that the main function of the tree is to facilitate the flow of water from the ground and into the atmosphere
5313068 to achieve that function the tree is ideally designed to not only maximize the flow of water but in order to be successful in the real world it must also be able to withstand the stresses of the wind it is exquisitely designed to do just that
5313069 the tree is a physical flow architecture that has evolved to meet two main objectives maximum mechanical strength against wind and maximum access for water coming from the ground through the tree and into the atmosphere
5313070 in the larger sense the forest itself is a flow system with the same mechanical properties and functions as the individual tree facilitating the flow of water across the globe
5313071 winds come in many speeds but their ultimate effect is cutting off trunks branches and leaves so whatever is too long or sticks out too much is shaved off
5313072 so the pattern of the tree is the result of the never ending assault by the wind
5313073 if the purpose of a tree was not to transport water it would look like the eiffel tower
5313074 it looks like mr french engineer gustave eiffel without knowing it designed a structure that corresponds with our constructal theory
5313075 thanks net detective you saved my life if i hadnt found out about my girlfriends credit problems i might have made the biggest mistake of my life
5313076 as a private investigator with over 22 years experience i was very surprised to discover what a great asset net detective is for our business we can now locate hard to find information in minutes that used to take hours or even days
5313077 this is great just 30 minutes after purchasing net detective i had located my long lost college roommate and had her on the phone we talked for two hours we hadnt talked in 27 years i have been telling all my friends and they are amazed
5313078 i have been telling my friends about net detective i have also been snooping on my friends and they dont even know it i found out how much alimony and child support my next door neighbor gets and that my neighbor across the street has some big credit problems
5313079 marianne clewiston check out all of our new employees before we hire them using net detective i have made some rather startling discoveries one applicant was wanted by the fbi for embezzlement and he was applying for a job in our accounting department
5313080 i thought the entire process was very easy to work with

5313092 we welcome the fact that the veb uses the platform we offer our shareholders to discuss their ideas as that is what the information sessions are meant for
5313093 we appreciate the active involvement of the veb with regards to the points some of these are familiar to us some are good suggestions we can already discuss during the sessions and others will take some more time

5313097 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5313098 today the shadow of dictatorship that has prevailed for long over this country that chapter has been closed
5313099 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5313100 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5313101 i pray the government stops this downward slide and takes the country out of this crisis
5313102 the crimes of musharraf against the nation against the judiciary against democracy and against rule of law in the country cannot be forgiven by any party or individual
5313103 that is a decision that has to be taken by the democratic leadership

5313106 sesungguhnya rabbku hanya mengharamkan perbuatan keji baik yang tampak ataupun yang tersembunyi dan perbuatan dosa serta melanggar hak manusia tanpa alasan yang benar dan rabbku juga mengharamkan perbuatan syirik terhadap allah dengan sesuatu yang allah tidak menurunkan hujjah untuk itu dan mengharamkan berkata atas nama agama allah dengan sesuatu yang tidak kalian ketahui
5313107 dan berpegang teguhlah kalian semuanya kepada tali agama allah dan janganlah kalian bercerai berai hendanya kalian ingat akan nikmat allah yang dilimpahkan kepada kalian ketika kalian dahulu masa jahiliyah saling bermusuhan kemudian allah mempersatukan hati kalian lalu jadilah kalian dengan nikmat tersebut allah sebagai orang orang yang bersaudara
5313108 dan barangsiapa yang menentang rasul sesudah jelas kebenaran baginya serta mengikuti jalan yang bukan jalan kaum mu minin maka kami biarkan ia tersesat dalam kesesatannya kemudian kami masukkan ia ke dalam jahannam dan jahannam itu seburuk buruk tempat kembali
5313109 tidaklah beriman salah seorang di antara kalian sampai ia mencintai saudaranya sebagaimana kecintaan dia terhadap dirinya sendiri
5313110 demi dzat yang jiwaku ada di tangan nya sungguh kalian tidak akan masuk al jannah sampai kalian beriman dan tidaklah kalian beriman sampai kalian saling mencintai maukah kalian aku tunjukkan pada suatu amalan yang bila kalian melakukannya maka kalian akan saling mencintai tebarkanlah salam di antara kalian

5313137 yes dan radcliffe does have dyspraxia this is something he has never hidden thankfully his condition is very mild and at worst manifests itself in an inability to ties his shoe laces and bad handwriting

5313139 lets really allow the people of zimbabwe to determine their future
5313140 the gap between the parties is narrower points of disagreement are not so wide
5313141 the parties still are far from each other though on one point and that is the executive powers that should go to the president and the prime minister that is the stumbling block
5313142 though more research is needed these findings raise the possibility that flavanol rich cocoa products could be developed to help slow brain decline in older age
5313143 nab has not decided against using its staff in the process it is anticipated that nab will use a mix of internal and external skills
5313144 it recognises that well be rebalancing our investment between business as usual and nexgen and must therefore consolidate our capabilities to free up capacity to focus on the significant transition activity ahead
5313145 well continue to progressively evolve our model over time as we further progress our transformation agendas
5313146 nab has always used hosting and still uses a combination of hosting having some of our internal people host the platforms and develop the platforms and working with external suppliers
5313147 weve done that for the past 10 to 15 years and will continue to do that
5313148 it has been the major driver of growth and has far exceeded what we expected
5313149 its a great product from our point of view because its very difficult for the large carriers to respond as it directly affects their pstn revenues
5313150 with the acquisition now complete we expect it achieve 2 5 million in synergies over the next financial year
5313151 its going to be at least a year before a decision is made on the national network and the government doesnt want a capital expenditure freeze for three to five years
5313152 the only way telcos can operate at the moment is by assuming the status quo and then dealing with the changes as they arrive
5313153 realistically by the time the nbn comes and starts being built most of the transition growth from dial up to broadband will be done
5313154 at that point the major differentiator will be deliverable product service and brand perception
5313155 i took this picture a week ago the signs say the enclosure belongs to the and include the centers website at the time i wondered whether it would be stealing if someone were to come along and take a sheet or a few sections of fence and bring them home could it be considered abandoned property it would have been funny if whoever left it there came back and found people sleeping in it after all the location is public property
5313156 when we re evaluated our position we said ok we need to reboot the dell operating system so to speak with an upgrade mr dell said
5313157 there were things we needed to do around that so we launched several initiatives consumer enterprise notebooks small to medium business and perhaps one of the most important a new strategy for emerging countries we assigned leadership teams and made investments
5313158 we are doing things very very different and have increased our commitment to product innovation and thought leadership and we have enhanced that with some acquisitions you are seeing a new dell emerging here
5313159 if you look at our competitive advantage one thing that has not changed over this entire period is that dell learns a tremendous amount from the direct relationships with our customers and the conversations we have
5313160 now we have turbocharged that with the internet and blogs and wikis we have 2 billion conversations a year and that inspires us and we are using all that new information to verify our position and using that information to expand
5313161 i was the chief executive for the first 20 years i am still a relatively young guy so i will keep doing this for a while i am 43 years old
5313162 we make more revenue from our computer product than our nearest competitor so we are selling more valuable computers
5313163 during the past 10 years our company has grown its shipping volumes by about 10 times there is really no other company in the industry that has done that it is also true that there was period when our growth slowed down at the end of that

5313173 andrew brees time in the 200m breaststroke semi final last week would have won him gold at the barcelona olympics in 1992 but in 2008 it wasnt enough for him to even make the final the competition for global foreign direct investment is just as fierce
5313174 the results speak for themselves northern ireland students again dramatically outperformed their counterparts in last weeks a level results with almost 30pc achieving a grades while the england and wales average was closer to 20pc
5313175 this is disappointing in light of the fact that the recent engineers ireland salary survey has shown that graduates can enjoy a starting salary of as much as 31 000

5313201 three decades ago the soviet union tried to subdue a fundamentalist islamic insurgency in afghanistan by deploying 108 000 troops at the conflicts height in 1985 86 including special forces and substantial air power
5313202 the single biggest reason for the soviets failure was pakistan
5313203 and if washington isnt careful pakistan could have the same effect today
5313204 the u s led coalition has been in afghanistan for seven years there are now 70 000 coalition troops in the country including approximately 36 000 americans to date more than 800 service members have been killed and the numbers and pace of casualties are rising worse despite the presence of these forces and billions of dollars in western reconstruction aid the taliban seem to be getting stronger
5313205 there is no reason to believe that leadership is anywhere else but pakistan
5313206 every major attack in western europe foiled or successful in the last five years has been postmarked in pakistan
5313207 pakistan instead is completely absorbed in its own domestic political problems
5313208 the best way to think about this is to think of pakistan stuck in neutral its left the military dictatorship of the last decade it aspires or at least most pakistanis aspire to get something like democracy but in fact we now have a combination of both meaning we have really neither
5313209 north koreas program irans program libyas program and quite possibly a nascent saudi program all find their origins in pakistan
5313210 almost every bullet we fire every meal we eat comes via pakistan and the pakistanis know that
5313211 the bush mush entente as it is called in pakistan has alienated the vast majority of pakistanis
5313212 we have a huge catch up job to do here ironically even the pakistani army has no faith in us because they know that in the clutch we have consistently deserted them time and time again

5313221 given our nations current energy needs and long term goal of energy security it is imperative that that we pass a comprehensive all of the above solution to increase the supply of american made energy
5313222 residents of the first district are frustrated that congress failed to pass a comprehensive energy plan my constituents made it clear that they want me to be in washington on the house floor and i am here to take their message directly to speaker pelosi oklahomans want an open debate and vote on our nations energy future

5313244 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
5313245 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
5313246 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
5313247 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
5313248 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
5313249 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
5313250 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
5313251 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
5313252 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
5313253 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
5313254 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
5313255 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
5313256 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
5313257 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
5313258 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
5313259 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
5313260 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
5313261 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
5313262 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
5313263 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
5313264 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
5313265 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
5313266 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
5313267 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
5313268 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
5313269 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
5313270 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
5313271 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
5313272 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
5313273 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
5313274 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
5313275 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
5313276 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
5313277 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
5313278 various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting i have between two days and two months to live
5313279 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that

5313376 russias military says its withdrawal from georgia has begun but
5313377 instead of thinning out their forces in south ossetia the russians appear to have been consolidating their presence there

5313381 fay is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations of 4 to 8 inches over much of cuba with isolated maximum amounts of 12 inches these rains could produce life threatening flash floods and mud slides
5313382 heavy rains are expected to spread across south florida today storm total amounts of 4 to 8 inches with maximum amounts of 10 inches are possible for the florida keys and south florida rainfall accumulations of 1 to 3 inches are possible in northwestern bahamas
5313383 he would not have withdrawn unless the pain was intolerable
5313384 with cadets faculty and visitors working walking and parking near our missile display every day we cant risk anyones safety when there is even the slightest risk of collapse
5313385 under advisement of experts from the national museum of the air force and the academy memorial board our leadership has decided to permanently retire the missile
5313386 in the instance of the academy display it is very likely that significant concealed internal corrosion exists inside the missile shell despite the best of conservation efforts missiles were never intended to remain exposed to the elements for decades and therefore it is a prudent decision that the academy retire the missile from display
5313387 there was a lively debate a very intense stormy discussion
5313388 is the only one that can enable us to avoid being faced with an alternative that i call catastrophic an iranian bomb or the bombing of iran
5313389 the full participation of france in the structures of nato
5313390 its a very bush like vision very american with a new concept of national security it puts the entire defense sector in the hands of the president but also civil security and the police
5313391 i will make clear that we are not shirking our responsibilities for engagement but i will also make the limits very clear just as i have done with the current president
5313392 right wing leaders who appear to want to give putin the benefit of the doubt
5313393 the principal element the respect of the territorial integrity of georgia
5313394 russia will sooner or later have to pay a high price
5313395 one of the conditions of the coastal commission involves the subterranean parking garage where well have to dig out several thousand tons of dirt
5313396 the commission didnt want any of that dirt to end up in the creek so they said we have to wait until spring after the rains are over to start that
5313397 that will give us time to get everything sorted out and be ready to go
5313398 i think i have a better project today than i had before
5313399 the coastal commission staff in santa cruz did a fantastic job it was a very good experience dealing with the coastal commission i enjoyed it
5313400 id like to publicly thank the city council members for all their help
5313401 im looking forward to getting with them and getting it resolved
5313402 the assurance of gods ultimate justice then frees radical love now
5313403 it is only when gods wrath and vengeance are hanging as grim realities over the heads of ones enemies that something of what it means to love and forgive them can touch our hearts
5313404 i will never ever forgive that person is much like saying
5313405 chris brauns has done a magnificent job in helping us understand the true nature of biblical forgiveness every christian will profit from reading and applying this book
5313406 look at him hes single the right religion hes successful
5313407 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared

5313412 ti ricordo che quella che hai lasciato affondare sarebbe stata la nostra barca
5313413 noi avele tanti volele sbucciati volele anche glappa di lose
5313414 we created only 16 lots but it was a start
5313415 my greatest accomplishment and pride comes from watching others succeed at becoming all that they want to be in life
5313416 however we think it is more probable that sq372 comes from the inner edge of the oort cloud
5313417 over the last six years there has been a massive decline in housing affordability in this state
5313418 high interest rates and an extremely onerous set of local state and federal government taxes and charges on new housing continue to slug new home buyers
5313419 over the last year there has been a significant increase in the median house price while building and land costs arent going down
5313420 the housing sector is a key to population growth so its imperative we make sure sa retains an affordability advantage over the rest of the nation
5313421 the human brain is always trying to determine why things happen and when the reason is not clear we tend to make up some pretty bizarre explanations
5313422 christians and new agers paranormalists etc all have one thing in common a spiritual orientation to the world
5313423 i believe they do exist but im not sure about this
5313424 i guess we will find out if this is on the up and up
5313425 while it is difficult to know for certain the tendency to believe in the paranormal appears to be there from the beginning
5313426 what changes is the content of the paranormal for example very few people believe in faeries and elves these days but as belief in faeries faded other beliefs such as belief in ufos emerged to take their place
5313427 it is an artifact of our brains desire to find cause and effect
5313428 that ability to predict the future is what makes humans smart but it also has side effects like superstitions and belief in the paranormal
5313429 humans first started believing in the supernatural because they were trying to understand things they couldnt explain
5313430 its basically the same process as mythology at one point people didnt understand why the sun rose and set each day so they suggested that a chariot pulled the sun across the heavens
5313431 they didnt understand why a child was stillborn or why a drought occurred so they came to believe that such events had supernatural causes
5313432 all societies have invoked the supernatural to explain things beyond their control and understanding especially good and bad events
5313433 in many places even today people believe that disasters or bad luck is caused by witches or curses
5313434 i believe that new orleans had a level of sin that was offensive to god and they are were recipients of the judgment of god for that
5313435 paranormal beliefs are very strongly negatively related to religious belief
5313436 this may partly reflect opinions of christians in the samples who take biblical sanctions against many paranormal activities seriously
5313437 my guess is that religiosity has a lot to do with how you were raised and less to do with genetics
5313438 those people who may have a high genetic susceptibility to faith based knowledge may end up being highly religious or may end up having belief in the paranormal depending on how they were raised those people less susceptible to that method of forming beliefs may still end up being highly religious if they were raised in a religious family
5313439 among christians those who attend church very often and are exposed to stigma and sacrifice within their congregations are least likely to believe in the paranormal
5313440 conversely those christians who do not attend church very often maybe once or twice a year are the most likely to hold paranormal beliefs
5313441 are much less likely to consult horoscopes visit psychics purchase new age items
5313442 however among those christians who do not attend church there is a much higher level of participation in these phenomena
5313443 perhaps amazingly paranormal beliefs are not related at all to education
5313444 ph d s are as likely as high school dropouts to believe in bigfoot loch ness monster ghosts etc
5313445 many paranormalists claim that their powers only work sometimes or that they dont work if there is a non believer in the room
5313446 just remember fans take losses much harder than the majority of players do
5313447 is always among the most highly anticipated events of the year
5313448 its probably not the most sensible thing weve done but its been fun
5313449 what is required to become a freight broker is it necessary to take those 3 5 amp 7 day courses
5313450 modern cars have airbags they have esp electronic stability program when you look at the accidents now we arent seeing anywhere near the level of injuries which have been there in the past
5313451 its not just the safety element but from the environmental aspect the newer cars are much more environmentally friendly on the whole because of fuel injection and things like that
5313452 when you look at the differential in taxes why should we be paying more in this state to get a car on the road
5313453 essentially the buses will get as close as they can to the tram stops
5313454 also signage will installed on all tram stops and customer service personnel will be present at all city tram stops from south terrace to city west to direct passengers to substitute services
5313455 we have this government that has this wages policy for 3 5 per cent as their standard offer across the public sector
5313456 it is a very exciting prospect very challenging as a project but something that adelaide will really sit up and take some notice of
5313457 youve got a community of green buildings low energy buildings things that are masterplanned it is a great opportunity to get something completely different for adelaide
5313458 then they cant back pedal and say thats not what was said at the meeting thats not how its going to be

5313499 we began to focus extensively on improving our safety record six years ago in 2002 our injury rates were well above industry averages and this was completely unacceptable it was recognized that major operating changes were necessary and a new corporate wide program was put into place to improve workplace safety i am very happy to report that due to the efforts of all our employees a significant milestone in that program was reached on august 17 we reached one complete year without a lost time accident
5313500 in 2002 our total recordable incidence rate was 20 0 per 100 employees and our dart days away from work restricted duty or job transfer incidence rate which is a measure of injury severity stood at 9 9 injuries per 100 employees since then we have reduced our total recordable incidence rate by 85 and our dart incidence rate by 87 what our employees have been able to achieve under the leadership of ben mcclellan our manager of environment health and safety in the past six years is remarkable
5313501 all of our employees are to be commended for this tremendous accomplishment but we will not stop here we cannot accept any employee injury as a part of doing business within l b foster we will continue to strive to achieve a zero injury safety culture where no injury regardless of severity will be accepted

5313510 population growth is erasing the gains that the united states has made in conserving energy high energy prices traffic jams and diminishing resources are symptoms of the overpopulation problem with the nations population increasing by 3 million each year americans wont be able to conserve their way out of the energy shortages
5313511 californias per capita energy consumption has been flat for over 30 years even though consumers acquired new more and bigger power hungry gadgets yet the states total energy consumption has increased dramatically along with the states population and this growth overwhelmed all the gains we made in conservation and energy efficiency

5313518 the free us ad takes a different tone than our previous efforts
5313519 this ad issues a direct and compelling challenge and juxtaposes the stark imagery of our addiction to fossil fuels with the earnest faces of the american people who are calling for answers and solutions now it takes the call for renewable energy from a request to a demand
5313520 the conventions are about coming together to choose the ideas and the people who will lead us forward
5313521 the next american president has the inescapable responsibility to move our country away from fossil fuels and toward clean sustainable energy sources our economic and environmental futures depend on it and the american people are demanding it

5313540 we expect the coming year to see recessionary processes in the world economy as well as a rise in inflation which could adversely affect the israeli economy the expectation for 2008 is that it will end with significant growth for the israeli economy higher than that of any other western economy this is the result of well balanced fiscal policy and monetary discipline instituted at times under very difficult circumstances by the ministry of finance with the backing of the government in recent years we have engraved in our conscious an order of priorities in which education welfare and security are at the apex the subjects of education and welfare are not just social issues and the artificial distinction between welfare and defense are unacceptable to me i was pleased to hear the statements by the defense minister in recent days saying that defense first of all is education and welfare these issues continue to stand at the top of our priorities and they will come before the cabinets discretion there are two central concerns which each minister is responsible for first he is responsible for his ministrys budgetary obligations and the issues which constitute that ministrys priorities and i expect each minister to give expression to those priorities and to the matters on his ministrys agenda additionally there is a shared joint responsibility of each government minister and of the government as a government towards the national economy this is not a matter from which ministers can disregard their responsibilities each minister must find the correct balance between his demands upon his offices budget and the total picture of national needs also something that i will not fathom and is totally unacceptable i will not accept the stances of factions in the budget discussion it has never been so and it will not be so now

5313552 here we go again using latinos and immigrants as a scapegoat
5313553 they did the same thing with the chinese and the irish
5313554 little more than a thinly veiled attempt to advance an anti immigration agenda by appealing to americans concerns over other issues
5313555 even if you have a college education and are only 25 you wont be able to buy a lamborghini or a mercedes
5313556 immigration has very significant implications for greenhouse gas emissions and we should be thinking about that
5313557 if we are going to have large numbers of immigrants we have to understand the implications for the global environment
5313558 its creating a political climate where immigrants are seen as a net benefit to the state
5313559 the states highest officeholder is sending a message that his state welcomes immigrants
5313560 were it not for immigrants and refugees massachusetts would have seen a population decline in the last seven years
5313561 immigrants are becoming increasingly important to the health of the state economy

5313563 everyone agrees that we need to expand the pipe which means that we can get more people across quicker more efficiently

5313584 georgia will survive but russia has lost its credibility in the eyes of the world
5313585 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5313586 i wouldnt say theres a humanitarian catastrophe but theres an urgent need for primary products

5313907 we now know that apart from a few hiv epidemics due to infected blood epidemic hiv transmission has occurred only in populations with the highest hiv risk behaviors principally having multiple and concurrent sex partners within overlapping sex networks or sharing needles with other injecting drug users
5313908 politically correct myth that poverty and discrimination are the driving forces of hiv epidemics instead of risky sex
5313909 the head of hiv aids at the world health organization admitted in june that it is very unlikely there will be a heterosexual epidemic outside sub saharan africa adults of both sexes in some countries routinely have several overlapping sex partners apart from africa prevention programs should exclusively target the highest hiv risk behavior groups gay men injecting drug users sex workers and their clients false statistic claiming that marital sex is more likely to transmit aids than sex with a prostitute aids rates are falling faster in impoverished african countries like zimbabwe where men can no longer afford multiple sex partners than in prosperous neighboring countries like botswana that receive lots of anti aids money and where multiple concurrent sex partners are commonplace numerous studies in africa have consistently shown that the richest men and women have hiv prevalence rates two to three times higher than the poorest probably because the rich can afford more sex partners

5313969 miss jolie says she likes john mccain too and hasnt decided who to endorse huh arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan

5313978 when we took alone in the dark in 2001 it was to renew the franchise with names characters we tried to put it in a modern base and modernise it a little bit
5313979 now i think that with this franchise if atari wants to do something it has to be a major step towards other things perhaps other platforms other game systems other gameplay
5313980 alone in the dark has this chance to have this fantastic title they have to work with that perhaps to be a little purer about it and move away from what has become the classical survival horror game with resident evil biohazard and let it be alone in the dark
5313981 when you forget that theres been four or five instalments in the franchise you can do something fantastic with it

5314048 if nothing else youve got to feel good about the depth inside
5314049 that was a great play the tight end threw his eyse inside like he was going to make a crack back block it kind of froze our guys and then he took off for the corner of the end zone it was a nice play well designed
5314050 in this offense theyve got to be versatile and able to block or catch right now at this point both are doing a good job id be comfortable with either one itll be a tough one in the end
5314051 its been a strength for us in the past but its the big plays been against some of the backup guys ive got to be careful how to guage it so we are working on the right things in practice if it is a weakness we need to get it fixed but so far i think its been more of a case of guys who are just fighting to even get on our roster

5314114 we far exceeded our objectives our goal was to just reach the taliban headquarters but we actually had the opportunity to exploit it
5314115 we had the opportunity to implode their fighting positions to make them useless to the enemy
5314116 in my entire time here i never thought we would capture one of the enemy
5314117 after he was detained we did everything we could to take care of him
5314118 you can kill a lot of enemy forces but when you bring one of theirs back it hits close to home for them
5314119 whether they know hes dead or alive it doesnt matter its still a huge blow to their morale
5314120 the enemy knows it cant match us toe to toe in a firefight so it uses mines and ieds to try and slow us down and limit our movement
5314121 there is a line of enemy troops with bunkers and firing positions we know where the enemy is and where the supply routes are
5314122 our original mission was to train the anp but the mission changed and weve adapted to it
5314123 the taliban here are trained fighters thats why we need reliable close air support and some additional firepower that would help us get rid of the taliban here for good

5314155 the stability in the united states crashed and the dollar has lost so much value
5314156 so the money i was making there did not translate into that much in brazilian currency it just was not worth it to stay in the us
5314157 he said the town was developing but that it needed more investment and he would help us if we came back so i did and i am happy with that decision because i have my family here and also now my business
5314158 many of these people returning left brazil five years ago or more without any global perspective
5314159 and now they are coming back here as entrepreneurs to create businesses and opportunities and jobs for others that have not left itabirinha the economy of the city improves any way you look at it

5314197 but then samantha came on to the scene and i was dropped
5314198 from the start lindsay was very confused about her feelings for courtenay so did more and more drugs to stifle the sexual attraction she was experiencing
5314199 but eventually she just gave in and at every party theyd kiss and touch each other in the corner its a miracle nobody found out

5314201 im pretty aware of the fact that anything you do on the internet pretty much should just be considered public
5314202 about what the company intends to do with your data and your information
5314203 like all privacy matters its something that people need to be informed on
5314204 that is why congress at this point is wanting to gather a lot more information because no one knows

5314609 people just watch sports on television at home with their friends and during the olympics if there is a television in a restaurant they might watch but there are no what you would call chinese sports pubs
5314610 dont know what they are talking about they offer their opinions with no justification of facts at all
5314611 maybe because of the olympic games people are watching more sports
5314612 and if people enjoy doing it so much they will want to do more of sitting together and drinking beer and watching games
5314613 i think this could make it because many people in china today want to go somewhere that is stylish to be seen
5314614 maybe they can go on and do well in the tournament i might be back for the next game

5314616 went about my morning routine forgetting that i had taken it based on the experience of the previous few days i didnt expect to feel anything significant i was considering putting an end to my pregnenolone experiment in order to go on to another hormone or nutrient however that evening while taking a stroll with a friend on the beachfront walk in venice california i could feel something clearly happening a mellow steady persistent feeling of well being like a mild euphoria had imperceptibly come on even though i normally feel good this was different and better i became more conscious of my surroundings flowers growing in the front gardens of the ocean homes seemed brighter and prettier a mosaic on the door of a beach house caught my eye examining it closer i noticed that it was a scene of tall redwood trees with a curving blue stream running through the middle my friend graciously accommodated my request that we stare at this mosaic and observe all of its fine details as i continued walking with my friend my attention focused on the architecture of the homes i started noticing the patterns of the stones the shapes of windows doorways and porticos and other details the palm trees lining the walk appeared carribean island like picturesque everything seemed more beautiful and intriguing
5314617 the books for example with which my study walls were lined like the flowers they glowed when i looked at them with brighter colors a profounder significance red books like rubies emerald books books bound in white jade books of agate of aquamarine of yellow topaz lapis lazuli books whose color was so intense so intrinsically meaningful that they seemed to be on the point of leaving the shelves to thrust themselves more insistently on my attention

5314629 california is the last state in the nation on a july fiscal calendar to enact a budget
5314630 the state budget is past due so why are lawmakers spending time raising big bucks from donors
5314631 all the lawmakers republican and democrat alike should be tossed out
5314632 but now that everyone has aired their feelings today we can get back to work
5314633 whats important now is that they know were not willing to vote for taxes
5314634 i believe the cuts go too far in some instances and im unhappy to see the reinstatement of the higher corporate tax rate and other taxes but no one has put together a plan to balance the budget without significant new revenues
5314635 runs the risk of putting california on the brink of bankruptcy along with many of its citizens and businesses
5314636 we have a 15 billion deficit thanks to the irresponsible budget choices by democrats in this legislature spending on new programs and bigger government
5314637 we are ready with a compassionate balanced budget that meets the governors demands and will keep our economy strong maintain our commitment to education and protect the states most vulnerable citizens

5314649 the government takes the protection of personal data extremely seriously and we are committed to ensuring that information is shared in a safe and secure way
5314650 a dedicated information assurance program has been established for the coming year to address information risks and inspire public trust and confidence

5314665 no research is acceptable and by the way owning pets is slavery
5314666 in another case the usda found that researchers cut open the skull of a
5314667 is it just another sleazy attempt to make basic research more expensive and onerous to discourage the use of animals
5314668 thalidomide was thoroughly tested on animals prior to the disaster of the early 60s
5314669 my point is that researchers who use animals are not just knee jerking here that there is no merit to the accusations
5314670 i hate animal research and the usda should go overboard and shut down a university forever if they step one technical toe over any conceivable legal line
5314671 although the drug was marketed in 1957 reproductive studies on thalidomide in animals were not started until 1961 after the drugs effects on human fetuses had begun to be suspected macbride 1961 and lenz 1961 1962 initial studies on rats and mice revealed some reproductive abnormalities notably reduction in litter size due to resorption of fetuses however only when the compound was tested in the new zealand white rabbit did abnormalities similar to those noticed in human babies occur studies on monkeys revealed that they were almost as sensitive as humans to the deformative effects of the drug
5314672 under what circumstances if any do you believe animal experimentation is wrong
5314673 is it wrong to fail to provide adequate post surgical analgesia when there is no justifiable experimental reason not to do so
5314674 i am fully aware of the rationale for a legalistic perspective of
5314675 the fact that most environmental laws are stronger than awa yet still get violated quite often is again a reason for strengthening the awa
5314676 over the past 20 years the reliability of scientific peer review judgments has been a topic of frequent debate and scrutiny however one area of peer review that has not received much empirical investigation is the system that protects animal subjects from research risks at most research institutions studies involving animal subjects must be approved by an institutional animal care and use committee iacuc w e conducted a study of randomly selected iacucs from u s universities and colleges seventy committees were drawn from a master list of 916 iacucs maintained by the u s office for protection from research risks of these 70 50 agreed to participate in the study thirty four iacucs came from research or doctoral universities seven came from masters colleges or universities six came from specialized institutions e g medical colleges and three came from liberal arts colleges in all 494 of 566 voting members 151 females and 343 males or 87 of those approached took part in the study each iacuc was asked to submit its three most recently reviewed protocols involving animal behavior including the committees decision on whether to approve the research in question all information identifying the investigator or institution was then removed from the protocols and each protocol was randomly assigned to be reviewed a second time by another participating iacuc voting members of the second committee were sent packets containing three masked protocols with a request to review the protocols and to send us a completed evaluation anonymously in a prepaid envelope once we received reviews from individual committee members the iacucs were asked to meet as a group and render a final evaluation for each of the three protocols committees were asked to follow their standard operating procedures and to discuss the protocols as they would any other research proposal protocol evaluations from the originating committee and from the second committee were not significantly related to one another this absence of a relation was found not only across the full set of 150 protocols but for relatively invasive research involving procedures such as electric shock food or water deprivation surgery and drug or alcohol research for protocols involving euthanasia and for protocols in which the reviewing iacuc expected animals to experience a significant amount of pain thus regardless of whether the research involved terminal or painful procedures iacuc protocol reviews did not exceed chance levels of intercommittee agreement
5314677 take the rabbit home and let your child play with it and name it explain to her what your god or your conscience says to you about its suffering then take it and her back to the lab and let her watch you experiment on it if you can do this then you have made the decision based on all your intelligence reason emotion and spirit rather than just reason
5314678 keep in mind it is not even clear that chimps can be
5314679 even if it could be done youd have to do a lot of training with the full range of painful this a contradiction to what you might really be after minimizing pain that is
5314680 not to mention chimps are a vanishingly small minority so the impact of your suggestion is likely to be negligible in terms of numbers
5314681 do you have any concept of how violent the chimpanzee and many macaque species are
5314682 well i just kinda think so cause thats how id feel
5314683 noo only my written words my chemicals and my numbers are real other cultures ways of knowing inferior
5314684 we dont have the right to impose our will on other species prove it this is jainist nonsense
5314685 we have the right to impose our will on other races
5314686 we have the right to impose our will on other species
5314687 there are clear structural problems with plous and herzog since it compared one set of real and uncontaminated decisions with decisions that were explicitly part of the study not blinded in other words the individual correlation thing does not and cannot get around this problem as much as the authors would like to convince you otherwise all told an interesting data set but by no means the best support even for the conclusions advanced perhaps this is why it is a policy forum and not peer reviewed
5314688 so ive shown animals can suffer and it must be really important so lets all make huge lifestyle changes and weaken science
5314689 imagine an impossible situation or at least so unlikely as to be absurd base your ethical principles on how you would feel in this alternate universe
5314690 would it be ok for a more intelligent species to experiment on us
5314691 if you can get away with it and never experience the same pain under the same cirumstances that you are inflicting on someone else that makes it ok
5314692 its okay for humans to kill dumber organisms but its not okay for smarter organisms to kill humans
5314693 what if aliens show up and because weve become vegatarian sissies they think were wimps so they exterminate us
5314694 if you can get away with it and never experience the same pain under the same cirumstances that you are inflicting on someone else that makes it ok
5314695 the question is not can they reason nor can they talk but can they suffer
5314696 the capacity for suffering and enjoying things is a prerequisite for having interests at all a condition that must be satisfied before we can speak of interests in any meaningful way
5314697 if a being suffers there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration no matter what the nature of the being the principle of equality requires that its suffering be counted equally with the like suffering in so far as rough comparisons can be made of any other being if a being is not capable of suffering or of experiencing enjoyment or happiness there is nothing to be taken into account this is why the limit of sentience using the term as a convenient if not strictly accurate shorthand for the capacity to suffer or experience enjoyment or happiness is the only defensible boundary of concern for the interests of others to mark this boundary by some characteristic like intelligence or rationality would be to mark it in an arbitrary way why not choose some other characteristic like skin color
5314698 as a speciesist the answer is obviously no they are members of my species i value human life over the life of animals

5314884 mccain did well because he understands the issues close to the hearts of the people at saddleback obama did poorly because he does not understand those issues and only built up the im a man of faith narrative to hide that fact
5314885 i was against more drilling before i was for it
5314886 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
5314887 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
5314888 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness
5314889 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5314890 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5314891 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5314892 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5314893 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5314894 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5314895 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5314896 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5314897 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5314898 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5314899 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5314900 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5314901 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5314902 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5314903 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5314904 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5314905 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5314906 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5314907 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5314908 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5314909 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5314910 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5314911 i treat this matter delicately because this person needs privacy
5314912 the united states supported the transition to democratic government in pakistan and respects the results of the election
5314913 we believe that respect for the democratic and constitutional processes in that country is fundamental to pakistans future and its fight against terrorism
5314914 musharraf made the critical choice to join the fight against al qaeda the taliban and other extremist groups that threaten the peace and security of pakistan its neighbors and partners throughout the world
5314915 one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5314916 i am unlucky in the olympics in athens i was a favorite but i made the same mistake like today i am a multiple world champion but in the olympics i havent won a gold medal
5314917 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5314918 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5314919 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5314920 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5314921 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5314922 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5314923 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5314924 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5314925 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5314926 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5314927 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5314928 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5314929 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5314930 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5314931 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5314932 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5314933 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5314934 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5314935 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5314936 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5314937 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5314938 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5314939 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5314940 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5314941 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5314942 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5314943 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5314944 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5314945 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5314946 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5314947 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5314948 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5314949 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5314950 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5314951 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5314952 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5314953 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5314954 whenever anyone asks why invest in china the answer is very simple thats where the money and exponential future growth is
5314955 the bank of china boc conducted a study of the effects of 12 olympiads on their host countries over the course of 60 years they found that nine of the twelve olympic host countries suffered a decline in gdp growth in the eight years after the games
5314956 the key to a post olympic slump is the size of the economy smaller economies like korea suffered larger downturns after the games while larger economies like the united states were not affected at all
5314957 in smaller economies the enormous investment dedicated to staging olympic games created an arti cial bubble which was followed by a slump when olympic building booms came to an end
5314958 china has made one of the largest investments ever in the olympic games with some estimates of spending topping 40 billion but we dont believe the capital city will go into a slump after the games
5314959 in fact beijing has been forced to defer other infrastructure projects during the run up to the games those and other pressing projects are expected to take up the economic slack in the city after the olympics
5314960 further thousands of factories have been shut down temporarily in the region surrounding beijing in an effort to reduce air pollution during the games also somey 50 of beijings automobiles are being taken ofthe roads and many heavy diesel trucks are being banned from the city
5314961 nationwide the effects of this economic event are likely to be absorbed by the immense momentum of chinas economy
5314962 in our view the olympics will barely register as a tremor in the bigger picture of the chinese economy in fact a minor slowdown would be welcome among some economic analysts who remain worried about the effects of in ation
5314963 among individual stocks china mobile has been in a holding pattern pending the beijing olympic games government regulators have ordered all telecom companies to refrain from signing up new subscribers until the games are over
5314964 its a highly unusual request but beijing says its a necessary move to prevent service disruptions due to increased loads on networks in chinas fast growing wireless communications sector
5314965 when new subscriptions resume we expect china mobile to retain its position as the largest and fastest growing cell phone company in china
5314966 with more than 407 million subscribers china mobile retains an excellent reputation and has added as many as 6 million new subscribers every month thats an 87 share of the new subscriber market and a 69 share of the total market
5314967 china mobile appears set to gain exclusive access to the much coveted apple iphone in china in current negotiations previous talks had broken down because apple had demanded a revenue sharing agreement
5314968 that demand has apparently been dropped the company has also announced plans to invest another billion dollars in expanding its network and will soon roll out 3g high speed data service in coming months
5314969 probably the biggest lie told in schools though is that the way to succeed is through following the rules
5314970 yes i am in a bad mood no it is nothing to do with you yes i will get over it understand good lets go on with the lesson
5314971 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5314972 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5314973 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5314974 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5314975 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5314976 hsbc holdings the banking and financial services company has gained nearly 19 since july 15
5314977 the stocks schaeffers put call open interest ratio is 2 54 a reading that is higher than 85 of those taken during the past year
5314978 in addition more than 10 puts have been purchased to open for every call purchased to open for hbc on the international securities exchange during the past 10 days
5314979 an unwinding of this pessimism could draive the shares higher analyst upgrades are a possibility for hbc as 4 of 5 analysts who cover the stock rate it a hold or worse
5314980 since hitting a low on july 15 wells fargo shares have gained more than 45 despite the recent turnaround option speculators remain pessimistic the stocks shaeffers put call open interest ratio is 2 99 the highest reading taken during the past year
5314981 in addition more than 3 puts have been purchased to open for every call purchased to open for wfc on the international securities exchange during the past 10 days an unwinding of this pessimism could drive the shares higher
5314982 when i saw tori amos in concert for the first time arthur i swear i felt something that i never have before i think i believe in god now when i saw tori amos i somehow knew that there must be a god out there somewhere
5314983 id love to go arthur but i just cant rationalize these things anymore
5314984 and if you feel what you think is true if you found peace deep inside of you if your faith made a mountain move for you then dont forget to pray for me
5314985 thank you lord i hear music lord i hear music over my head what are you trying to tell me lord
5314986 students can receive qualifications for almost anything be it a
5314987 it will also save two thirds of training on the job and enable them to walk right in and know what is going on
5314988 the hedge fund group hfg team has been fabulous they answer every question quickly accurately and professionally its this stuff that quite simply builds credibility
5314989 technically the broader bearish head amp shoulders pattern in the wilshire 5000 remains in place thus the long term downtrend remains in place and all rallies are considered countertrend moves
5314990 moreover many indices have now returned to major overhead resistance levels that are consistent with a risk reward for returning to an aggressive short position
5314991 were going to a long energy position which we consider oversold while also taking a short position in financials
5314992 the bear stearns takedown marked the low for the financials in terms of market cap at 270 billion which was broken as concerns about fannie and freddie came to the forefront
5314993 now with the rules having been taken off we find goldman sachs and jp morgan under attack by downgrades and short selling
5314994 perhaps this will mark the highs in the big 19 and the financials in general certainly it removes a bullish floor from the financial stocks after such a larger run up thus we are sellers of the financials for at least a test of the lows
5314995 further we would look to be more overweight energy given the oversold condition as there is quite a bit of leverage in doing so given the enormous 6 week decline
5314996 the tactical move out of energy has been far overdone in fact we now see of the s amp p 500 stocks the financials have regained the lead in terms of market cap for all of the s amp p 500 at near 15 as they have rallied sharply recently whereas the sharp decline in energy has pushed the percentage to 12
5314997 during the early 1980s we saw energy stocks make up about 22 of the s amp p 500 whereas recently the financials made up 22 before their fall from grace a changing of the guard is upon us and we should realize the earnings potentials of each
5314998 in the old days it was expected that about half the children in a family would die before they grew up this involved pain illness and sorrow to the mother often great suffering to the children and
5314999 such a state of affairs will have both merits and demerits more important than either however is the fact that nothing less will enable a society imbued with scientific technique to survive scientific technique demands organization and the more it becomes perfected the larger are the organizations that it demands quite apart from war the present depression has made it evident that an international organization of credit and banking is necessary to the prosperity not only of some countries but of all the international organization of industrial production is being rendered necessary by the efficiency of modern methods modern industrial plants can easily supply in many directions much more than the total needs of the world the result of this which should be wealth is in fact poverty owing to competition in the absence of competition the immensely enhanced productivity of labour would enable men to arrive at a just compromise between leisure and goods they could choose whether they would work six hours a day and be rich or four hours a day and enjoy only moderate comfort the advantages of world wide organization both in preventing the waste of economic competition and in removing the danger of war are so great as to be becoming an essential condition for the survival of societies possessing scientific technique this argument is overwhelming in comparison with all counterarguments and renders almost unimportant the question whether life in an organized world state will be more or less satisfactory than life at the present day for it is only in the direction of an organized world state that the human race can develop unless it abandons scientific technique and it will not do this except as the result of a cataclysm so severe as to lower the whole level of civilization the advantages to be derived from an organized world state are great and obvious there will be in the first place security against war and a saving of almost the whole effort and expense now devoted to competitive armaments there will be one must suppose a single highly efficient fighting machine employing mainly aeroplanes and chemical methods of warfare which will be quite obviously irresistible and will therefore not be resisted the central government may be changed from time to time by a palace revolution but this will only alter the personnel of the figure heads not the essential organization of government the central government will of course forbid the propaganda of nationalism by means of which at present anarchy is maintained and will put in its place a propaganda of loyalty to the world state
5315000 we have seen that scientific civilization demands world wide organization if it is to be stable we have considered the possibility of such an organization in matters of government we shall now consider it in the economic sphere at present production is organized as far as possible nationally be means of tariff walls every nation tries to produce at home as much as possible of the goods that it consumes this tendency is on the increase and even great britain which has hitherto aimed at maximizing its exports by means of free trade appears to be on the point of abandoning this policy in favour of comparative economic isolation it is of course clear that from a purely economic point of view it is wasteful to organize production nationally rather than internationally it would be an economy if all the motor cars used throughout the world were manufactured in detroit that is to say a car of given excellence could be produced with less expense of human labour in that case than it can at present in a world scientifically organized most industrial products would be thus localized there would be one place for making pins and needles another place for making scissors and knives another place for making aeroplanes and yet another for agricultural machinery when if ever the world government that we have considered comes into being one of its first tasks will be the international organization of production production will no longer be left as at present to private enterprise but will be undertaken solely in accordance with government orders this is already the case with such things as battleships because in regard to war efficiency is thought to be important but in most matters production is left to the chaotic impulses of private manufacturers who make too much of some things and too little of others with the result that there is poverty in the midst of unused plenty the industrial plant at present existing in the world is in many directions far in excess of the worlds needs by eliminating competition and concentrating production in a single concern all this waste could be avoided the control of raw materials is a matter which in any scientific society would be governed by a central authority at present the important raw materials are controlled by military power the weak nation possessed of oil soon finds itself under suzerainty of some stronger nation the transvaal lost its independence because it contained gold raw material ought not to belong to those who by conquest or diplomacy have happened to acquire the territory in which they are they ought to belong to a world authority which would ration them to those who had the most skill in utilizing them moreover our present economic system causes everybody to be wasteful of raw materials since there is no motive for foresight in a scientific world the supply of any vital raw material will be carefully estimated and as the moment of its exhaustion approaches scientific research will be directed to the discovery of a substitute agriculture for reasons which we considered in an earlier chapter may have less importance in the future than it has at present and has had in the past we shall have not only artificial silk but artificial wool and artificial timber and artificial rubber in time we may have artificial food but in the meantime agriculture will become more and more industrialized both in its methods and in the mentality of those who practise it american and canadian agriculturists have already the industrial mentality not the mentality of the patient peasant machinery will of course be increasingly employed in the neighbourhood of large urban markets intensive cultivation with artificial methods of warming the soil will yield many crops every year here and there throughout the country side there will be large power stations forming the nucleus around which the population will cluster of agricultural mentality as it has been known since ancient times nothing will survive since the soil and even the climate will be subject to human control
5315001 the gain from an economic point of view will be enormous there will be no waste in competitive production no uncertainty as to employment no poverty no sudden alternations of good and bad times every man willing to work will be kept in comfort and every man unwilling to work will be kept in prison when owing to any circumstances the work upon which a man has hitherto been employed is no longer required he will be taught some new kind of work and will be adequately maintained while he is learning his new trade economic motives will be employed to regulate population which will probably be kept stationary almost all that is tragic in human life will be eliminated and even death will seldom come before old age
5315002 it may be assumed that every man and woman will be obliged to work and will be taught a new trade if for any reason work at the old trade is no longer required the pleasantest work of course will be that which gives the most control over the mechanism the posts giving most power will presumably be awarded to the ablest men as a result of intelligence tests for entirely inferior work negroes will be employed wherever possible one may i suppose assume that the most desirable kinds of work will be more highly paid than the less desirable kinds since they require more skill the society will not be one in which there is equality although i doubt whether the inequalities will be hereditary except as between different races i e between white and coloured labour everybody will be comfortable and those who occupy the better paid posts will be able to enjoy considerable luxury there will not be as at present fluctuations of good and bad times for these are merely the result of our anarchic economic system nobody will starve and nobody will suffer the economic anxieties which at present beset rich and poor alike on the other hand life will be destitute of adventure except for the most highly paid experts ever since civilization began men have been seeking security more avidly than they have sough anything else in such a world they will have it but i am not quite sure whether they will think it worth the price that they will have paid for it
5315003 take again the question of work both the kind of work and the method of performing it at present young people choose their own trade or profession usually because at the moment of their choice it seems to afford a good opening a well informed person possessed of foresight might know that the particular line in question was going to be much less profitable a few years hence in such a case some public guidance to the young might prove extremely useful and as regards technical methods it is seldom in the public interest that an antiquated or wasteful technique should be allowed to persist when a more economical technique is known at present owning to the irrational character of the capitalist system the interest of the individual wage earner is very often opposed to the interest of the community since economical methods may cause him to lose his job this is due to the survival of capitalistic principles in a society which has grown so organic that it ought not to tolerate them it is obvious that in a well organized community it should be impossible for a large body of individuals to profit by preserving an inefficient technique it is clear that the use of the most efficient technique should be enforced and no wage earner should be allowed to suffer by its enforcement
5315004 in the moments when we see our own weaknesses and mistakes most clearly we also see the hand of god most clearly

5315007 is still very strong reinforcing the huge potential in the brazilian food market for domestic and foreign investors
5315008 the development of a high quality but lower priced private label portfolio by the major retailers such as carrefour will appeal to low income households
5315009 brazilians are shopping more frequently and are more interested in brands than ever before
5315010 smaller grocery stores are benefiting from evolving shopping habits which are focused on convenience and product quality strong gdp growth has increased expenditure on food and drink among middle class urban consumers but it has also impacted on overall food expenditure value and volume growth in the brazilian retail market is being driven by increasing wealth and health consciousness and a propensity for higher income consumers to trade up to premium and indulgent variants
5315011 economic growth the strength of the brazilian real and rising disposable incomes in brazil are building a premium food sector with potential for strong growth over the next three to five years consumers are becoming more sophisticated in their food and drink choices with many in the higher income bracket using food as a status symbol purchasing the more exclusive expensive and exotic brands
5315012 impulse purchasing is also rising and boosting demand for snack products with a premium positioning more affluent consumers are purchasing products that offer indulgence convenience and health benefits and are prepared to pay a premium for such items
5315013 the convenience megatrend is starting to be felt within the brazilian food and drinks market
5315014 flexible packaging dominates many food product sectors including cereal rice beans flour and sugar transparent packaging is also increasing in popularity particularly in the health and wellness sector as consumers want to see that the product inside is fresh and visually appealing
5315015 new product development is likely to focus on adding vitamins and minerals to products that are already popularly consumed such as yoghurts rather than trying to convince consumers to purchase an additional product outside of their usual shopping list such as a one shot drink
5315016 outside of the healthy food market premium and indulgent products will increase in popularity throughout the food and drink sector although private labels will be a driving force as they open up indulgent items to a bigger more mass market target audience
5315017 exclusive products will be developed to target the high end market but these will have a stronger focus on higher quality ingredients and the look and feel of the product

5315196 the fundraising and the acquisition of axismobile is a dramatic acceleration for synchronica and i believe that it will build value for our shareholders we aim to build a world leader in the market of consumer mobile email and synchronization solutions and this acquisition is a key milestone which will improve our competitive positioning and accelerate our commercial growth it will increase our ability to sell to customers particularly to those in emerging economies where we see the largest potential growth for mobile email and synchronization with the fundraising and the acquisition of axismobile synchronica now has sufficient mass and funding to take advantage of the outstanding opportunity to exploit the commercial potential of mass market mobile email the next few years will be an exciting time for us all here at synchronica and for our customers around the globe we look forward with increased confidence from this inflection point
5315197 this is the start of an exciting new era for axismobile and our customers there are real synergies between synchronicas products and target markets and our own so it makes great commercial sense to combine forces both companies are committed to open standards and to developing products that work on even the most basic of handsets a must given that the market for mass market mobile email is being fuelled by demand from the developing world we are confident that the combined might of our two companies will prove to be greater than the sum of its parts

5315230 the movement was after all about freedom to choose your own candidate
5315231 you could argue that it was the clinton supporter and not those black politicians who embraced obama because they closely identified with his racial experience who represented the truest embodiment of obama ism
5315232 comfortable inside the establishment bred at universities they are just as likely to see themselves as ambassadors to the black community as spokesmen for it which often means extolling middle class values in urban neighborhoods as obama did on fathers day their ambitions range well beyond safely black seats

5315246 there are a lot of cost synergies in being a large reseller and we still think theres a niche market that if approached correctly is quite profitable
5315247 were in a fairly good position seeing that we dont have any debts and were doing quite well on cash flow so yes it is something that given the right circumstances wed be looking at

5315268 the ip leadership is taking advice from the eptts and taking responsibility for their stations while feeling more comfortable working with the recommendations made by the eptt subject matter experts who are improving the ip systems in baghdad
5315269 we are trying to get a handle on the fuel corruption issuing out of supplies and equipment payroll issues training new and previous ip and investigation techniques
5315270 the team is at the directorate almost daily working right alongside the ip to improve their systems
5315271 at one point i got a good look at her and saw that she was walking on her hands so that brought concern to us
5315272 we went through ins and outs of trying to get it all connected but once we did brad was excited to take the project on and i was excited to be here for it
5315273 in the last 11 months they have made a 180 degree turnaround
5315274 they are now conducting unilateral ops at the bn level throughout their area of ops with little or no coalition support
5315275 we operate as a bn staff trainers and combat advisors
5315276 their presence has allowed the people to feel more secure and has opened doors for more cooperation between the population and the ia in general
5315277 they see you there sweating operating eating and training with them and they will be more open to listen and learn from you but most importantly they will want to show you that they can do it and are as capable as you are
5315278 as a police officer its going to be very successful to work with the cf and things will get better in our area
5315279 i dont think anyone would have predicted that the al anbar province would become a model for elsewhere in the nation
5315280 what you have today is a very likeable condition in the al anbar province and again that is good remarks for the rest of iraq
5315281 given the passage of time we have to validate the assumptions used in the model to support our offer price of 25 74 per share in cash in addition we no longer believe we can integrate take two ahead of the important holiday season accordingly we require due diligence to support a transaction and are therefore letting the tender offer expire tonight however we are pleased to accept your offer to review your management presentation as outlined in your letter
5315282 the presentation also includes information about the underlying factors that have driven our strong operational and financial performance i believe our presentation will enable you to understand better the value of our company to ea

5315286 this doesnt happen very often where theres a tragedy like this and very famous very successful actors suddenly say ok well do whatever it takes to help
5315287 they came they allowed the movie to be finished and they didnt take money it goes to heaths daughter
5315288 thats extraordinary and wonderful and weve got a movie full of wonderful people who did extraordinary things to help
5315289 vou continuar trabalhando nos bastidores mas depois de 10 anos recebendo 1 500 pessoas em cada um dos cinco dias de carnaval dei me o direito de dividir a tarefa
5315290 the commissioners who were in charge of the report at that time wouldnt have had a mobile phone or a pc on their desk no digital cameras no e tags e mail no e anything there were no high speed computers for individuals or private industry with which they could do data matching and data mining and no high tech surveillance cameras
5315291 were saying lets flip it around lets make it general with higher order principles that will cover most situations most of the time then if youre dealing with some specialized area like health information or credit reporting you supplement that area with rules that are dedicated specifically to regulate that area
5315292 first and foremost there is not going to be any real immediate impact in terms of changes of investment in either it infrastructure or security infrastructure
5315293 part one is going to take a good 12 months to get all the actual regulations set out then there will have to be some sort of compliance period so were several years out from things really hitting the ground and organizations having to show compliance
5315294 but at the same time businesses should be looking carefully at the recommendations and the potential impact they will have on their business processes their business models and the infrastructure that supports all of those activities
5315295 that may affect internal practices and how security controls are applied i suspect many organizations will have to look very carefully at how they manage employee data and ask themselves if we have to treat that as private data what are the implications
5315296 in essence the new amendments are about being able to report on and monitor e mail and web use internally and externally before taking the necessary steps to prevent misuse
5315297 it managers do not need to implement new technology for technologys sake instead they need to firstly educate end users as many data breaches can happen accidentally and secondly to update their internal policies to be in line with the privacy act industries such as health and financial services as well as large companies need to pay particular attention to these amendments
5315298 this black market of information is exactly what the privacy act aims to prevent end users need to know their confidential data will be secured and not sold
5315299 notification of a data breach to the government and affected individuals is actually a public relations activity a marketing function so organizations will have to take their incident response and incident management teams and integrate them with pr
5315300 the reality is there probably wont be any more data breach activity than normal were just going to hear and talk about every one now which is a healthy thing because it provides transparency and establishes security performance as a market differentiator but it will be painful for a few years
5315301 they made some very ambiguous statements about level of harm if an organization experiences a breach on just one persons details out of hundreds of thousands then that is not a big deal for the organization but for that individual it could be catastrophic so by adopting this test based on the organizations assessment the recommendations are really saying privacy is a problem for business and government agencies not an individual problem
5315302 the company doesnt get to say no its not that big a deal well ignore it but under this reasonable test that may not occur
5315303 we were responding to community concerns there that the privacy act might be a bit of a toothless tiger so we wanted the privacy commissioner to be able to issue notices to comply amazingly they cant do that at the moment
5315304 ive actually asked friends and neighbors what they think can be collected and they are astonished at how limited it is
5315305 weve recommended opening it up a bit so if youre applying for a a 100 000 loan to buy a boat the lenders and credit agencies should know that youve got a 500 000 mortgage a 20 000 loan for a car four credit cards with 50 000 limit for example that will enable better risk management practices because its hard to know how they make those assessments with the limited amount of information they currently have
5315306 many australians are attached to things like linkedin myspace beebo facebook etc which are multi national entities based in the us europe and elsewhere but the recommendations make no comment about what we should be doing there
5315307 westpac is experimenting with facebook as a collaboration and productivity enhancer and i know of other australian organizations using virtual worlds like second life to do team collaboration they are all using off shore resources so what is the status of law there i think they missed an opportunity to grapple with this issue
5315308 so that even if the technology changes we will still have the eleven commandments as i call them
5315309 then well see whether enforcement actually occurs but that is several years out i think were probably looking at three years in terms of real impact

5315313 consistent commitment to the cause of the publics right to know what its government is doing as she has demonstrated throughout her career in words and actions
5315314 this is one of the labours proudest achievements in government and we built on this by increasing the minimum wage and bringing in better safeguards at work like paid holidays and the right to request flexible working for parents and carers
5315315 what working people in weaver vale want to know is how we are making sure that all working people benefit from the improved standards that labour has introduced
5315316 when it came in ten years ago i remember people like david cameron strongly opposed it
5315317 and labour is coming down hard on those people that dont pay workers the minimum wage
5315318 at the present stage there is merit in the contention that the article put up by the defendant on the blog site is defamatory

5315320 these new figures by erg are a strong indication that the review of the roaming regulation also has to tackle the issue of per second billing
5315321 to look at it in that amount of detail would prevent operators from having any flexibility
5315322 this shows there continues to be a worrying lack of competition in the roaming market
5315323 tandbergs strategic value as the leading player in a rapidly growing niche positions the company as an attractive acquisition target
5315324 we would not rule out industrial players entering the scene
5315325 many of the financial shareholders who have been shareholders for some time view tandberg as undervalued and expect a realistic bid to be a great deal above the current share price

5315359 just as a microscope reveals that a straight edge is really ragged research on human reproduction shows that the moment of conception is not a moment at all sometimes several sperm penetrate the outer membrane of the egg and it takes time for the egg to eject the extra chromosomes even when a single sperm enters its genes remain separate from those of the egg for a day or more and it takes yet another day or so for the newly merged genome to control the cell so the moment of conception is in fact a span of 24 to 48 hours

5315367 chris carney promised to defend the sanctity of human life when he ran for congress in 2006 but since his arrival in washington he has become a reliable vote for liberal house speaker nancy pelosi d san francisco and her pro abortion agenda
5315368 abortion is one of those important symbolic issues thats always out there
5315369 its about intensity for those that find the issue important its intensely important
5315370 carney does not favor abortion he has been adamant about that since his first campaign
5315371 northeast pennsylvania voters are values voters and abortion is a key issue among that electorate
5315372 unfortunately the negative primary may have neutralized a key issue that chris hackett should have been able to dominate on
5315373 the economy and so many other issues matter far more in this election cycle which is fairly typical when the economy sours the cultural issues are not as important in vote choice

5315641 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

5315651 existing schools should be retrofitted with air filtration systems that will reduce students exposure to traffic pollutants
5315652 for many years our focus has been on homes when it comes to air pollution school attendance may result in a large dose of inhaled traffic pollutants that until now have been completely overlooked
5315653 major roads play an important role in the economy but we need to strike a balance between economic and health considerations as we break ground on new areas
5315654 policymakers need to develop new effective strategies that would encourage urban planners to reconsider our current infrastructure particularly when it comes to building new schools and maintaining existing ones

5315678 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5315679 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5315680 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5315681 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5315682 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5315683 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5315684 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5315685 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5315686 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5315687 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5315688 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5315689 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5315690 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5315691 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5315692 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5315693 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5315694 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5315695 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5315696 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5315697 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5315698 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5315699 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5315700 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

5315709 it was impossible to imagine that russian tanks would be 20 25 minutes drive from tbilisi that we would have so many refugees and displaced persons and so many casualties among civilians

5315718 my goal for every play for every game is to run the offense and put the ball in the right spot to the right receiver
5315719 if thats a 5 yard route then ill throw a 5 yard route if its a 50 yard route then i throw a 50 yard route but im not going to try to do too much or too little because theres a quarterback competition
5315720 we had a plan when we started up and were right in the middle of that plan
5315721 let one guy start let the next one start and see where we are from there i feel good about where were at we learn something every time we see them out there
5315722 no you let them play and then they tell you everything you need to know from that
5315723 theres no uncertainty about it its just like any other position if you dont say that someones a starter right away you let the preseason play out and then theyll tell you
5315724 not after two games you dont need to worry about that
5315725 we have a plan and the plan is playing out exactly how we wanted later on you want to have somebody in place at least for the last preseason game which is what i said all along our guys are getting reps people say that they need to get reps thats what theyve been doing in practice all this time they only get a couple of reps in the game these guys have been throwing to receivers all offseason all training camp thats blown out of proportion

5315832 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
5315833 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
5315834 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
5315835 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas

5315838 in fondo siam davanti alla tv perch amiamo lo sport e perch vogliamo gioire esaltarci commuoverci e i giochi son meravigliosi proprio perch gioie e dolori vittorie e sconfitte si mescolano si alternano si quasi compensano certo poi vaglielo a dire a mia figlia otto anni che fa ginnastica artistica e che vede la finale degli anelli come quasi unico spunto ogni quattro anni e che il suo futuro dipende da quel che vede e da quello che la appassiona vaglielo a spiegare che giusto cos che lo sport bello che tutto perfetto
5315839 il bello delle olimpiadi proprio questo ogni giorno c una speranza nuova un sogno da provare a conquistare magari un jolly ci far poi ancora gridare al miracolo e tutto dun tratto riscopriremo la bellezza delle olimpiadi capaci di entusiasmarti quando meno te laspetti dopo averti deluso e avvilito spero che come me tutti quanti ci credano e aspettino luned prossimo per i giudizi e i consuntivi di turno ricordandosi inoltre che un argento e un bronzo anche se non fanno avanzare nel medagliere rappresentano comunque un risultato di spessore uno solo vince nello sport ma non giusto considerare tutti gli altri dei perdenti ognuno pu essere vincente a modo suo dando il massimo di quanto capace e molti italiani pur non arrivando a medaglia penso labbiano dimostrato in questi dieci giorni di gare

5315856 in subsequent years we will see reduced growth but the fundamentals remain strong emerging regions replacement of obsolete systems and some technology shifts are driving growth
5315857 the projected shift to cloud computing for example will result in dramatic growth in it products in some areas and in significant reductions in other areas
5315858 in general assets will be utilised with greater efficiency and we are assuming that the overall effect on market growth will be neutral we also recognise that there is considerable upside potential for higher growth
5315859 sonian was looking for both cost effective and scalable computing power that reduced time to market for their digital content archiving offering
5315860 having the vertica analytic database available on demand in amazon ec2 enables software as a service innovators like sonian to give customers faster more affordable and more scalable access to business analytic data

5315903 most of us do not live especially holy lives after all we spend most of our time sitting in traffic paying bills and being irritated with one another yet every week we are invited to stop all of that for one hour at least we are invited to participate in a great drama that has been going on without us for thousands of years and one that will go on as long as there is a single player left standing

5315906 we spend hours writing our headlines and we often test four or five of them before we settle on one that works but that time is always well spent in fact we once made one tiny tweak to one of our headlines and overnight our revenues jumped by 714
5315907 microcontent needs to be pearls of clarity you get 40 60 characters to explain your macrocontent unless the title or subject make it absolutely clear what the page or email is about users will never open it
5315908 as part of a list of articles in an email programs list of incoming messages in a search engine hitlist or in a browsers bookmark menu or other navigation aid
5315909 even when a headline is displayed together with related content the difficulty of reading online and the reduced amount of information that can be seen in a glance make it harder for users to learn enough from the surrounding data
5315910 its job is to clearly communicate the benefit that you will deliver to the reader in exchange for their valuable time the thing about promises is they tend to be made before being fulfilled
5315911 on average 8 out of 10 people will read headline copy but only 2 out of 10 will read the rest this is the secret to the power of the headline and why it so highly determines the effectiveness of the entire piece
5315912 how you title your title has an impact on your reader when scanning down a list of link titles or search results in a fraction of a second your brain sifts evaluates and judges the content within the article based upon the title the more specific the better the more motivating even better
5315913 headlines within your content serve several important functions first they pinpoint problems the reader may be having and draw them into reading your next paragraph secondly when you continue using versions of your main keyword phrase in your headlines you tell the search engines yup my article really is about this topic that helps you get pulled up in search results much more often which easily means more visitors to your writing
5315914 without the proper keywords headlines and the appropriate keyword density associated content articles cant be found and online articles that cant be located through popular search engines are virtually worthless
5315915 recent research suggests that users decide to stay or leave your site in 8 seconds or less in that short amount of time headlines are the one piece of copy that users will actually read
5315916 the importance of good page titles and summaries goes far beyond traditional search engine optimization seo and its narrow focus on getting a high gym rating that is a high ranking on google yahoo and microsoft search listings
5315917 page titles are used to draw in clicks from search results amongst many anonymous competing offers thus they present an opportunity to differentiate yourself from the competition and qualify prospects to your offer
5315918 since the page title is one of the few elements search engines can show searchers before sending them to your site they place significant weight on the words in the page title in addition some people link to pages using their official page title as the link anchor text
5315919 headlines aid in the visual task of scanning and skimming which helps your visitors organize the information you present worded appropriately they encourage your visitors to go deeper into your persuasive copy
5315920 if you cannot be motivated to write the article based on the headline how is the reader going to be motivated to read it based on the headline
5315921 the headline is read by five times as many people who read the body copy according to david ogilvy the headline is what stops people in their tracks and seduces them to continue reading
5315922 most bloggers start writing their post first and add a headline later however sometimes doing it the other way around can be fun you might not end up using the headline that you start with but it might be enough to spark a little creativity and get the ball rolling on a blog post
5315923 according to psychologist abraham maslow human behavior is always the result of one or more of five basic needs he listed these needs in a sequence that he refers to as the hierarchy of human needs
5315924 basic human needs include hunger thirst shelter clothing and sex
5315925 engaging powerful words draw readers in think top free how secret you think about action words that encourage people to do something
5315926 start subheads paragraphs and bullet points with information carrying words that users will notice when scanning down the left side of your content in the final stem of their f behavior theyll read the third word on a line much less often than the first two words
5315927 no teasers that try to entice people to click to find out what the story is about users have been burned too often on the web to have time to wait for a page to download unless they have clear expectations for what they will get in print curiosity can get people to turn the page or start reading an article online its simply too painful for people to do so
5315928 make the first word an important information carrying one results in better position in alphabetized lists and facilitates scanning for example start with the name of the company person or concept discussed in an article
5315929 it is about who for the most important factor the thing you need to work out before even thinking about a headline is who are you writing for
5315930 you might find that a more toned down version of your headline while pulling fewer clicks works better overall
5315931 specificity increases credibility because specific details are simply more believable than broad assertions plus a specific headline conveys more valuable information to a potential reader which acts to draw them magnetically into the content
5315932 so try to be as specific as possible use very specific quantifiable descriptions for instance use odd non rounded numbers instead of generalizations odd non rounded numbers are more credible and have pulled more than even or rounded numbers
5315933 be useful to the reader provide him with a sense of urgency convey the idea that the main benefit is somehow unique and do all of the above in an ultra specific way
5315934 1 does your headline offer the reader a reward for reading 2 what specifics could you add to make your headline more intriguing and believable 3 does your headline trigger a strong actionable emotion the reader already has about the subject at hand 4 does your headline present a proposition that will instantly get your prospect nodding his or her head 5 could your headline benefit from the inclusion of a proposed transaction 6 could you add an element of intrigue to drive the prospect into your opening copy
5315935 always make your title clear and make it easy for your audience to recognize they need your book
5315936 money discovery save easy new love health proven you results guaranteed and safety
5315937 what the headlines have in common is they all solve problems they all make the promise that if you read the article you will gain a piece of information that will improve your life
5315938 using a headline that immediately conveys either a problem or a potential benefit not only makes the reader aware that there is a gap but also reinforces it in the mind emotionally charged headlines also help to widen those gaps the wider the gap is the greater the desire to close it will be
5315939 a headline that communicates a problem i e a painful situation they feel right now or a potentially painful one that could arise without the benefits of ones offering or without at least reading the copy will have more emotional impact than a pleasurable one
5315940 the more vivid the picture is the more compelling the headline will be headlines that communicate something worth reading will cause people to surf deeper into your site or read further into the letter dont let visitors guess what they must do or what they will get from reading further you can also tell them in the headline
5315941 this is where you can get creative and have fun with your titles or just be succinct do keep in mind that most readers will look toward the headline to see if the content of the post is relevant to them make sure that your title makes sense to the reader and makes a promise about the content of the post
5315942 the page title should be short and to the point titles lengths should average between 60 and 80 characters your keywords must be in your title but the trick is doing this without making the headline unattractive and boring if possible use your key words in the beginning because these readers are scanning the search results for keywords they will want to see certain words pop out from the onset
5315943 headlines that play on words can make a website memorable make sure the pun reinforces the message so it works on more than one level as a clever idea and as a sales pitch
5315944 rarely almost never use short verb less labels as main heads for news stories they fail to tell the news
5315945 stealing the lead means repeating it almost verbatim you do want to make sure the headline matches the tone of the story
5315946 the first job of a headline is to grab the readers attention it should do so appropriately and honestly of course but the headline is the way that you draw a reader into a story if it doesnt grab attention it doesnt matter what else the headline does
5315947 the best headline will tell the reader what he will get out of reading this story whatever the story will do it should have some use to the reader the more useful the better
5315948 the headline should summarize the main point of an article if you dont get the main point or think that theres 3 or 4 main points the article hasnt done its job it should be rewritten but at any rate find that main point and summarize it in the headline
5315949 theres no better guarantee of catching a readers attention than to stir up a little controversy be bold dare to incite a little indignation or get the pulse racing just a bit dont be moronic about it though you dont need to incite a riot
5315950 in print journalism a detached editor writes the headline the writer is too close to the story and is biased she thinks every word is important every point is the main point and no headline is good enough if youre writing your own blog headlines you should become detached write a headline leave it for awhile come back to it try to see it as an outsider would see it someone who hasnt read your article yet
5315951 you need to find the middle line between being boring and being crazy its not always easy 20 ways to write a great headline is better than headline writing but not as strong as write a perfect headline or your blog will fail and so will you
5315952 try this exercise find a strong verb that best fits the story then find other words in the story to go around the verb to form a sentence that summarizes the story then shorten that sentence to make a great headline
5315953 before you go to print with your article or press publish check over your headline again read it for spelling mistakes grammar mistakes punctuation mistakes factual mistakes the headline is the worst place to make these mistakes make sure it makes sense and that it does its job
5315954 dont save the headline for last its too important and when youre done with a post you just want to write the darn headline and be done with it write the headline first this allows you to know your main point before you even start writing then rewrite the headline later and give it some time to get right
5315955 people arent so interested in what your product or service is they want to know what it does specifically they want to know what itll do for them
5315956 selling points such as low price large selection money back guarantees and so on can be quite effective when highlighted in the headline of a page this is the first text a visitor will see so it has much potential for a large impact
5315957 the more you focus on the benefits to the reader in your headline the more readers youll have and by touching on the beneficial aspects while laying out the procedural content youll have more happy readers at the conclusion of the piece
5315958 create a headline title or slogan that tells a story people can immediately recognize and relate to and they may just start telling your story for you
5315959 top 7 lists actually scored a 59 success rate as measured by jones compared to 39 for the traditional top 10 compilations top 12 lists were fairly high achievers then registering at a 47 success rate
5315960 any headline that lists a number of reasons secrets types or ways will work because once again it makes a very specific promise of whats in store for the reader a nice quantifiable return on attention invested goes a long way toward prompting action and as long as you deliver with quality content youll have a satisfied reader
5315961 dont sacrifice quality for a big headline you could probably find a hundred or more resources for your list but how many of them will waste your readers time include only as many
5315962 people love to read stories about topics theyre interested in some trends endure longer than others whilst some are short lived but if youre writing about a hot topic be sure to drop in those keywords to whet your readers appetite
5315963 website visitors are looking for information fast the best headlines for the web immediately communicate facts if you can feed site visitors hunger for knowledge you will be rewarded with more hits
5315964 its not easy to gain the trust of site visitors especially when you have only three seconds to communicate your authority thats why messages of endorsement can make good headlines testimonials from respected people allow you to do that
5315965 you can gain peoples trust by saying how many other people have benefited from the product or service
5315966 a guarantee dissolves any skepticism people may have about the reliability of the product guarantees can be based around customer satisfaction results quality durability strength fixed price promises a commitment on behalf of the company and lowest price claims
5315967 a proven way to position a product is to show how it solves a need or a problem
5315968 if the product is particularly good value for money you cant go wrong with the three ps show the product show the price and show where to purchase
5315969 people are always looking for a bargain which is why the word free is another powerful word in the advertisers lexicon if you have a good offer to tell people about lead with it
5315970 you can test the product to highlight its key features such as convenience strength versatility or to show how the product compares with the competition
5315971 case studies prove validity by showing how people have already benefited from the product in the past they are particularly useful for highlighting success stories before and afters or for demonstrating the versatility and universality of the product
5315972 headlines that reveal a trade secret or confront a taboo can make the website look refreshingly honest and therefore never fail to grab attention warning this only works if your target audience welcomes the information consciously or unconsciously
5315973 you dont have to write in the third person your headlines can mimic the voice of anyone or anything that benefits from the audience using the websites product or service
5315974 really clever headlines incorporate an element of surprise setting up an expectation and presenting the message in a way that breaks it
5315975 metaphor is commonly used in consumer advertising corporate identity and brand building collateral it can be particularly effective in activating an archetype that connects an emotion with the brand
5315976 if you are covering several different topics within a post or are covering one topic from several different angles break up the action by separating each subsection of your post with a title of its own
5315977 by using subtitles i am breaking up the action between the text and making it easer for all of you to consume all the text as a reader if you already know some of these techniques and want to skip ahead to the one you dont know its as easy as looking for the bold text subheadings reinforce the content of your page when it is being indexed by a search engine
5315978 given that many social news sites have a voting mechanism that does not even require people to read the article to vote the title may be far more important than the actual content of your link bait
5315979 have a friend or yourself submit your best ideas to the most authoritative and relevant social news sites ensures your story has a title that is easy to vote for ensures your story is
5315980 the headline and the opening are the most important words on the page
5315981 you just remove certain words that will be superfluous you want to make your title as short as possible because these readers dont have a lot of patience and you have mere seconds to get their attention
5315982 i simply rearranged the title to bring new to the front which immediately makes the title attractive because the people get a look at something breaking new exclusive this just in
5315983 you drop a few words from the actual title to create a title that isnt as restrictive as the original by removing a few key words you can make the title appeal to a much larger audience
5315984 i removed the question mark to make it a statement not a question then i added new information to the title and pushed the existing information to the end the result is automatically sensationalized
5315985 because it was good to begin with i opted simply to add pictures right before the title and it worked like a charm
5315986 of course these changes were only made to the title and in fact the summary reflected complete information so as to not make the submission inaccurate but this is a first step in getting the readers attention
5315987 by targeting a story at or slightly amending the headline and summary for the audience of social media sites we can drive huge amounts of traffic
5315988 to increase your chances of getting on diggs homepage try coming up with something unique and funny but dont forget to make sure its still related to the article
5315989 the words new first and top tell us that you have to be the first one to do something and do it well
5315990 the word web is quite obviously a sign that a web based or web related service is more tuned to the interests of the crowd
5315991 the words pictures and video tell us that it is often better to use these mediums to present information in a quicker and more appealing way than just paragraphs upon paragraphs of text
5315992 the value curiosity headline formula the two most effective ways to encourage someone to read your posts is to a promise value that will make the time investment worthwhile or b make them curious for option a pick a headline that makes your post sound unmissable for b pick a headline that begs an explanation for example whats the scariest fish in the amazon hint its not the piranha its far far worse source another simple hack is to make your headlines really big and eye catching so they gather more attention
5315993 this point is perhaps particularly relevant to social bookmarking sites but the use of a superlative is a good way to get clicks on your headline in fact its probably the best way
5315994 know your audiences fetishes know what they love hate and know what they talk about know what cliques exist within the community know what totems symbols personalities and ideas are embraced by the general populace
5315995 the number most over the top adjective subject of all time synonyms like in history or ever will also be accepted popularity
5315996 list based content marries very well with an en approach because without a super strong idea your headline will need to promise value lists do that by previewing the amount of value in the content compare kung fu battles with the top 50 kung fu battles of all time
5315997 digg users are busy people do you really expect them to sit there and read all that stuff if your article is worth digging cut the bullshit and say so in the headline trust me the community will thank you for it
5315998 i changed my title tags on my home page to problogger blog tips helping bloggers earn money just a tweak really the inclusion of two words i set this up and waited to see what would happen my search ranking for google on the term blog tips went from 65th to 10th in two or three days on msn i went from 40th to 1st
5315999 h1 tags play a hugely important role in helping a search engine assess a web page for relevance against a search term secondary only to the page title tag the h1 tag plays a vital role in your on page optimisation
5316000 page titles are the most important link between pure seo and your human readers although their apparent impact on your sites pages may appear minimal their true impact in the search engines is undeniable
5316001 title tags are arguably the most important of the on page factors for search engine optimization seo it blows my mind how post titles are also used as title tags by wordpress considering that post titles should be catchy pithy and short and sweet whereas title tags should incorporate synonyms and alternate phrases to capture additional search visibility
5316002 you can win awards with a headline like bastards over a shot of the twin towers in flames but in a search engine results page that headline is invisible instead you want a clean informative headline that alphabetizes well no punctuation numbers or articles at the start along with a totally straight totally informative lede graf
5316003 skip leading articles like the and a in email subjects and page titles but do include them in headlines that are embedded within a page shorter microcontent is more scannable and since lists are often alphabetized you dont want your content to be listed under t in a confused mess with many other pages starting with the
5316004 you should write simple concise informative headlines if you want people to click on them getting a story ranked by having a sub headline designed for the engines will do you no good if the link that the engines display is the clever wordy version instead the journalist should assume that the searcher does not have much knowledge on the subject thus a simple and informative headline will make it much easier for them to decide whether the article that the search engine returns is actually relevant too them
5316005 the title tag is whats displayed as the link in search results research in the us showed that it accounted for 30 of a users decision of which result to click on
5316006 if you dont put the most important bits of information towards the front of your headline they may get cut off as engines only display around 60 characters including spaces
5316007 search engines dont understand metaphors puns or other forms of wordplay and people dont use them when searching for information use plain english
5316008 when writing headlines and body copy you should use full names of people places companies amp products avoid acronyms abbreviations amp jargon
5316009 its critical that whatever your keyword research shows as being the most valuable for capturing searches gets prominently included in your title tag it doesnt have to be the first words but it should be the semantic and logical center of attention
5316010 although most themes for wordpress get this right make sure your post title is an and nothing else your blogs name should only be an on your frontpage and on single post and category pages it should be no more than an
5316011 out of the box wordpress puts the blog title in an h1 tag on every page while this makes sense on the homepage on individual posts its just bad information architecture and shows a complete lack of understanding of seo the best thing to do is to put the post title in an h1 tag
5316012 i prefer to do this with headspace as that makes it very very easy
5316013 active voice is best for most web content but using passive voice can let you front load important keywords in headings blurbs and lead sentences this enhances scannability and thus seo effectiveness users scan web content in an jakob nielsen
5316014 sometimes it helps to add in a descriptive modifier before your core keyword this helps ensure your page is less likely to get filtered out of the search results and thus makes your rankings more stable while helping you rank for additional terms
5316015 page titles should be differentiated from page to page on your site unless limited by the size and scope of your site it is best not to have all your page titles follow the exact same formula across your site you also should not use the same keyword at or near the start of every page title
5316016 a good document has headings and subheadings because headings make it easier to determine the topic of a page these headings can range in importance from h1 to h6 strict semanticists sometimes suggest that you should only have one h1 two h2s 3 h3s etc i dont agree with that as i think its very normal for a document to have more than two h2s
5316017 search engines give the words used in the various headings more weight in determining the topic of a page the keyword your page is optimized for should appear at least once in an h1 tag and related keywords should be used in the other headings
5316018 add a h2 headline which is a sentence explaining your h1 headline
5316019 although it may seem obvious you should go after the highest traffic phrase ordering first i say this even if youre thinking the competition is stiff and you might have a better shot with some of the less high demand orderings those will come later
5316020 generic words such as website home or welcome to usually should not appear in your page title ensure your page title differentiates your site from competing sites
5316021 use the title of your site or brand at the beginning or end of every title tag to help searchers know where theyre going and to increase return visits
5316022 when choosing what keywords to include in a title tag i often like to use as many as are completely relevant to the page at hand while remaining accurate and descriptive however if you have a separate landing page for skiing accessories than for equipment then you shouldnt include one term in the others title youll be cannibalizing your rankings by forcing the engines to choose which page on your site is more relevant
5316023 when splitting up the brand from the descriptive i like to use the symbol aka the pipe bar others choose the arrow gt or hyphen and both work well at times however ive found it useful to use the arrow or hyphen inside a title tag as with a title like seomoz articles gt keyword research a beginners guide hence my love of the pipe bar
5316024 if youve got a market that is relatively stable in search volume week to week you can do some testing with your title tags and improve the clickthrough watch your analytics and if it makes sense buy search ads on the page as well even if its just for a week or two it can make a huge difference in the long run
5316025 if the intent is browsing or research based a more descriptive title tag is appropriate if youre reasonably sure the intent is a purchase download or other action make it clear in your title that this function can be performed at your site
5316026 users who go to a page from the serps will have the expectation of finding the title they clicked deliver and youve fulfilled that obligation users will be more likely to stay on a page theyre reasonably certain fits their intended goal or query
5316027 if you can spread a great idea that other people will link to and reference then that is a good thing sometimes you can get keywords in great article headlines but if making the title keyword rich means that few people will link to it then i suggest choosing to go with the story that spreads over the story that ranks you could always go back and change the title later after the story spreads
5316028 most search engines treat hyphens and apostrophes as a space e mail is seen as being slightly different than email if a word is split by a hyphen or apostrophe then you should check to see which version is used more frequently and optimize for whatever versions are commonly searched upon
5316029 make sure that if you are not from the country of your target market you know what words are commonly used to describe the products or services you are promoting there it is important that your copy sounds local when targeting local markets
5316030 keywords matter because when you speak the language of the audience you attract more readers more links more diggs more social bookmarks and yes more relevant search traffic
5316031 check which version of a phrase gets more searches using the free keyword tools provided by yahoo see what kind of information the engines return on a particular search term if its not the same as the content youre creating dont use that phrase
5316032 headlines must contain the main keywords or phrases that best describe the piece and preferably nothing more dont make your headlines too wordy
5316033 dont use the same initial keywords in your headline and summary you have 4 words to make your point so use 4 different words
5316034 avoid repeating any headline words in the summary except for the most important one or two keywords you can repeat these halfway through the summary to reinforce them for people who scanned past them in the headline
5316035 the format order and word selection of the words in your page title should be at least slightly different than the words in your meta description and on page headers
5316036 if you have a strong brand you may want to place it at the end of your page title if you have one of the leading trusted internet brands amazon ebay etc then it might make sense to place your brand at the start of the page title in most cases the page title should still be more focused on the page copy and searchers intent than on your brand
5316037 challenge yourself to write the best headline possible dont just go with your first attempt write that down then do 3 or 4 more tries test each headline by saying it out loud look over these guidelines and see if any of them will help the headline say it out loud to your spouse or best friend or your mom which one catches their attention sometimes a clever headline will sound confusing to others
5316038 be aware of your testing options basic a b testing and multivariate testing allow different levels of flexibility and specificity a b testing allows you to focus exclusively on headlines while multivariate testing allows you to test other page elements simultaneously
5316039 visit your favorite keyword traffic estimator tool kw discovery choose the keyword or phrase most central to your blog posts title and enter it into the keyword suggestion tool take the results and modify your title intelligently you might even consider adding the popular search terms that are returned to the posts body content just once or twice is all it takes
5316040 each page on your site can be targeted for a few different keyword phrases typically i like to just do about one to two primary phrases and at most two to three secondary phrases many secondary phrases simply consist of a primary keyword a related keyword modifier
5316041 some search engines use stemming but usually the search results for singular and plural search phrases are at least slightly different in fact google returns different search results for searches with low value stop words in the search queries while it is recommended that you optimize for common versions of your popular keywords you should occasionally use other versions of those words throughout your copy
5316042 the first word in the head should be capitalized as should all proper nouns most headline words appear in lower case letters do not capitalize every word
5316043 numbers often go against ap style in headlines for example you may start a sentence with a number and even though that number is below 10 you do not have to spell it out
5316044 headline punctuation is normal with two significant exceptions use periods for abbreviations only and use single quotes where you would use double quotes in copy
5316045 the comma in addition to its normal use can take on the work of the word and
5316046 full stops like their name suggests are something that halts the eye of your reader this isnt something you want at this point in your post titles are all about leading your reader into your post and so anyway that you can help this flow is a bonus
5316047 about after all almost always because before between both down every if it its like more most no not other out than that their them there through toward what who
5316048 a an and as at but by for from in into nor of on or over per the to upon vs with
5316049 if you want to get inspiration look at the cover of magazines half the time they get them wrong but sometimes youll find a great headline i hate it when they oversell a story but those magazine editors sure know how to write sexy headlines but magazines know the secret of headlines its the headlines and the sexy model that sell the magazine same thing with your blog headlines
5316050 whilst continually keeping the headline in the back of my mind i mooch around magazines newspapers daytime tv they have excellent adverts a lot of social media im a few people talk to a few people
5316051 basically i get a headline idea which i think worthy of the twitter mosh pit and i throw it in if i get feedback great if not the headline needs serious work every so often i will throw one into the twitter mosh pit and see what comes back
5316052 this should go without saying but ill say it nonetheless read good blogs the successful blogs got where they are because they provide awesome content with headlines to match and blogs that have been successful for some time have usually perfected the craft use them for inspiration
5316053 if you dont match up an appropriate headline structure with your content you might crash and burn worse than if you just came up with a headline off the top of your head
5316054 your sexual health crucial new facts your gyno forgot to mention
5316055 the larger the headline is the more weight it is given to however if too many headlines compete for users attention the cognitive load increases and it is becoming harder to the users to actually consider the navigation options
5316056 if youre using images to replace text because you want the text to look nicer image replacement make sure that youre using normal text in your html and that you replace that text with images by using css you have to do this because both people with visual impairments and search engines cannot read the text in your images

5316091 parece interesante pero antes habr a que concretar todo lo anterior
5316092 el conseller acostumbra desde hace un a o a lanzar globos sondas a la prensa antes de discutirlo con la comunidad educativa especialmente en verano y los lunes
5316093 hay que decirle a font de mora que deje de so ar y especular y especifique de qu partida presupuestaria se va a realizar para formar a este profesorado o encontrarlo

5316113 i cant repeat what i said at half time but i lost my rag because we were losing battles all over the pitch
5316114 it was powder puff stuff and im still angry now at what i saw in that first half but at least i got a response
5316115 i told the lads if a manager had said the same to me during my playing career i would have done everything possible in the second half to ram the words down his throat
5316116 you could see the difference straight away we showed the fight and spirit that has been sadly lacking for the last eight months or so
5316117 liams injury is not serious but i still think we will have to bring in a new centre back and ill be going straight off to look through my book of contacts
5316118 im disappointed with only a point because we dominated the first half and then failed to get anywhere near that standard in the second
5316119 the first 20 minutes after the interval were very poor from our point of view and in the end i suppose it was a fair result
5316120 im pleased for nicky maynard but i wish his goal had been the winner
5316121 i brought on rafael sobis because he knows how to deal with tight marking can open up the spaces and does not go offside pato must grow again and he must learn to free himself from his marker

5316124 the experience of the early 1990s provides a stark warning about how rapidly the public finances can deteriorate from modest surpluses at the end of the 1980s to gargantuan psnb deficits of 7 5 percent and 7 8 percent of gdp in 1992 93 and 1993 94

5316130 abandonar la autocomplacencia que se reflexa en sus informes al consejo de administraci n donde afirma que la presencia del valenciano est progresando y reconocer la realidad

5316136 criticar por criticar cualquier cosa que haga el conseller pero en nuestra opini n las declaraciones que peri dicamente realiza son cadad a m s vagas e imprecisas sin concretar las que hace con anterioridad y dando la impresi n de que no sabe por donde va
5316137 ahora se descuelga con una propuesta a n m s imprecisa que las de los uniformes o la ley valenciana de calidad educativa y pr cticamente una semana despu s de que no pusiera en marcha los ciclos superiores de idiomas ni de que ponga al d as las inversiones en las escuelas oficiales de idiomas
5316138 son las serpientes de verano que cada a o formula el conseller de educaci n en su periodo de guardia pero mientras hace promesas de lograr un sistema educativo p blico triling e la conselleria sigue levantando barracones transfiriendo dinero p blico a la red privada de centros mediante convenios y apoya incondicionalmente a la escuela concertada
5316139 no crea la red de centros p blicos de guarder as no resuelve los problemas de hacinamiento de la poblaci n inmigrante en los centros p blicos ni garantiza el cumplimiento de la obligaci n de recepci n en los centros concertados y no asegura la continuidad del valenciano entre primaria y secundaria obligando a miles de estudiantes a renunciar al uso del valenciano en esta etapa educativa
5316140 aprendan idiomas y a usarlos con normalidad junto al valenciano y castellano nos parece perfecto pero limitar al ingl s el sistema triling e que quiere implantar nos parece limitar el aprendizaje de idiomas adem s de que es un proyecto obsoleto desde hace d cadas
5316141 se vende el ingl s como la nica opci n posible pero le recuerdo al se or conseller que el chino el ruso y el rabe junto al castellano son los idiomas m s hablados y que m s demanda est n teniendo en el mundo tanto en los negocios como en muchas reas del saber
5316142 m s complejos y antiguos que el ingl s y sin menospreciar a ning n idioma se deber a ofrecer estas opciones a los estudiantes para formarlos en el mundo del futuro

5316206 the important thing was to understand the brief and what the committee was aiming to commemorate with this memorial
5316207 there is a lack of knowledge and understanding about the history of africa the repercussion of slavery and what it meant for britain
5316208 this memorial will be an educational resource as the focus of curriculum based and life long learning
5316209 it will also serve within a broader context to highlight in a national and public setting the centrality of the experience of enslaved africans and their descendants in the history of britain this in turn will function as a focus for family and local history researchers

5316248 heute ist der tag einer wichtigen entscheidung f r mich
5316249 als ich vor neun jahren das ruder bernahm stand das land kurz davor als failed state als gefallener staat gebrandmarkt zu werden in den letzten neun jahren habe ich nach besten kr ften versucht der nation zu dienen
5316250 keiner der anklagepunkte gegen mich kann bewiesen werden denn nichts von all dem was ich getan habe habe ich f r mich selbst getan
5316251 timo boll wie ist das gef hl nach dieser 0 3 finalniederlage gegen china
5316252 nach einer niederlage ist man immer ein kleines bisschen entt uscht wir dachten die chinesen werden im finale vielleicht nerv s sie waren der haushohe favorit aber sie waren mental sehr stark sie waren sehr gut auf uns vorbereitet wir hatten keine chance
5316253 trotzdem haben sie silber gewonnen wie ordnen sie diesen erfolg f r den deutschen tischtennis ein
5316254 wir haben seit ewigkeiten keine medaille gewonnen und jetzt haben wir das mit einer superleistung in diesem turnier geschafft wir sind sehr sehr zufrieden das hat man auch bei der siegerehrung gesehen mit der medaille hat sich auch f r mich ein traum erf llt
5316255 gab es einen moment im finale in dem sie geglaubt haben dass die sensation m glich ist
5316256 die chinesen haben gleich losgelegt wie die feuerwehr sicher hat man nach den beiden satzgewinnen im einzel und doppel die hoffnung dass vielleicht was gehen k nnte aber dann haben sie einfach am limit gespielt so sind die chinesen unschlagbar
5316257 was nehmen sie vom teamwettbewerb f r das einzelturnier mit
5316258 nat rlich die medaille damit haben wir das soll mehr als erf llt aber nat rlich versuche ich im einzel wieder mein gl ck wenn es dazu kommt auch gegen die chinesen

5316317 people often talk about this as the internet service revolution
5316318 that will eventually lead to machines that have lots of server capacity lots of low cost computing low cost storage and that will let us write software in an even more ambitious way eliminating the last constraints we have
5316319 to encompass all interactive techniques the touch the speech the vision
5316320 because theyre fairly developed in the labs i can say that in 10 years will be widespread
5316321 you might get artificial intelligence or robotics but those are still so undeveloped at least in widespread impact
5316322 it really is a milestone i think and shows the world this opportunity to all work together and how places like hong kong and china will be such an important part of the future
5316323 whether its software or energy or agriculture the promise of science is much greater than ever before and thats why im so optimistic
5316324 the idea is to train these workers in the environment before they actually go into it so they can make all of their decisions about the operation they are going to perform select the correct equipment and do the job safely
5316325 in this project we are scoping the best approach for the hard rock environment in south australia
5316326 particularly during the sars epidemic xinhua has for last few months been putting out news reports embarrassing to the government but they are designed to fool the international community since they are not published in chinese
5316327 everyone i know wanted tickets we chinese love to see sports
5316328 its a pity there are so many empty seats we would like to know who is responsible
5316329 this is our fourth olympics but getting tickets to this one really has been a nightmare
5316330 then you get inside and you wonder who got all the tickets because there is nobody there
5316331 all the tickets have been sold out we will be encouraging all the ticket holders to watch the matches themselves
5316332 if they dont want to go they should give the tickets to those who do
5316333 i know where our seats are the people who bought our tickets are attending
5316334 but you can tell theyve just been brought in here to fill the seats they know nothing about hockey they cheer at all the wrong times
5316335 what should we do and how should we do it
5316336 weve had one of these economic downturns before when the dot com bubble burst what i told our company was that we were just going to invest our way through the downturn we werent going to lay off people and we were going to keep funding in fact we were going to up our r amp d budget so that we would be ahead of our competitors when the downturn was over and thats exactly what we did and it worked and thats exactly what well do this time

5316352 they ask us to seek satisfaction in cooperation with each other in order to secure their interests that is the principle effect of consumer culture

5316357 these guys are animals if they saw a female dog they would harass it
5316358 i think a woman who wears hijab can be more provocative to them
5316359 the more covered up you are the more interesting you are to them
5316360 i feel like with the hijab it makes them wonder what are you hiding underneath
5316361 the more women veil the less men learn to behave as decent and civilized members of society
5316362 and the more women are harassed the more they veil thinking it will protect them
5316363 it makes a woman happy when i call to her it makes her know shes attractive
5316364 the woman herself is the one who makes men harass her
5316365 if shes walking swinging as she goes of course it will happen
5316366 one of the great strengths of this campaign from the very beginning has been the cohesion the sense of camaraderie and the lack of drama
5316367 im glad im traveling with you guys and not some asshole cartoonists
5316368 barack obama on the issue of life is further left than anybody in the congress of the united states he not only pro abortion but pro abortion on demand he is pro late term abortion pro partial birth abortion he objected to the supreme court ruling that upheld the ban but most important barack obama and the illinois legislature supported or rather opposed a bill that would have protected the life of babies born from a botched abortion who were alive three times and i do know republicans are planning or rather 527s are planning attack ads on this and i will be interested to see if rick warren brings it up
5316369 i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade but let me just speak more generally about the issue of abortion because this is something obviously the country wrestles with one thing that im absolutely convinced of is there is a moral and ethical content to this issue so i think that anybody who tries to deny the moral difficulties and gravity of the abortion issue i think is not paying attention
5316370 i appreciate you being candid with me about your concerns im going to go on trying to do a good job but it sounds like we should be realistic about the possibility this wont work out i wonder if we can make arrangements now to plan for a transition that will be as smooth as possible for both of us would you be willing to work with me while i conduct a job search that will help me and it will give you time to search for a replacement and have a smooth transition and i can be as involved as youd like in bringing the new person up to speed

5316376 and so you prefer a system where 50 states set their own level of proficiency that has kids literally all over the map

5316380 i really dont know that there are that many people with set hours monday through friday
5316381 but this year im forcing the kids to reuse their backpacks
5316382 they each cost 50 they like the special cool ones and theyre still holding up
5316383 ive got two teenage boys and they like the brand names
5316384 they shant expect that this year were a cheap bunch here at this house anyway
5316385 i think if parents are going to drive their kids to school and not use bus service thats already available that creates problems
5316386 those choices have to be revisited just like everywhere else
5316387 the defendant used a noose to threaten peaceful civil rights marchers who were in louisiana to rally against racial intolerance

5316394 the lack of mortgage finance has brought the housing market to a virtual standstill with first time buyers rapidly becoming an endangered species going forward there are signs that sales activity might pick up a little as sellers start to re evaluate unrealistic asking prices
5316395 however the current confused messages from the government regarding stamp duty risks damaging any returning confidence and may discourage mobility
5316396 mortgage lending activity remains relatively weak and will decline further in the coming months as a result of funding constraints and lower consumer demand the majority of lending continues to be to people with larger deposits which is prudent for borrowers and lenders in a slowing housing market
5316397 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5316398 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5316399 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5316400 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5316401 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5316402 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5316403 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5316404 was not in a cone of silence on saturday night
5316405 hmm why does it sound like the back end is about to excuse itself from this exercise
5316406 rankings reflect sales for the week ending aug 2 at many thousands of venues
5316407 i felt more fear in american cities i can walk down the streets of tel aviv at night without a problem but i of course have the knowledge of which places not to go at night just like any other city in america
5316408 what better post to be sustainability czar than vice president
5316409 what we can do for these children now we are their mothers and fathers
5316410 its a classic case of rage of hate for someone its very personal
5316411 around november or december 2007 a man came into the office he was crying and his arms were bruised seeking assistance
5316412 took him into her office then to my amazement i heard her tell him that another way doesnt provide services or assistance for men my heart went out to this man because it was evident that he was truly a victim of domestic violence
5316413 this is discrimination and violating mens rights there are men with children that are being victimized it takes courage for men to come forward and admit they are victims then when they do we revictimize them all over again
5316414 we have limited resources and its all we can do to try and keep up with the demand for services for women and children
5316415 in all of that time there was one woman admitted who i was sure had been severely physically abused the rest of the women and kids who came and went were playing the system to the hilt
5316416 strenuously opposed the execution of the iraq war he slammed the presidents response to katrina he fought the agents of intolerance of the religious right he crusaded against the g o p house leader tom delay the criminal lobbyist jack abramoff and their coterie of influence peddlers
5316417 both the excessively genteel obama campaign and a too compliant press
5316418 if it is determined that an individual acted improperly blackwater would support holding that person accountable
5316419 but at this stage without being able to review evidence collected in an ongoing investigation we will not prejudge the actions of any individual the company is cooperating fully with ongoing investigations and believes that accountability is important
5316420 fool me once shame on you fool me again and ill fucking kill you
5316421 not only does it look tacky but this habit also indicates to people when you havent been able to take a shower for a while
5316422 take for instance those women who have their hair looking like a wet fowls beetee after it has been in a fight another indictable offence is for those who have in braids weaves and other such hair implanted but refuse to wash them properly that foul smell emanating from their heads is a major turn off to men everywhere even more unsettling to mens olfactories is the use of coconut oil in womens hair that thing leaves a rather rancid and pungent odour that diffuses so effectively that it makes mens eyes water do you have any idea how difficult it is for men to endure such torture ladies should be cognisant of the fact that on average men are taller than women so that whether men are talking to them getting a back ball or standing next to them the smell of their hair is in close proximity to the mens noses this is not only discomforting but it is also unhygienic get your act together or face the consequences
5316423 the use of scented pads is also offensive not every man you come in contact with needs to know that youre menstruating
5316424 it is very unnerving to see women wearing clothing that may be in style at the time but definitely dont suit their bodies or their personality pedal pushers arent for everyone the same goes for plaid linen short skirts low rider jeans and mid riff showing tops worn correctly these are a sight to behold but when worn by someone who it doesnt go well with it can be a very offensive eyesore
5316425 men are not walking atms so ladies please stop treating men like theyre money trees the whole point of womens liberation is that you want to be independent independence suggests that you do not require someone else to provide you with a new outfit to go to jamzone to pay for your trips to the beauty salon to pay your rent and your hire purchase bills and other such expenses live within your means and stop putting men under undue financial strain you cannot expect to be treated like an equal when youre always leaching off of a man to finance your lifestyle you were allowed into the world of work and by large given equal opportunities to earn your own money so please act responsibly many men have been displaced so that you could be employed so it is up to you to use your own money rather than becoming a financial burden on the men that have been able to secure a job
5316426 if you want to run your mouth then pay for it yourself
5316427 there is no reason why you should be talking like youre trying to speak above loud music when the place is silent this is a major turn off and such behaviour will be stamped out
5316428 an increasing amount of women are unable to use toilet paper properly and the consequences have been dire nothing is more unattractive than seeing little balls of toilet paper rolled up in their nether regions
5316429 it gives honor to her and her supporters and it gets us all on the same page supporting barack i think its the perfect outcome and its something obama wanted as much as hillary did
5316430 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
5316431 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
5316432 its not near good enough and its not acceptable we are making too many mistakes and we are going to go back to practice and fix it
5316433 it felt pretty good im just trying to get back up to tempo it just felt good to get hit its been a long time i really havent been on the ground since the pro bowl
5316434 we dont want to have our granddaughter abused by these people
5316435 the child support was the icing on the cake i couldnt believe that our son has to pay child support to his abuser
5316436 it is an age and maturity issue not a gender issue
5316437 hes a young boy coming into his own being taken advantage of by an adult
5316438 i have made what i consider to be a reasonable offer but i have not received a response
5316439 he is a father even though it was a crime for him to be a father his life is changed forever
5316440 kenny hong a well known figure in the elt community in japan was found dead at his home

5316442 a set proportion of the revenues are set aside as a pool and split between the various music rights owners of this pool a percentage is paid to the record companies and a percentage to the music publishers via the collection agency mcps prs the proportion paid to an individual record company is calculated on a pro rata basis according to the usage within the playlouder network of that record companys music
5316443 t he acceleration of the body is proportional to the force produced but inversely proportional to the body mass according to newtons second law this implies an inverse relationship between height and performance in disciplines such as sprint running
5316444 his head was back his shoulders were well behind his center of gravity this resulted in him spending too much time in the air and over striding
5316445 his length of stride is compatible with his height one of the reasons he has such a long but efficient stride is because he lifts his knees so well
5316446 i definitely plan to be back here in a few years
5316447 i tried to attack on the bike but the pack kept us in it so it came down to a strong run i felt good on the run
5316448 i learned that on the swim when i was trying get out get around and get away at the exact time im going to go i just need to step on it
5316449 no matter what i need to get out and spread it out a little bit
5316450 i didnt want to press the swim because if youre pulling youre using more energy but i think im just going to go back to my style of really really swimming really hard thats going to break up the swim even more
5316451 very gently like there are eggshells on your pedals and you dont want to break them thats how you drive in the rain
5316452 we couldnt even imagine how varied are the british toasts
5316453 i can only do what i do and not worry about the rest
5316454 i dont know how old she is but i do know that she gave a performance that merited her medal
5316455 obviously im gutted but last sunday i didnt think id even be competing because of a rib injury so im pleased just to make the final
5316456 the dismount probably did cost me my place on the podium
5316457 my dismount is normally not a problem but i just didnt get enough height and to be honest i thought i was going to end up on my face
5316458 the big industrial chains can harvest as much cane with 11 wage workers in a week that it traditionally took 700 families with home made tools to produce in a year
5316459 by 2002 the country was producing only 7 of the barley 36 of the wheat and 98 of the maize that it produced in 1990
5316460 imports have increased in volume and in cost it is a serious state of affairs that the amount of foreign purchases of agricultural and agro industrial products should rise from 6 106 564 tonnes in 2002 to 8 126 637 in 2007 but the rising curve of cost is even worse one tonne of yellow maize has risen from 96 in august 2002 to 249 in march 2008 wheat has gone from 172 to 485 over the same period rice from 242 to 524 barley from 133 to 485 and white maize from 148 to 259 each time the imports get more and more expensive
5316461 in respect to colombia the policy of maintaining the status quo presupposed that the venezuelan government should not make any comment on human rights violations should not denounce the state terrorism of the colombian oligarchy and that during the state summits between the two countries uribe should even be qualified as a friend and appeals should be made to him to work for peace
5316462 if the position of the bolivarian leadership swings between critical support for the farc when there is conflict between the colombian government and equally uncritical diplomatic accords with uribe hugs and abstract calls to keep the peace this will only result in confusion and demoralisation of the masses and it will leave the door open for the colombian oligarchy to continue to exploit the desire for peace of the colombian people in a demagogic and reactionary manner
5316463 as trotsky explained the revolution is permanent in two senses
5316464 the expropriation of the bourgeoisie and the setting up of a planned economy that would solve the problems of the venezuelan masses would serve as an example to the masses of the americas and the world also it is imperative to explain to the masses that the struggle for peace in colombia as we said earlier is indissolubly linked to the struggle for the socialist transformation of society if venezuela can end the domination of the capitalists and solve problems like unemployment shortages housing etc it would immediately become a magnet for all of the peoples of the americas starting with our brothers and sisters in colombia this combined with a call to the other latin american peoples to organise themselves to struggle for socialism would be the best way of making real the dream of bolivar of a united latin america the socialist federation of the peoples of latin america would no longer be a slogan but a real possibility

5316475 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5316476 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5316477 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent senator obama
5316478 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5316479 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5316480 the great difference is that i intend to win it first

5316494 i think the whole focus on water and the environment thats going to offer we think big opportunities for us as time goes on
5316495 it impacts us but i think weve kind of managed our way through it pretty well we havent had any big write offs
5316496 some of the best opportunities weve seen in the last 10 years were seeing right now assets are cheap
5316497 in financial services sometimes bad news is good news youll see some great deals done in this cycle and well do some of them
5316498 its another way to simplify the company and run it better

5316510 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information it turns police officers into spies on behalf of the federal government
5316511 my friends we have reached a crisis the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the cold war this is an act of aggression
5316512 with its actions in recent days russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the twenty first century
5316513 today we start a new chapter of paraguayan history whose authorities will be relentless against the thieves in their communities

5316524 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5316525 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5316526 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5316527 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5316528 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5316529 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5316530 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5316531 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5316532 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best

5316534 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5316535 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5316536 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5316537 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5316538 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5316539 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5316540 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5316541 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5316542 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5316543 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5316544 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5316545 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5316546 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5316547 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5316548 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5316549 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5316550 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5316551 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5316552 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5316553 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5316554 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5316555 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5316556 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5316557 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5316558 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5316559 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5316560 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5316561 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5316562 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5316563 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5316564 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5316565 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5316566 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5316567 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5316568 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5316569 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5316570 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5316571 before we really didnt need much because all of our work is done off base
5316572 but we are growing this puts us near the interstate and the fedex terminal and it gives us room to grow
5316573 youre parked in a handicapped spot thanks for making me walk
5316574 handicapped parking enforcement has not been what it should be
5316575 you should do well at making money and holding on to it
5316576 any doubts that you may have will disappear early this month
5316577 get your mind set confidence will lead you on to success
5316578 what the mind can concieve and believe it can achieve
5316579 i used to watch the apprentice but its become big brother
5316580 they all live in a house together and are given tasks where do you recognise that i dont think its challenging any more
5316581 i like alan sugar i think hes fabulous but the whole format and the things that the contestants do its not a million miles away from what happens in big brother which isnt the most intellectually stimulating programme
5316582 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
5316583 it is hard to imagine a more sound and appropriate choice

5316588 to splurge or not to splurge that is the question
5316589 i had to do a double take and reread it to make sure i understood what was happening
5316590 as far as the pilots and the west gulf proposal all i can say at this time is theres no need for pilots to take any action on the proposal and we have no further comment
5316591 the pilots showed great flexibility and initiative to handle unique traffic needs
5316592 it is very gratifying to me that west gulf was proactive in trying to keep rates competitive and fair

5316600 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5316601 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5316602 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5316603 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5316604 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5316605 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5316606 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5316607 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5316608 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5316609 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5316610 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5316611 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5316612 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5316613 i did have more energy later in the day and decided to go to the gym i had a good workout which made me feel better and less bloated i am excited to be finished tomorrow i am going to take measurements tomorrow but i am also going to wait until my menstrual cycle is over to take the measurements again i usually get bloated during my period and i want to get accurate measurements i also had to be strong today and not go out with all my friends who were going out drinking i knew i only had one more day left of the cleanse and i didnt want the alcohol to affect the results

5316617 quintessentially american ideal of individual creativity conviction dedication and exuberance
5316618 overall today went well i felt a little constipated in the morning but after i went to the bathroom i felt a little better i did feel some gas pains before lunch but they went away after i went to the bathroom i had a lot more energy than i did yesterday i am hoping the energy level picks up as i continue through the week i am having trouble sticking to eating all fruits and vegetables all day long i have had some snacks granola bars and cereal

5316620 go back to your cell its going to be very tough on you now
5316621 ik had het moeilijk bekende de middenvelder van fc twente na afloop
5316622 ik had in het tweede bedrijf graag willen laten zien dat het beter kan natuurlijk hebben we het tegen frankrijk bij fasen moeilijk gehad gelukkig hebben we gewonnen
5316623 we hadden al een positief gesprek met anderlecht over de man
5316624 we moeten nog naar elkaar toegroeien maar wij hebben zon goede relatie met anderlecht dat de transfer wel rond komt
5316625 de wedstrijd tegen roemeni komt er voor ons nu eigenlijk een beetje tussendoor
5316626 wat de opstelling betreft moeten we eerst maar eens kijken naar hoe we er fysiek voorstaan maar ik weet zeker dat als we straks weer die sfeer van oranje in het stadion voelen we er gewoon voor gaan
5316627 weissman blue square controlling shareholder david weissman n t does not realize what he is doing
5316628 the haredim will not let him harm one of their own the lithuanian rabbis have protected weissman so far by refusing to sign the boycott order unlike the hassidic rabbis that suit will destroy shefa shuk completely
5316629 he should find out who really instigated the boycott and who is funding the propaganda in the haredi community it is not yehuda porat
5316630 the suit is nonsense it is an insult to weissmans intelligence they have targeted the gatekeeper porat
5316631 de nederlaag ge ncasseerd tegen nederland behoort tot een categorie verliesbeurten die je bescheiden maken dit verlies zal niet gemakkelijk worden vergeten ze hebben hun lot niet meer in eigen hand de situatie is alarmerend
5316632 geweldig machtig en vol zelfvertrouwen is het elftal van marco van basten er vol voor gegaan om de eerste plaats veilig te stellen en toen het klaar was met spelen had het fluoriscerende oranje de ogen van de toeschouwers geopend
5316633 nederland heeft het franse team dat sinds de halve finale van het wk in 1958 5 2 niet meer zoveel tegengoals kreeg simpelweg vernederd triest half eeuwfeest
5316634 het spel van nederland verdiende een mooie handtekening sneijder was daarvan de auteur de middenvelder van real madrid lanceerde een schot en klopte coupet
5316635 zeer zeker was olanda buitengewoon en zorgde het voor een boeiende wedstrijd met superieure hoogstandjes de fransen zetten er met volle overgave hun trots tegenover maar dat was niet genoeg
5316636 de achterhoede van nederland zorgt nog voor twijfels maar het middenveld is een lanceerbasis voor raketten sneijder robben kuijt en van persie zijn snel en technisch en dan is er het enigma van nistelrooy dat door de fransen niet kon worden opgelost
5316637 na twee fantastische wedstrijden is oranje nu de absolute nummer n titelkandidaat
5316638 de onstuitbare nederlanders gaven een masterclass aanvallen aldus cnn de zender sprak van een sensationele voetbalstijl de lovende woorden gaan maar door de zwitserse newswebsite
5316639 bij de 2 0 lieten de nederlanders weer eens zien hoe simpel n mooi voetbal gespeeld kan worden
5316640 er waren zoveel oranjefans in bern berichtte de britse krant
5316641 dit is genieten vertelde sneijder die voor de tweede keer dit toernooi werd gekozen tot man van de wedstrijd na afloop
5316642 de wedstrijd tegen itali was al mooi en dan doen we vandaag gewoon weer precies hetzelfde we gaan zeker een klein feestje bouwen maar niet te veel want de kwartfinales komen er natuurlijk aan super zes punten na twee wedstrijden dat geeft absoluut heel veel vertrouwen
5316643 zeven goals tegen itali en frankrijk als iemand dit van tevoren gezegd had dan zou je m hebben opgeborgen p het moment dat dit team niet draait gaan ze bikkelen khalid boulahrouz loopt voorop met nigel de jong en de rest doet mee
5316644 de verdediging heeft het in twee wedstrijden uitstekend gedaan maar de grote kwaliteit van deze ploeg is de uitstekende voorhoede op moeilijke momenten zoals hun 2 1 maak je meteen weer de 3 1 dat is extreem
5316645 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5316646 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5316647 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5316648 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5316649 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5316650 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5316651 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5316652 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5316653 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5316654 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5316655 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5316656 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5316657 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5316658 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5316659 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5316660 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5316661 koei does not accept any outside game ideas at this time
5316662 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills

5316664 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5316665 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5316666 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5316667 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5316668 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5316669 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5316670 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5316671 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5316672 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5316673 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5316674 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5316675 today my bowel movements were not like the past few days i am not sure what changed but i felt like i had to go all morning i would go and a little would come out but not a lot it was weird though because i felt like i couldnt hold it and i really had to go it was very uncomfortable things got better as the day progressed but i still didnt feel like i have the past few days i didnt go to the gym today because i didnt want to have to keep running to the bathroom throughout my workout to try to go i have been extra hungry these past few days but i think that might be because i am eating less than i normally would i am trying not to eat a lot of meats besides chicken i have also completely cut out drinking coffee in the morning i now drink decaf green tea which is a habit i will keep after the detox is over i am hoping that tomorrow will go better and i wont have to keep running to the bathroom i am looking forward to the end of the detox so i can eat a little more variety of foods and not worry so much about going to the bathroom

5316678 that when it comes to judging he looks to the law books but not to the bible or any other religious source
5316679 thanks rick chuck baldwins website could be charitably described as underwhelming what i wonder about is why did this guy

5316698 i got nervous at the gym because i felt like i had to go while i was running and i didnt want to take any chances so i stopped the treadmill and went to the bathroom however i only urinated and a tiny bit of waste came out i get nervous when i am in public places because i know how watery my bowel movements were all day and i didnt want to take any chances towards the end of the night i was feeling a little bloated but i think this might be because of the amount of water i consumed i have not experienced any increase in my energy level one of the advantages on the website stated that there would be an increase in energy maybe this will follow in the next few days i did not have a large bowel movement since early afternoon i decided to call it an early night and take 4 more pills and head to bed
5316699 my first thoughts after my first day were not good i went to the bathroom a little bit but not as much as i thought i was going to i felt miserable all day long but i am not sure if this is because of the colon cleanse this is the first day in months that i have not taken my herbalife vitamins i think that my body becomes used to these nutrients and when i do not have them in my system i get a headache i have gotten headaches before when i discontinued use of herbalife at the end of the day i took 4 more pills and drank 16 9 oz of water i got up two hours after i went to bed to urinate i was also a little hesitant about the lack of instructions that came with the pills the only thing in the package that arrived was the bottle of pills and a half sheet of green paper that had some coupons and suggestions on it
5316700 the pills look like horse pills i am so glad that i only have to take 4 a day i cant imagine swallowing more of these i get nervous they will get stuck in my throat i need to make sure that i am drinking a lot of water

5316703 emil called me tonight and said that he has been thinking about it for two years and has decided to retire
5316704 he said he will announce it at a news conference monday
5316705 emil called my son mike and said that he going to retire
5316706 but emil has a history of changing his mind i certainly wish him well if he indeed retires he served with my father in the house he served with me in the senate and he serves with my son mike three generations of jacobs
5316707 emil really hurt members of his caucus by aligning himself so closely with gov blagojevich he really should have been looking out for the interests of his members rather than watching the back of the most unpopular governor in recent memory
5316708 it used to be that federal money to help at risk students was distributed evenly among all the states school districts but emil jones successfully pushed for that money to only go to school districts where poverty was the greatest

5316718 how could i be losing to this guy lovitz said playing me with dana carvey on the other side i was asking myself the same question
5316719 political scientists have bewildered themselves for years wondering why our nation suffers such difficulty in expressing our political ideals through our right to vote the problem of unmotivated potential voters is by no means a new one however this last election i believe holds an important clue in solving the riddle of americas politically neglectful the electoral college in this election nearly every state voted in accordance with how it did four years ago this means that the election was decided by the few states that didnt among these ohio retained the greatest number of electoral votes and so it was bestowed upon ohio to make americas decision it is truly hard in the scheme of things to appreciate ones own individual role in the american political system one neglects to vote due to apathy toward americas political situations but due to the failure of the democratic system to emphasize the value of each and every vote under these circumstances one simply cannot conceive that their vote could possibly make any difference unfortunately this quandary is unavoidable in any structured democracy the electoral college successfully manipulates the political system and distorts our notion of democracy to the extent that the exposure of such fraudulence would render even the most devoted political zealots despondent

5316740 wenngleich es sich hier nicht um eine repr sentative umfrage handelt geben die ergebnisse dennoch die erfahrungen aus der antdiskriminierungsarbeit wieder
5316741 in anbetracht der ergebnisse verwundert es kaum dass noch zu wenig betroffene mit migrationshintergrund auch rechtliche schritte einleiten um gegen die erlebte diskriminierung vorzugehen
5316742 diese als auch andere ergebnisse zeigen dass deutschland dieser verpflichtung noch nicht gerecht geworden ist nach 2 jahren agg m ssen sich die daf r verantwortlichen fragen was sie in dieser zeit tats chlich auf den weg gebracht haben um von diskriminierung betroffene zu unterst tzen
5316743 es bedarf jedoch weitreichender ma nahmen insbesondere auf bundesebene die direkt betroffene ansprechen und sie ber ihre rechte aufkl ren eine breit angelegte medienkampagne mit fernsehspots auch in den sog migrantischen medien w re sicherlich ein erster schritt in die richtige richtung

5316751 its not about whether you have problems or dont have them
5316752 its how quickly you address them that matters if apple addresses them people will cut them slack
5316753 but i wouldnt say it is a two woman show
5316754 everyone played very well for example formiga who was injured during the world cup but she made a lot of contribution to the team and theres our captain tania she made a lot of opportunities all the players played really well
5316755 at the start the team was a little bit tense and i didnt know why perhaps it was because they met germany in the group stage but they changed their position which enabled the pace of the game to come and after that it went pretty well
5316756 we kind of feel that we had it in our hands we led 1 0 and missed some other chances to score the second goal
5316757 after that we didnt work well in front of our defense and we surrendered the equalizing goal at a bad time just before halftime we were on the wing with two players covering cristiane and we just couldnt manage to get the ball
5316758 the second and third goals were situations that started with a corner on the other side marta had a lot of space and handled the ball very well and you saw the result after that it was difficult to get back in the game we are disappointed with the loss but we cant change it
5316759 no we need ritalin and leashes thats what we need
5316760 from our point of view it was fantastic right from the start
5316761 some members were initially very reluctant to use it but now they dont know how we did without it
5316762 we had problems with insurance and having people covered as soon as they did something because there was a one week turnaround
5316763 they had to send in paper work and we had to process a cheque whereas now a payment is made online instantly
5316764 when we review our registrations we are able to generate the subscriptions by member type divers coaches officials or volunteers and they all get an email to say it is due and they pay it online
5316765 so in a matter of five minutes all the registrations for the year can be done without the paperwork and mailouts
5316766 we found it was going to cost in the vicinity of 30 000 with some of the other quotes we got and being a tiny organisation it was just not possible
5316767 what really won us over was that their banking systems are fully integrated and reconciled every month by them
5316768 a lot of the other ones went through the paypal system which is just so much more complicated from our point of view
5316769 when you have government grants they like to know if a dive school project as we are running at the moment could result in someone ending up in the olympics in eight years
5316770 we have a 10 year old girl in our talent identification program and we can track what programs she has gone through by what she has entered over that time we couldnt do anything like that before
5316771 the main thing is to get our newsletter into a more electronic format
5316772 our sales results for the quarter while better than our forecast reflect the realities of the continuing macro economic pressures on our industry
5316773 we believe our second quarter sales benefited from the economic impact of the fiscal stimulus tax rebates unfortunately weakness in bigger ticket projects continues particularly in markets most impacted by the housing downturn
5316774 the macro economic factors pressuring consumers and the ongoing challenges and uncertainty of the financial markets suggest a cautious sales forecast for the balance of fiscal 2008 is prudent
5316775 we remain focused on positioning the company for long term success while managing through the near term challenges of the current environment

5316787 all the time the enemy tries to carry out any kind of activity that it can but the afghan security forces are ready and we have already taken measures to disrupt any enemy activity
5316788 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5316789 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5316790 i wouldnt say theres a humanitarian catastrophe but theres an urgent need for primary products
5316791 the zimbabwean issue is far from resolved and so the continent as a whole has a responsibility to continue to engage with us in finding solutions
5316792 we hope a deal can be finalised in the fullness of time
5316793 unless tsvangirai signs on the dotted line the crisis continues not only simply because the billions of foreign aid does not become available but also because he does represent a significant majority of the zimbabwean population
5316794 parliament will have to be convened sooner rather than later but i cannot say when that is the presidents prerogative he will decide its almost five months since they were elected
5316795 what he was saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view
5316796 hes not judgmental about me or my belief he just disagrees with me
5316797 the same old folks that brought you george w bush
5316798 john mccain has never questioned sen obamas patriotism but he clearly does question sen obamas experience and judgment
5316799 john mccain all he wants to do is talk about me

5316810 siempre un partido te deja cosas buenas cosas positivas y a nosotros primeramente nos cost sobre todo el inicio los primeros 20 o 25 minutos realmente ellos fueron superiores se adaptaron r pidamente a la cancha y fue lo que a nosotros nos cost mucho trabajo en la adaptaci n de la cancha y de la pelota nos cost mucho en eso fuimos muy imprecisos y a trav s de nuestra circulaci n nos se tuvo sobre todo la tranquilidad de manejar mucho mejor el partido
5316811 si bueno yo creo que mas alla de los errores que pueda uno cometer individualmente para mi es todo esl equipo lamentablemente tuvo dos tres lanzes sobre todo en el primer tiempo y despues viene el empate de ellos no que te deja el sabor de que pudo haber hecho algo mas para tratar de que no se te acercaran en el marcador
5316812 si bueno es un viaje largo tienes que acostumbrarte al horario y tardas no tardas eso realmente ya lo sabiamos son seres humanos a cualquiera nos pueda pasar eso realmente no es excusa ni mucho menos para mi yo creo en donde nos falto fue en la adaptacion de la cancha

5316831 he has looked lively very happy and full of desire and the coach bernd schuster has told me that he is training very well
5316832 he is a player whose club did not want to sell him
5316833 there are a lot of clubs who want our players and we dont want to sell them either
5316834 this is football it was a matter between the player and his club he said that he would like to play for us but his club did not want to sell him

5316870 personally i dont think china should strive to win so many gold medals
5316871 coming in second or third place in gold medals is good enough im just worried that others may look at us as being cocky if we win too many
5316872 this was the most important medal of all for chinese people
5316873 its different from pingpong or diving in track and field you are competing against the whole world when liu won we felt on top of the world all the other medals are small compared to this one
5316874 behind the medals count everybodys excited to see chinas athletes in the lead as well as american swimmer michael phelps achievement of breaking world records and winning eight golds but were even happier to see the competitors from more countries and regions climb on top of the medals podium
5316875 its very misleading to see what the official media are presenting
5316876 people feel very strongly about winning when the games are over youll see a burst of patriotism
5316877 if we put up photos of all the medal winners there would be too many
5316878 im a very experienced boxer and i felt i should win
5316879 we said were not here to win one or two bouts were here to earn a gold medal
5316880 it inspired me and also put a little more pressure on me because i didnt want them to come all this way and not qualify
5316881 stop by personnel and fill out some paperwork before you go home

5316886 imagine sitting down with a group of colleagues and friends and listening to one of you bounce business ideas off the others thats pubtalk a non threatening yet sometimes brutally honest atmosphere where presenting entrepreneurs use their peers as a sounding board first three young oen member companies have five minutes each to present who they are and what they do to the assembled crowd who are encouraged to ask questions later a single featured company will present an expanded version of their pitch and take comments and questions from the audience think of it as trial by friendly fire

5316905 sehwags injury is bad and he will miss the remainder of the series

5316907 thats the way it goes in cricket you cant really stop and think about the guys you will be missing in the series rather than that you will have to fill in that space because that is the only way your team can win
5316908 he sehwag is still in the hotel but i do not know exactly it was quite bad yesterday you will get to know
5316909 were knocking on the door its time to get down to business right now weve got three games to accomplish what weve been waiting to do for four years
5316910 this is what weve been preparing for for these three games right here
5316911 we had to play these five games to position ourselves in the right way we did that we played well now weve got to take it up a notch to play even better
5316912 well we feel that were even hungrier now and were going to look at every game as a game 7 if we continue to play defense the way were playing and continue to move the ball its going to be tough to beat us
5316913 in that game we were looking forward to coming here and getting the olympics started
5316914 theyre a physical team a tough team and im pretty sure theyre going to take that game and build some confidence and momentum off of it
5316915 i have not seen them play with such a chip on their shoulders since the dream team of 92 especially with kobe running the show
5316916 they have a different mentality they are trying to kill teams and they are going to try to knock us out with the first punch but we have to stay calm

5316923 i misread the wicket in the morning there was something for the bowlers but i thought it will be just for half an hour or so but it went on to assist them for longer
5316924 moreover we were not chasing well for sometime in last few matches but all credit to the lankans they bowled really well
5316925 both munaf and zaheer bowled well but i guess it was not enough
5316926 the next match is a day after so we will involve ourselves in some team activity take a day off and comeback strong in the next match
5316927 playing to our strength and the urge to keep working hard against a quality opposition was the key
5316928 the indians were not taking any chance against mendis so we decided to hold him back and introduce other bowlers in the meantime
5316929 it was not easy to bat but i decided to see off the new bowl and bat through the overs
5316930 he is a very different bowler and even if you pick him up by the time you realise what bowl it is it gets late to play a big shot
5316931 now a days you will see batsmen who can play him but in one day cricket it is not only about playing him you also have to rotate the strike because you do not want a bowler to end up bowling 10 overs and may be 20 runs
5316932 we need to find a way in which we can rotate singles if not play the big shot take singles take few from him mendis few from murali and look to attack others
5316933 you got to have something on the board you cannot really score 180 or 200 runs and look to defend that so you have to get a decent score for which we have to score from each and every bowler
5316934 it is important to get a good start because the two games that we have played against sri lanka when mendis was playing we were never off to a good start
5316935 we were off to a good start in asia cup but we lost quick wickets and after that when you are playing mendis you have to save wickets and you have to get the runs as well so it gets a bit tough when you have to rotate the strike you have to save wickets if the bowler is as unusual as mendis
5316936 even when murali was here some years back 7 or 8 years back it was really difficult and everybody was talking about murali but with time i think it will get a bit easy but i think mendis is a bit more unusual than muralitharan
5316937 we may look at a different composition and a different combination for the next game it is at a very initial stage we have just gone through this game we will have a look and whatever fits the team the best we will decide on that

5316973 every man under my command owes me 100 nazi scalps and yall will git get me 100 nazi scalps taken from the heads of 100 dead nazis or die trying
5316974 it is not just the scalping or the carving of swastikas in foreheads or the shooting of a german officers testicles or the slow strangling scene all shown with tarantinos customary love of detail that is likely to upset the german nation and its critics
5316975 it is the whole idea of turning the second world war into a comic book adventure in which not a single german character has redeeming value

5316987 it is funny though because it does happen oasis insult another band every single time they put out an album and the last two albums its been us

5316990 sonian was looking for both cost effective and scalable computing power that reduced time to market for their digital content archiving offering
5316991 having the vertica analytic database available on demand in amazon ec2 enables software as a service innovators like sonian to give customers faster more affordable and more scalable access to business analytic data
5316992 sarbanes oxley and other federal and industry mandates are going to continue to drive the need to effectively archive digital content

5317001 looks like it was a good toss to lose but i would have still batted if i had won the toss
5317002 first 45 minutes would always have been tough but if you have got through that period and got 225 runs on board it would have been a much tougher score to chase down on this
5317003 it was not easy wicket even when we were batting it was not easy with the new ball but we managed to get through which is the most important
5317004 it was a very good one day wicket because with the new ball it wicket is going to do a bit there is a bit bounce on it there is a bit of dew for the first eight overs maximum but after that there is a seam moment but that seam was there when we were batting
5317005 the burden of revenge i carried the darkness i was capable of

5317034 the materialistic civilization of our age has so much absorbed the energy and interest of mankind that people in general do no longer feel the necessity of raising themselves above the forces and conditions of their daily material existence there is not sufficient demand for things that we should call spiritual to differentiate them from the needs and requirements of our physical existence

5317085 were properly addressed by relevant authorities or departments through consultations
5317086 we would like some transparency regarding who those citizens were what their issues were and how the chinese government has supposedly resolved those issues because we have justifiable concern about the whereabouts and safety of those individuals given that there have been several documented incidents in which chinese citizens who have legally applied have gone missing and are potentially in detention

5317092 greys anatomy is all about the surgery and private practice this season were honing in on really making it a show that the stories tell more of the ethical dilemmas that our doctors have to face

5317102 what a great occasion to celebrate little league baseball in mount vernon
5317103 i want the coaches players and manager to know how proud we are of their accomplishment not only in their season but also at the great lakes regional tournament prior to this team participating in the tournament i would be very surprised if many people outside of the state of ohio wouldnt even know where mount vernon is thanks to these young men and the media of television there are now hundreds of thousands of people throughout the united states that do know where mount vernon is they also now know the top notch baseball that is played in the state of ohio
5317104 i would like to thank the community for their support
5317105 we had two teams the 12 year olds and the 15 year olds step into territory thats never been stepped in before
5317106 the announcer after the last game said boys you may have just played in the greatest game ever played on this field i havent watched much baseball in the great lakes but if there is a game that is better than that id like for them to show it to me i have never seen a youth baseball game better than what we saw there
5317107 we couldnt have done this without the support we received
5317108 another characteristic of this team is that they never quit
5317109 we won two games in the state tournament where we had to come from behind this team stayed even keel throughout all 24 games that we played they never quit and it really paid off
5317110 the regional was a new experience we got to have some quality time for about 12 days
5317111 these kids revealed the most important thing during those 12 days they are real class acts they showed a lot of character never once did i ever see our players cause trouble they were where they were supposed to be on time and they got along great together that is quite a chore for that length of time i felt like when we got to that final game a lot of the volunteer workers had an appreciation for mount vernon because of the way these kids conducted themselves there
5317112 the united states supported the transition to democratic government in pakistan and respects the results of the election

5317118 porque un ni o nos es nacido hijo nos es dado y el principado sobre su hombro y se llamar su nombre admirable consejero dios fuerte padre eterno pr ncipe de paz
5317119 padre eterno es una expresi n idiom tica que describe la relaci n del mes as con el tiempo no con las otras personas de la trinidad significa que siempre ha existido
5317120 yo he venido en nombre de mi padre y no me recib s si otro viniere en su propio nombre a se recibir is
5317121 es importante notar que el nombre del padre es jes s porque este nombre revela totalmente y expresa al padre
5317122 yo he venido en nombre de mi padre y no me recib s si otro viniera en su propio nombre a se recibir is
5317123 entonces dijo david al filisteo t vienes a m con espada y lanza y jabalina mas yo vengo a ti en el nombre de jehov de los ej rcitos el dios de los escuadrones de israel a quien t has provocado
5317124 por lo cual dios tambi n le exalt hasta lo sumo y le dio un nombre que es sobre todo nombre 2 10 para que en el nombre de jes s se doble toda rodilla de los que est n en los cielos y en la tierra y debajo de la tierra 2 11 y toda lengua confiese que jesucristo es el se or para gloria de dios padre
5317125 en la gram tica griega muy similar a la espa ola significa el nombre que le pertenece a jes s se trata de posesi n no de identificaci n

5317143 we said were not here to win one or two bouts were here to earn a gold medal
5317144 lomachenko scored at will then coasted through the fourth round in apparent deference to his host after getting the tournaments single most difficult draw lomachenko has beaten world champion albert selimov former olympic medalist bahodirjon sultonov and the talented li by a combined 39 11
5317145 it inspired me and also put a little more pressure on me because i didnt want them to come all this way and not qualify
5317146 but balance on the board is something were taught on a daily basis im not too pleased
5317147 personally i dont think china should strive to win so many gold medals
5317148 coming in second or third place in gold medals is good enough im just worried that others may look at us as being cocky if we win too many
5317149 this was the most important medal of all for chinese people
5317150 its different from pingpong or diving in track and field you are competing against the whole world when liu won we felt on top of the world all the other medals are small compared to this one
5317151 behind the medals count everybodys excited to see chinas athletes in the lead as well as american swimmer michael phelps achievement of breaking world records and winning eight golds but were even happier to see the competitors from more countries and regions climb on top of the medals podium
5317152 its very misleading to see what the official media are presenting
5317153 people feel very strongly about winning when the games are over youll see a burst of patriotism
5317154 if we put up photos of all the medal winners there would be too many
5317155 capousek said he was angered when he learned the chinese language version of his contract required that he win gold medals the americans seem unlikely to overtake china in gold and likely have a better chance of leading the overall table
5317156 this wont be the last time we see china perform at this level in the olympics
5317157 china is making a long term commitment to its olympics sports
5317158 the idea of this ep was birthed when we wrote and recorded the song faster still from 2007s secrets keep you sick we all love the song and the fact that it displayed a whole new side of

5317227 in musicals in particular if they are done well i think it can be tremendously exciting to be so close to the voices and the actors after all all you are hearing at drury lane in the west end are electronic sound waves from a giant public address system
5317228 because i havent fulfilled my duty in the bedroom yet
5317229 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5317230 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5317231 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5317232 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5317233 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5317234 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5317235 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5317236 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5317237 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5317238 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5317239 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5317240 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5317241 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5317242 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5317243 ceea ce inseamna fie ca efodul de in a lasat sa i se vada organele genitale iar david nu a facut nimic sa impiedice acest lucru sau nu si a dat seama fie ca el
5317244 in plus gestul de expunere a organelor genitale nu era considerat nicidecum obscen pe vremea aia pana la urma oamenii de atunci jurau cu mana pe testicule penis era cel mai puternic juramant
5317245 aha nu ti place apai nici n ai s o mai vezi
5317246 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5317247 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5317248 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5317249 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5317250 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5317251 the only one with significant size is at 30 hectares it is about 55 kms northeast of fort st john by the osborn river
5317252 we have one that has burned four hectares and that is located at the red deer river about 200 kms southeast of tumbler ridge and we have air tankers actioning it with two initial attack crews three per crew and one 20 person unit crew en route

5317255 we have to pick here and there what weve got to eat
5317256 but the foods good theyve got all kinds of varieties

5317258 im able to watch an athlete on tv and think i fueled that person for the event of a lifetime
5317259 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5317260 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5317261 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5317262 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5317263 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5317264 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5317265 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5317266 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5317267 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5317268 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5317269 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5317270 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5317271 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5317272 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5317273 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5317274 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5317275 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5317276 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5317277 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5317278 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5317279 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5317280 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5317281 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5317282 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5317283 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5317284 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5317285 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5317286 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5317287 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5317288 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5317289 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5317290 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5317291 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5317292 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5317293 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5317294 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5317295 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5317296 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5317297 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5317298 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5317299 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5317300 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5317301 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5317302 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5317303 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5317304 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5317305 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5317306 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5317307 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5317308 who are open to doing something on the production side
5317309 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5317310 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5317311 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5317312 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5317313 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5317314 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5317315 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5317316 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5317317 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5317318 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5317319 yes dragon age origins will be coming to consoles in the near future yes
5317320 so did you do any cloud computing over the weekend
5317321 this training program was initiated because in terms of the tunes nowadays the liturgical hymns are out of control and they need to be controlled
5317322 but band songs destroy the beauty depth and spirituality of liturgy
5317323 need to control the use of musical instruments in the liturgical celebration
5317324 there will be no more loud tunes but union and harmony in tunes is a must to express the depth of spirituality
5317325 the liturgical hymns must express that the eucharist is the mystery and the center of our life

5317369 the province of louisiana had been divided on 16 may 1722 into three spiritual jurisdictions the first comprising all the country from the mouth of the mississippi to the wabash and west of the mississippi was allowed to the capuchins whose superior was to be vicar general of the bishop of quebec and was to reside in new orleans the second extended north from the wabash and belonged to the jesuits whose superior residing in the illinois country was also to be vicar general of the bishop of quebec in that department the third comprised all the country east of the mississippi from the sea to the wabash and was given to the carmelites whose superior was also vicar general and resided usually at mobile the capuchins took possession of their district in 1722 the jesuits had already been in theirs a long time the jurisdiction of the carmelites was added to that of the capuchins on 19 december 1722 and the former returned to france in december 1723 the jurisdiction of the capuchins was restricted to the country on both sides of the river from natchez south to the sea as the capuchins were not very numerous it was however decided in 1725 that no monks or priests could attend churches or missions within the jurisdiction of the capuchins without the consent of the latter a little later the spiritual care of all the savages in the province was given to the jesuits and their superior was allowed to reside in new orleans provided he performed no ecclesiastical functions without the consent of the capuchins several jesuits arrived in new orleans with the ursuline nuns and father de beaubois soon became their superior it was the jesuits who in 1751 introduced the sugar cane into louisiana from hispaniola they cultivated on their plateau the sugar cane indigo and the myrtle wax shrub

5317432 youre definitely going to see more independence on this album i got to work with different people and learn what their habits were and what works well with me
5317433 so youll see a difference in vocals a little bit more personality and its definitely a sensual album
5317434 i definitely think that when i first heard the song from the beginning of the record you kind of feel like you know im leaving it up to you
5317435 and by the time it gets to the second verse and makes it to the end of the song it just feels like im saying i dont want to put up with it anymore
5317436 it was a great first single for me because it said something i fell in love with records like beyonc s irreplaceable where you could emotionally attach yourself to the record as soon as you heard it

5317446 both bowdoin and the marines taught me that service has no political party no original location the marines taught me strength vigilance and discipline they opened my eyes to the dangers that most of our citizenry never think about and the honor that comes with service
5317447 bowdoin taught me the values of activism debate intellectual curiosity and the importance of political participation each of these values helped instill in me the common notion that if we really want to help change our communities big and small we must get involved respect each other and never give up on our visions for tomorrow

5317461 ziro the hutt is perhaps the most bizarre character ever created in the series history yes including jar jar a jabba shaped slug who wears face paint and feathers the creature speaks english rather than huttese except that he she somehow has the accent of truman capote by way of eric cartman of south park
5317462 i found it impossible to concentrate on much of anything she he was saying except to imagine that all of this would one day make for a great book entitled in cold hutt naturally

5317517 in other words you know the woods not coming from a rain forest in south america
5317518 when you put all these things together you use less materials initially and over the life of the building you use less energy
5317519 the money that they save each month in utility bills is money that can be spent on the childrens health and safety and school supplies and all the other things that families need

5317538 what has been called the long war is likely to be many years of persistent engaged combat all around the world in differing degrees of size and intensity this generational campaign cannot be wished away or put on a timetable there are no exit strategies to paraphrase the bolshevik leon trotsky we may not be interested in the long war but the long war is interested in us
5317539 for the foreseeable future winning the long war against violent extremist movements will be the central objective of the u

5317546 customers find mobile broadband easy to use and install but transmission speeds and to a lesser extent network coverage reduce the initial enjoyment of getting up and running

5317553 however in england a lot of very large hospitals took part in the study whereas in ireland while we had a large number of teaching hospitals we also had some smaller hospitals and larger hospitals tend to have more high risk patients who are more susceptible to hcais
5317554 if a patient takes an antibiotic sometimes this can kill off the good bacteria in the bowel and that allows bugs such as c diff to multiply and in some patients this can also lead to c diff infection
5317555 some people may complain of nausea and appetite may be reduced and they may have crampy abdominal pain but in general most have diarrhoea
5317556 it is important to remember that most patients recover completely from c diff however in a small percentage of patients the infection causes an inflammation of the bowel colitis and that can be very serious but again it is more serious in the high risk groups of patients
5317557 both conditions if they are associated with death are recorded on death certs or if they are a contributing factor they are also meant to be recorded but sometimes it is not straightforward as people who get c diff can be very sick also so they might be other reasons as to why they may die and c diff or mrsa may not be the major reason

5317587 the next generation of americans will know less than their parents did about our history and founding ideals
5317588 knowing what america stands for is not a genetic inheritance
5317589 it must be learned both by the next generation and by those who come to this country in this way a nation founded on an idea is inherently fragile
5317590 students should first be taught about americas great heroes dramatic achievements and high ideals so they can put its failings in perspective
5317591 americas great public documents and speeches and books with compelling narratives

5317603 in 2000 the small grants programme gave the community two female buffaloes which subsequently were bred and the 30 families in the revitalisation programme now have additional buffaloes
5317604 using the manure in the rice fields and selling the excess for 15 baht 45 cents per 10kg sack in the past some farmers used as many as 10 sacks of fertiliser per 10 rai 1 6 hectares of rice fields but now they use only two sacks per 10 rai
5317605 here they are 72 000 baht 2 150 not counting fuel costs while a large buffalo is only 25 000 baht 746
5317606 and unlike the tractor if you invest in buffaloes they multiply
5317607 and things are getting better because we now hire out the buffaloes at 150 baht 4 50 per rai so we can earn about 400 baht 11 25 per day

5317613 these persons expressed the wish to return to laos of their own accord after negotiations with the thai officials proved that their demands could not be met
5317614 the thai side thereafter facilitated their return in a dignified and humane manner
5317615 we would like to help the thai authorities in the screening process to determine if any of the hmong refugees are eligible for refugee status and able to stay in thailand
5317616 if an outside agency were allowed access it could add transparency to the whole process
5317617 the level of anxiety is extremely high among the hmong
5317618 if the international community does not react firmly against this return then this process of repatriation will continue without any external control nor humanitarian assistance for the returnees
5317619 in spite of having not signed the convention they have been very hospitable to refugees mckinsey said
5317620 thailand has hosted 1 2 million refugees over the past 30 years so that shouldnt be forgotten

5317625 i have sold food for 40 years here and times have never been this hard for us
5317626 i have five employees working for me and each week i struggle to pay their wages
5317627 transportation and food cost a lot more although i dont suffer as much as the poor i have to cut down a lot on unnecessary expenditures especially on food ive stopped eating out at restaurants and increasingly use public transportation
5317628 in the next two years we are looking at how we can solve the food crisis problem and relate it to opportunities
5317629 all of these related agricultural products fertilisers pesticides and animal feed will be in the frame of the preferential trade agreement so exporting and importing will be facilitated by this cooperation
5317630 to delay concerted action on this great challenge of our time is to court disaster
5317631 the least we can do in our respective countries is to strive for national food self reliance that will support the domestic economy and meet the food requirements of the peoples
5317632 in the longer run food production increases country by country are clearly in the best interests of all populations
5317633 self sufficiency and assuring national food supplies are now recognised by the world bank and other international organisations as very critical steps for national development
5317634 in many of the countries small hold farming is being discouraged in the name of big farms and corporate agriculture
5317635 the d 8 countries should agree on policy that promotes agriculture right from the small farm to the broader level production of food crops
5317636 they are not enthusiastic about increasing food production especially at the expense of high production costs since prices of food commodities are not attractive
5317637 increase in food production does not directly translate into an increase in a farmers welfare
5317638 all the mangrove forests are gone and coastal erosion keeps getting worse especially during the monsoon season
5317639 im not sure how long my family and i can live here
5317640 we desperately need help before we lose the whole district to the sea
5317641 the authorities need to listen to the particular plight of each community and adopt solutions that are best suited for individual coastal areas
5317642 if mangrove forest encroachment continues the land will sooner or later be washed into the sea
5317643 i rely on my buffaloes because the tractor is now so much more costly given fuel prices i use them for ploughing for their manure and for cash when needed
5317644 one application of manure can last two or three years if applied correctly i want to use less and less chemical fertiliser because it costs so much
5317645 only a small percentage of these are being used as draft animals
5317646 the rest are multi purpose for the manure and for income when sold as meat
5317647 some 80 percent of thai farms are rain fed and small scale and most are now less that two 12 rai or three hectares 18 rai
5317648 we use the buffaloes more now for ploughing because of the high cost of tractors
5317649 fertiliser consumption of other foods for the family and for making merit giving financial offerings at the local buddhist temple
5317650 if you have 60 000 baht to buy a tractor in 10 years time it is no longer good but with that money you can buy six buffaloes or so and they will have offspring to sell for cash and manure instead of fertiliser cambodia questions over legality of evictions in name of development donors
5317651 we now have 43 medical stations each with one or more ambulances staffed by emergency medical technicians and pre hospital emergency response nurses
5317652 is to establish a database on these issues as most of the countries in the region dont have a statistical data collection system or adequate information to show how big a problem trauma actually is
5317653 we have also hosted with the support of the government who and jica numerous medical delegations from 11 neighbouring countries to visit our trauma and critical care centre and study our emergency response system
5317654 through the oscc we are the first hospital in the region to provide assistance to children and women who have been abused either through sexual abuse or domestic violence 10 years ago there was no such service

5317658 during those 10 seconds your brain is doing something that computers cannot do
5317659 these new figures by erg are a strong indication that the review of the roaming regulation also has to tackle the issue of per second billing
5317660 to look at it in that amount of detail would prevent operators from having any flexibility
5317661 this shows there continues to be a worrying lack of competition in the roaming market
5317662 but once they get to a certain size they get a lot of interest from multinationals
5317663 australia is not the easiest market there have been times when fast growing australian it companies had to let go of some of their equity and bring in venture capitalists so individual stakes got diluted
5317664 our early start means were not facing the same compliance costs others in the sector are facing under the national greenhouse and energy reporting act
5317665 instead were focusing on the commercial opportunities for us rather than dealing with the compliance costs
5317666 were well positioned to make money from carbon markets which is simply an extension of our energy trading business
5317667 we have a solid understanding of the market and how to help our customers
5317668 the train has left the station on this and there will be severe repercussions for those who fail to see the inevitable coming
5317669 no one says its easy but carbon will have to be managed as just another business issue
5317670 we understood what it meant to measure our carbon footprint it was extremely difficult to get landlords to change their behaviour
5317671 we ended up spending the money ourselves to install sensors in offices change our light bulbs and employ our own cleaners so we could recycle
5317672 it was also a challenge convincing suppliers that we were serious about the carbon impact of production processes in our purchasing decisions
5317673 we made a conscious decision to pay more for more efficiently produced consumables and to include the long term carbon impact in equipment running costs
5317674 tnt has the largest fleet of diesel electric vehicles in australia we bought the whole production line from japan of 10 vehicles last year but we have 1500 trucks in our fleet
5317675 so its going to be some time before our suppliers can produce enough trucks to satisfy the demand
5317676 we started talking to them in 2002 to map out initial requirements and beijing became the first olympiad to have 16m by 9m screens
5317677 we can make screens whatever size is required but ultimately we supply according to the request of the venue owner and bocog
5317678 like bocog a few years ago panasonic is already in initial talks with the organising committees of the next winter and summer games
5317679 its much too early for any decisions from britain too but a temporary large screen will be installed in london to show the games handover ceremony from beijing
5317680 in all of our stores hdtv sales are up between 10 per cent and 40 per cent and probably by at least 40 per cent in the last few weeks
5317681 it is the only product i can think of at the moment that is selling like hotcakes
5317682 its almost not worth putting standard definition televisions on the floor even at 89 people are just not interested
5317683 channel seven is using their own equipment and not ours
5317684 we have 44 feeds in total including four beauty shots for various sceneries
5317685 were excited about what more can be done for future games
5317686 people often talk about this as the internet service revolution
5317687 that will eventually lead to machines that have lots of server capacity lots of low cost computing low cost storage and that will let us write software in an even more ambitious way eliminating the last constraints we have
5317688 to encompass all interactive techniques the touch the speech the vision
5317689 because theyre fairly developed in the labs i can say that in 10 years will be widespread
5317690 you might get artificial intelligence or robotics but those are still so undeveloped at least in widespread impact
5317691 it really is a milestone i think and shows the world this opportunity to all work together and how places like hong kong and china will be such an important part of the future
5317692 whether its software or energy or agriculture the promise of science is much greater than ever before and thats why im so optimistic
5317693 once companies get a bit down the carbon reduction path they want to build a granular view of individual product footprints
5317694 its not really happening here yet but retailers in the us and britain are definitely pushing for it
5317695 tesco in britain for example wants to enable consumers to compare products not just on price or content but on the carbon created in getting that item to the shelf
5317696 you may find a product is generating little profit yet the manufacturing process creates a lot of carbon you may conclude its no longer feasible to retain that product line
5317697 in other cases modelling will allow you to see where components such as packaging or transport could be outsourced to suppliers using green energy
5317698 we saw several years ago that the next evolution of adaptive supply chains would be around adjusting to low carbon sources not just low cost manufacturing countries
5317699 tenants were asking how green their buildings were and owners are now aspiring to achieve five or six star ratings for their properties
5317700 we realised owners needed to be able to report their emissions and decided to build a product that would capture the data and put it into a format for reporting
5317701 one of the key requirements under the act is comparability between companies within a sector
5317702 in this way we can see which companies are doing well and which need to put more effort into reducing emissions
5317703 the call sheet itself is a document distributed to the crew and cast to let them know what is going on for the next day
5317704 these documents are manually keyed in beforehand and distributed to different assistant directors so they can do planning and discuss what is feasible but everything is so dynamic it keeps changing every day from a scene to a prop or when things go wrong
5317705 if a call sheet has to be manually entered it is pretty much what the production co ordinator would be doing for the entire day
5317706 the main thing is that the production co ordinator who usually generates the call sheet will be able at the click of a button to select which day they want to generate the call sheet and within seconds receive all the information consolidated from different sources
5317707 we will be improving different modules for example so the production manager will be able to manage the crew in a more efficient manner through our scheduling tool
5317708 currently we are building a set of tools for the film industry and particularly for production companies in australia such as porchlight
5317709 sou extremamente irrequieta e no meu trabalho vejo uma tranq ilidade que n o sei de onde vem quem v parece uma planta

5317711 suppose both sides of the relationship rise sharply in price
5317712 we own a put on one and a call on the other the call would profit handsomely while the put can only lose a fixed amount of money so this second way of making money works even if the two entities dont converge in price
5317713 people generally decide against creativity because the creative way often is too painful at least in the short run it doesnt have to be this way lets change it
5317714 you know things will look so different on the way back it will be like we are on a new trail keep your eyes open and you might see some amazing things
5317715 listen to your life see it for the fathomless mystery that it is in the boredom and pain of it no less than in the excitement and gladness touch taste smell your way to the holy and hidden heart of it because in the last analysis all moments are key moments and life itself is grace
5317716 the action at armstrongs hill has largely been forgotten you cannot find armstrongs hill mentioned anywhere in the official records and only in a handful of regimentals however this was a savage two hour battle with important results for the siege of knoxville and surprising parallels to the assault on little round top at gettysburg the numbers in both actions were roughly equal and the confederate participants were the same in both the terrain is markedly similar on both fields although the slope of little round top is certainly rockier the confederates mounted a spirited assault in both instances only to be driven back here the similarities end little round top has been the subject of story poetry and canvas for 125 years while armstrongs hill has been relegated to obscurity

5317749 its so important because they get to bring their backpacks full of supplies and put them at their seats and then put away their scissors and their crayons in the appropriate places
5317750 so then when they come in on monday everything is in place and they know where to go
5317751 the kids get here on the first day of school and the first thing they do is look around and see if they know someone else in the room
5317752 and when they do see someone it instantly makes them more comfortable
5317753 now the moms can bring the video cameras and take their pictures then they can give them great big hugs and say their goodbyes and the kids are all ready to learn
5317754 my kids go to st joseph preschool and even though they are just going to the classroom next door they have to get used to doing things differently and the longer days and being able to come early helps
5317755 we know each step of the day and it definitely decreases anxiety for both me and the kids
5317756 they really do well with school and i think its because with them being so close in age each one is getting the next one ready

5317773 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5317827 we are seeing a new realism among businesses about the need to weather the current economic conditions with projected staff and capital investment both significantly down on this time last year
5317828 we expect the slowdown to be at its worst towards the end of 2008 and into early 2009
5317829 we also expect inflation to start falling back from early 2009 allowing the bank of england room to cut interest rates throughout 2009
5317830 nevertheless overall the performance of uk plc through 2009 is likely to be the weakest growth since 1992 when the economy grew by just 0 3 per cent however towards the end of 2009 providing wage inflation stays low economic activity looks likely to pick up
5317831 whilst a marked slowdown in activity is likely over the next 18 months even if interest rates are cut when inflation peaks the correct policy decisions are still needed to ward off the threats of a serious and prolonged recession
5317832 the longer the mpc waits before cutting rates the bigger the danger that the economic situation would deteriorate

5317955 centrism is the philosophy of the american media and that essentially backs the status quo when youre a centrist and this game of objectivity that they play is really limited by parameters that youre allowed to ask questions and to investigate and in a sense then youre transmitting these assumptions and reinforcing every day that the us is really a functioning democracy

5317963 if we examine the subject we can experience that the people lived with a non functional image and a fake situation for years they lived in a fantasia with the lullabies of the religious and political leaders nobody mentioned them about the realities and they did not prepare themselves for a possible solution in reality most of the emigrants stand todays realities and they were shocked when they visited the occupied areas after the check points were opened some of them could not stand todays realities and they caught psychological diseases
5317964 the reality for the turkish cypriots is that the relations were different before 1960 because during those times there was not any power sharing problem there were only same daily problems the situation has been changed after 1960

5317982 it is obviously disappointing not to be selected and you want to be playing for your country
5317983 but if mr capello doesnt put you in the squad then we have to go out like on sunday and prove him wrong and i think we myself and ashley young did that today
5317984 that is all you can do really all we can do is play good football for our clubs it is out of our hands whether or not we are selected
5317985 mr capello does come to villa quite a lot and i am not going to give up we have just got to keep doing the business for our club that is all we can do
5317986 then if he doesnt want to pick us he doesnt want to pick us
5317987 but i want to play for my country ive played for the under 21s and i want to be in the full squad i want to get on the pitch and play and hopefully i can do that
5317988 but at the moment all i can do is my best for villa and if i get picked i get picked
5317989 it has been a great week it couldnt have gone much better hopefully that can continue and i can sign many more contracts at the club
5317990 it will be good to sign ashley as well there are a lot of players that he oneill wants signed up so the more he can do that the better
5317991 with the guys who werent available it was a big ask for us at villa we played ched evans in place of valeri his first premier league debut
5317992 he has got a great future in the game but it is a big ask to expect these young kids to carry the flag at the moment

5318031 weve made an offer to southampton for andrew davies which has been accepted
5318032 hes a good young player whos got some ability and some experience in the premier league
5318033 andrew has been out injured since my arrival and i have not seen him play
5318034 his agent has been keen for him to complete a deal away from the club and if players and agents feel that way then it doesnt help the rest of the team
5318035 andrew is one of the high earners at the club and the financial pressures that have been placed on us by the bank have not been made secret
5318036 have it on very good authority that benni mccarthy and anton ferdinand will be lining up at whl on saaturday for sunderland mccarthy will cost arpund 9 million and ferdinand will cost around 7 million
5318037 when i was left out of the wales squad i was gutted i want to be playing for wales scoring goals and doing well i want to make my mark
5318038 but really what happened was caused by what happened at derby i was not playing there and there was a knock on effect
5318039 the move to forest has lifted a huge weight from my shoulders it was made difficult for me at derby impossible really
5318040 i felt i was never going to be allowed to do well so i needed to move and i have done that
5318041 i felt i was not going to get a chance i was left sitting and watching and thinking there must be more than football causing the problem
5318042 i was trying my best to do well but i knew after the first few months that i needed to move
5318043 i felt i should have been playing scoring goals and doing well but i was not on the pitch to be allowed to do that
5318044 sometimes people just do not fit in and will be gone soon that is how it was at derby for me i knew i had to move on
5318045 then someone was prepared to pay good money for me and that gave me a hell of a lift
5318046 as soon as forest got promoted they were prepared to spend the money and i was told i was their number one choice
5318047 even at the end at derby i got the chance to say goodbye to the fans in the right way i played against arsenal late in the season and scored a goal that really pleased me
5318048 the fans at derby were brilliant to me and when i got that goal against one of the best teams in the country i was saying to them this is what i can do
5318049 this is what i am about it was a farewell and i wanted to finish off on a high against one of the best teams i could then move on
5318050 i never thought that wales would not happen again for me i felt hard done by and decided just to keep going and hope for a change
5318051 it was really all about moving club basically leaving derby the last month has been brilliant for me i have enjoyed my time at nottingham forest a very good club and a very good manager
5318052 all of a sudden things have changed around in just a few months for me
5318053 i want to do well for wales again i am 27 now and want to be playing until my late 30s like kevin phillips dion dublin and teddy sheringham
5318054 so for me this is the beginning of the second half of my career now i have got to do well and enjoy things
5318055 i have to prove something to john toshack if i do well then i believe i can stay in the squad
5318056 i feel refreshed ive had a good season and am really enjoying life again
5318057 it is not doom and gloom any more i feel like a new flower it was a massive shock to be left out by wales i had to look a few times at the squad to believe it
5318058 but it made me think about making decisions about my career where i was going and the need to move on i am just happy to be back involved
5318059 my club career needed to be sorted out and then came the axe from wales and i was gutted really shocked
5318060 if i do well for wales it will help me at forest i need to be consistent now for club and country and i have to make it impossible to leave me out
5318061 have it on very good authority that benni mccarthy and anton ferdinand will be lining up at whl on saaturday for sunderland mccarthy will cost arpund 9 million and ferdinand will cost around 7 million
5318062 only time will tell to what extent the chinese economy will decouple from the rest of the world but we can clearly see some differentiation in the economic performance of china the main driver of our volume growth and the developed world
5318063 the slowdown in china also seems to be concentrated in the light manufacturing sector for those economies that are in the heavy sectors those economies that are driven by local investment and local consumption were seeing a strong performance and outlook
5318064 people are way too optimistic and have been way too optimistic for years on the speed at which new projects can deliver new volumes
5318065 weve got very thin underlying fundamental changes that have given rise to these price changes

5318360 we were quite lucky our activities often fell between periods of overcast and rainy skies we proved that sainte rose en bleu has great potential its the planting of an extraordinary seed for laval and the district to become a tourist attraction
5318361 to their credit they were put into a slot that wasnt familiar in a festival that was coming in with new approaches but this will change we have a desire to attract more young people to concerts such as these so well move the event to the weekend next year
5318362 to see quebecois de souche traditional quebecers dancing to the folk music of lebanon or greece you couldnt buy that with all the money in the world it was harmony and amity thats always sought but not always found and yet it was an important part of this years festival and well give it even more importance next year
5318363 it was really wonderful to speak and hear our words in the solemnity of the church especially for people who wouldnt usually take part in literary evenings
5318364 we have to give young people more opportunities to do and perform and increase the things they can discover during the unfolding of the festival well have to give flight to our imagination to accomplish these needed changes
5318365 some changes like abandoning the inflatable games for children were not entirely lost
5318366 we have nothing to envy montreal for with respect to the quality and scope of our fireworks
5318367 it all started here at salle andr mathieu and its here that it continues to roll with love
5318368 hes the most difficult to shoot he makes me laugh so hard i have to stop listening to him as i have to do with the others they are so good that they could keep me there right to the end of their shows but my work forces me to be in many places within short periods of time another show a football game a fire
5318369 its incredible what technology has brought to photography in just four years the quality has improved beyond belief and you always have to be on the lookout for more technological changes just to keep up
5318370 but the challenge hasnt changed you still have to adapt and adjust to each performer without neglecting the sets and lights that go with the show its the reason why i foster good relations with the technicians working at the hall you also have to find the best vantage points without conspicuously parading in the concert hall people dont pay good money to hear the clic clics of your camera over their shoulders i understand and appreciate their sentiments
5318371 i also have to mention the 18 helicopter flights i go on each year for one of my specialties aerial photography and of course there was the metro the little kid who used to collect model trains found himself in the tunnels to record for posterity the building of the laval subway extension what a thrill
5318372 my work its an amusement park i love to put people at ease its the quality of the picture thats at stake its the important thing

5318664 this years report card shines a harsh and frankly unflattering light on the attitudes we canadians have concerning mental health
5318665 in some ways mental illness is the final frontier of socially acceptable discrimination
5318666 can you imagine the public uproar if mental health was replaced with race gender or religion
5318667 these figures show clearly the insidious stigma still associated with mental health and mental illness
5318668 these are the attitudes that have kept mental health on the outside for far too long
5318669 these findings indicate that the worrying trend of have and have not patients continues

5318729 its a decades spanning story that starts during world war ii and goes all the way up to when magneto conquered the world
5318730 the main early difference is that mutants emerged sooner and in greater numbers than they did in the mainstream marvel universe well see that reflected but there isnt a single key moment
5318731 a big part of it was what i just mentioned there were more mutants around for magneto to ally himself with
5318732 rather than just a small brotherhood of mutants he was able to raise a full fledged army and use it for conquest
5318733 in terms of temperament and philosophy theyre basically the same person in different circumstances
5318734 im approaching the character as if he were the same man weve always seen obviously informed by somewhat different experiences but at heart the same individual
5318735 his power for one thing and the fact that no one else seems to be as capable
5318736 but he doesnt go unchallenged for the role of top dog in our first issue he has to battle apocalypse for leadership of the mutant rebellion
5318737 he unites mutantkind by liberating mutants from oppression or captivity then allowing them to join his ranks
5318738 as for opposition it primarily comes from humanity who have deadly operatives of their own like bucky the deadliest man on earth and the soviet super soldiers
5318739 among mutants theres the aforementioned apocalypse who isnt about to give up the throne easily and where will charles xavier stand
5318740 the title refers to the civil war between mutantkind and humanity one that can pit brother against brother or parent against child
5318741 editor bill rosemann asked if i was interested and when i heard the premise magneto takes over the world i couldnt say no
5318742 the art is by andrea divito who i collaborated with on world war hulk x men and hes bringing the same dynamic art and all out action readers saw there

5318755 david sent messengers from the wilderness to greet our master but he screamed insults at them these men have been very good to us and we never suffered any harm from them nothing was stolen from us the whole time they were with us in fact day and night they were like a wall of protection to us and the sheep you need to know this and figure out what to do for there is going to be trouble for our master and his whole family hes so ill tempered that no one can even talk to him
5318756 a lot of good it did to help this fellow we protected his flocks in the wilderness and nothing he owned was lost or stolen but he has repaid me evil for good may god strike me and kill me if even one man of his household is still alive tomorrow morning
5318757 i accept all blame in this matter my lord please listen to what i have to say i know nabal is a wicked and ill tempered man please dont pay any attention to him he is a fool just as his name suggests but i never even saw the young men you sent

5318759 return home in peace i have heard what you said we will not kill your husband
5318760 praise the l ord who has avenged the insult i received from nabal and has kept me from doing it myself nabal has received the punishment for his sin

5318794 ik kom tot u met een teken van uw heer ik zal u uit klei de vorm van een vogel maken dan adem ik daarin en hij zal een vogel worden door allahs gebod en ik genees de blinden en de melaatsen en doe de doden herleven en ik deel u mede wat gij zult eten en wat gij in uw huizen zult opslaan voorzeker daarin is voor u een teken indien gij gelovigen zijt
5318795 wij zijn de helpers van allah wij geloven in allah en getuigt gij dat wij moslims zijn
5318796 onze heer wij geloven in hetgeen gij hebt geopenbaard en volgen deze boodschapper schrijf ons onder hen die getuigen
5318797 o jezus ik zal u doen sterven en u tot mij opheffen en u zuiveren van de ongelovigen en zal uw volgelingen tot de laatste dag over hen doen zegevieren die u niet geloven dan zal uw terugkeer tot mij zijn en ik zal onder u rechtspreken over datgeen waarin gij verschildet 56 doch de ongelovigen zal ik in deze wereld en in de volgende streng straffen en zij zullen geen helpers hebben
5318798 kom laat ons onze kinderen en uw kinderen en onze vrouwen en uw vrouwen en ons volk en uw volk roepen laat ons daarna vurig bidden en de vloek van allah roepen over degenen die liegen
5318799 o mensen van het boek komt tot n woord waarin wij met elkander overeenstemmen dat wij niemand dan allah aanbidden en dat wij niets met hem vereenzelvigen en dat sommigen onzer geen anderen tot goden nemen buiten allah
5318800 gelooft in hetgeen de gelovigen moslirns is geopenbaard in de vroege ochtendstond en verwerpt het aan het einde van de dag misschien keren zij wel terug
5318801 en gelooft niet behalve in hem die uw godsdienst belijdt
5318802 voorzeker de ware leiding is allahs leiding dat iemand zal worden gegeven als aan u werd gegeven anders zullen zij met u redetwisten bij uw heer
5318803 genade is in allahs hand hij schenkt deze aan wie hij wil
5318804 wij zijn niet aansprakelijk voor de zaak van de ongeletterden
5318805 voorwaar ik heb u het boek en de wijsheid geschonken en daarna zal een boodschapper tot u komen vervullend hetgeen bij u is in hem zult gij geloven en hem zult gij helpen
5318806 getuigt dan en ik ben met u onder de getuigen
5318807 wij geloven in allah en in hetgeen ons werd geopenbaard en hetgeen werd geopenbaard aan abraham isma l iza k jacob en de stammen en hetgeen aan mozes en jezus en de profeten door hun heer werd gegeven wij maken geen onderscheid tussen wie dan ook van hen aan hem alleen onderwerpen wij ons
5318808 komt met de torah en leest haar als gij waarachtig zijt
5318809 allah heeft de waarheid gesproken volgt daarom de godsdienst van abraham de oprechte hij behoorde niet tot de afgodendienaren
5318810 o mensen van het boek waarom verwerpt gij de tekenen van allah terwijl allah ziet hetgeen gij doet
5318811 o mensen van het boek waarom houdt gij de mensen af van het rechte pad van allah en wenst gij het krom te maken terwijl gij er getuige van zijt allah is niet onachtzaam over hetgeen gij doet
5318812 hebt gij verworpen nadat gij hadt geloofd ondergaat dan de straf omdat gij placht te verwerpen
5318813 zal het niet genoeg voor u zijn dat uw heer u met drie duizend nedergezonden engelen zal helpen 125 ja indien gij geduldig en rechtvaardit zijt en zij de ongelovigen u dadelijk in wilde vaart aanvallen zal uw heer u met vijf duizend nedergezonden engelen bijstaan
5318814 onze heer vergeef ons onze zonden en de buitensporigheden in ons gedrag en maak ons standvastig en help ons tegen het ongelovige volk
5318815 als de zaak in onze handen was geweest zouden wij hier niet hebben moeten vechten
5318816 indien gij in uw huizen waart gebleven zouden zij wie het strijden was bevolen zeker naar de plaats waar zij zouden sterven zijn gegaan opdat allah mocht beproeven wat in uw innerlijk was en louteren wat in uw hart was allah weet wat in het innerlijk is
5318817 waren zij bij ons gebleven zij zouden niet zijn gestorven of gedood opdat allah dit tot een oorzaak van wroeging in hun der ongelovigen hart moge maken allah geeft leven en veroorzaakt de dood allah ziet wat gij doet
5318818 als wij wisten dat het vechten was zouden wij u zeker hebben gevolgd
5318819 als zij ons hadden gehoorzaamd zouden zij niet zijn gedood
5318820 wendt dan de dood van uzelf af als gij waarheid spreekt
5318821 de volkeren hebben zich tegen u verzameld vreest hen daarom
5318822 allah is ons genoeg en hij is een uitstekende beschermer
5318823 allah heeft ons opgedragen in geen boodschapper te geloven voordat deze ons een offer brengt dat door het vuur wordt verteerd
5318824 er zijn reeds v r mij boodschappers tot u gekomen met duidelijke tekenen en met hetgeen waarover gij spreekt waarom trachttet gij hen dan te doden als gij eerlijk zijt
5318825 gij zult dit aan de mensen bekend maken en het niet verbergen
5318826 onze heer gij hebt dit niet tevergeefs geschapen neen heilig zijt gij red ons daarom van de straf van het vuur 192 onze heer wie gij het vuur doet ingaan hem hebt gij voorzeker vernederd en de onrechtvaardigen zullen geen helper vinden 193 onze heer wij hebben een prediker gehoord die opriep tot het geloof gelooft in de heer en wij hebben geloofd onze heer vergeef ons daarom onze zonden en bedek onze zwakheden en doe ons sterven met de rechtvaardigen 194 onze heer schenk ons hetgeen gij ons door uw boodschappers hebt beloofd en verneder ons niet op de dag der opstanding voorzeker gij breekt de belofte niet
5318827 ik zal het werk van iedere werker onder u hetzij man of vrouw niet verloren doen gaan gij behoort tot elkander en ik zal van hen die hun land verlieten en van hun huizen zijn verjaagd en voor mijn zaak zign vervolgd en die hebben gevochten en zijn gedood de fouten zeker bedekken en zal hen tuinen doen binnengaan waar doorheen rivieren stromen een beloning van allah en bij allah is de beste beloning

5318845 the researchers led by ingunn holen and based at the university of sheffield and kuopio university in finland set out to test whether a drug called zoledronic acid zol could enhance the effects of a standard chemotherapy drug called doxorubicin dox in mice that modelled early stage breast cancer their results are dox was developed as an anti cancer drug back in the 1960s and has since been used to treat a variety of different cancer types including both early and late stage breast cancer zol is a well established drug used to treat osteoporosis as it prevents the breakdown of bone it has also been used as a treatment for people with cancer that has spread to the bone including breast cancer that has spread the researchers tested dox and zol on their own in combination and in different orders they found that giving dox to mice with breast cancers followed 24 hours later by zol almost completely stopped these tumours from growing using the drugs individually or in the reverse order led to far less dramatic effects so how significant are these findings one of the really positive things to emerge from this study is that zol appears to enhance the effects of dox at least in mice this suggests that zol could be used in combination with dox as an improved treatment for early stage breast cancer in people completely new approach to treatment

5318856 it is around them so much they see it so much they hear it so much it is part of their language
5318857 i think we have to look at the reality 641 teenagers got pregnant in a year in spartanburg county
5318858 we have to make some serious changes in the education that we provide as a community and as a family throughout
5318859 what we are able to do is defined specifically by the law and it focuses on abstinence based education
5318860 it is a problem if it is 641 or 1
5318861 i think those kinds of decisions are best made by the parents who are involved with their children they need to be talking to kids about those kinds of things
5318862 the reduction from adolescent pregnancy just from this type of education is tremendous
5318863 i think it is a crisis that the churches must be aggressive in addressing compassionate but aggressive
5318864 i believe that it does within each family each family must know what they want to teach and what they want to address but the more education the less likely a child is to engage in sexual activities
5318865 you cant think that your child will be the one that wont make you know the bad choice
5318866 i pushed the washcloth in his belly button to give it a good scrub
5318867 well it didnt stop i was able to put half the cloth and my finger inside
5318868 the inside of his navel was extremely deep i fit an entire q tip inside i sent joey for a cat scan which showed that beyond the entrance and seven millimeters of epidermal duct the anatomical feature just disappears
5318869 based on the way it absorbed even x rays i determined that the innie is an event horizon that leads somewhere else in the universe
5318870 in other words the boys belly button is a wormhole
5318871 neutrinos are one of the basic particles that make up the universe
5318872 neutrinos left over from the big bang the explosion that created all mater often bombard the earth being smaller than atoms they pass right through the planet somehow a neutrino became lodged in joeys belly button possibly due to an accumulation of lint from a cloth diaper his mother used in any case it ripped the space time continuum
5318873 since closing the hole is impossible it swallowed the sutures my rubber gloves and a wristwatch when we tried
5318874 the westons want to have the hole removed entirely that would be an extremely risky undertaking we have no idea where the belly button leads and we could end up exposing the hospital the entire earth in fact to the intense radiation of a pulsar or supernova

5318882 well never see the old entertainment days of las vegas again
5318883 corporate says that every department has to make money so you cant experiment and take chances thats the bottom line todays performers feel that they dont need las vegas to sell records or to be successful what i mean by that is that they dont have to perform a few nights at a hotel they can do a concert and thats enough or they can get paid to make an appearance at an ultra lounge and get just as much publicity
5318884 playing vegas can help an act as long as it is the right venue years ago it meant something to headline a hotel but times have changed playing the house of blues or the pearl helps most of the others places could hurt an act
5318885 weve been doing it for along time and selling it out each weekend
5318886 its certainly an easier production it also gives our patron a choice of how to spend their entertainment dollar especially with the high cost of the production show ticket this way they can afford to see one of our cirque shows and then choose from one of our many other shows
5318887 not easy finding emerging talent newer performers today play it safe by being the opening for a major concert artist so its difficult to find anyone willing to take a chance
5318888 to be fair its a question i cant answer its mind boggling and it sure beats doing risky broadway shows theyre a great marketing tool for hotels theyre the preeminent show producers with the most talented people willing to spend unbelievable amounts of money you cant ask for more
5318889 i promise to get all the paperwork in order well release the silverton from all responsibility and liability and well return to perform the escape i have to do it

5318891 this has never been done before underwater i have to hold my breath and the steel box which is no larger than an animal luggage box used on airlines gives me absolutely no room for movement
5318892 ive trained myself to hold my breath for up to four minutes underwater but with all the exertion of getting out of the metal cuffs on my hands and feet the air gets used up much faster if i could get out in 30 seconds believe me i would but it takes almost the length of the hold of my breath theres not much room for safety

5318902 what is the value of a candidates faith when he totally misunderstands the difference between o t law and n t grace
5318903 which passages of scripture should guide our public policy should we go with leviticus which suggests slavery is okay and that eating shellfish is an abomination how about deuteronomy which suggests stoning your child if he strays from the faith
5318904 why is he so silent about his faith could it be he really does not have anything substantial to offer in that department

5318951 whenever anyone asks why invest in china the answer is very simple that s where the money and exponential future growth is
5318952 the bank of china boc conducted a study of the effects of 12 olympiads on their host countries over the course of 60 years they found that nine of the twelve olympic host countries suffered a decline in gdp growth in the eight years after the games
5318953 the key to a post olympic slump is the size of the economy smaller economies like korea suffered larger downturns after the games while larger economies like the united states were not affected at all
5318954 in smaller economies the enormous investment dedicated to staging olympic games created an arti cial bubble which was followed by a slump when olympic building booms came to an end
5318955 china has made one of the largest investments ever in the olympic games with some estimates of spending topping 40 billion but we dont believe the capital city will go into a slump after the games
5318956 in fact beijing has been forced to defer other infrastructure projects during the run up to the games those and other pressing projects are expected to take up the economic slack in the city after the olympics
5318957 further thousands of factories have been shut down temporarily in the region surrounding beijing in an effort to reduce air pollution during the games also somey 50 of beijing s automobiles are being taken ofthe roads and many heavy diesel trucks are being banned from the city
5318958 nationwide the effects of this economic event are likely to be absorbed by the immense momentum of china s economy
5318959 in our view the olympics will barely register as a tremor in the bigger picture of the chinese economy in fact a minor slowdown would be welcome among some economic analysts who remain worried about the effects of in ation
5318960 among individual stocks china mobile has been in a holding pattern pending the beijing olympic games government regulators have ordered all telecom companies to refrain from signing up new subscribers until the games are over
5318961 it s a highly unusual request but beijing says it s a necessary move to prevent service disruptions due to increased loads on networks in china s fast growing wireless communications sector
5318962 when new subscriptions resume we expect china mobile to retain its position as the largest and fastest growing cell phone company in china
5318963 with more than 407 million subscribers china mobile retains an excellent reputation and has added as many as 6 million new subscribers every month that s an 87 share of the new subscriber market and a 69 share of the total market
5318964 china mobile appears set to gain exclusive access to the much coveted apple iphone in china in current negotiations previous talks had broken down because apple had demanded a revenue sharing agreement
5318965 that demand has apparently been dropped the company has also announced plans to invest another billion dollars in expanding its network and will soon roll out 3g high speed data service in coming months
5318966 a speculative pick due to its small capitalization cgs is providing its high tech services to the olympic games
5318967 with annual revenues of 35 million cgs is a micro cap stock the company was picked to provide over two dozen graphics systems to nbc during the networks coverage of the 2008 olympic games
5318968 utilizing the power of chyrons hyperx2 in both hd and sd and being the first broadcaster in the us to realize the potential of lyric pro 7 nbc will be broadcasting a massive 3 600 hours of programming during of the games
5318969 utilizing the power of chyrons hyperx2 in both hd and sd and being the first broadcaster in the us to realize the potential of lyric pro 7 nbc will be broadcasting a massive 3 600 hours of programming during the period of the games
5318970 technically the stock has broken out from an 11 week flat base recently making a new high overall cgs has been a top performing stock for the past 12 months shows the stock has appreciated 80 versus a 15 decline in the s amp p 500 index
5318971 the shares have risen from 2 four years ago to 6 a triple in remains in a bull market phase now that is good confirmation that the breakout has technical support from buyers
5318972 this year analysts predict a 67 jump in profits to 30 cents a share from 18 cents a share a year ago
5318973 the stocks institutional sponsorship is very good oberweis microcap which is very good with small cap stocks holds a 0 40 stake

5319021 guys are trying to get used to each other especially in the preseason weve got guys rotating in and out so much youre hardly ever next to the same guy i think thats part of it thats why you play preseason games to get the timing down
5319022 its a little bit of both having new guys in new positions and getting used to the technique and executing your blocks
5319023 at the same time the other team is making plays we have to make and finish plays rather than allow them to get into the lanes were supposed to keep them out of
5319024 right now we kind of have an idea whos going to be out there were trying to roll some guys in including some of the younger guys who we may not have seen in a game setting
5319025 i was thinking about running before i even made the catch
5319026 im thinking about everything you cant do nothing without the ball im trying to make a play instead of focusing on little things
5319027 the most important thing on offense is to secure the ball first whether it be a handoff catching a pass or fielding a punt
5319028 as far as special teams ive never done it i want to go out and prove to myself that i can do it
5319029 special teams is all about effort its a one play kind of situation
5319030 you dont get to line up on second down and remake anything special teams requires you to go 100 percent
5319031 watching the films what i see is a lot of guys here learning the system working to get into place
5319032 its preseason right now and its trial and error were going to get better by the time the season comes
5319033 the lanes on the punt returns you have to be patient back there im seeing some lanes but it seems hard to get to them but im going to stay patient and work on it
5319034 i know they are great fans but there are also people i will say for a minute that i read message boards and got caught up in that whole thing
5319035 that even put more stress on me just worrying about what people thought about me people say a lot of times i dont care what people think about me me personally i dont care how people perceive me when they look at my hair but i like people to think great things about shawn andrews but you cant please the world

5319052 its a very sad situation without its mother at suckling age we are very concerned theres no guarantee another pod will have a lactating mother and no guarantee it will accept it
5319053 if theres a slender chance its mother is still out there then it may hear it further out to sea
5319054 there were people swimming with the mother and calf off coogee last week and it freaked them out
5319055 if people try to swim with whales theres a good chance they can distress the mother this is how they get abandoned
5319056 it might be a peaceful experience for people but its not for the whale
5319057 for three years we have been saying that war is coming and the team has been working hard to deliver on this promise
5319058 in just a few weeks we are going to throw open our doors and invite more players into the game than ever before they will have a chance to delve into the open beta and see for themselves that war has arrived and it is glorious
5319059 es ist schwierig meine gef hlslage zu beschreiben als ich die nationalhymne h rte war es einfach nur ein traum
5319060 es war ein sehr hartes rennen erst im zweiten versuch ist es mir gelungen davon zu fahren ich musste mich sehr konzentrieren denn in einer solchen situation gehen einem ganz viele sachen durch den kopf ich habe den kampf gegen mich selbst gewonnen

5319065 im real proud of the team and the results we delivered in light of the environment
5319066 i thought he had some good throwaways and that one touchdown pass he really knifed it in there well
5319067 was right on my left side and someone was on my right because i felt them jon threw a low ball to where eric couldnt get a piece of it and i caught it and got in he just threw a great ball
5319068 when you get in a groove you seem to be clicking and i thought we were clicking all night
5319069 were going to be multiple and do whatever we want to do thats how were going to do it this year
5319070 thats part of him being the starter for the first time and its a new offense every time we practice a play every time we get a rep in we get better at it i thought he came out saturday and looked sharp
5319071 i thought our speed in the huddle was pretty good
5319072 we were in and out we didnt have any clock issues we were shifting motioning and getting the ball snapped with plenty of time
5319073 and then i think thats really where you can tell a difference with the
5319074 i think its important now that we start shrinking the offense a little bit and narrowing down what were going to do for ucla
5319075 weve put a lot in done a lot of different things out of a lot of different formations and i think the thing i look forward to now is that now you start prepping for a game and start getting a confined offense ready that the guys can really sink their teeth into
5319076 were to the point now where weve got the whole offense in and we talk about what we feel more comfortable with and what we dont feel as comfortable with
5319077 we can focus on the ones we feel more comfortable running so that we can get completely better with them
5319078 were trying to rep as few a plays as we can that we know were going to be really really good at and go into ucla with those
5319079 taurens just hes just one of those guys that gets it
5319080 certainly the benefit of coming in in january helped him but hes just a serious football player that has a sense of purpose to him that is fun to coach
5319081 he can sink his hips and he can punch block people
5319082 individuals taking antidepressants should be aware of the possible cognitive effects as they may affect performance in social academic and work settings as well as driving abilities
5319083 however it appears that mood is correlated with cognitive performance more so than medication use
5319084 fay looks like it will be far removed from major oil producing areas but until its better defined we should still see some volatility in the market
5319085 one of the things that guys like steven have to do they have to earn their way onto the field
5319086 usually the easiest way of doing that is specials teams were working with a bunch of those types of guys
5319087 if they can get into the depth chart on special teams and you know youre going to use them thats more of a reason to groom him to play linebacker
5319088 its not just filer its fleming its r j blanton its some second year guys like steve paskorz there have been some guys that have really stood out
5319089 its hard not to get mesmerized by a guy like filer or a guy like fleming because they are athletic
5319090 what youre trying to find is the guys that will cut it loose and play a guy that can run 4 5 if hes thinking too much and doesnt recognize whats in front of him and that makes him slow down and makes him run 4 75 whats the use of being 4 5 if you cant play fast
5319091 what we need to get is some of these young kids both freshmen and second year players just reacting to what they see trust their eyes and go play fast nothing good ever happens if we get confused and slow down if youre going to make a mistake make it at 100 miles an hour and see if we cant hit somebody in the process
5319092 im real proud of the team and the results we delivered in light of the environment
5319093 im real proud of the team and the results we delivered in light of the environment
5319094 so there i was in this amazing suite just beautiful and im looking around and theres this piano the place had a grand piano and i thought huh maybe i should learn to play the piano i mean i was extremely satisfied but also devastated by the finality of it all
5319095 youre talking about people who have trained for years every day and made huge sacrifices
5319096 and for some of them once they have this huge intense experience its a very fragile situation afterwards
5319097 many reported that this was the only life they knew and it was inconceivable to do anything else
5319098 some olympians now they think if i win the gold then the world will come to my door and ill be set
5319099 that is the last thing they should be focusing on
5319100 they will often try to retain the fame by resorting to all sorts of bizarre behavior to bring attention to themselves
5319101 i didnt want to compete to make history i wanted to compete to be the best
5319102 im real proud of the team and the results we delivered in light of the environment

5319111 you get to the point where you need to reorganize so you shut down reorganize reopen and hopefully get back on your feet
5319112 after the students move back and then obviously when classes start on sept 4 thatll be more of a benchmark
5319113 there were just some store owners who wanted some follow up services asking can you talk me through it again
5319114 plominski said adding that the university provided that start up help
5319115 obviously its a tool that only works as well as you use it
5319116 it could be the hologram or the magnetic strip or just the photo
5319117 so it provides quite a bit of data that police on the street can then zero in on

5319126 depauw fortunately chose greencastle as a place to study way back in the 1830s and to build their campus
5319127 the city of greencastle incorporated in 1849 so weve been growing up together but we still have some opportunities to make that relationship a stronger one
5319128 it is not for historians necessarily because historians talk to each other and theyre too esoteric
5319129 the audience would be anybody that is intelligent and literate anybody i was taken by the fact that my garage mechanic waited for every article as did tom chiarella
5319130 so its a variety of people and of course people were sending the magazine articles out throughout the country to other people
5319131 we call them essays because they really are rather than history
5319132 they have personal background which you can subtly see we had a great fire out at the poor farm the same years that we had a great fire that burned the downtown area and that burned a major building on the university
5319133 because obviously we didnt have poverty in this town but here we lost a couple of lives out there we didnt lose any lives in the greencastle fire but you know everybody talks about it
5319134 you dont realize that there were depauw student jazz bands that were playing in the 1920s on the summer ships going overseas
5319135 people dont realize duke ellington spent more time in greencastle than john dillinger
5319136 everybody thinks dillinger was the big guy but he was only one of four and he only was here a half hour and yet everybody thinks that the greatest thing that ever happened in putnam county was john dillinger
5319137 from 1837 on which is 172 years this town and the university have been interrelated
5319138 we have affected each other and deep down in their hearts those who have been in the town any length of time know that and i think all the depauw people know that
5319139 depauw people will know those just as much as the townspeople will know it this is the kind of relationship im trying to develop so that marvins gets in it so does moores bar so does the first president of depauws board of trustees who was the richest man in the county et cetera et cetera
5319140 history has utility but it gives most of all i think a sense of perspective
5319141 in these essays john baughman demonstrates his remarkable talents as both historian and storyteller
5319142 we are pleased and honored to have this opportunity to join in partnership with the putnam county museum and professor baughman to bring our past their present to members of the depauw and putnam county communities many of these essays document the mutual respect and interwoven stories of depauw and its community members and the residents of greencastle and putnam county stories that cover many years and continue to be written as evidenced by
5319143 every presidential election year im struck by a basic imbalance in media coverage
5319144 a great deal of time space and attention go to what we can expect from the candidates on their policy stances their strengths and weaknesses their frame of mind at any given moment
5319145 something is missing this kind of wall to wall coverage sends a message that the candidates and their personal qualities are all that matter to our government which isnt true
5319146 theres another half of the equation the american people far too little gets written or broadcast about our role in making this democracy work we ask the candidates whether theyre prepared for their responsibilities we need to ask the same thing of the american people because we have the oldest enduring republic and an ever robust public discourse its easy to forget that our system needs constant tending by the people most invested in its success americans in general it depends on broad participation in the political process participation that goes well beyond simply voting it depends on an active belief in accommodation and compromise not the winner take all single mindedness that has come to characterize political culture of late and perhaps above all else it depends on a widespread understanding that our system of government gives us all an opportunity to achieve what we want by following paths defined and limited by our constitution it does not guarantee that well get what we want
5319147 just because congress and the president dont produce exactly what we want when we think its needed does not mean the system is broken dysfunctional or even unrepresentative to some extent a more thorough civic education would be helpful here both in school and afterward many americans knowledge of basic concepts the need for a balance of powers at the federal level or the crucial role compromise plays in making the system work is weaker than it ought to be
5319148 one thing that strikes me often as i meet with people around the country is that as unhappy as people get with the president or congress or the supreme court they dont stand up and say i dont support the constitution there is an inbred respect for our constitutional structure the challenge for ordinary citizens is to make it work
5319149 this is a challenge for every generation our system does not function on automatic pilot just because it has worked in the past does not mean we will have a free and successful country in the future to achieve this we need a citizenry that not only participates actively but also expects and encourages each of its members to do so we need debate deliberation accommodation a healthy system of checks and balances thoroughgoing representation of all voices in the halls of power and an electorate willing to hold those in power to account when they stray from these basic constitutional principles
5319150 there is no replacement in our system for accepting the responsibility that comes with being an american to help make our system work it requires skill patience and above all an appreciation for the gift given us by our predecessors and a determination not to squander its legacy
5319151 the country is hungering for leaders like him open minded unassuming centrists who are interested in government more than politics
5319152 the sidelines at jimtown football games wont look the same but the product on the field certainly should
5319153 after winning 288 1980 07 games and four state titles bill sharpe retired and tossed the keys to former player mike campbell campbell was on the 1991 state champion team played at depauw then served on the staffs at both wawasee and jimtown before becoming head coach

5319157 if you ask about his son theyll stop the car and drop you on the expletive 405
5319158 one who is not taking part in the battle nor has the sheer intention to die is in the branch of hypocrisy
5319159 i felt upset and angry with the onslaught against innocent women and children in countries such as russia
5319160 the russian army massacred quite a lot of muslims in chechnya they bombarded woman and children in the cities and they flattened most of the republic it is still going on today
5319161 deep commitment to and involvement in violent jihad by promoting it inciting others to take part in it and arranging for himself and others to attend military training in pakistan in preparation for going to fight and inevitably to kill
5319162 assassinating named personnel and foreign tourists and freeing captured brothers from the enemy
5319163 deep concerns about the news standards and level of objectivity
5319164 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they wanted to in that context
5319165 because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5319166 we are extremely disappointed to see that the level of objectivity at nbc news has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut john mccain
5319167 it was like winning the lottery without having to buy a lottery ticket
5319168 it was the only time any of their jobs came in under budget thats what it is all about beating budgets it didnt cost the fire brigade anything

5319189 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage its my greatest moral failure
5319190 there were times where i experimented with drugs i drank you know in my teenage years and what i traced this to is a certain selfish necessary on my part
5319191 what does it mean to you to trust in christ and what does it mean on a daily basis i mean what does that really look like
5319192 as a starting point it means i believe in that jesus christ died for my sins and that i am redeemed through him
5319193 you publicly say you are a follower of christ what does that mean to you and how does faith work out in your life on a daily basis what does it mean to you
5319194 well i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5319195 at what point is a baby entitled to human rights

5319198 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation of a lot of the constitution
5319199 i think we have to use discernment in seeing through what could possibly be the politics of it but i dont fault any party for reaching out to any demographics with their ideals and their ideas and with their plans
5319200 i am not a politician if i thought politics was the answer to changing the world i would be a politician but im not
5319201 im a pastor because only jesus christ and the power of the holy spirit can change lives
5319202 theyre both flawed individuals and theyre going to both need god
5319203 oh can you bring this backpack up to the guy working at the top he forgot it down here
5319204 they have a collective memory there this is very important and plays a big role
5319205 it is the second biggest economy in the world in 50 years it will be the biggest economy in the world starting with former prime minister john diefenbaker and then with trudeau and all of us and we established very good relations with china
5319206 and suddenly you break a bridge it would have been easy just to be there
5319207 the research headed by dr joel katz from the hms medicine education office revealed that undergraduate medical students taking a class in fine art had a 38 improvement in their ability to make accurate clinical observations
5319208 what i really have tried to focus on was the visual language science uses to convey information and also how creative decisions and aesthetics fill in so many of the gaps that we dont know but for example if a scientific illustrator is doing an illustration of a dinosaur he has a very limited amount of knowledge so everything else their color whether they had head feathers are if they didnt have feathers a lot of the aspects of it are just made up by the artist
5319209 we are pleased to see that two thirds of sbc churches are offering some level of medical coverage for their ministers and families
5319210 what is most rewarding is recognizing the number of smaller churches that understand that this is an important benefit for the overall financial well being of their ministers
5319211 average worship attendance accounts for the most variance in pastor salaries 54 percent
5319212 the membership of the congregation is the next most significant factor accounting for 50 percent of salary variance church budget also explains a noticeable amount of variation 35 percent
5319213 its no surprise that pastors who have the additional responsibility of leading a larger church are paid more but it is surprising how seldom churches reward experience
5319214 compared to a pastor serving in the south a full time senior pastor in the midwest on average receives 2 124 fewer dollars of total compensation a pastor in the northeast receives 6 978 more and a pastor in the west receives 3 795 more
5319215 a full time senior pastor who does not have a seminary degree on average receives 3 660 fewer dollars in total compensation than a pastor with a seminary degree
5319216 a pastor who has a doctoral degree on average receives 10 015 more than a pastor with a high school education
5319217 the sbc church compensation study is an important resource for churches to use as they seek to determine appropriate salaries for their staff members
5319218 our prayer is that churches will use it both as they seek to hire new staff but also as they retain existing staff to ensure their compensation is competitive with other churches and within their communities
5319219 weve had a very strong year off the back of good steel demand both in export markets and in our domestic markets
5319220 we are entering fiscal 09 in a similar manner to the one in which we came out of 08 with still strong demand and continued good performance
5319221 it was a good result above guidance but i think steel prices have peaked and you also have a massive reline in the second half
5319222 we are operating at record production levels and selling all of the product that we can make
5319223 if customers want to buy more than we can make theres not much we can do about that
5319224 while urbanisation and industrialisation continue in china as well as india russia and brazil i think were going to see very strong demand for steel and quite high raw material costs

5319238 with commander going belly up having purchased wireless broadband player iburst recently i dont see how unwired can survive
5319239 unwireds services uses wimax technology and its unfortunate that wimax is not going anywhere
5319240 these products have no particular impact on our business we welcome the fact that theyre doing this and educating the market on wireless broadband
5319241 it will be interesting to see if vodafone and optus can deliver on their network coverage promises we have a vastly superior network infrastructure
5319242 overall mobile broadband spending consumer and business will more than double from 750 million in 2008 to 1 7 billion in 2012
5319243 in about 24 months we could see pricing halve to 29 for 5gb
5319244 telstra knows it has very good coverage for its 3g network compared with the others and businesses and consumers will pay for that premium

5319249 i got like 135 access points off the freeway on my way up here from santa cruz
5319250 i think most people would presume that you have permission to access that open network thats become the social norm but its a little unclear what the law is
5319251 i think for most people an open network is a nice neighborly thing to do
5319252 youve given that person access to your home and he can hack your home
5319253 how much do you trust your neighbors and how much do you trust well anybody that can get geographic proximity to your network
5319254 if a bad guy wants to commit a crime he usually wants to avoid committing it in a place that it can be traced back to him

5319268 the lgma represents an unprecedented commitment to food safety and public health
5319269 while there is always much more work to be done the leafy greens industry has come a long way in the last twelve months
5319270 significant efforts were made to involve as many associations agencies companies and individuals with expertise in food safety practices for one or more steps in the fresh tomato supply chain as possible
5319271 we wanted everyones input on this so we could be as thorough as possible
5319272 in the two years since the first document weve learned more about potential risks and control measures at all points in the fresh tomato supply chain
5319273 the second edition of the guidelines represents current understanding of conditions and controls that should be considered by every company in the tomato supply chain
5319274 that 15 million bale export forecast gives us some cause for hope
5319275 even if we dont get to 15 million in exports it leaves us in the situation where we may see a tightening of the balance sheet for u s cotton
5319276 any number between 5 2 million and 7 1 million bales is still better than 10 million bales
5319277 the decline in world cotton production in 2008 09 is attributable mainly to the lower forecast for the united states as this crop is projected 28 percent below 2007 08
5319278 chinas crop is forecast only slightly below that of a year ago while the rest of the world of the world is forecast to fall 2 percent to the lowest since 2003 04
5319279 the u s share of global production is estimated lower at 12 percent in 2008 09 compared with the five year average of 18 5 percent
5319280 input costs for cotton are still high relative to other crops
5319281 the concern now is that when you look at these prices we could still be in a situation where we are still trying to hold on to cotton acres at best we may be holding on but we could possibly lose more acres in 2009
5319282 it may well be that consumers have to curtail clothing purchases because of higher gasoline prices
5319283 if you look at the august crop report over the last five years the crop gets bigger by from 1 million to 3 million bales between august and december
5319284 cotton still appears to be the better alternative because of the sharp increase in indias cotton yields
5319285 the key to the world production and price outlooks may be whether a shift will occur in brazil brazilian farmers are expected to plant more soybeans because of exchange problems and the higher prices offered for soybeans
5319286 while the long term outlook for the cotton sector in the united states is favorable the sector may still endure some pain
5319287 its getting clearer and clearer especially with a 340 pound all pro knocking vikings outta there damn cleats
5319288 our defense is peaking super bowl caliber and the window to win in this league is a narrow one that slam shuts suddenly so we felt jason made us a super bowl contender not a pretender and he has the same agent as hester which helped us work it out
5319289 in this league you cant have too many tackles you cant have too much depth if chris comes back we will find a place for both of them its a problem i like to have hey john tait isnt getting any younger no one is so maybe we will rest him a bit peters is a big boy he can play right tackle
5319290 in this league its win now and we intend to win now
5319291 well we only gave up a pair of third rounders for jeff hes better then that as for fits we make things fit the nfl is about adjusting its about winning
5319292 right now kyle is our starter and rex is our backup but in this league qb depth is key and we thought jeff would provide us with a quality player who has won big games in this league
5319293 listen draft picks are a crap shoot sometimes ya roll lucky sevens sometimes ya crap out so we skipped rolling dem bones a bit and picked up a pair of quality players that could give us a super bowl trophy
5319294 es wird ein schwieriges spiel aber einen besseren gegner k nnen wir uns nicht w nschen

5319296 because of these sneaky and treacherous attacks as your commander in chief i have ordered the armed forces of the philippines and the philippine national police to defend every inch of philippine territory against milf forces and immediately restore peace in the affected areas in lanao del norte
5319297 the arsonists who acted as firemen at the expense of poor household owners
5319298 a resumption of the war in mindanao and sulu as radical elements in the moro islamic liberation front milf and the abu sayyaf raise the ante by making demands on the manila government that they know the manila government cannot accede to
5319299 would stretch the resources of the philippine government and would encourage calls for either martial law or a military takeover president arroyo would respond positively to a call for martial law whether the causes are real or manufactured it would be in keeping with her desire to remain in power beyond 2010
5319300 congress would be abolished civil and political rights would be suspended and there would be no presidential elections in 2010
5319301 but president arroyo would continue her maneuvers to remain in power beyond 2010 either as prime minister if we switch to the parliamentary system or as president without term limits if we retain the presidential system
5319302 your evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby brad pitt make about 40 million a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a crap about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more
5319303 miss jolie says she likes john mccain too and hasnt decided who to endorse huh arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan
5319304 it might be good for your asian and african childrens self esteem to know you support

5319317 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5319318 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5319319 i wouldnt say theres a humanitarian catastrophe but theres an urgent need for primary products
5319320 the assignment i have received today is a great responsibility
5319321 in the maya tradition these are the carriers of time i am at your service i am following in the steps of my ancestors without violence without hatred without intrigue because valiant men deal with dialogue while cowardly mean deal with weapons what we need now without distinction of race color or creed is to understand that we are all humans and we have the same needs and the same feelings i ask of you ministers of state lets forget about racism lets walk together we are beings of equal value
5319322 i have had the honor to meet many of the indigenous elders who are here today
5319323 we have shared many things in the past 14 years it is this connection with them walking at their side learning from them has transformed my life it transformed me so much that it has made me president today
5319324 the mayan worldview isnt about the number of indigenous posts or the number of native
5319325 were going to have a fodigua dedicated to indigenous issues the preservation of language and culture the establishment of the ancient houses of knowledge and more support for the councils of elders to help them implement their vision their prophetic heritage and their love for their people
5319326 this event has sought unity and solidarity among indigenous entities and a national celebration that promotes the beginning of a new era for indigenous peoples in guatemala this historic moment signifies that the guatemalan government has a serious commitment to their indigenous people
5319327 the profound wisdom of our indigenous elders is as contemporary and relevant as modern science

5319345 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
5319346 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
5319347 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters now is who uses that language for what purpose
5319348 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
5319349 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
5319350 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
5319351 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
5319352 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
5319353 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
5319354 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
5319355 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
5319356 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
5319357 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
5319358 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
5319359 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
5319360 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
5319361 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
5319362 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
5319363 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
5319364 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
5319365 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
5319366 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
5319367 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
5319368 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
5319369 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
5319370 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
5319371 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
5319372 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
5319373 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
5319374 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
5319375 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
5319376 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
5319377 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
5319378 politics depends to a great extent on judging what is actual relative to what is possible however we have an inherently weak grasp of what is possible and most societies are not set up so as naturally to improve this or to make us aware of possibilities we may have ignored or taken with insufficient seriousness

5319386 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5319387 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most

5319390 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
5319391 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5319392 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

5319427 the sector strategy is to build on quality not volumes our country is not so big to produce big volumes of coffee like brazil
5319428 this strong performance should be put in the context of a challenging international environment
5319429 the imported inflation is manly attributed to oil prices and food prices particularly cereals cooking oil fish and sugar
5319430 its the first time for several years that imported inflation has been so much significant in rwanda
5319431 we simply are not going to sacrifice the integrity of the certification process for expediency
5319432 the united states supported the transition to democratic government in pakistan and respects the results of the election
5319433 we believe that respect for the democratic and constitutional processes in that country is fundamental to pakistans future and its fight against terrorism
5319434 musharraf made the critical choice to join the fight against al qaida the taliban and other extremist groups that threaten the peace and security of pakistan its neighbors and partners throughout the world
5319435 one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5319436 from our point of view a lot of credit must be given to the thousands of festival goers the vast majority of whom enjoyed a fantastic weekends entertainment in a good natured way
5319437 weve known for years that a large percentage of onshore pollution comes from activities in the water our ports need to expand and modernize but the adjacent communities are not willing to tolerate the health risks
5319438 the single most significant rule the air resources board has adopted in the last five years
5319439 there was a man in the back of the car that had been taken into custody so i knew it was very serious then when i saw the crime scene investigators truck pull up i assumed it was a murder
5319440 vabbeh i miei in fondo non vedono mai la loro nipotina
5319441 obviously a lot of things have gone on the last few months im not going to sit here and say i havent second guessed decisions not only this year but along the way
5319442 ill say it again there are no guarantees but it went well today

5319445 kalau nggak ada handphone aku nggak bisa komunikasi sama orang tua dan pacarku
5319446 untuk alat komunikasi supaya orang tua bisa mengontrol keberadaan kita bisa dapat kenalan baru banyak deh pokoknya
5319447 tidak semua pelajar yang menyimpan foto atau video porno di handphone nya
5319448 sedang asyik belajar eh tahunya ada yang sms atau cuma missed called apalagi kalau sedang ulangan bisa bisa nilaiku jeblok karena nggak konsentrasi
5319449 larangan itu nggak penting banget merugikan kita yang tidak bersalah
5319450 bashir was invited to the summit as an african country leader and there is no arrest warrant against him at his moment if there are any requests we will evaluate them then
5319451 the turkish government should reject efforts by sudans president omar bashir to secure a suspension of the international criminal courts investigation against him
5319452 turkey should also convey a clear message that khartoum must not respond to the investigation with retaliation against civilians peacekeepers or humanitarian workers
5319453 in recent years the continent became the focus of attention of several countries like china india and japan because of its rich energy and mining resources
5319454 poker site w unique scriptthis is a brand new site that was created for resell purposews

5319456 ac ghaffur was the subject of direct surveillance and given a pseudo name vivaldi this was a direct attack on his honesty and integrity
5319457 what is expected from the parties directly involved in the talks is for them to abide by the sadc decisions as zimbabwe is one of its member states
5319458 he sehwag is still in the hotel it was quite bad yesterday we will get to know soon
5319459 to start with we misread the wicket a bit we did not think it would seam or swing that much of course since the breeze was strong we expected it to swing throughout the day which it did
5319460 they got the first two batsmen out it was not like the batsmen played bad shots and got out credit goes to their fast bowlers they got wickets later on mendis put the pressure the only thing we were doing was to catch up and it gets really tough in one day games if you lose too many wickets up front
5319461 in line with the decision i resigned both from congress party and lok sabha
5319462 hey firstly they didnt say anything about it when asked then they denied it and now what they should say
5319463 its taxpayer dollars and every fraud that occurs destroys some of the trust that citizens have in government
5319464 i think its so important that we set the tone that we dont tolerate fraud that we investigate it and there are consequences for people who do that
5319465 neutralize city residents negative perceptions of the criminal justice system
5319466 generally speaking citizens in the three comparison jurisdictions tend to be more advantaged in all respects than those in baltimore city they are better educated are wealthier and are more likely to own their own homes
5319467 are also less likely to suffer from the structural disadvantage and social disorganization which often results in the higher incidence of crime and victimization from crime
5319468 i am simply appalled that in the name of science and research you reach a conclusion that because a large number of city residents live in poverty and among crime they are incapable of performing their civic duty
5319469 toutes ces derni res ann es la russie a t mise devant des faits accomplis le kosovo la sortie du trait antimissile et le d ploiement des sites antimissiles dans les pays voisins ou encore l largissement incessant de lotan etc
5319470 et tout cela sur fond de doux discours sur un partenariat ce nest quune fa ade a qui cela peut il plaire
5319471 on entend aujourdhui aux etats unis des appels revoir les relations avec la russie je pense que sil faut revoir quelque chose cest la mani re hautaine de parler avec la russie sans prendre en compte sa position et ses int r ts
5319472 aqu no hay conflicto las agrupaciones que conforman la alianza pais que trabajaron desde el inicio en respaldo del se or presidente de la rep blica cuando fue candidato y que lo fueron en gran medida junto con el pueblo ecuatoriano quienes lo llevaron a la presidencia han sentido la necesidad de refrescar un poco filas no hay una pelea ni confrontaci n interna
5319473 esta designaci n fue hecha de manera un nime con qu rum completo en una sesi n del bur de alianza pais entre los cuales est n acreditado dos personas de parte de mi movimiento de integraci n ciudadana

5319475 yo no soy una persona que me quedo en el pasado yo creo que los impases las diferentes circunstancias por las cuales a uno le toca vivir tienen que ser experiencia que nos deje ense anzas para continuar con el camino eso es lo que yo he hecho
5319476 le he dicho que si tiene alg n tipo de dudas vamos a rectificar

5319478 hemos logrado 900 becas para los hijos de los migrantes que est n en condiciones siempre desfavorables para tratar de que nadie se quede sin la oportunidad de trabajar de estudiar

5319490 this unexpected guidance downgrade might have somewhat eroded investor faith in the capex reduction story
5319491 with the addition of these two large full service hotels davidson now has a portfolio which includes five upscale hotels in florida
5319492 we are attracted to the strong demographics in both orlando and miami and following the implementation of our proprietary marketing and management systems we believe these hotels will quickly gain strong market share and substantially increased value for ownership

5319494 i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right

5319505 dracula wants to suck a blood think heme with his glystening teeth
5319506 competition is hard because we have to travel more kilometers km with the same velocity
5319507 as i understand it yes there are rights of appeal zentais son ernie steiner said outside the court today
5319508 last time we went through the issue of the constitution but this is an entirely different argument now mr steiner said
5319509 and so there are similar rights available to my father
5319510 your honours task is not to delve into foreign law mr donaldson told the court
5319511 on the material before you there is no relevant extradition offence
5319512 clearly there has been recent debate about the jury system here in queensland arising out of a couple of cases
5319513 while these amendments have not been designed with any particular case in mind they will apply to any case where an application is heard from the time that the amendments become law
5319514 intolerable prospect of retrials in situations where one intransigent juror had refused to do his or her duty in accordance with the law
5319515 reform of the justice system is needed but whether these proposals are the right reforms remains to be seen
5319516 the latter group women who did not take maternity leave is significantly more likely to have been promoted by june 30 2007
5319517 the figures may also be distorted by the possibility that women having children are at a relatively more senior classification already and simply have less scope for promotion
5319518 having a child brings a great opportunity cost to their career
5319519 i think it is certainly concerning that women are being discriminated against because of their family situation
5319520 when you think about the theft of that particular object alone that in fact has very substantially added to the theft of motor vehicle category within our crime figures
5319521 its a modern thing people are nicking them and theyre selling them just like videos were some years ago mr cameron said
5319522 the key message to people is just dont leave the gps in the car
5319523 what we have been arguing for a number of years is to put on a more visible saturation frontline police presence
5319524 it will reduce crime the road toll and anti social behaviour
5319525 im very happy to be driving at home for a second time its always a special feeling to race in front of my countrymen and im really looking forward to it
5319526 in barcelona we were having a strong race when i had to retire but i hope this time i can get a good result as the circuit will be new for all the drivers
5319527 we were on the pace in hungary the car felt good and we showed we are still moving forward and that we will fight hard to finish in fourth place in the championship
5319528 i like street circuits they are always an interesting challenge and the sensation of speed from inside the cockpit is incredible
5319529 i will do my best to improve the set up of the car over the weekend so that we can aim for a strong result whatever happens i will give my maximum for this second grand prix in spain
5319530 i would like to have another solid weekend starting off with a good day of practice on friday qualifying in the top ten and showing good race pace to hopefully finish in the points thats how i will approach this race
5319531 come on today is the first day of the new school year you cannot be beaten by this rain come on
5319532 i think there is an opportunity for other things to come
5319533 ingredients is a growth area with real potential which is why dfa management and the board are dedicating more resources to it
5319534 this new division will better allow us to meet the growing demands of our customers both domestically and internationally
5319535 we knew we could vastly improve the customer experience by deploying an online booking application to enhance our existing web site ibm came in and really pulled the project together in an amazingly short period of time five months compressing a development cycle that was slated to take 12 months
5319536 when customers book a tour the application is simultaneously booking reservations for hotels buses and so on
5319537 we needed our online system to extend the complexities built into our core business systems out to the web without making the process too complicated for our customers the websphere commerce solution did this without having to completely rewrite our back end systems
5319538 this project is a great example of how ibm is helping clients adapt to constantly changing conditions such as rising fuel costs and new terms of engagement between airlines and travel agencies
5319539 using ibm software and soa companies like vantage can make it easier and less expensive for consumers to book vacations while reducing the time and money it takes to manage a complex business and web site like this

5319546 sencillamente lo que hace es desnaturalizar los procesos de integraci n que se est n desarrollando en el seno del parlamento de mercosur y todas las instancias en suram rica
5319547 venezuela es un pa s que est aplicando soberanamente las leyes y la constituci n para combatir la corrupci n se pretende apoyar a sectores de la derecha corrupta del pa s que quieren estar por encima de las leyes vulnerar el estado de derecho y eludir sus responsabilidades administrativas que los involucran en escandalosos casos de corrupci n que son escondidos por los medios de comunicaci n que atienden los peores intereses tanto en venezuela como en el continente
5319548 ojala esta persona se haya dado cuenta del rid culo que hizo en nuestro pa s diciendo que representaba al mercosur y luego al congreso uruguayo ni la uno ni lo otro ninguna de las dos cosas representaba esta persona que formaba parte de un gui n de un show que montan contra el proceso democr tico constitucional revolucionario que lidera el presidente ch vez

5319551 telesur ha abierto un boquete a la dictadura medi tica que nos imponen los grandes medios televisivos que son dirigidos desde el norte
5319552 se trata de una reuni n hist rica porque echa por tierra la campa a internacional de que el presidente ch vez o venezuela promueva alg n tipo de discriminaci n o de antisemitismo

5319557 this is the greatest country in the whole wide world
5319558 i can confirm that she married her long term partner a few months ago
5319559 it was a small and very private affair and she and her re olympics 2008
5319560 it appears a cowardly attack the offender has walked straight up to the person there has been very little altercation or conversation and theres been one big king hit inspector rod kemp told reporters in brisbane
5319561 it appears that its merely been a case of someones backed in and taken a bowser ahead of someone else insp kemp said
5319562 it is a great honour for us so now we have a friendly match with belarus and we go away very happy
5319563 we come back on thursday night which is near the bolton match but we will be prepared to play
5319564 fabricio enjoyed the match it was a great start for him and the rest of the team
5319565 i keep saying to him when are you going to move over and let me have a bash
5319566 but at the moment he still seems to be enjoying himself although one day maybe
5319567 nothing became available in the summer that i wanted a go at or that wanted me is the main thing
5319568 arsenal can today confirm that togolese forward emmanuel adebayor has signed a new long term contract with the club
5319569 the team wants to get the ball down and pass it those who werent in the original squad have already hooked on to that message from george burley and that is to play good football
5319570 weve got a young squad of the original 24 18 were 26 or under but when it comes to world cup qualifiers youve got to have the experience to get you through to those major tournaments
5319571 that was an incredible result and a fantastic feeling i hope it will be the first of many podiums in formula 1
5319572 the important thing was that we showed just how competitive we are at the moment and moved further ahead in fourth place in the constructors championship
5319573 there is a great atmosphere in the team and we are all working hard together to move forward which is why it was so satisfying to get on the podium in hungary
5319574 i did plenty of street races when i was racing in champ cars and in that season almost all the tracks were new to me so i have learnt to adapt quickly
5319575 it looks like an interesting circuit and its quite long so it should be a good show
5319576 ive only had two full rounds since the tournament started so the victory is a bit of an anti climax for me
5319577 but ive had my share of bad luck and im not complaining
5319578 if the next fight goes the full four rounds i know im fit enough it will come and ill be ready for it when it does
5319579 for the next four or five weeks my mind will be very much focused on the fedex cup playoff series which starts this week at ridgewood country club in new jersey
5319580 to be honest i felt like last years fedex cup came and went without me making much of an impression on things
5319581 obviously im very keen to do a lot better this time around i certainly like the revised schedule giving the players a break between the penultimate event the bmw championship and the tour championship
5319582 thats a welcome respite especially for those of us who are not involved in the ryder cup at valhalla its a two week break for us guys and for me personally thats no bad thing
5319583 any player who went back to management or managed his county team of course he would give the dublin job very serious consideration its a very attractive job
5319584 of course all managers would look at that and would take it into account of course they would i wouldnt be on my own in saying that there are plenty of other people who would as well
5319585 i would say at this point in time that dublin would find it very hard to be looking outside their own county

5319587 if someone thinks they can kill our citizens kill soldiers and officers fulfilling the role of peacekeepers we will never allow this

5319592 i have been told that tom daschle is not the running mate i also happen to know that it is not wesley clark
5319593 a surge of concern from the left wing of the democratic party about evan bayh arose and subsequently he has not been selected as obamas vp running mate
5319594 these guys came in for a good cause to help out and its not starting out so good
5319595 its more emotional because there are so many memories associated with them
5319596 a 50 point win im as happy as a little girl
5319597 the option of sending in a robot to check what is behind a wall or to survey a town before deploying ground troops could minimize british casualties
5319598 its not going to happen if youre coming for that youll be disappointed
5319599 however we think it is more probable that sq372 comes from the inner edge of the

5319607 when we re evaluated our position we said ok we need to reboot the dell operating system so to speak with an upgrade mr dell said
5319608 there were things we needed to do around that so we launched several initiatives consumer enterprise notebooks small to medium business and perhaps one of the most important a new strategy for emerging countries we assigned leadership teams and made investments
5319609 we are doing things very very different and have increased our commitment to product innovation and thought leadership and we have enhanced that with some acquisitions you are seeing a new dell emerging here
5319610 if you look at our competitive advantage one thing that has not changed over this entire period is that dell learns a tremendous amount from the direct relationships with our customers and the conversations we have
5319611 now we have turbocharged that with the internet and blogs and wikis we have 2 billion conversations a year and that inspires us and we are using all that new information to verify our position and using that information to expand

5319613 we make more revenue from our computer product than our nearest competitor so we are selling more valuable computers
5319614 during the past 10 years our company has grown its shipping volumes by about 10 times there is really no other company in the industry that has done that it is also true that there was period when our growth slowed down at the end of that
5319615 the idea is to train these workers in the environment before they actually go into it so they can make all of their decisions about the operation they are going to perform select the correct equipment and do the job safely

5319621 with commander going belly up having purchased wireless broadband player iburst recently i dont see how unwired can survive
5319622 unwireds services uses wimax technology and its unfortunate that wimax is not going anywhere
5319623 these products have no particular impact on our business we welcome the fact that theyre doing this and educating the market on wireless broadband
5319624 it will be interesting to see if vodafone and optus can deliver on their network coverage promises we have a vastly superior network infrastructure
5319625 overall mobile broadband spending consumer and business will more than double from 750 million in 2008 to 1 7 billion in 2012

5319629 were looking at a number of opportunities and this definitely is one of them
5319630 there are a lot of cost synergies in being a large reseller and we still think theres a niche market that if approached correctly is quite profitable
5319631 were in a fairly good position seeing that we dont have any debts and were doing quite well on cash flow so yes it is something that given the right circumstances wed be looking at
5319632 were not sure what structure their going to pursue whether theyre going to encourage people to bundle big chunks of the business or try to maximise what they can get

5319636 nab has always used hosting and still uses a combination of hosting having some of our internal people host the platforms and develop the platforms and working with external suppliers

5319639 ewww a red heart looking like it was just ripped from a fresh cadaver all juicy and bloodly
5319640 but i think it can hardly get any better mostly because there it is once again the eternal teaching that will sustain the soul through diving into the wreck to do salvage to see and breathe with the sacred heart relentlessly rather than only see and be amongst the thorns the handless maiden recap this old tale was told in our family on successive nights over a long period of time giving time enough in between to contemplate its images and ideas to measure ones own life against them the apple tree sexual body theology
5319641 your evil wife has been unfaithful to you and has given birth to a half dog
5319642 i am so sorry for what has befallen us please take good care of my wife and my child until i return oh my poor handless queen
5319643 just as i imagined my wifes had an unfaithful heart kill my queen and kill the child immediately
5319644 laying his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude work site bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to many other prisoners
5319645 as he waited head down he felt a presence a skinny old prisoner squatted down next to him the man said nothing instead he drew a stick through the ground at solzhenitsyns feet tracing the sign of the cross the man then got back up and returned to his work
5319646 as solzhenitsyn stared at the sign of the cross his entire perspective changed he knew that he was only one man against the all powerful soviet empire yet in that moment he knew that there was something greater than the evil that he saw in the prison something greater than the soviet union he knew that the hope of all mankind was represented in that simple cross and through the power of the cross anything was possible
5319647 grandma they have beautiful old pictures and really good prayers on them

5319659 the patrol identified insurgents with weapons on the roof of the compound preparing to attack and in order to protect themselves launched three rockets all of which hit the target

5319671 with commander going belly up having purchased wireless broadband player iburst recently i dont see how unwired can survive
5319672 unwireds services uses wimax technology and its unfortunate that wimax is not going anywhere
5319673 these products have no particular impact on our business we welcome the fact that theyre doing this and educating the market on wireless broadband
5319674 it will be interesting to see if vodafone and optus can deliver on their network coverage promises we have a vastly superior network infrastructure
5319675 overall mobile broadband spending consumer and business will more than double from 750 million in 2008 to 1 7 billion in 2012

5319677 telstra knows it has very good coverage for its 3g network compared with the others and businesses and consumers will pay for that premium
5319678 with prepaid we stop you once youve used up your data allowance
5319679 well i guess i know what they want me to do here
5319680 it has been the major driver of growth and has far exceeded what we expected
5319681 its a great product from our point of view because its very difficult for the large carriers to respond as it directly affects their pstn revenues
5319682 with the acquisition now complete we expect it achieve 2 5 million in synergies over the next financial year
5319683 its going to be at least a year before a decision is made on the national network and the government doesnt want a capital expenditure freeze for three to five years
5319684 the only way telcos can operate at the moment is by assuming the status quo and then dealing with the changes as they arrive
5319685 realistically by the time the nbn comes and starts being built most of the transition growth from dial up to broadband will be done
5319686 at that point the major differentiator will be deliverable product service and brand perception
5319687 when we re evaluated our position we said ok we need to reboot the dell operating system so to speak with an upgrade mr dell said
5319688 there were things we needed to do around that so we launched several initiatives consumer enterprise notebooks small to medium business and perhaps one of the most important a new strategy for emerging countries we assigned leadership teams and made investments
5319689 we are doing things very very different and have increased our commitment to product innovation and thought leadership and we have enhanced that with some acquisitions you are seeing a new dell emerging here
5319690 if you look at our competitive advantage one thing that has not changed over this entire period is that dell learns a tremendous amount from the direct relationships with our customers and the conversations we have
5319691 now we have turbocharged that with the internet and blogs and wikis we have 2 billion conversations a year and that inspires us and we are using all that new information to verify our position and using that information to expand
5319692 i was the chief executive for the first 20 years i am still a relatively young guy so i will keep doing this for a while i am 43 years old

5319707 we ended up coming back and winning we were bidding blind and all that
5319708 they were like i cant believe that just happened and lochte and i were yelling and screaming it was so much fun
5319709 bravo i cannot think of a better way for a developer to first learn these algorithms and methods nor can i think of a better way for me an old ai dog to reinvigorate my knowledge of the details

5319714 let me give you the unvarnished facts of our nations fiscal predicament in the seven years ending in 2007 federal spending grew at a 6 2 percent nominal annual rate while receipts grew at only 3 5 percent the mathematics of the long term outlook for entitlements left unchanged is nothing short of catastrophic critics begin by wringing their collective hands over the unfunded liabilities of social security the bad news is that social security is the lesser of our entitlement worries it is but the tip of the unfunded liability iceberg the much bigger concern is medicare if you wanted to cover the unfunded liability of all medicare programs today you would be stuck with an 85 6 trillion bill for the existing unfunded liabilities to be covered in the end someone must pay 99 2 trillion more or receive 99 2 trillion less than they have been currently promised we know from centuries of evidence in countless economies from ancient rome to todays zimbabwe that running the printing press to pay off todays bills leads to much worse problems later on the inflation that results from the flood of money into the economy turns out to be far worse than the fiscal pain those countries hoped to avoid
5319715 though he doesnt actually say it the united states is headed for hyperinflation its debt obligations make that outcome certain just like it did for those other countries with fiat currency
5319716 more than 850m people across the world today are hungry while high food prices risk pushing 100m additional people over the edge into hunger and poverty
5319717 these efforts attract developers and create the potential for ireland to create an ocean energy technology cluster an important first step toward establishing a sustainable competitive advantage in an infant industry
5319718 other good moves include the commitment of significant government funding and government policies that provide incentives to the marketplace to accelerate commercial development
5319719 but despite these good policy actions progress toward a commercial scale installation an important development goal has been slow

5319744 this website while appearing to operate on the margins of legality was clearly a front for the sinister sexual abuse of children and an image trading ground for paedophiles there is a simple message for those individuals like thompson who think they can go to this website or indeed any space on the internet and discuss their sexual interest in children and share images you leave a digital footprint we will track you down and hold you to account

5319759 increasing kangaroo numbers to produce the same amount of meat as cattle by 2020 would provide substantial conservation benefits
5319760 currently farmers have few options to reduce the contribution that livestock make to greenhouse gas production
5319761 however low emission kangaroo meat will provide an option to avoid emissions permit fees and have a positive global impact
5319762 when landholders value a wildlife species populations increase and the conservation status of the species becomes more secure
5319763 this has been the case for similar iconic species such as springbok in south africa red deer in scotland and bison in the usa

5319851 i think i connected way more with lyrics then than i do now i have actually rooted out my diaries from when i was young and theres a meaningful lyrics section contained are these gems you were there for summer dreaming and you are a friend indeed and i know youll find your peace now in eternity robbie williams eternity
5319852 at first yeah every song on an album is important when you only have ten cds and you know the words inside out and it kind of feels like the band belongs to you that faded a bit but im trying to get back to it
5319853 absolutely music just like romantic attraction is a million times more real when youre 14
5319854 no i think theres just a sort of nostalgia that goes with the music you listen to when youre younger i think maybe i used to pay more attention to lyrics when i was younger
5319855 not when i was a young teen 13 14 but when i was 15 16 i used to get really caught up in albums so much so thatd id listen to them over and over again i got a real emotional response from them which i never really get anymore or at least very rarely
5319856 my cool cousin robert despite being only a year older than me he had a ticket to the 1994 dublin nirvana show and listened to dinosaur junior and stone temple pilots he even had an actual record player and only ever bought vinyl
5319857 dave fanning and the band names written on the canvas bags of kids in school who were cooler than me
5319858 my mam and my uncle tony were huge factors my mam comes from the talking heads david bowie mamas and papas end of music and my uncle was mad into brit pop and punk and both of them have an unhealthy obsession with bruce springsteen
5319859 my mother was a big dylan fan and i just always loved music
5319860 friends were pretty important but i read q and occasionally nme and hot press from 14 on so i was building my own immature picture of what was cool and what wasnt cool to like that gave me the notion that a finite number of deadly bands exist and that the way to get to them is through buying music magazines
5319861 when i was growing up you were either a raver or a grunger
5319862 some elements ive come to really enjoy instrumental music which i think i can trace right back to smashing pumpkins and their style and approach to writing
5319863 definitely from when i was 16 or older when i was 16 17 i had pavement sonic youth yo la tengo and jeff buckley on heavy rotation looking at the bands ive been listening to over the last week on itunes i can see a connection i still love slightly weird indie rock that occasionally has heavy parts like wolf parade white denim and times new viking but ill also listen to folky slow burners like bon iver le loup and beirut
5319864 i still listen to a lot of it so yeah i guess im a sucker for a melody and a call and answer chorus though i probably wouldntve listened to half the stuff i listen to now when i was younger i liked an easy listening experience no growers thanks
5319865 yeah i love melody and i always liked the more melodic stuff in the metal spectrum
5319866 yes a good hook a stupid lyric always gets me
5319867 dandy like musical family you can fall in and out of love with them but youre stuck to them
5319868 id still spin the first ash album because it has the same timeless youthful vigour as stuff like the undertones
5319869 very few the ones i still actually listen to from that time either stopped making records long before i was born sixties stuff or started making terrible records after a certain point counting crows
5319870 i still listen to nirvana every now and then they are still legitimately good they are durable in a general sense because kids start liking them for the same reason i did but for me i started to hear different things in them when i went back to them a few years ago heavy means a couple of different things and nirvana are all of them and poppy too in their way which helps
5319871 pavement my bloody valentine and elliot smith what makes them so durable i guess its because they each have such an original sound and when you listen to them theres just something that makes you want to hear the album the whole way through in the right order
5319872 well i never listen to smashing pumpkins anymore apart from the odd rare b side or two or any other bands from that time for that matter
5319873 i think perhaps we will need a stiff drink after that
5319874 the u s dollar is a faith based currency dependent on the credibility of a central bank
5319875 we decided this was the right issue to take over

5319881 unfortunately we couldnt get it in to the stage set up we could have done it with a bunch of wires and stuff the idea was to have it come out of the sky and hover above the crowd we had it built spent a lot of money but well save it for 2010

5319887 the russian talk about helping others and bringing peace to georgia we dont buy it when did moscow ever enter a country without bringing peace

5319917 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5319918 i think the russians will pull out but will damage georgia strongly
5319919 georgia will survive but russia has lost its credibility in the eyes of the world
5319920 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5319921 i wouldnt say theres a humanitarian catastrophe but theres an urgent need for primary products

5319930 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
