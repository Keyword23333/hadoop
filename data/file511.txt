5110000 a trans caspian gas pipeline can be considered a forever buried chimera
5110001 it became clear for all the participants of these energy games that nothing will go through the caspian sea
5110002 it makes sense why they would want to be called it it makes no sense why we would want to call them that
5110003 this feeds into their idea that this is a religious war and its not
5110004 they want it to be a war of religions but we have said very clearly that this is not a war on islam its not christianity vs islam in some way its about radicals its about extremists who are using violence
5110005 the fact is the muslim world isnt waiting around holding its breath to hear the u s government an infidel entity define islamic terms for them
5110006 this seems to me unprecedented when we fought the japanese and we fought the nazis we called them what they called themselves
5110007 if osama bin laden calls himself a mujahid we should understand what a mujahid is and we should understand that that is in english a holy warrior whos fighting on behalf of islam

5110009 according to islamic law offensive jihad offensive not just to defend yourself but offensive to go out and invade is as codified and is obilgatory
5110010 you trace it to islamic doctrine and law jihad is simply warfare to subjugate the infidel world to islamic rule
5110011 terrorist groups often try to legitimize their actions by associating them with religion using words such as jihad
5110012 however a jihad also has peaceful and positive meanings and it is unfortunate if the authorities repeat it and strengthen the extremists use of the word

5110166 we were young during the making of our first album in fact at 19 years of age everything sounds great
5110167 in fact we had ample time to write and decide what sounds good and not we had no pressure and all we wanted to do was to put our music out there
5110168 we love the sound of the second album it is more classic rock
5110169 those are nostalgic tracks and we are heavily influenced by bands such as the beatles and the beach boys most probably our maturity as musicians helps to navigate the album and we do feel that the second album is more polished than the first
5110170 it is different and difficult we did not take that lightly time seems to be the main factor that constrained us in writing materials for the second album
5110171 he is a genius he gave a lot of input on what works and what does not we learned a great deal from him

5110173 it was a mind boggling experience and we were excited just to be there

5110218 cold weather weakens scents while a warm one enhances it because as we perspire more and produce more body oil scents are retained longer
5110219 so a heavy fragrance which smells fantastic on drier and cooler climates like those in europe tend to be overpowering in our climate
5110220 but it doesnt work for me when im in kuala lumpur
5110221 high altitudes also decrease the long lasting effects of a fragrance so it should be applied more often
5110222 so stay away from overpowering perfumes and opt for less heady ones there should only be a hint of fragrance when you wear it and in so doing sparing others too from your strong scent
5110223 perfumes can either stir you up or calm you down wear a wrong one and you are left in a cloud of stink that torments everyone who gets too close weather skin moisture time of the day body chemistry and even mood can affect how a perfume smells
5110224 when you start off with a light fragrance you can layer on perfumes without them being overpowering on the other hand if you are already wearing a strong fragrance it cannot be mitigated quite as conveniently
5110225 the essence of the modern woman with its floral freshness layered with amber and wood
5110226 i really like watching infotainment shows the lives of the celebrities are just like a movie
5110227 in general indonesians love watching a paradox seeing someone rich glamorous and beautiful suffer be it a divorce or losing all their wealth overnight
5110228 bambang is handsome rich and powerful he was married to halimah for more than 25 years their joint assets are worth 27 trillion rupiah
5110229 in the publics mind they think how can bambang fall for mayangsari halimah is more beautiful than her mayangsari is not somebody of great prestige
5110230 the public support halimah in an asian culture people still disapprove and find it unacceptable to see a woman wrecking a marriage
5110231 i interviewed local actress ayu azhari about her marriage to a finnish man who converted to islam
5110232 ayus husband they are now divorced turned out to be far more strict about their religion than she is when the episode was aired it became the most watched tv show
5110233 we have established a very good network of contacts for example we are always informed whenever a celebrity couples divorce petition comes up in court
5110234 one of my reporters even had a shoe thrown at her
5110235 their commercial value greatly depends on their popularity with the public there are so many young actors actresses singers coming up all the time so the competition is fierce
5110236 they celebrities are always thinking of ways to remain in the limelight so that the public remembers them and they love being in the limelight it helps them greatly to get work
5110237 they show us their wedding clothes and their reception venue some of them even show us their marital bed
5110238 it is not always possible for the world to come to us so we value the opportunity to bring stylo to the world we are grateful to the singapore tourism board for giving us this exposure
5110239 thats much more abuse than a normal skillet would undergo
5110240 sit quietly at the table and youll get a gummy star
5110241 we basically supported the bush policy in the middle east but we have been very critical of his execution
5110242 we basically supported the bush policy in the middle east but we have been very critical of his execution
5110243 you really did it i cant believe it boy what a guyll do for a dollar you win fair and square pay the man mike
5110244 michael has an ankle injury and it has swollen up very badly and hell be out for maybe two or three weeks which is unfortunate
5110245 ryans got a hamstring injury so it was disappointing to get these injuries on top of what were missing anyway i havent got too many complaints we did our best with the resources we had available
5110246 carlos tevez will be back for the portsmouth match next week and wayne will be much sharper and much fitter and in the second half it started to show for him but unfortunately campbell also picked up an injury and i had to take him off so we were asking wayne to play through the middle when hes really needing games and it was a big ask
5110247 im not discussing anyone i think we have a good squad the same squad as last year and when tevez comes back and wayne gets games that will be my strike force
5110248 thats what it was last season and im happy to continue with that there are 37 games left so it is not a disaster we have shown before we can come from behind
5110249 in spite what everyone thinks were working really hard to bring quality players in
5110250 i think too often in the last few years newcastle have bought players that havent been quite good enough for whatever reason
5110251 sometimes they havent settled sometimes they havent seemed to understand what it means to play for newcastle united
5110252 the three that weve got so far do and the next three must as well and if that means waiting then so be it
5110253 anyone can collect players because there are hundreds around but good players who can play at newcastle not everyone can do that
5110254 the site called business exchange is one approach to the fast evolving digital world where some news sites that experiment have rapidly expanded their audiences while those that do little more than post articles online have been left in the dust
5110255 the core of business exchange is hundreds of topic pages on subjects as broad as the housing market and as narrow as the
5110256 a few other magazines and newspapers have also become serious about building verticals but they tend to jealously guard control of their online audiences and content not this one
5110257 each business exchange topic page links to articles and blog posts from myriad other sources including businessweeks competitors with the contents updated automatically by a web crawler nearly all traditional news organizations offer only their own material spurning the role of aggregator as an invitation to readers to leave their sites
5110258 and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were
5110259 not pursuing whether mccain heard any of the other questions
5110260 confirmed that mccain did not hear or see any of the broadcast
5110261 we were in motorcade until 5 30 p m et then a holding room in another building with no tv
5110262 he was in the cone of a secret service motorcade
5110263 a well made blog about a fascinating subject very much useful information and lots of links to more in depth information and resources the only thing im not to happy about is all the ideas my girlfriend got from the site
5110264 you would definitely do great if you marketed this service i love your blog very niche oriented and a pleasant read keep up the good work

5110267 eu pensei comigo o que aconteceu por que elas n o est o vindo
5110268 talvez elas pensaram que eu n o chegaria entre as tr s primeiras
5110269 a experi ncia da idade me ajudou muito j participei de muitas corridas e sei bastante coisa sobre elas
5110270 fiquei sempre olhando para tr s porque n o queria perder a medalha
5110271 foi uma grande performance mostrei o que eu posso fazer
5110272 hoje eu vi o melhor jogo do palmeiras na competi o e ganhamos s por 1 a 0 mas jogamos contra uma excelente equipe muito bem estruturada por um treinador jovem e de muito talento os jogadores conseguem entender o que ele passa
5110273 o alex matador teve uma oportunidade no jogo e botou pra dentro ele assim vai ter duas tr s chances de gol por jogo mas vai colocar pra dentro um jogador que define e sabe se posicionar
5110274 foi um sufoco danado bola pegou na trave o goleiro fez defesas incr veis o momento ali era de extravasar por tudo o que aconteceu durante a partida o time estava jogando bem ficou com um a menos em campo mas o importante foi a vit ria dentro de casa
5110275 17 august was a special day to china because of the 32 gold medals the country has won it was also a special day to me because its my birthday
5110276 classifico como injusto sempre que a equipe faz o gol justo mas teoricamente as duas equipes se equilibraram ataque defesa um jogo que o atl tico procurou se defender mas criou oportunidades ent o o sentimento de tristeza de ter sa do com um resultado negativo
5110277 foi no meu modo de ver um confronto de duas equipes que est o tentando melhorar a sua situa o no campeonato se fortalecerem achei bastante equilibrado tanto no primeiro quanto no segundo tempo
5110278 tive a impress o que quem fizesse o gol primeiro iria levar o resultado e infelizmente em uma jogada que n o marcamos bem em uma boa tabela entre o washington e o dod tomamos o gol assim como tivemos oportunidades de marcar ficamos muito pr ximos do gol mas faltou caprichar um pouco mais
5110279 tenho percebido que o nosso time vem tendo alguma modifica o o time vem evoluindo tem tido mais posse de bola marca mais joga de igual para igual com todas as equipes ganhar ou perder voc tem sempre que sair com a sensa o de que fez o melhor
5110280 estamos tentando extrair o m ximo do grupo mas acho que faltou caprichar na finaliza o ter convic o de que pode fazer gol que pode ganhar o jogo algumas cabe adas erradas chutes equivocados faltou este poder ofensivo
5110281 levando em conta raz es estritamente humanit rias e porque somos respeitosos dos direitos humanos demos esse amparo e ela est hospitalizada na nicar gua
5110282 porque somos respeitosos dos direitos humanos damos prote o s pessoas independentemente do pa s que sejam
5110283 quando cruzei a linha e vi sherone e kerron l foi o grande momento eu n o trocaria isso por nada
5110284 meu deus isso demais o segredo do sucesso da equipe o poder do reggae
5110285 eu n o sabia de nada sobre a queimada de largada s ouvi sobre isso depois que terminei
5110286 ela estava mais perto de mim e senti a queimada de largada mas a prova acabou n o h nada que possamos fazer a jamaica saiu no topo
5110287 se voc consegue oito medalhas de ouro consegue qualquer coisa
5110288 voc agiu com humildade d um grande abra o em sua m e por mim
5110289 acho que foi um jogo equilibrado em todos os aspectos e definido numa jogada que estava marcada e estava toda desenhada e n s sofremos o gol por um relaxamento natural para um time que passa jogar contra dez homens
5110290 o veiga n o entrou bem foi uma op o minha queria que ele jogasse um pouco mais adiantado e nosso time passou a jogar atr s infelizmente tive que substituir um jogador experiente como ele mas nosso time mudou muito o desempenho no fim do primeiro tempo
5110291 ocorreu uma fatalidade isso foi uma falta de sorte mas olimp ada assim mesmo e hoje n o foi nosso dia
5110292 se fosse s a falta dava para seguir o problema foi que acabei caindo e eliminado

5110295 ah tou a ver qual mas tamb m n o sei quem que a canta
5110296 faced with calls to make the sums stack up cameron reverts to slogans sharing the proceeds of growth or living within our means when pressed he concedes this means sticking with labours spending plans
5110297 but a serious look at his policies reveals an approach which is at best confused and at worst would be deeply damaging for our economy
5110298 wherever possible david cameron has ducked difficult questions be it on global commodity prices the collapse of northern rock the 10p tax rate or the future of nuclear power
5110299 but dig deeper and what you see is not quite what you get he campaigns against a new runway for heathrow in londons mayoral election while promising the city to do more on infrastructure he promises green tax increases to the green movement and tells everyone else they wont make anyone worse off
5110300 he knows that his party and in particular his shadow chancellor are keen for some traditional tory red meat especially on tax cuts so they remain ideologically opposed to europe at a time when world economic problems mean european and international co operation matter more than ever
5110301 they remain hostile to government action for example opposing nationalisation of northern rock even at the risk of serious financial instability at a time when the role of government is critical to stability and prosperity
5110302 however after his own experience of black wednesday cameron knows the damage to his party from inept and unpopular economic policies hence the emergence of cameronomics where photo ops and warm words attempt to distract from risky destructive ideology
5110303 you would expect a similar process on any landscape but when you have changes in elevation it makes things more complicated
5110304 were just getting back the lost treasures of the desktop that we lost when we went to the web
5110305 it is a great property but it simply didnt fit into our plans for 2009
5110306 do not pray for tasks equal to your abilities but pray for abilities equal to your tasks then the performance of your tasks will be no miracle but you will be the miracle
5110307 its the story of life its not a hockey story
5110308 it took me a good three or four years just to figure out what was going on
5110309 as a player i always believed that eventually id go on to work for a club
5110310 ive always tried to do things in a very methodical way
5110311 i was a player in my twenties learned the business in my thirties and im getting involved on the management side with a club in my forties
5110312 ive looked at it for a long time that way
5110313 i had contacted them about what they were doing and i sent them some information on how i believed an organization should be run
5110314 we were all in agreement and were able to come together quickly as to what was going to happen
5110315 they dont understand how knowledgeable they are people know that oren played they know that len played they didnt know how current their information was or how much time and effort theyve put in
5110316 i think what youre seeing are the fruits of all of our vision we were able to very quickly come to a consensus about where were going and how were going to get there
5110317 a tremendous player with a tremendous future who gets a little bit of a benefit because hell have vinny lecavalier and myself here
5110318 vinny has done an incredible job but not without having some hard times when he started out as well
5110319 particularly on the management side to put steven in a position to succeed and to guide him through the beginning of his career
5110320 its a real benefit that will be terrific for him that we have some real quality players on the team
5110321 he wont be counted on to lead our team every night or to lead our team in points
5110322 hes a very humble person just a young hockey player whos going to do everything he can to get better and earn his stripes every day
5110323 i played in the canada cup that was a big honor i had a couple of hat tricks in chicago stadium that was an honor i scored some overtime goals you know those are the types of things that were a lot of fun but its the few people that are really good close friends today that have meant the most to me
5110324 being selected first overall theyre all nice things but they seem so innate in the end its the experience and the relationships those are the things that stand out for a very long time
5110325 im really excited to go to prague with our hockey team
5110326 were big literally one of the biggest group of forwards and our defense isnt small neither are our goalies expect with barry melrose as their coach a big aggressive skating team
5110327 jeff halpern is a guy that just makes you win hell do whatever he has to do if he has to chip in offensively hes capable if he has to shut down the other teams top line hes capable hes a guy in my opinion when all things match up evenly that will tilt things in your favor
5110328 chris has a strong history with the hockey club a lot of size a lot of aggressiveness we think hes got a couple of things to really prove hes on a one year contract and we expect a big year from him
5110329 we were interested in mark and mark was very interested in playing for the tampa bay lightning its wide open what role hell play we like his versatility we like his character weve spent a lot of time discussing potential situations and marks all on board with everything he wants to contribute in any way he can
5110330 jannes a guy that can be a serious contributor on our power play but quite frankly is just a guy that is capable of playing in the nhl night in night out hes gotta come in and prove that in camp
5110331 lundin was up all year last year and he surprised a lot of people he had a great career at maine and is just a really intelligent player
5110332 youre going to see a lot of competition between andrew janne and mike they all have the capabilities we want to give people an opportunity to show us what theyve got in a very competitive environment where guys are gonna push each other to be better
5110333 you can say theyll be in direct competition on paper but until everybody gets in there and you see where everybody is you cant make those statements just yet theyre going to be competing for a spot to be on the club and theyre all going to get a great opportunity
5110334 to be a success that will have to translate on the scoreboard and in the standings
5110335 last year was not acceptable to this organization we want players to give their all every day but we really want them to enjoy what theyre doing its still a game there needs to be an element of fun and enjoyment for people to fulfill their potential
5110336 up to now there has been just a very light off and on rainfall so much so that last night the people continued celebrating carnival
5110337 hey lets just stop the game so he cant save and has to close it and play it all over
5110338 as long as the grotto stands key west will never again experience the full brunt of a hurricane
5110339 people are playing in their head considering what happened the last time

5110343 fa o o meu trabalho com convic o com certeza daquilo que estou fazendo sempre visando o bem da equipe senti que na arrancada o marques estava desgastado natural na idade dele que tem muita condi o t cnica
5110344 coloquei o garoto para poder fazer a fun o do marques de chegar na frente e completar no meio porque t nhamos a id ia de que poder amos empatar o jogo
5110345 um jogador que se exp e muito que n o p ra vai para cima natural que ele se desgaste no final dos jogos e isso que a gente tem tentado administrar j que a parte t cnica a parte disciplinar s o excepcionais atletas que eu quero contar com eles sempre
5110346 nossa equipe uma equipe jovem que est amadurecendo durante o campeonato acho que quando eles tiveram o jogador expulso faltou um pouco de malandragem para girar a bola ter calma para criar a oportunidade de fazer gol
5110347 a gente tinha quatro cinco jogadores para tr s deles na verdade foi uma desaten o nossa
5110348 a gente sai um pouco frustrado porque se preparou muito forte para vencer esta partida acho que fizemos uma atua o razo vel mas para vencer o palmeiras ficou provado que n o basta jogar razoavelmente
5110349 o gol foi uma falha nossa ali atr s era uma bola simples e deixamos sair o cruzamento o alex mineiro se antecipou e fez o gol
5110350 we hope these seminars contribute to students learning about the web and generate discussion on important topics currently facing the web industry and indeed all users of the web
5110351 irrigating with wastewater isnt a rare practice limited to a few of the poorest countries
5110352 its a widespread phenomenon occurring on 20 million hectares 50 million acres across the developing world especially in asian countries like china india and vietnam but also around nearly every city of sub saharan africa and in many latin american cities as well
5110353 in over 70 percent of the cities studied more than half of urban agricultural land is irrigated with wastewater that is either raw or diluted in streams
5110354 in the face of water scarcity generally and a lack of access to clean water urban farmers will have no alternative except to use diluted or untreated wastewater or polluted river water

5110372 nick gills doing a very good job hes working hard a couple of weeks ago we had our ruckmen kick six and simon goodwin continues to cause the opposition some problems down there
5110373 what youve seen in the past two weeks is the capacity to share that 10 and 12 goalkickers in the last two weeks is really important for us
5110374 we understand we havent got a matthew lloyd at the moment but well continue to develop our squad so we can get those type of players
5110375 ive moved about all year but the last couple of weeks ive been thrown down there its good hard work but i enjoy kicking goals
5110376 weve got the structure that we can put different people through it and hopefully they can play well because weve got a good structure in place it doesnt always work as you would like but weve stuck at it and days like today saturday can happen
5110377 hey i bought gas at some little station in the middle of nowhere could that cause a problem
5110378 at one level a post american world is a sign of american failure and at another its a sign of glorious success

5110383 a man came to allahs apostle and said instruct me as to such a deed as equals jihad in reward
5110384 among the believers are men who have been true to their covenant with allah and have gone out for jihad holy fighting some have completed their vow to extreme and have been martyred fighting and dying in his cause and some are waiting prepared for death in battle
5110385 allahs apostle said there is no migration after the conquest of mecca but only jihad
5110386 allahs apostle said i have been ordered to fight with the people till they say
5110387 it is not proper for the believers to all go forth together to fight jihad a troop from every expedition should remain behind when others go to war
5110388 the prophet said were it not for the believers who do not want to be without me i would always go forth in army units setting out for jihad
5110389 the best jihad struggle is by the one who strives against his own self for allah the mighty and majestic
5110390 fight in the cause of allah those who fight you but do not transgress limits for allah loves not transgressors
5110391 the best jihad struggle is by the one who strives against his own self for allah the mighty and majestic
5110392 fight in the cause of allah those who fight you but do not transgress limits for allah loves not transgressors
5110393 allah ahead of our loved ones our wealth our worldly ambitions and our own lives
5110394 the true believers are only those who believe in allah and his messenger and afterward doubt not but strive with their wealth and their selves for the cause of allah such are the truthful
5110395 the life of the prophet muhammad was full of striving to gain the freedom to inform and convey the message of islam during his stay in makkah mecca he used non violent methods and after the establishment of his government in madinah medina by the permission of allah he used armed struggle against his enemies whenever he found it inevitable
5110396 lo those who believe and those who emigrate to escape persecution and strive jahadu in the way of allah these have hope of allahs mercy
5110397 to those against whom war is made permission is given to defend themselves because they are wronged and verily allah is most powerful to give them victory
5110398 fighting and warfare might sometimes be necessary but it was only a minor part of the whole jihad or struggle a well known tradition hadith has muhammad say on returning from a battle we return from the little jihad to the greater jihad the more difficult and crucial effort to conquer the forces of evil in oneself and and in ones own society in all the details of daily life

5110404 previously the security situation was very bad and this area was under the control of the insurgency groups

5110406 some of the doctors are trying to close the clinic by having women deliver at home and getting the cash
5110407 there is no trust between the local government and the provincial government because there are no rules and regulation regarding the budget

5110418 parlare con gli altri non vuol dire apparire deboli anzi aprirsi vuol dire essere forti a tal punto da mostrare le proprie debolezze
5110419 first of all during that spring and summer we have two major assassinations by the time the convention rolls around the democrats are going into the convention with an enormous amount of division within the party
5110420 humphrey has the support of course of the johnson administration but for that reason hes enormously controversial to anyone who opposes the vietnam war so from the outset theres absolutely no unity in the party and it devolves from there into chaos
5110421 within the protesters you have everything you can imagine people who are there solely to peacefully protest the war all the way to people like jerry rubin and abbie hoffman who deliberately came to undermine the democrats
5110422 so i saw this march of people marching against the war in vietnam and of course my heart was with them i was opposed to the war as well so i joined the march
5110423 it was just a sense of joy and celebration that slipped over the crowd it was a celebration of having our voice heard
5110424 i looked down on the crowd that i had been in only minutes before and at the far right end at the end of the block i saw these policemen in military formation and as they approached that crowd they picked up speed and they started running into that crowd with their nightsticks swinging it was awful i just i couldnt believe that this was happening in our country i broke down and started crying i could not believe what i was seeing
5110425 it was a police riot it was a police riot and the demonstrators reacted to that police riot there would have never been the chaos that occurred had it not been for that police riot
5110426 i think there are a thousand stories to answer that if you look at the numbers estimates are there were probably about 5 000 protesters you have about 12 000 police that daly had put on the streets and another 5 000 to 10 000 in national guard and army
5110427 but the consensus really is and this is confirmed by a report in the aftermath of chicago that the police riot was really the story that was going on that the police were really looking for a fight
5110428 and it affirms in peoples minds i think the sense that the democratic party is imploding that its an organization that is incoherent that it cant contain itself
5110429 most historians have come to the conclusion that 68 really does fuel the rise of a conservative revolution
5110430 we learned that the young can make a difference that if the young are passionate that if they are peaceful and non violent that they do impact that was number one but number two we learned that we ought not to be afraid of peaceful demonstration
5110431 it was a police riot it was a police riot and the demonstrators reacted to that police riot there would have never been the chaos that occurred had it not been for that police riot
5110432 when you have at least one woman in a position of power such as an executive producer or director you not only get more female characters but more dimensional and powerful female characters
5110433 go see a movie about women on the opening weekend that is what matters to hollywood
5110434 we need to build our economic power and prove were a market
5110435 the only thing that makes anyone pay attention is money
5110436 anyone who thinks otherwise shouldnt be in this business young men under 25 keep seeing comic book and slasher films and thats why hollywood makes them if women want to change things they cant wait for the dvd
5110437 i refuse even the money side of my business i try to do as good work as i can do i try to grow in my art and reach for truth
5110438 you think once youve shown what you can do and your movies have been successful that snap you work so to discover the difference between guys roles and girls roles made me plain mad its unjust
5110439 it will be great for some of our guys to play against geelong its a wonderful opportunity so we are looking forward to it
5110440 its pretty simple why they are so good they have a lot of talent they are very mature very slick and probably have got four of their best players sitting on the sideline last night and they will probably come back in next week
5110441 but again we will recover and front up and send them out there and have a shot at it
5110442 i think they are going to be a big problem for a lot of teams in september they are very well coached and to a man they played their part for the team they are right up there with the best teams we had played this year
5110443 teams that are going to play the kangaroos in the finals i think watch out because they have hit form at the right time their key players are playing well they are playing very structured and very good footy
5110444 absolutely edwards and hamish and thommo nathan thompson next week you cant play them all in the same side though so if you are in one of those positions you have to perform
5110445 whatever happens between now and the end of the year and we can put our hand over our heart and say we are going to play in september after today i just look at the young players we have brought in over the last two years and we are really heading in the right direction
5110446 dark knight blah blah blah gritty blah blah blah heath ledger tragedy great loss to acting should get oscar five stars
5110447 we need to get the fire going and we both need to drink can you manage
5110448 of course theyll come tobias we just have to be patient
5110449 because i told them to leave us alone you know when we lost power in the tricorder and phasers
5110450 well every time power was restored i would be contacted by the enterprise it annoyed me and as i thought the blackouts were of little consequence i told the ship to ignore them and that i would contact them if i needed to
5110451 yes but im sure beverly will be worried by now every time ive been away from the ship where possible i have always contacted her regularly this protracted silence will tell her somethings wrong im sure she will convince will to check up on us and when they find our camp abandoned theyll start looking for us
5110452 no i dont think so when we left the enterprise we were unable to scan the surface at all at least this area unless that has changed we will have to rely on personnel coming down and physically looking for us as you know our tricorder was of limited use and i know that none of our technology works at the ruins
5110453 theres a light drizzle coming in from the sea its still pretty windy
5110454 well then tomorrow with luck well be able to build a fire outside hopefully they will spot the smoke and come to investigate
5110455 you honestly think theyre looking for us i doubt it i think were screwed
5110456 stop saying that yes i think theyre looking for us and its up to us to help them
5110457 not at all unfortunately the wound in the animals chest will only hasten decomposition and the raised temperature in the cave will exacerbate matters perhaps tomorrow we can move it outside together
5110458 we can carve it up into manageable bits with the phaser
5110459 yes but im sure well be found soon in any event it is a matter of our well being that we remove the remains i dont know about you but the last thing i want is to be sharing this cave with a rotting carcase
5110460 maman said my farts were breathtaking maybe we should leave it here to compete
5110461 there are times my son when i question the validity of our connection are you really related to me
5110462 of course i do but not loudly and not in public
5110463 so what youre at some captains thing and you want to fart what do you do hold it in and fill up with gas
5110464 i would excuse myself and leave the room as any gentleman would
5110465 actually i used to have competitions with my brother one time we got kicked out of gym class for doing it
5110466 yes well just as long as you know i will never admit to telling you that its between you and me
5110467 okay thats enough for today well leave it as is and return to the ship ill ask engineering to make us a sled and tomorrow well drag it to a shuttle
5110468 i know how you feel but we need a sled to move it and we dont have one be patient my friend
5110469 not bloody likely mrak captain picard and his son are somewhere on this damned planet and were going to find them
5110470 but doctor we cannot function properly in the dark it makes no logical sense to continue we should return to the ship
5110471 there is microcellular debris here doctor two types and here
5110472 unknown im taking this back to the ship in the mean time keep looking
5110473 oh nothing arent you going to ask me what ive found
5110474 the microcellular debris comes from both the captain and tobias but the droplets of blood are the captains im just about to go back down for another look
5110475 what didnt you hear me will the blood belongs to jean luc hes hurt
5110476 we dont know that beverly he might have cut a finger or something i want all our personnel back aboard over night
5110477 no look let me go back to help mrak and her teams i think
5110478 i dont want anybody on the surface over night beverly until we find the captain and figure out what the hells going on i want to protect our crew
5110479 but will do you realise what youre saying youre leaving jean luc and tobias to their fate we can find them will if you wont let the crew go down then let me go alone ill keep in contact and ill
5110480 you have damaged your lung that bruise on your chest how did you come by it
5110481 well i found this cave then it had drift wood piled up in front and i climbed the pile to get a look inside but as i turned to leave the pile collapsed and i fell i landed on my side and something happened because the next thing i knew i was waking up down between the boulders
5110482 you probably lost consciousness and you most certainly broke some ribs and thats whats damaged your lung
5110483 you must make a fire outside put seaweed on it make lots of smoke
5110484 i understand papa before i go ill get you a drink
5110485 theres no more water papa since it stopped raining the pool has dried up
5110486 never mind theres bound to be some puddles outside promise me youll find some and drink
5110487 i promise papa ill go and make the fire now and dont worry ill make it a smoky one
5110488 i cant come up here and get it we cant risk losing it
5110489 its all right tobias we fell and you hit your head
5110490 my head hurts and i feel sick in my stomach
5110491 i know i think you have a bad concussion can you see all right
5110492 i everythings doubled but when i blink it clears a bit
5110493 you should get back to the cave do you think you can climb
5110494 i dont think so son i cant even stand up let alone climb
5110495 because i bloody well said so just do it will you
5110496 all right all right you win sit down before you fall down
5110497 well its going to be very hard to light that then
5110498 perhaps you can look for it it cant be too far away
5110499 would you like to get a bite to eat or something so i can talk to you about your love of intertexuality

5110524 on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron
5110525 it will be a beautiful day when the masses look at the paper and truly realize they have lost their own country
5110526 white people arent going to do a thing until their toys are taken away from them
5110527 so things have to be worse for things to be better
5110528 we have not inherited the earth from our parents we have borrowed it from our children
5110529 on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron
5110530 good politicians like good scientists draw conclusions from facts bad politicians like bad scientists draw facts from conclusions
5110531 we have not inherited the earth from our parents we have borrowed it from our children
5110532 the condom fits 100 perfectly so the safety is much higher than a standard condoms and it feels more natural
5110533 if youre asking me if id rather finish fourth or fifth id much rather finish fourth that obviously gives you a better chance of a premiership
5110534 our main focus is to make the finals for a start as it is every year and were still not over the line there yet so we need to make sure we get there
5110535 thats at the front of our mind rather than worrying about whether were going to be fifth fourth or whatever
5110536 weve got to take some positives out of the game because were still in the mix and weve got big games to come against collingwood and brisbane
5110537 weve got to get some of our players back into form some of our guys are in good form
5110538 he comprehensively beat his opponent and was a class above any other forward on the night
5110539 when you start looking at results the expectation comes and you lose focus and then you lose
5110540 so we will focus on the job at hand you cant win finals until you are in them and we are clearly not in them so that question about the top eight is irrelevant
5110541 im not trying to be smart but everyone talks about momentum but gee whiz weve lost two games in the past month
5110542 theyre a really down to earth group the st kilda boys they dont get ahead of themselves
5110543 theyve already started preparing for a very professional outfit in the adelaide football club theyve got a day on us weve got to fly back there is no time for a lapse in professionalism
5110544 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5110545 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5110546 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5110547 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5110548 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5110549 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5110550 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5110553 they intel wont be factoring our 45 nanometer shanghai product and be making shipments of that by the end of the year

5110556 im delighted to announce that act policing has met or surpassed all of its response time targets when attending to incidents across the territory
5110557 this is a commendable result and one that act policing should be proud of

5110561 he mitchell wasnt comfortable with the surface under his feet and we butchered the footy a fair few occasions and we need to get better in that regard
5110562 but i reckon the mcg surface needs to get better too its the worst ive ever seen it
5110563 theres been enormous talk about the telstra dome surface three or four years ago and telstra dome is miles better than the mcg at the present time
5110564 as we know it is winter it is wet and it is a little bit soft so of course its a little bit different to normal
5110565 we have other agendas in our mind that others arent aware of
5110566 if you look at the best team in the competition geelong and also hawthorn they possess the ball similar numbers or more than us
5110567 i agree there are times all teams get their decision making wrong
5110568 only at times when the ball is turned over after using tactics to hold ground do we second guess and say it should have been done the other way with a quick kick to the forwards
5110569 then when holding tactics lead to an inside 50 or a goal we say good play you have to spend time to look at the tape and see how many times the extra handball caused a problem or did it set up a goal
5110570 when it mucks up well all cry kick the ball if the opposition is playing a certain way you cant kick the ball to a crowded defence you need to run and get past some of their extra numbers
5110571 i thought we got quite a good response from our players from last weeks disappointing game a 66 point loss to carlton
5110572 im not going to feel as bad as last week given the fact there was a lot of effort displayed tonight
5110573 it is time to do justice to them after the establishment of the state of law
5110574 ridicule is the only weapon that can be used against unintelligible propositions ideas must be distinct before reason can act upon them
5110575 iraq bringing benzene and gasoline from outside its a joke
5110576 we need equipment we need instruments we need a lot of technical help
5110577 these deals themselves are not likely to be hugely lucrative
5110578 a lot of conferences give attendees a development platform to work on while theyre at the event but esc boston attendees get to keep their newly configured kit
5110579 we must rise to the challenge and modernize our universities so that they retain their status as producers of the most skilled workforce in the world

5110593 i am not really jewish i found out recently im 1 8th but i was not raised in a religious or ethnically conscious home
5110594 while im not jewish i did think the band was a good fit for me even though i was born and confirmed catholic i proudly wore the star of david around my neck this really freaked my parents out
5110595 to me being in total passover wasnt really about the whole jewish thing i mean yeah okay i was down with the cause and in fact i too still own a star of david necklace that i wore even after i left the band i was only jewish by association but i dug it
5110596 after my parents found out i was hanging around jewish people they had me de programmed and my head filled back up with the proper and correct catholic dogma so most of those total passover memories are lost to the ages along with any memory of owing tom twenty dollars
5110597 im certain there is spanish jewish ancestry on my mothers side but how far it goes back i cannot tell

5110610 the designs are not the typical melinda looi look though it will be an all new melinda looi with electric blue as the signature colour

5110640 semejante provocaci n s lo podr a ser urdida por el lado ruso con el objetivo de mantener las unidades militares rusas en la zona de conflicto
5110641 the argument was the thing that art itself was arguable and that was okay
5110642 but its hard to overstate the importance of a nationally syndicated tv show that speaks up for small fine movies without marketing budgets and reinforces names such as
5110643 the irony of course is that it wasnt so long ago that ebert and siskel themselves and those opposing critical digits were often raised as the primary catalyst in the dumbing down of film criticism

5110653 oh and i dont wanna die for you but if dyings asked of me ill bear that cross with honor cause freedom dont come free im an american soldier my system information
5110654 go to a monestry placed somewhere in there youll find a book required for learn the expelliarmus spell level 30 the monastry is guarded by some mean vampires do whatever it take to get that book
5110655 i can hear you the rest of the world hears you and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon
5110656 the rest of the boat was still rowing i put my oar down i was done
5110657 were really proud to be in the same league as those amazing women
5110658 before we left princeton we all gathered together at my house and we watched the 1984 race and it was really inspiring
5110659 just to see those women be so cool when it was neck and neck and they pulled away at the end thats what we envisioned
5110660 it felt like we got faster put it that way
5110661 on the schuylkill at college thats where i fell in love with this sport
5110662 probably the most professional group ive ever worked with no fear
5110663 they came down smiling to the boathouse today which was a good sign
5110664 you train for gold you dont say im going to train for that silver medal honestly i dont care about scores i dont care about placement i just want to go out and hit the best routine that i can
5110665 you just want the best for everybody a lot of people think that while im sitting there watching im saying please fall its totally the opposite if i finished last and had a great routine but everybody else hit their routines id be happy you really feel the pain
5110666 i knew that if she had a great routine she would have it
5110667 she stuck every landing she had beautiful execution i was really proud of her she deserved it
5110668 the plot centers on an upper middle class new york mother is forced to start over after getting divorced and losing her high powered job in one fell swoop
5110669 i thought they put a few eggs in that basket today
5110670 when a bloke has been as good as what hes been when a bloke is nine goals off a hundred when the opposition know they are in a finals campaign i dont think they do it on purpose
5110671 i think players do it as a natural thing that they want to see this bloke who has looked after them so much they want to look after him
5110672 considering when he kicks two goals in the first couple of minutes of a game youd be trying to get the ball to him as often as you possibly could
5110673 roughy played higher up the ground than what we expected considering he kicked 10 goals against us the last two times we played them hes always been a worry for us so we were comfortable with that
5110674 there was plenty of opportunities for all of our forwards to have an impact and it was either due to the forwards poor play or the midfielders poor execution of the kick which disallowed us to do that
5110675 if you watched the third quarter there was plenty of opportunities for us but we just butchered the footy
5110676 i sat here after the last time we played hawthorn raving about what alastair had done with their rolling zone so obviously we put a fair bit of time into playing them this time around
5110677 so we were ready for it and thats a real credit to the coaching staff your assistants who put so much work in real credit to the guys who do the opposition analysis and to the players
5110678 ti innamori cos per caso di un tipo qualunque ti innamori cos imparando a volergli bene parlandogli da amica sorridendogli accorgendoti di star male se un giorno non lo vedi t innamori cos stando ore insieme a lui quando il cuore batte forte se lui ti si avvicinae una voglia immensa di baciarlo se dolcemente ti sfiora t innamori cos stando male quando il suo viso rigato dalle lacrime sentendoti morire al solo pensiero ke lui abbia unaltra ti innamori cos quando provi tutte queste cose e quando vuoi dire a una persona solo tre parole grazie di esistere

5110686 as a nation we need to turn the rising tide of diabetes around this will require a concerted effort from all key stakeholders government at all levels non government organisations community based agencies and their leaders to work in partnership to develop healthier lifestyles
5110687 clearly national strategies are needed beyond behaviourally based awareness raising campaigns that focus just on physical activity and healthy eating
5110688 we need concerted committed and coordinated action at systems and organisational level to address the underlying social determinants of health that cause risk factors for obesity and diabetes
5110689 diabetes australia believes we must deal with the obesogenic environment in this way if we want real change which is sustainable over the long term and help create an environment where healthy choices can be easier choices
5110690 while type 2 diabetes is recognized as a serious global epidemic the severe health consequences of untreated sleep apnea especially in people with diabetes are not health policy makers and the general public must be made aware of the link between type 2 diabetes and sleep apnea so that we can begin to address the significant economic burden and debilitating health consequences to both individuals and the community
5110691 todays statement is an urgent call to action to the medical community it is imperative that we better understand the relationship between diabetes and sleep apnea through research and establish appropriate standards of care for managing diabetes and co morbidities such as sleep apnea
5110692 recent studies show that osa is common in people with diabetes estimates suggest that up to 40 of people with osa have diabetes 2 3 however further research is needed in this area in order to strengthen the evidence base between diabetes and osa

5110695 the parties still are far from each other though on one point and that is the executive powers that should go to the president and the prime minister that is the stumbling block
5110696 it is critical that we conclude these negotiations very soon i hope that wise counsel and wisdom will prevail we are fully and firmly committed to the process of dialogue

5110745 even though i appear as myself in the coming film crazy people youll have to take my objective view that its one of the funniest movies to come down the pike in a long long time
5110746 if you dont have any self control we can deal with that

5110759 granted the archways are not smoothly semi circular as might be seen in for example a roman arch nor are they as sharply pointed as a gothic arch these could in fact be tudor arches including the ogee inflexed and the elliptical arches weve already seen that makes four distinct types of arch at this site which is highly unusual the progression of advances in engineering could be indicative of long term occupancy possibly spanning
5110760 still this is several steps beyond the corbel arches seen in the oldest section of this site and which are often referred to as false arches since the structure doesnt sufficiently redirect the stress bearing loads given that this entire site is entirely erected of stone the weight
5110761 i love you but not in that way not that theres anything wrong with that
5110762 oh yeah i now know more about archways vaulted ceilings and flying buttresses than frank lloyd wrong
5110763 and i am now well versed in what is apparently a nearly endless list of substances which give off readings similar to naquadah yet which are not remotely related to it
5110764 every wrong answer helps narrow down the right one sir plus ive collected some great new data about energy signatures
5110765 carter between you and daniel im way past my perky limit for the month check in again in two hours and try not to sound so cheerful will ya oneill out
5110766 she sounded as bouncy as you look and she didnt even find anything yet
5110767 well in science one often learns as much if not more from experiments that dont go as planned than the ones that do
5110768 amazing catenary its extremely unusual to have so many different styles
5110769 you got bonked pretty good on the noggin there i needed to check your pupils for signs of immediate swelling or pressure in the brain ill have to check again later just in case pressures been building up slowly
5110770 like that time i stepped into a hole when we were running from the jaffa on m35 2p9
5110771 okay light sprain there better leave your boot on to help contain the swelling
5110772 so looks like the pipes burst and flooded the basement kind of a fancy basement though looks like those medieval churches with the fancy vaulted ceilings bit on the damp side for the brethren to congregate now
5110773 im sure they had women too brethren doesnt just mean the guys in the congregation
5110774 cistern as in reservoir this is an underground water storage tank did you notice the courtyard up there
5110775 i noticed it completely failed at being a courtyard when we stepped on it
5110776 true but right before that i saw that there were drains in the pavement around the statue in the middle
5110777 the pavement was sloped to direct rainwater to the center and down those drains into this cistern
5110778 technically you were in the lead so you fell down the well i fell in trying to help you
5110779 when i was a kid i used to watch that show about that dog lassie little timmy was always falling down wells just like you
5110780 shouldnt you be up there barking for sam and tealc
5110781 trust me i barked no signal as soon as we miss check in theyll come looking for us well be out of here in three hours tops all we have to do is kick back and pass the time
5110782 itll be a snug fit but if we lay on our sides we can do it
5110783 yeah me too better take your time getting up but first
5110784 were a little banged up but well be okay though well need to cut this picnic short and pay a visit to fraiser
5110785 oh daniel managed to find an early example of an indoor swimming pool
5110786 never mind carter the floor gave way and dropped us on our asses in some underground chamber full of water
5110787 daniel says its a cistern bring lots of rope were about 20 feet down
5110788 we have nearly arrived at your last known location now and will need to double back to camp to obtain rope can you tell us exactly where you are
5110789 just keep following our tracks big guy when you get to a paved courtyard surrounded by buildings look for the big hole in the ground and try not to find us the hard way two of us down here is bad enough lets not make it unanimous
5110790 well daniel the colonels field assessment of your condition was right on the money in addition to the bumps and bruises youve got a mild concussion and a sprained ankle for the ankle stay off your feet for the next forty eight hours keep the compression bandage on keep it elevated and ice it every three to four hours but for no more than twenty minutes at a time if you do need to move around use crutches the pharmacy will dispense those along with your meds for the headache youll have codeine for the muscle aches take ibuprofen
5110791 colonel you should be fine with ibuprofen and im putting you both on broad spectrum antibiotics for ten days since theres no way of knowing what was brewing in that water colonel youre on medical leave for the next three days daniel youre on definite leave for a week at which time ill reevaluate the ankle and well see when you might be able to go on light duty
5110792 actually colonel an airman will drive you two home neither of you is in any shape to get behind the wheel
5110793 sam and tealc have already offered to get your vehicles back to your houses so dont worry about that

5110803 a border aint nothing but a law drawn in the sand
5110804 but it was really just a way to bring the lolz for jasper emmett and i
5110805 the wedding goes well even a bit boring but it was nice not to have to fight some evil vampire for a few hours so i try to be a good husband and invite bellas smelly dog best friend to cheer her up
5110806 but of course fido has to go cause a big scene when he finds out im gonna tap that while she is still human even though shes been begging to do her for months and i mean how much restraint is man supposed to have
5110807 anyways so i take bella away to esmes island which is in the middle of nowhere so i can get busy with my wife in private and she wont get all cold from me because its hot as hell
5110808 so then i get all seductive and tell bella to meet me in the ocean then im finally not a virgin anymore but now no one has any idea how fucking awesome i am in bed since the bitch author fades to black so i get all emo about and figure i shouldnt do it with bella again until after she is changed which of course pisses bella off
5110809 so i totally freak out because there is no god damn way im spending eternity looking after a kid so im thinking its time for a mutant baby smushsmortion but bella is all attached and shit
5110810 so we go back home to get help from carlisle but apparently bella and rose are all bff now so the house is all divided then to top it off things are now told from the mongrels pov
5110811 im edward fucking cullen does no one care about my view
5110812 anyways so i hear all the dogs thoughts and between bella dying from the mutant baby and me not getting a chance to have my pov i get really emo and desperate and ask jacob to do bella so she can have puppies or whatever werewolves have
5110813 i know i know wtf right lapse in judgement but i really didnt want bella to die
5110814 so were trying to be all nice to the dogs because the pack broke up and give them food and shelter and of course my bff seth is awesome about it all but jake and leah have to be complete assholes about it all
5110815 so this pregnancy shit goes on for way too long not mention a bunch of really pointless and boring stuff with the pack goes on
5110816 then of course as soon as carlisle and the others leave bella goes into labor and then rose decides she gets thirsty for bella right when she is supposed to save the baby so im all
5110817 so i inject her in the heart with my venom then bite her all over then 2 days go by while she has her transformation and she doesnt move at all so im kinda freaked but i mean 2 days
5110818 so when she wakes up she is super hot which is awesome and i take her hunting and it turns out she can handle the bloodlust business really well so thumbs up and i show her the baby and warn her about jacob but kinda dont say everything
5110819 so bella finds out jacob imprinted on our kid and nicknamed her after the lock ness monster so she flips out on him which basically just amuses me
5110820 so to calm bella down i take her to our little cabin the family gave us for some vampire sexin and she felt way better if i do say so
5110821 okay you have to admit the stuff with nessie and me is pretty fucking cute
5110822 so bella is all bonding with nessie then that idiot jacob comes back and tells bella he fucking phased in front of charlie and invited him over so we try to act all normal since hes been clueless all this time and its like
5110823 then he comes and like basically doesnt care which is stupid but at least bella didnt eat him which was helpful
5110824 time totally flies by and nessie grows super fast and is all creepy too so carlisle and i do research and plan to go back to south america to figure this baby shit out
5110825 bella goes hunting with jacob and nessie but that that ho bag irina sees them on some fucking mountain and gets all miffed and walks away
5110826 alice has some epic vision of the volturi killing us all just when things are going okay so were basically all fucked then alice and jasper totally bail after we decide to round up more vamps to vouch for nessie
5110827 and its like wtf alice way to bail but we formulate a plan anyways and everyone goes off to round up vampires to witness that nessie grows since vamp babies and big n o with the volturi since irina told them she her that day in the mountains
5110828 so all these vamps from all over show up and we find bella is actually a shield but she kinda sucks at using it so we are all training her
5110829 all this preparation stuff goes on for a long ass time i mean even im getting bored and im expecting to die soon
5110830 so then the day finally comes for the battle to end all battles but it goes on so long and the volturi are all corrupt because we proved nessie wasnt an immortal and bellas shield keeps us all safe
5110831 then alice comes back with another half immortal kid who is basically totally okay and stopped growing at like 17 so we know nessie wont die and now we know that alice didnt bail on us
5110832 and like i totally knew she wouldnt bail because she is alice and she is too awesome for that
5110833 so the voluturi back off because everyone kinda turned against them and all is good again and we have a bunch of random new friends and charlie is totally doing sue clearwater now so bella knows he is fed and shit
5110834 i mean if he is gonna end up my doing my daughter when she technically only like 7 but looks 17 and probably end up having some wolf vampire baby i better get the jokes in now
5110835 so everyone is all happy then bella and i put nessie to bed then i was gonna totally get some but bella let me see in her mind finally which was nice after all this time

5110852 last year we had a whole family show up from hong kong
5110853 once the parties eliminated the uncertainty and one might say the excitement of the extended roll call votes the conventions became much more strategic affairs
5110854 the television audiences were never very large but there was some news value in the uncertainty now tv networks are keen to get back to their prime time coverage as soon as possible
5110855 we havent heard very much this time about the republican platform
5110856 we dont know how controversial thats going to be on hot button issues like abortion religion and taxes
5110857 we think cap and trade is an important way to go
5110858 it fits in better with what other jurisdictions are doing and it guarantees emission reductions
5110859 this is an exploration of an area of emissions trading that could be included in a future program for us
5110860 if farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers in a better way and reduce those emissions that come off their field then were further ahead in terms of the total amount of greenhouse gases that are getting released from human operations
5110861 instead of opening up the soil by tilling it really actively where you get a lot of carbon released and get nitrous oxide released during that process if you keep it closed it keeps the carbon sequestered in the soil
5110862 by growing new trees youre taking carbon out of the air and youre putting it into the wood and sequestering it there

5110990 sometimes its hard to tell if barrack obama is running for president of the united states or mr universe
5110991 only celebrities like barack obama go to the gym three times a day
5110992 obama now appears vulnerable to the kind of character assassination that helped do in senator john kerry the democratic contender in 2004
5110993 kerry was successfully depicted by republicans as an effete windsurfing brie eating french speaking fop
5110994 berliners are germans and germans are foreigners and since well before john kerry was demonized for knowing how to speak french it has been axiomatic that heartland americans dont like foreigners piping up about our elections

5111013 we scrimmaged him out there some plays today probably didnt know what to do but he went up and tackled the guy with the ball quite a bit i did notice that well see how he develops and thats just kind of a trial right now
5111014 when you give up any big plays it kind of disturbs you
5111015 i think well be a faster unit you definitely see a difference in the guys and the attitude on the field in getting more guys to the ball
5111016 you wont see many times in which just one guy makes a tackle its your going to see a lot more guys swarming to the ball because thats something theyre emphasizing every day
5111017 they throw a deep ball and they want the defensive linemen to take off running you never know anything could happen fumble anything
5111018 he has made a significant improvement in weight management discipline
5111019 hes in the 365 range i think we wanted him at 366 365 i dont know that hes going to be able to lose a whole lot more weight than that right now its his conditioning and his ability to sustain
5111020 hes a presence in the middle and pushes the pocket hes difficult to block hes made a contribution to the defense in the middle theres no question about that especially on run downs
5111021 john mccain has spent a career fighting for veterans issues but barack obama wouldnt even make the time to visit fort hood for a town hall meeting with military families

5111039 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance

5111100 the beetle has a one year life cycle so you wont be able to tell that theres been damage most of the trees that are being attacked right for up to 9 12 months
5111101 sometimes after the tree has been compromised woodpeckers will come in and strip the bark off its then you start to see trees turning yellow and red
5111102 the beetles are carried by the wind but they also fly most of the bug infestations are on the westside in the lodge pole pine populations at high elevations i expect thats where theyre coming from
5111103 a lot is dependent on weather i think a lot of the beetles would prefer to stay up in the high elevation forests where there is a lot of food the unpredictable factor is how quickly they will build up in the city
5111104 its pretty much run its course in the north and central interior sometime over the next five years we expect the beetles will have run out of food theyll either be dispersed into new areas or just die out

5111178 everybody knows that if we keep on going on the same track that were going that we are giving our wealth away were funding both sides in the
5111179 were going to be over the long term putting enormous pressure on ordinary families here in america who just arent going to be able to afford skyrocketing and home heating prices so this is one of those issues that i think should unify the country thats what were going to be talking about
5111180 and while clinton gets 72 percent of the democratic vote obama is getting just 57 percent some of that may be the racist vote

5111189 ba argues that the aviation landscape has changed since their last failed application i disagree nothing has changed
5111190 the current economic slowdown is also no justification for agreeing to this alliance
5111191 we are not against consolidation but this alliance is on a scale never seen before ba aa with iberia wont create fair play so we say no way ba aa
5111192 even in this current climate where many airlines are reviewing their networks our team is always on the look out for potential routes that could do with added competition and where we can make a difference by bringing down over priced airfares
5111193 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies
5111194 we are applying for eu us anti trust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any us or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
5111195 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns
5111196 in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
5111197 ba aa would have a combination of high frequencies and a transatlantic network that could not be replicated by any other airline alliance and which would make it impossible for other carriers to compete for time sensitive corporate or business travellers

5111216 but if a computer cant read such a captcha how does the system know the correct answer to the puzzle heres how each new word that cannot be read correctly by ocr is given to a user in conjunction with another word for which the answer is already known the user is then asked to read both words if they solve the one for which the answer is known the system assumes their answer is correct for the new one the system then gives the new image to a number of other people to determine with higher confidence whether the original answer was correct

5111264 the saddleback civil forum changes the face of american politics pastor rick warren stakes out common ground for the common good in presumptive presidential nominees first joint appearance
5111265 we believe in the separation of church and state but we do not believe in the separation of faith and politics
5111266 i dont happen to agree with everything either of the candidates teach or believe but they both care deeply about america theyre both patriots and they have very different views on how our nation can be strengthened
5111267 weve got to learn to disagree without demonizing each other and we need to restore civility in our civil discourse and thats the goal of the saddleback civil forum
5111268 the two hour event attended by nearly 5 000 church members in the main auditorium and remote overflow venues began with warren posing questions first to sen
5111269 of inquiry into four categories including stewardship leadership worldview and americas role in the world the questions covered a wide range of topics ranging from the candidates values vision and virtues as applied to many of the critical issues of interest to the faith community and general public including a discussion on abortion traditional marriage stem cell research education religious persecution world orphans the theory of evil in the world and their vision for the future of america at home and abroad
5111270 when warren asked obama about what christianity means to him on a daily basis the senator responded
5111271 if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not practice the truth
5111272 but what it also means i think is a sense of obligation to embrace not just words but also through deeds and expectations that god has for us
5111273 and that means thinking about the least of these acting justly loving mercy and walking humbly with our god
5111274 in response to that same question about his personal christian faith mccain replied
5111275 i admire the islam theres a lot of good principles in it
5111276 i would like to tell you that i still think that even in the worst places in the world today they still harbor this hope and dream someday to be like us and have freedom and democracy
5111277 we remain my friends the most unusual experiment in history and im privileged to spend every day of my life in it i know what it is like to be without it
5111278 at what point is a baby entitled to human rights
5111279 at the moment of conception i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5111280 i am pro choice because ultimately i dont think women make these decisions casually
5111281 after both candidates had departed the stage warren concluded the evening by reminding the live television radio and internet audiences that
5111282 i appeal to you brothers to watch out for those who cause divisions and create obstacles contrary to the doctrine that you have been taught avoid them 18 for such persons do not serve our lord christ but their own appetites and by smooth talk and flattery they deceive the hearts of the naive
5111283 the saddleback civil forum was established to promote civil discourse and the common good of all
5111284 we will remember her in our own way which were mostly sad and troubling times

5111292 although the abiogenic hypothesis was accepted by some geologists in the former soviet union most geologists now consider the biogenic formation of petroleum to be supported scientifically though evidence exists for abiogenic creation of methane and hydrocarbon gases within the earth studies indicate that they are not produced in commercially significant quantities all hydrocarbon gases that are extracted for use as fuel or raw materials for industrial production contain a median abiogenic hydrocarbon content of only 200 parts per million ppm or one fiftieth of one percent the abiogenic origin of petroleum has also recently been reviewed in detail by glasby who raises a number of objections including that there is no direct evidence to date of abiogenic petroleum liquid crude oil and long chain hydrocarbon compounds
5111293 dont believe the federal reserves inflation rate which is based on hard formulas and methodologies that anything can cross check just believe me a completely random digger
5111294 oil and gold are both finite resources meanwhile world economies are expanding if we were to split the resources among all live people on earth every year we would each get a smaller and smaller share this is why our representative currency shows their prices going up while production reserves of the two are arguably stable in short this article makes some pretty stupid insinuations
5111295 oil is worth the same the us dollar is just worth less

5111303 it was too smoky to get downstairs it was too thick and it was coming up the stairs you couldnt see anything so we headed for the roof it was pretty worrying we didnt know was there a fire escape up to the roof or not in the space of a few minutes the whole place filled with smoke the smoke was just crazy
5111304 there were 12 14 people in this one apartment and we waited there for about an hour and a half

5111310 the seal seemed doomed but amazingly its survival instincts kicked in and escaped to swim another day
5111311 as a white shark moves in a seal will get as close to its tail as possible and twist and turn over and over again the shark uses up a lot of energy as it has to make enormous turns to line up the seal in front of its jaws

5111314 twelve days of terror a definitive investigation of the 1916 new jersey shark attacks
5111315 its 100 percent real it happened at our own doorstep not only were there definitely sharks here but it or they mangeled five people
5111316 back in 1916 nobody ever thought that a shark would do such a thing
5111317 im sure that the boys that were dipping down in the creek as well as the people in the town never thought in their wildest dreams that such an event could happen
5111318 to find a shark in a bay is honestly not that unusual
5111319 but to find a shark up a narrow creek like that is somewhat very unusual
5111320 there is a certain aspect that relates to sharks you are in their domain its almost like a dark closet

5111364 i felt like the game was moving too fast for me i would break my routes off five or six yards too early just because everything was happening so fast i didnt know what was going on
5111365 its hard to put a guy in when you dont know what hes going to do in a close situation
5111366 i feel like the coaches have more confidence in me now
5111367 hes head and shoulders above where he was last year at this time
5111368 hes much more dependable he looks more like a receiver who knows how to be a receiver not just a guy that runs fast
5111369 i love getting the ball handed off to me anytime i can i try to take advantage of it and try to make the play last as long as i can
5111370 last year i came in and i thought id run some routes catch the ball block every now and then and it would be simple
5111371 i got here and i had to learn specific depths you have to run the routes certain techniques you use sight adjustments picking up the blitz it was really frustrating
5111372 right now hes doing a hell of a lot better
5111373 we all know golden has great speed but hes improved most in his route running and using his hands at the line of scrimmage
5111374 but these two men are so different obama is lyrical mccain is staccato
5111375 were a bubble driver and weve made stupid choices at this point we dont even deserve to be in the chase
5111376 the role of the archbishop of canterbury to articulate the mind of the communion
5111377 a pre modern system in which human rights have no role
5111378 we have to think a little harder about the role and rule of law in a plural society of overlapping identities
5111379 the construction of a moral framework which could expand outside the boundaries of particular narratives while at the same time respecting the narratives as the cultural contexts in which the language of common dignity and mutually intelligible commitments to work for certain common moral priorities is learned and taught
5111380 what we want socially is a pattern of relations in which a plurality of divers and overlapping affiliations work for a common good
5111381 he best argument for faith schools from the point of view of any aspiration towards social harmony and understanding is that they bring communal loyalties into direct relation with the wider society and inevitably lead to mutual questioning and sometimes mutual influence towards change without compromising the distinctiveness of the essential elements of those communal loyalties
5111382 we need a fair amount of deconstruction of crude oppositions and mythologies
5111383 go therefore and make disciples of all the nations baptizing them in the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation
5111384 religious diversity when studied with care and sympathy shows us a historical world in which whatever we say about the claims of diverse religions to truth there is no possibility of claiming that every human question is answered once and for all by one system
5111385 holy scripture contains all things necessary for salvation consequently whatever is not read in scripture nor can be proved from scripture cannot be demanded from any person to believe it as an article of the faith nor is any such thing to be thought necessary or required for salvation by holy scripture is meant those canonical books of the old and new testaments whose authority has never been doubted within the church even as we christians proclaim that all human beings are called to union with god the father in jesus christ by the gift and power of the spirit obliges us to acknowledge with respect the depth and richness of anothers devotion to and obedience to what they have received as truth as we learn that kind of respect for each other we remember that we have none of us received the whole truth as god knows it we all have things to learn and it is that expectant and positive attitude to our mutual encounter that makes the relation between passionately convinced christians muslims jews hindus buddhists sikhs whatever else finally a gift and not a threat to a thoroughly contemporary and plural society and its hopes for coherence justice and peace

5111401 although conrad sheehan thinks he has come up with a way to provide the mobility factor in the formula for ecommerce success hes an unlikely dot com entrepreneur at age 41
5111402 he was an inspiration to us all and had a smile that lit up every room he entered
5111403 he had a passion for life that made all our lives brighter and fuller gerard saw the best in all situations and in all people
5111404 theres only ever going to be one gerard mcdonnell hes irreplaceable as a son brother brother in law uncle partner and loyal friend gerard you are our hero
5111405 id say the three men he met that day in the pub in doolin are still sitting there with their mouths open
5111406 ger could not explain his fascination with mountain climbing any other way except to say it was such a spiritual thing he even referred to it as being an honour to die on a mountain
5111407 gerards strength and honour in spending over 3 hours at 8 300m attempting to rescue three other climbers while well aware of the risks to his own life make him stand out as a real hero
5111408 for both sides it was difficult his mother was of course nervous about it and we were also very nervous about it because we understand that its very difficult to have no body and this was for her one of the hardest things
5111409 because as a mother you give birth to a child and if you dont get back anything you just have to believe the stories and thats very difficult
5111410 the annual hse budget for audiology services in the southeast has run out mid year and there is no more funding forthcoming for the remainder of 2008
5111411 audiology services have taken on no new clients since june
5111412 and this seems set to continue unless the badly needed extra funding becomes available
5111413 prior to this latest blow the service in the region was already operating well below par with only two audiologists covering the four community care areas in the south east
5111414 realistically to provide an efficient service there needs to be one audiologist allocated for each community care area
5111415 they dont want to go out because they get embarrassed and frustrated when they cant hear people properly they dont want to go to family or social gatherings because they feel stupid and to be honest people treat you like an imbecile when they think you cant understand them
5111416 as regards patients on the routine waiting lists for hearing aids
5111417 the hse is working to address this issue within its resources however in the case of urgent or emergency referrals hearing aids are being provided
5111418 in an effort to address waiting lists in 2007 the hse south east employed an additional audiologist and is currently recruiting for an additional audiological scientist the interviews have taken place for this position and we now await sanction to appoint this person
5111419 everyone had nothing so there wasnt even a question of one upmanship
5111420 pensions hah i remember meeting people whod taken the permanent pensionable jobs after school and by 43 or 44 years of age they were twisted and bitter
5111421 the way i looked at it was that you cant always wait for the green man to cross the road sometimes you have to go when its red to get to the other side
5111422 the ground is heavy and very deep hes in now but he has to be a doubt
5111423 its far from ideal and will be totally against him but knowing the horse he is the lads might let him run well talk about it tomorrow and make a decision
5111424 some seriously shrewd punters have been backing new approach which suggests he will be ready to run to his very best at york
5111425 duke of marmalade is a good horse and i firmly believe that a good horse will go on any ground
5111426 he is tough and genuine and will give 110 hes a horse that will die for you he can overcome difficulties and though its a hot contest i dont fear anything in the race
5111427 well see how she comes out of this before we firm up plans she handles that ground well and shes been coming forward well since her debut
5111428 the grounds very soft not many like it and i dont think he really liked it either hes a lovely big horse but hes not the finished article physically hes in the national stakes and hes also a possible for the beresford hes promising but theres a long way to go
5111429 she in the moyglare but shes not a big robust filly well have to see how she comes out of it i wouldnt see her running much this year
5111430 its funny because obviously im lucky i have a couple of really good very close girlfriends who have similar interests to mine
5111431 theyre not actors but we have a certain aesthetic or things we like to do but when it comes to men youre always going to differ from another woman about what she likes and what shes into how you feel about her boyfriend and how she feels about your boyfriend and all of that stuff
5111432 i try not to get into that kind of thing
5111433 i think with most of my girlfriends were pretty solid we go away together because we want to see each other you know
5111434 its amazing when you see the film these characters fall in love and thats what people who fall in love are intimate
5111435 nobody cares when youre doing it its like your day at work and this is part of the story then of course people get wind of whats coming and they get excited because they associate two women who wear gowns at an awards show and like gosh the possibilities you know its ridiculous
5111436 of course thats how it always is i think theres a lot of chemistry between the characters and all of us as actors and thats where the steaminess comes from its not really explicit i mean its just people kissing theres nothing crazy about it
5111437 when youre working youre so isolated that i never even open the newspaper
5111438 youre so tired you come home youre exhausted i never research what the world thinks about the film
5111439 the idea of it being woody allens steamiest film is so ridiculous to me hes so conservative with that kind of thing its sweet and i think hes quite respectful of the relationship
5111440 nothing was written for that scene and we did it so many times i really couldnt tell you what was said
5111441 i think its unfortunate that people cant just appreciate the decision to not have that heard
5111442 theres a poetry in that scene people are obsessed with discovering the secret of everything and uncovering the code its sad
5111443 he has such an appreciation and understanding for the intricacies of the female mind i mean such an appreciation i think he would say that were a superior species or something he loves women the way we think and its always some inspired character with him
5111444 after the monthly payments i send him he would say that
5111445 im always surprised at how fortunate ive been i can never quite understand whats happening and i always feel lucky to be employed so for me its such a high compliment for him to see me in any role or that he can imagine me doing anything as an actor thats the best compliment ive worked with woody three times and its really been a dream come true for me as an actor theres no higher compliment certainly
5111446 no i like to change my look from time to time and enjoy my feminine side not that i see myself as some kind of beauty or fashion icon
5111447 im never going to be a supermodel kind of girl i work with what ive got and that is curves i eat well and work out occasionally i dont really like going to the gym any more than once every three or four days is a real struggle for me
5111448 other than that i slap on some red lipstick and mess around with my hair and enjoy being glamorous if i can
5111449 i think everyone has times when they struggle with where to go now
5111450 ive been fortunate enough always to know what i wanted to do what i was passionate about i never had to struggle with that but even then there are all kinds of questions you have about where you go from here and of course personal times when i felt that way
5111451 i think people will see something of that in this movie i can identify with certain aspects of my characters philosophy
5111452 i was inspired by her sort of seize the day attitude and her willingness to let life kind of happen in front of her
5111453 completes a pattern of hyped one sided reportage that goes back a while
5111454 you might well consider it desirable to put about the story that the communists are plotting against musaddiqs life and are trying to plant the responsibility onto the british
5111455 completes a pattern of hyped one sided reportage that goes back a while
5111456 we are expecting to show further growth in all key financial measures for the fy2009 financial year
5111457 we will continue to focus on expanding the companys operations overseas as well as increasing productive capacity and capabilities to meet ongoing and strengthening demand for the companys products and services
5111458 michael has an ankle injury and it has swollen up very badly and hell be out for maybe two or three weeks which is unfortunate
5111459 ryans got a hamstring injury so it was disappointing to get these injuries on top of what were missing anyway i havent got too many complaints we did our best with the resources we had available
5111460 carlos tevez will be back for the portsmouth match next week and wayne will be much sharper and much fitter and in the second half it started to show for him but unfortunately campbell also picked up an injury and i had to take him off so we were asking wayne to play through the middle when hes really needing games and it was a big ask
5111461 im not discussing anyone i think we have a good squad the same squad as last year and when tevez comes back and wayne gets games that will be my strike force
5111462 thats what it was last season and im happy to continue with that there are 37 games left so it is not a disaster we have shown before we can come from behind
5111463 in spite what everyone thinks were working really hard to bring quality players in
5111464 i think too often in the last few years newcastle have bought players that havent been quite good enough for whatever reason
5111465 sometimes they havent settled sometimes they havent seemed to understand what it means to play for newcastle united
5111466 the three that weve got so far do and the next three must as well and if that means waiting then so be it
5111467 anyone can collect players because there are hundreds around but good players who can play at newcastle not everyone can do that
5111468 the range we have given is really around making sure we have some flexibility we need to keep some competition around the procurement of the turbines
5111469 until we got that certainly we couldnt get down to the detail
5111470 there were two friends bidding against each other taking the piss i guess
5111471 when youre going to buy groceries anyway its a good opportunity to help out the charity at the same time
5111472 were not fixing everything in one day but its a morale booster anyway
5111473 we made some pretty good progress here my problem is we spend half the time feeding stock and doing stockwork and theres not much time to go trim trees
5111474 but for some it will be summer until they can get access to their tree blocks some forestry blocks were absolutely annihilated
5111475 we are facing the much larger issue of how russia plans to behave in international affairs for decades to come
5111476 on obamas best day he cant hold a candle to thomass intelligence
5111477 despite request mccain resorted to stock answers at faith forum
5111478 i wont win cool points for this but mccain is doing excellent so far better than obama
5111479 why mccains win wasnt really a win at the fbf
5111480 whitebait are the young of native fish such as giant kokopu shortjaw kokopu banded kokopu koaro and inanga collectively known as galaxiids
5111481 our greatest concern was that we have all been checking streams and rivers with historical records of having adult galaxiids and not been able to find them
5111482 one element of good design is to allow these workers to come back year after year if they turn out to be good workers
5111483 what that does is it shifts the incentives in favour of playing by the rules and having access to a job year after year after year rather than by blowing your chances by not complying in one year
5111484 there is a shortage of unskilled workers throughout a number of sectors in the economy so why is horticulture the only sector which is going to benefit from this scheme
5111485 it could save millions of patients around the world the burden of dialysis and also improved lifestyle of course and a benefit economically as well
5111486 there are some people particularly women who have good reason to be concerned about where this information might end up
5111487 i mean unlike police who are subject to strict regimes of accountability people who work in pubs and clubs are not subject to any privacy regime at all
5111488 we say that this procedure is dangerous to womens privacy because there is just nothing to stop someone who takes a fancy to a woman to simply put down her address and then go around and look that woman up
5111489 i can understand why people might raise their eyebrows but entry to a club is not a right
5111490 these are private clubs and you are entitled to enter them if you obey all the requirements
5111491 these requirements i think are there to protect the safety of patrons and the safety of the general public
5111492 the gold coast is a very important tourism destination and i want its reputation to be one where you can have a good time but have a good time safely
5111493 in particular i agree with mr ogorman that for the young ladies i would be very concerned as to the information that is collected where it is kept how it is used and again it comes down to protecting ones privacy how far does one go
5111494 it is a bit of invasion of privacy because from what i understand and what they are trying to do down the coast is leave that responsibility with the information they collect up to the staff and management of licensed venues
5111495 new email account tap to setup a new account page when i click on new e mail account it simply takes me to my yahoo inbox

5111501 the sale of tamar represents a significant de risking for the bbp business
5111502 bbp has achieved a key step towards stabilisation of debt and balance sheet improvement
5111503 the full year 2008 result will reflect a non cash impairment charge of 410 million to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill associated with the acquisition of the alinta retail business

5111540 as of 2008 we have over 700 students attending classes in three separate schools a kindergarten school a primary school and a secondary school

5111546 her figure looked blocked and heavy in her gardening costume a mans black hat pulled low down over her eyes clod hopper shoes a figured print dress almost completely covered by a big corduroy apron with four big pockets to hold the snips the trowel and scratcher the seeds and the knife she worked with she wore heavy leather gloves to protect her hands while she worked
5111547 the public and the city really dont know exactly whats going on about about 10 percent of the city is right under the wind farm
5111548 it puts the affected parties on the back foot he said
5111549 there are so many people here and overseas that work desperately hard in their jobs and its always a shame when you have one or two people who let us down
5111550 we have pretty strict rules and regulations about the consumption and supply of alcohol to underage personnel and we obviously dont condone it
5111551 we take our host responsibility very seriously and our approach to alcohol extremely seriously
5111552 we do have clubs and social amenities on our bases socialisation is an important part of army life
5111553 make sure i pay you back i dont want to take any pocket money
5111554 to be successful in business you have to work really hard
5111555 the single thing you cant do without is a good education
5111556 i see a lot of her at social functions but i dont talk to her that much
5111557 what did you want to be when you grew up
5111558 when i was about 10 or 11 i wanted to be prime minister ill let you know how that goes in a few months
5111559 they have put all the glossy brochures out and all the bull and jellybeans or whatever you want to call it i am not that rapt about it
5111560 its a bit different when it affects you isnt it they must have been rubbing their hands together with glee when they found this quiet little place
5111561 they go off and pick people off one by one get them signed up and tight lipped its almost like the mafia
5111562 were not totally against them but there are a lot of questions that need to be answered
5111563 her helmet saved her from more serious injury the whole front of it was smashed to smithereens
5111564 the door was only opened 10cm and shes just caught the edge
5111565 i only just put my hand on the handle to open the door and bang i hadnt even got my foot out the door
5111566 i saw her go up in the air and land back down near the curb
5111567 there was a doctor on her way to work who stopped and a nurse we tried to keep her talking she said her name was anna
5111568 it shouldnt make any difference where you live there ought to be a common basis for making decisions about exceptional circumstances and i think anybody who uses the nhs for their care is entitled to expect that
5111569 if you have a patient from cheshire they have a very good record most of the time we apply to cheshire they tend to fund patients that have exceptional circumstances if we apply to the manchester primary care trust then in the eight applications weve made theyve only accepted one for funding in 2006
5111570 sometimes maybe i put off making decisions that maybe i should have taken earlier
5111571 to make decisions in the long term interests of the country you have to take quite tough decisions quite early on so that you can get things done within the life of a parliament
5111572 i absolutely believe that if wed have had that election that gordon brown would no longer have been prime minister and that the conservatives would have been the largest party in a hung parliament
5111573 brown compounded calling off the election by then saying it was nothing to do with the polls which was a massive mistake it was a lie and it was treating people like fools
5111574 it was a big roll of the dice to do it without any notes no autocue no funny business there was a moment when i lost my train of thought but no one really noticed
5111575 i regret that my government driver took some of my papers home while i was on my bike
5111576 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms
5111577 the fate of tens of thousands of troubled properties around the country would be thrown into limbo while lenders and title insurers duke it out

5111579 we believe new zealand holds enormous potential for kennys cardiology and we expect to duplicate the success this franchise has achieved since we acquired it in 2007

5111589 un buen ilustrador publicitario de segunda fila con esperanzas de convertirme en uno de primera fila con el tiempo
5111590 la idea de nebee resultaba muy innovadora ya que en aquella poca no exist an c mics realistas de aventuras
5111591 lo m s parecido a la tira de acci n que se publicaba era wash tubbs de roy crane que se inici el 21 de abril de 1924
5111592 para asegurar el xito de tarz n neebe contact con el ilustrador de portadas j allen st john para realizar la adaptaci n pero st john aunque sent a inter s la rechaz cuando conoci la fecha de entrega neebe necesitaba un ilustrador con la sensibilidad de un especialista en bellas artes por lo tanto en 1928 se dirigi a su segunda opci n hal foster
5111593 con la adaptaci n del texto de r w palmer un resumen de
5111594 no me dieron ninguna instrucci n tan solo el libro
5111595 otra marca de f brica de hal foster que apareci desde el primer momento en las tiras es el uso de leyendas en lugar de bocadillos esta t cnica conocida como story strip permiti a foster crear composiciones que conten an fondos muy bien detallados que no quedaban ocultos tras el texto fue una t ctica deliberada y se realiz para proporcionar a la tira la apariencia de haber sido creada en la tradici n de pyle wyeth y todos los grandes ilustradores de libros que hal admiraba la t ctica funcion y la tira fue tan solicitada que en agosto de 1929 grosset amp dunlap reunieron y reimprimieron la serie entera the ilustrated tarzan book n 1
5111596 hal hab a hecho a neebe un favor pero se consideraba a s mismo un artista y el dibujo de c mics era para l un medio inferior
5111597 en dicha p gina foster traslad el estilo formal de sus tiras es decir ilustraciones sin bocadillos y con leyendas
5111598 hal no estaba interesado porque pensaba que prostitu a su talento pero sin ning n trabajo en el horizonte y una familia a la que mantener acept a rega adientes la oferta de neebe
5111599 me ofend a un poco que quisieran comprar mi talento por un plato de comida caliente
5111600 no estar a mal tener un poco de comida caliente ahora mismo
5111601 el hambre y tarz n llevaron a foster de vuelta a los c mics
5111602 el paso definitivo lo da la agencia campbell ewald en la que foster es un asociado joseph h neebe su director ve un xito en la adaptaci n de los pulps de tarzan al idioma del c mic pensando con criterio comercial que el dibujante ideal para acometer la empresa debe ser el mismo que realiza las portadas de la novelas j allen st john pero rechaza la oferta alegando varios motivos es m s un pintor que un dibujante de historietas no ve claro el xito del proyecto y adem s alega estr s generado por la presi n de los plazos de entrega pero si el afamado ilustrador rechaza la oferta el dibujante foster la acepta con lo que se inicia su carrera la obra ser un resumen de la primera novela del personaje tarz n de los monos el texto est impreso en tipograf a para darle un aspecto m s literario a la obra y tanto las vi etas como las dailies no se vertebran en la estructura narrativa propia de la historieta pese a todo constituye un xito sin precedentes y posiciona a foster como un pionero due o de un estilo realista nunca visto hasta esa poca por otro lado foster se niega a realizar m s dailies de tarzan por considerar al c mic como una forma baja de expresi n art stica las dailies en consecuencia siguen adelante realizadas por el incapacitado rex maxon que se dispone a continuar con la adaptaci n de otras novelas de burroughs ya sea por la novedad de los planteamientos o por la falta de competencia con otras historias los c mics de tarzan mantienen un ascendente camino de triunfos lo cual motiva la realizaci n de sunday pages cuya autor a seguir a en manos de maxon inici ndose el 15 de marzo de 1931 pero su mediocridad alcanza su cenit en la entrega dominical con el subsiguiente enfado de un burroughs cada vez m s disgustado con el trabajo gr fico de su obra literaria con un j allen st john vetado por el syndicate se vuelve a ofertar la realizaci n de tarzan a foster por otra parte bendecido por el propio burroughs y este acepta el trabajo inici ndolo en la que ser a la p gina 29 fechada un 27 de septiembre de 1931 pero si foster hab a hecho declaraciones sobre la mediocridad del c mic como manifestaci n art stica en 1929 a qu se deben las razones de su cambio de actitud qu le motiva a aceptar la realizaci n de la sunday page la respuesta es tan simple y contundente como el incremento de dividendos con el crack econ mico de 1929 las empresas de publicidad pierden buena parte de su raz n de ser al no tener la poblaci n dinero para sus compras por otra parte la masa p blica demanda historias de evasi n que les alejen de sus problemas en una sociedad en la que aun no exist a televisi n y el cine no era lo accesible que comenz a ser muy pocos a os despu s el trabajo de foster como publicitario se resiente por la grave situaci n econ mica y un cambio de actividad hacia los c mics mantendr a sus ingresos saneados dando estabilidad a su familia si adem s se considera el benepl cito de burroughs y las cartas de fans encantados con el tratamiento que da a tarzan su cambio de actitud queda pues justificado al poseer la coartada moral que necesita para su dedicaci n al c mic
5111603 sus innovaciones t cnicas tales como las vi etas panor micas el detallismo de los fondos el realismo y la pulcritud en la documentaci n se hacen presentes en lo que ser una constante de su estilo mantenido durante cuarenta a os ello le obliga a colocar los textos tanto los descriptivos que se van haciendo po ticos como los de di logo en la parte inferior de sus dibujos con el nimo de no crear una disrupci n en sus composiciones gr ficas
5111604 cuando uno de sus clientes tuvo la idea de convertir las novelas de
5111605 pens que prostituir a mi arte siendo un artista de p ginas c micas
5111606 el tipo era tan bueno en su particular trabajo que dej muy poco margen para que posteriores artistas le superaran y muy pocos ten an la habilidad de acercarse a su nivel
5111607 king features se acerc primero porque a william randolph hearts le gustaban mucho las ilustraciones de
5111608 ellos quer an que hiciera una tira y me ofrecieron crear una para m primero dije que no porque quer a crear algo de mi propiedad pr ncipe valiente fue el resultado
5111609 weve asked our allies to provide any of the escort requirements for our chinooks and or possibly the charters in theatre
5111610 so that capability that the griffon might fulfill should be addressed by nato
5111611 im appalled that the government is not moving ahead on its own attack helicopters that would ensure we can move independently as a nation and bring our chinooks into hotspots and difficult landing areas
5111612 to me its fundamental that if were going to have half the capability which is the chinook then we should get the other half of the capability which is an attack helicopter
5111613 youve seen the ramp ceremonies for one or two soldiers can you imagine what a ramp ceremony for 35 people would be like
5111614 if people are offended by the name attack helicopters we can pass a rule and call them protect helicopters these helicopters protect the 25 to 40 souls on a large transport and get them alive from point a to point b
5111615 we think space and time are important because that s the kind of monkeys we are
5111616 we show up fast but we cant put a whole race together so weve got to do some homework weve got to science it out and figure out what the heck is going on because we are sure fast when that race starts but ive been like that my whole career
5111617 but theyre just hard to drive like that all dayi ran fifth all day and maybe better than that at some parts of the race and im a good enough driver i should have finished somewhere around there with that car
5111618 earnhardt jr strong early fades late for disappointing michigan finish
5111619 im upset because i thought we had a car to finish inside the top 10 today
5111620 we were working on it all the way from the 32nd position we did a lot of good things and this is a good race track for me and the whole team
5111621 to have a bad race is disappointing with the points but its what it is weve got three to go and we can still definitely make the chase
5111622 we came here with a new engine package and were a bubble driver
5111623 we just make stupid choices we cant keep our cars together we have dash malfunctions motors breaking at this point we dont even deserve to be in the chase
5111624 its frustrating as a driver to not have the consistency
5111625 i keep thinking in the back of my head lets just get in the chase and itll be a whole new slate when we get in there but we cant stop problems from happening and if we cant then we dont deserve to be there
5111626 were running better thats the thing we started dang near last and made our way up into the top 10 and close to the top five and then all the wheels fall off and they seem to fall off every time at the end of these races
5111627 were so far behind on our engine program on the cup side
5111628 i know the engine guys are doing all they can to keep up the hendrick motorsports guys seem to be the class of the field right now as far as engines
5111629 were trying to keep up because were behind and were struggling to try to find all the pieces so when we come to the race track with a piece thats got more power we just hope it lasts and it just hasnt yet
5111630 a frustrated hamlin says team doesnt even deserve to be in the chase
5111631 es una cuesti n de tiempo para que los kirchner sean echados
5111632 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5111633 but how much time it will take it depends definitely on how georgians will continue to behave
5111634 have to call an extraordinary meeting of the council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5111635 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5111636 we are waiting for more support from other countries because this is not a war between russian and georgia its a war between civilization and barbarism
5111637 oh we didnt realize you were the good kind of nigger
5111638 hey boy you got mighty curly hair you got any black in you
5111639 if you miss me at the back of the bus
5111640 what man or nation has ever become rich by holding out a begging bowl
5111641 well i had the straight draw so went for it
5111642 i dont know of my availability for a phone interview over the weekend im doing a photo shoot in las vegas
5111643 oh it shouldnt be a problem its for full tilt
5111644 a callback method must not invoke entitymanager or query methods
5111645 some have learnt many tricks of sly evasion instead of truth they use equivocation and eke it out with mental reservation which is to good men an abomination
5111646 we now have the entire details about how and where the plans for the ahmedabad blasts were chalked out who were the people involved and how the entire plan was operationalised
5111647 a matter of time before external hand behind the bomb blasts is established
5111648 but we all know that somewhere at the top the local terror groups are actively linked with the let huji as well as pakistans isi it is only a matter of time before the external hand behind the bomb blasts in ahmedabad and possibly some other parts of the country is established
5111649 we also know who stole the cars who brought these to vapi and vadodara and who finally took them to ahmedabad javed sheikh being an expert driver was given the responsibility of the cars
5111650 some have learnt many tricks of sly evasion instead of truth they use equivocation and eke it out with mental reservation which is to good men an abomination
5111651 weve spent so many resources and so much attention on iraq that weve lost sight of future threats down the road the current conflict between russia and georgia is a perfect example
5111652 too much of a tendency towards what might be called
5111653 the debate has got to shift as a result of this war
5111654 some have learnt many tricks of sly evasion instead of truth they use equivocation and eke it out with mental reservation which is to good men an abomination
5111655 the dac has agreed in principle that such projects should be funded in a 70 20 10 per cent ratio 70 per cent by the drdo 20 per cent by the industry partner that will manufacture the developed product and 10 per cent by whichever of the three services the product is being developed for
5111656 the drdo has certainly demanded this but it is equally applicable to the private sector and the public sector undertakings
5111657 so the proposal was considered carefully and finally the dac has given its approval i think this is a very significant development
5111658 some have learnt many tricks of sly evasion instead of truth they use equivocation and eke it out with mental reservation which is to good men an abomination
5111659 ncw is vital you cannot survive today for long against a good adversary without this capability
5111660 at present we do not have it we are just about network enabled but we are in the process of developing this capability
5111661 i never had breakfast i woke up at like 11 oclock sat around and watched some tv had lunch some chicken nuggets then i pretty much went back to my room slept again then went back and got some more nuggets then i came to the track
5111662 we are feisty women who have opinions and aint afraid of expressing them
5111663 we always knew we could run this way if we just went a whole weekend without making many mistakes
5111664 we always seem to have fast cars and good speed but maybe myself or the pit crew or somebody would make a mistake through the weekend and wed pay for it when the checkered flag fell
5111665 the bottom line is everythings easier the second time around
5111666 if there is such a thing as reincarnation i want to come back as simon wood to write the wondrous books he has written and especially to have written his new one paying the piper im seriously jealous of his talent and i hate to admit that but dammit he writes like a dark demented angel he is the real deal already knocking on the door of the a list hes that good a ferocious raw artist
5111667 were going to try our hardest not to be violent
5111668 the public was never going to view this place it was just found out
5111669 they got caught with this place so embarrassing to be caught with a warehouse concealed about ones person they told our lawyers in negotiations that this place didnt even exist
5111670 whats going to happen here is police are going to detain people for an inordinate amount of time
5111671 theyre going to use this as an excuse to keep people out of the courts and off of the streets
5111672 weve provided for restroom facilities i didnt say anything water medical assistance
5111673 we tried to mirror in this facility what we do every day in our city jail
5111674 a society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in
5111675 remain s confident of growing our profitability in the current financial year
5111676 our focus on key drivers of growth remains consistent resulting in continued strong financial results mr bassat said
5111677 growth in the australian and new zealand employment business has been driven by ongoing migration from print to online a growing presence in sme healthcare education and government markets improved yield and the introduction of product extensions through standout amp premium ads
5111678 more than 77 per cent of job seekers time is now spent on seek and over the past 12 months we have increased job ad volumes by more than our two closest competitors combined
5111679 with increased sales capability and new content partnerships seek learning had a strong second half and with continued leverage of the seek brand we expect this momentum to continue paul bassat said
5111680 the industry has struggled badly with both skilled workers but more particularly people to do the harvest he told abc radio today
5111681 there is no question that there is a dire shortage
5111682 its such a dramatic announcement for the pacific workers who have been looking for work for generations she told abc radio
5111683 the situation can be quite dire in terms of unemployment
5111684 its the schemes really a chance to go from being nearly unviable to being economically prosperous
5111685 there are workers coming back with roughly about five or six thousand new zealand dollars
5111686 it was targeted to a specific audience for specific reasons
5111687 we accomplished that mission and it will continue in another medium
5111688 were thrilled quite frankly it played out exactly how we hoped
5111689 you never can predict how somethings going to do but we felt that the movie is so strong we just needed to get it out there
5111690 im gonna say that theres a resentment of some kind on the part of wright towards obama

5111695 i often use samso as an ambitious example of how to cope with the big challenges that our own country faces in the race to become independent of fossil fuels
5111696 i think samso has set an agenda for the climate issue and alongside other projects it has shown that this is possible
5111697 all too often the direct economic value generated by pastoralists is not retained in their communities and the indirect value is unrewarded and even unacknowledged by decision makers
5111698 this is an important project for new zealand in that it is located in the north island closer to electricity demand centres and harnesses a very strong wind resource
5111699 im very excited it brings money to the area and it brings income to us as well 500 million in a small district like tararua its a huge coup for us
5111700 i think its their right to protest but as i said to a neighbour i would be quite prepared to pull the wind farm out if they turn their power off i dont think i would have any takers
5111701 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5111702 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
5111703 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
5111704 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
5111705 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
5111706 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5111707 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5111708 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
5111709 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
5111710 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
5111711 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5111712 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
5111713 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

5111723 we need the help of all of our elected official on all levels of the united states to help turn the tide of violence in mexico and the violence in juarez this is a trend that is disturbing it is a trend that we need to bring attention to so we can get help from federal and local agencies
5111724 bordering on juarez the most violent city in mexico and one of the most violent cities anywhere besides iraq youre always vigilant
5111725 but those people hit men down there know who theyre after and they know how to get them
5111726 weve received 24 patients related to the violence and the drug cartel and this is a disturbing trend

5111739 some drugs are quite difficult to get hold of but this one suddenly became much easier to buy and i guess thats why were seeing more positive tests
5111740 it seems the use of this drug by the greeks is related to its appearance on the internet
5111741 we have a very simple and effective test for this steroid so we will catch any athletes who have used it

5111749 the word of the russian president needs to be upheld by his forces or people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
5111750 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way

5111775 ninety percent of patients with huntingtons disease have chorea and many suffer terribly its hard to describe the torment that these people undergo we had several patients who experienced a dramatic improvement in their quality of life some patients who hadnt been able to attend church for years were able to do so others were able to go out to a restaurant and have a meal for the first time in years its impossible to over emphasize what this has meant to some patients who are able to reclaim part of the life that they have lost due to this disease
5111776 patients and families with huntingtons disease maintain a courageous hope for progress
5111777 on one hand the fda approval of tetrabenazine represents only a small step forward this medication helps patients control their movements better but is not known to slow the underlying progression of the disease on the other hand the fda approval represents a giant symbolic breakthrough since tetrabenazine is the first drug ever approved in the united states for any aspect of huntingtons disease it is an honor to be part of the extended community of patients families and researchers trying to find a better way forward
5111778 my mother and many others have died without the benefits of tetrabenazine
5111779 since the medication was invented in the 1950s worldwide it has been give to close to a million people we have a tremendous amount of information about its benefits potential side effects how to treat the side effects and dosing suggestions this is day to celebrate for huntingtons patients and their families
5111780 our study reveals potentially clinically relevant differences in the gene expression of different cancer types and represents a reference framework for interpretation of smaller scale functional studies
5111781 this segregation of tumors into three groups with distinct expression patterns is surprising clearly the developmental trajectory provides a meaningful background for capturing large scale differences in gene expression across diverse conditions
5111782 shifting our focus from single sets of genes or processes to the biology of aggregates on the order of the entire transcriptome is likely to be useful in establishing highly robust molecular correlations between seemingly unrelated disease phenotypes
5111783 we now can study how iaps contribute to the development of cancer in a living animal and develop drugs to prevent or thwart the disease
5111784 cancer cells thrive by disabling the molecular machinery that tells sick cells to die
5111785 by removing the ring we wanted to see whether we would trick the machinery to turn back on and thats what happened cells die more readily making it much more difficult for cancer to be established
5111786 we need to use genetics to sort out which individual iaps contribute to tumors and which iaps we need to target in order to cure cancer
5111787 this was a very big step in understanding what role iaps play in cancer but it isnt the last
5111788 at an important presentation the wireless microphones batteries go flat amp you wait for ages while the technical crew looks for new batteries the laptop doesnt open the powerpoint presentation the speaker arrives late a guitar string breaks right in the middle of a solo what do all of these have in common who cares the audience doesnt care what caused the problem they dont care that it cant be helped they dont have empathy for you at all ever
5111789 if two or three weeks later theyre still thinking about the temperature then thats an issue
5111790 to plan a fabulous program with a speaker you paid 100 000 for and all you hear from people leaving is brrr it was freezing in there
5111791 yesterday i sat though an hour long presentation today i cannot recall any of the main points i cant remember anything because the speaker did not care enough about the material to connect with the audience and make a point epic failure for a presenter

5111794 truth be told always figured that she wasnt over him i dont know if it was intuition or just a fluke i think you sensed it and were aware of it but she was confused and unable to be honest even with herself you sound like a great guy and im sure there is someone out there perfect for you stay strong stay you posts 1 041 thanks 293 thanked 177 times in 90 posts hi lion i dont feel you are being selfish all i read is maturity in this post and a very broken heart i am soo sorry this is happened to you a broken heart is one hard thing to mend some people say they do but to be honest i dont think they ever mend completely but i truly feel you did the right thing and are carrying on in that fashion giving each step time and being strong enough to allow her to be around her ex for a bit through decision making there is an old wives tale that referers to that it was one my grandmother and mom must have said a dozen time to me alone if not more if you love something let it go if it comes back to you its yours forever if it dosent then it was never meant to be anonymous you are strong lion because you were able to do that it has to be one of the hardest things to do in life as we know what the end result could be and the pain that will follow but i truly think you did the right thing by letting her go to her friends with her ex being there at least then you knew where you stood you didnt let your heart fall deeper if it possibly could thanked 1 328 times in 1 127 posts wow lion where has the time gone im sorry this has happened and you both seemed to be well suited for each other chin up and glad that you are still around these parts wisdom is the power of the soul

5111797 i dont feel 33 i feel 18 chusovitina said in german her adopted language she is the first gymnast to compete in five olympics and the oldest gymnastics medalist in recent memory
5111798 by then ill be 37 and if i have the chance i can do a sixth olympics
5111799 she stuck all her landings and had amazing execution johnson said of izbasa
5111800 my landings could have been better but i have no regrets im having the time of my life
5111801 before i was thinking it would be hot and humid
5111802 i dont feel 33 i feel 18 chusovitina said in german her adopted language
5111803 we used to compete together in the same meets he said
5111804 it is unbelievable that she is still out there and winning a medal i cant even describe how amazing that is it is very very difficult to do the stuff shes doing i guess thats why shes the only 33 year old out there
5111805 she is definitely an inspiration to all of us i dont know how her body holds up im already hurting and im only 16
5111806 when im talking to my teammates i feel like a young girl and when i talk to the coaches i feel like a woman she said
5111807 as long as i love gymnastics and have fun every day i will continue to compete
5111808 by then ill be 37 and if i have the chance i can do a sixth olympics
5111809 she stuck all her landings and had amazing execution johnson said of izbasa
5111810 my landings could have been better but i have no regrets im having the time of my life
5111811 it was really hard to go back into the gym after what happened but i kept training she said her voice cracking
5111812 i didnt know if they were going to call it and i should have just run
5111813 thats my fault because i felt great i know i could have run a pr personal record
5111814 i felt the false start but i mean the race is over theres nothing we can do about it i cant say it hurt me because i got a medal i dont want to be ungrateful but who knows what the outcome would have been
5111815 because with the american trials i sat there and watched and thought wow whats going on in the states these girls are running 10 7 10 8 10 9 like its nothing but what happened before today nothing else matters this is it this is what you train for
5111816 i really am i thought that at least one of us would be in the mix
5111817 i should have went with the start since they gave it to me
5111818 i hesitated and that was really a rookie mistake i should have just went and figured they wouldnt call it back
5111819 but i didnt because i knew in my mind ok that was a false start i kind of got stuck out there and there was nothing i could do after that i mean 11 2 is so mediocre its ridiculous
5111820 i wanted to come out and do the same thing
5111821 because so many women before us were role models to us and came so close but never achieved what we have achieved
5111822 this is a great accomplishment for us despite the fact that coming into the olympics people thought we were not as experienced as some of the other athletes are i guess when you give us a chance to do something we make the best of it
5111823 we going to come back and try to go after it and get our revenge
5111824 they have a lot of speed but in the relay its the handoff if we have smooth handoffs we can still take it
5111825 im gonna ice down as soon as i get to the hotel
5111826 i wear this band on my hand every day that says from robbins illinois
5111827 when i sat back and thought about it all the kids back in robbins and kids that never had the opportunity to really experience something like this in life i had to experience it so i can go back and tell them about it its the great wall
5111828 for a gatorade this is me on this i can get this
5111829 its about being in a place like this making it to beijing seeing things in life
5111830 basically what john mccains done is hes hired the same old folks who brought you george w bush same team and its the same strategy
5111831 they dont have something positive to say about what theyre going to do for america what they try to do is they say well this other guy hes unpatriotic or this other guy he likes french people thats what they said about john kerry
5111832 they try to make it out like somehow democrats arent tough enough or arent macho enough thats their strategy and they do it every four years
5111833 and then you end up with what weve got right now ive got news for john mccain my plans not going to bring about economic disaster we already have economic disaster because of john mccains president george w bush
5111834 the mccain campaign wants to make this election about me because the issues arent on their side dont get fooled by paris and britney and nasty e mails that folks are sending out dont get fooled by them this election is about you its about us and whether we are going to meet the challenges that lie before us
5111835 my opponent wants to keep telling you lies about me
5111836 bush bush bush with a picture of mccain remember when the rightwingers though bush was jesus what idiots
5111837 if a republican was involved in this kind of a hate church you would want to lynch him
5111838 we already have economic disaster because of john mccains president george w bush
5111839 a few months ago we were thinking about it i wouldnt want to say never but at this point its not something i think were going to do
5111840 we were there doing some suit testing at one of the flumes
5111841 ive actually been talking to a few of the new zealanders who have been saying you should come back you should come back and id love to come back id love to see more of the country
5111842 it was a fun trip i saw a lot of rain though i think it was the rain season so i definitely want to get back there get some nice weather just have a good time
5111843 they wanted to look at the flow around the suit they just wanted to go to out of the way places where there were not loads of people

5111857 finding statistically robust associations linked to two proteins that may be involved in regulating such ion channels and that are also thought to be targets of drugs used to clinically to treat bipolar disorder is astonishing
5111858 faced with little agreement among previous studies searching for the genomic hot spots in bipolar disorder these researchers pooled their data for maximal statistical power and unearthed surprising results
5111859 improved understanding of these abnormalities could lead to new hope for the millions of americans affected by bipolar disorder

5111862 based on a candidates support or opposition to an issue that impacts people with disabilities
5111863 it would require asking very sensitive questions in a survey which would lead respondents to hang up
5111864 i think people with disabilities vote just like anyone else does
5111865 i think they vote on big issues like war in iraq and the economy like others
5111866 it goes to the candidate who talks most about disability

5111880 i first thought to myself you have come too far for this to be the end of a high school career
5111881 the first couple of weeks i turned it up as much as i could take
5111882 after that i fought through the pain and tried to make it more mental which i knew i could handle and control better
5111883 i am about 60 65 right now and we are in august
5111884 ill be back right in time for everything to start moving quickly

5111888 hes done some really great and some really rotten things
5111889 and he gets taken in by rotten people he goes to a church that just gave their man of the year award to louis farrakhan he calls the minister of his church his spiritual mentor
5111890 he krugman is totally for hillary because she understands the economy health care and the complexity of foreign diplomacy
5111891 the fact that were not squandering lives at the same rate we were a year ago were still squandering money as fast as ever does not seem to have convinced people that the war we were misled into was a good idea
5111892 that candidate b i e hillary clinton despite the progressive talk is just bush the third
5111893 i talked about that at spring training i thought he was going to have a good year
5111894 hes just thrown the ball great and hes been really consistent every start he goes out there he locates he changes speeds and hes just in a groove
5111895 i was hoping that id be important to the club this year
5111896 i was hoping id have a role like ive had in the past coming off of last year and the way things were setting up in spring training youre not really sure the way its going to be
5111897 it still looked like they were comfortable at the plate
5111898 and when theyre standing in there comfortably thats something you dont want to see
5111899 he has a sense of how to read swings and i think he knows his mechanics really well if somethings off a little bit i think moose because hes thrown so many games can correct it on the fly
5111900 im just pleased ive been able to go out there every time its my turn and pitch well and winning games is a bonus
5111901 i was very consistent throwing my fastball in and out over the plate they hit the ball and put it in play and that made my job very easy
5111902 hes a big game pitcher for a reason he did what he needed to do we couldnt get anything going
5111903 kyle is really good on restarts and i wasnt going to let him get the kind of run on me that he got on jimmie johnson a few weeks ago
5111904 so i just didnt want to have to go through the pain i did everything i could to have the best restart i could and it worked out great
5111905 he has been all year hes the guy that weve got to race on these mile and a half two mile racetracks hes been decent at the other race tracks too but not as stout as he is at these and theres a lot of those in the chase
5111906 those are racetracks that i feel like we need to gain on i dont feel like we struggled there in the first part of the year
5111907 but we need to get better at qualifying up front at those tracks so we dont have to fight for track position all day so we can just run our own race and try to keep up in the top five top 10 if we can get better at passing guys at those tracks thatll make it easier
5111908 we didnt qualify well obviously starting 27th makes it a little tense early in the race but carl did a great job with the car coming through the field
5111909 we were pretty loose there and the 18 was able to stretch a pretty big lead from laps 142 to 165 having the ability to pit again and work on the car when the debris caution was called on lap 166 was a relief carl did a great job from there on out
5111910 were getting to the point that we can win at any race track we go to
5111911 our pit crew has stepped up their game that was our weakness for a long time the guys have repeatedly worked harder week after week to become better so yea i feel confident at all the race tracks we go to
5111912 my psyche and mentality is pretty much fixed on im the greatest race car driver that ever lived know what im saying david pearson told me that if you dont believe that you dont belong in a race car
5111913 it definitely wouldve been great to win but you dont want to take an unnecessary risk and take out a top five finish or finish 20th
5111914 the 18 and the 99 were just a little better than us and after we didnt pit for tires that last run we were going to be sitting ducks depending on how the cautions worked out
5111915 i just drove as hard as i could and tried not to make any mistakes at this point in the season a third place is great a win wouldve been better but a 20th place finish would have been devastating for us trying to make the chase
5111916 we made stupid choices dash malfunctions motor problems at this point we dont deserve to be in the chase

5111925 both the adb and idb have assured us to shore up our reserves by extending 1 billion emergency assistance before the end of this month

5111927 said lon mitchell director of public affairs for the lucas county board of mental retardation and developmental disabilities
5111928 people inherit angelman syndrome as a mutant ube3a gene that does not make ube3a protein
5111929 the simplest explanation for the disease biochemistry is that when ube3a is not around to do its job its substrates arent being degraded like they should be and these proteins build up and interfere with brain functions
5111930 this finding may yield new insights into a form of altered brain activity occurring in schizophrenia
5111931 it may also lead to new methods for screening drugs with potential as schizophrenia treatments
5111932 its analogous to tuning in the weak signal of a distant station on your car radio as opposed to picking up the strong signal of a station thats nearby
5111933 for the first time we were able to show that neuregulin 1 which has been genetically implicated in schizophrenia affects a brain activity that appears to be altered in schizophrenia
5111934 future studies of brain regions rich in erb4 receptors may yield important information on the nature of schizophrenia

5111937 i took my apple out and started eating while i was working as well and she teacher said put that in the bin and you get a sanction and everybodys like but hes diabetic oh hes diabetic and then she was like oh sorry
5111938 he the teacher should have understood a bit more that i was low and didnt know what i was doing because i was talking complete nonsense which is a big sign of being low well my friends know how to react but other people in the class will know when im low and will tell somebody
5111939 i said by the time i get there shell be unconscious
5111940 previous studies have examined the role of parents in diabetes self care and found that parental influence decreases during adolescence as friendships and school life become more important during adolescence examining the influence of school personnel and peers was pertinent there were few studies examining this area so possible outcomes were unknown
5111941 the impact of teachers on young people with diabetes cannot be overestimated given that poorer self care increases the risk of complications including unconsciousness seizures and coma as well as serious long term problems such as blindness and kidney failure
5111942 diabetes is a legally recognised disability all young people with the condition have the right to appropriate school care to help them fully take part in school life young people with diabetes must be allowed to undertake care at any time at school schools need to make all staff aware of pupils with diabetes and their related care needs and staff must be trained in recognising and treating hypoglycaemia
5111943 irrigating with wastewater isnt a rare practice limited to a few of the poorest countries
5111944 its a widespread phenomenon occurring on 20 million hectares across the developing world especially in asian countries like china india and vietnam but also around nearly every city of sub saharan africa and in many latin american cities as well
5111945 the negative and positive implications of wastewater agriculture have only recently received attention
5111946 this study offers the first comprehensive cross country analysis of the conditions that account for the practice and the difficult tradeoffs that arise from it
5111947 of the large potential of wastewater agriculture for both helping and hurting great numbers of urban consumers
5111948 and it isnt just affluent consumers of exotic vegetables whose welfare is at stake
5111949 poor consumers of inexpensive street food also depend on urban agriculture
5111950 a key aim of iwmi research is to find feasible approaches whereby wastewater irrigation can continue strengthening food security and generating economic benefits but without major health risks for urban consumers and farmers

5111952 newer evidence describes how curcumin interacts with certain proteins to generate anti cancer activity inside the body were focusing on the pathways that are most involved in cancer and trying to optimize for those properties
5111953 most of the interaction between our compound and the overactive protein comes from what are called hot spots on the proteins surface
5111954 for each spot we can design small chemical fragments and link them together to make a molecule this is what computer aided design and modeling can do
5111955 very small changes that may seem insignificant can have dramatic effects on these toxicity properties
5111956 but most of the compounds weve made have been more potent than curcumin against the cancer cells
5111957 to be able to develop a drug that in the future could have potential to treat 50 percent of these cancers would be a major contribution
5111958 if you get the chance to have a power you use it for good so ill try my best but ill also just go and live my life and see what happens
5111959 so i went and tried to be a musician and that didnt work
5111960 so then i thought all right ill do this drama class and they told me i was really good and i got an a and then the next thing they did was to drop drama in high school
5111961 i didnt just want to pass the time i wanted to still work and make a living
5111962 i could feel the stares of some of the people
5111963 i didnt have a specialist at that time and so i was a bit in limbo

5111965 its probably easier to get drugs off fat charlie round the back of the bus station than it is to get medicines but there we are
5111966 the evidence is absolutely clear that the extent of the benefits and the numbers of patients involved as such that it isnt the right decision for the health service to make treatment available until patients as they inevitably will move into the moderate stage of the disease

5111968 alzheimers scares people and at four oclock in the morning it scares me and aricept is well worth having for the relief that it brings
5111969 were getting to the point i feel personally that we can win at any race track we go to
5111970 our pit crew has stepped up their game that was our weakness for a long time and the guys have repeatedly week after week worked harder and become better
5111971 every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us what we just have to keep doing is going out here and try to win the next three events and go into this chase on even ground

5111995 the safir ambassador rocket was successfully launched all its systems are iranian made
5111996 we have paved the way for placing a satellite in space in future
5111997 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5111998 this action and dual use possibilities for their ballistic missile program are inconsistent with their un security council obligations
5111999 we do not wish to attack another country but we will defend ourselves should we be attacked

5112001 25 ways to be a douche but make it seem like youre not
5112002 it was a little disappointing in a lot of ways
5112003 we did a lot of things that cause you to lose games in the regular season thirteen penalties a turnover in the red zone not taking care of things in the red zone and defensively a lot of mistakes
5112004 it was a different type of offense than weve played in terms of moving around shifting and motioning but we kind of got out of whack that
5112005 i didnt think we took a step forward really this week
5112006 i know the guys are going to want to play well coming into the new stadium well have a full week a full regular wednesday thursday friday and saturday to prepare we want to be much sharper than weve been these last two games
5112007 there are positives in terms of individual performances but a lot of things we need to clean up
5112008 i think guys understood the defense especially that we did some things that cause you to lose games
5112009 i think some guys we are going to be able to count on during the course of the year are showing up
5112010 hes converting things on third down hes getting us in the right plays other than two plays a fumble and an interception in the first quarter in carolina hes taking care of the ball well he has done a lot of positive things
5112011 i just think overall we have to be sharper on offense
5112012 it was a very big goal for me to win this title my dreams have come true to win tonight
5112013 to come out here took it to another level for me i ran pretty well i was getting in there and being competitive i think i did a great job of that
5112014 it was a good race but i couldnt get my rhythm
5112015 i wish i could have done better but ill move on ill go raise my hand high and continue to dream again
5112016 defensively were miles ahead of where we were at the start of the year
5112017 thats come through hard work and a great attitude from the players and i guess tonight really showed that and won us the game
5112018 too many mistakes fundamental mistakes passing out of dummy half dropped balls on collision bad passing just a really very poor game skill wise

5112028 in the next few months growers will be informed of their water allocation for the 2008 2009 growing season
5112029 with water supply at critical levels there is every indication that this allocation will not increase from last year and in some cases it may be less
5112030 research shows that it is possible to grow profitable crops on reduced water supplies but management systems must change
5112031 growers need to know more about the exact water they need how to access additional irrigation water and understand more about the allocation decision making process
5112032 they also need to know about how to maintain the long term health of their vineyard
5112033 having more knowledge about the market empowers growers to make more strategic decisions
5112034 its quite possible that this lack of water could persist for a long time and growers may need to look at alternative business models or vineyard management strategies

5112043 we expect a strong first half of fiscal 2009 having already had a good start to fiscal 2009 mainly driven by continued strong global steel demand and prices bluescope managing director and chief executive paul omalley said
5112044 our asian businesses particularly thailand where economic conditions continue to improve are producing consistent results
5112045 our north american coated and building products businesses are performing at the solid levels at which they finished fiscal 2008 despite the uncertainty that currently exists within the us economy
5112046 excited by the opportunities offered in the north american market following bluescopes acquisition of fellow steelmaker imsa steel for us730 million 843 million in february
5112047 we will provide further guidance on first half fiscal 2009 performance during the november annual general meeting mr omalley said
5112048 detailed project planning for the approximate 105 day reline period is in place mr omalley said
5112049 on a longer term basis these projects will deliver both cost and volume benefits
5112050 the aim of this project is to develop a more dynamic learning environment
5112051 learning in our first year biology courses is often hampered by the difficulty students have in internalising new and often abstract concepts
5112052 while tutorial sessions have the principal function of supporting student learning by engaging students in small group discussion of topics this rarely happens effectively
5112053 tutes for this course previously contained 30 students hardly conducive to student interaction
5112054 my challenge has been to develop a tutorial format that will facilitate a high level of engagement and learning
5112055 a commonly cited source of student disatisfaction is the lack of feedback students receive during their studies particularly in large classes
5112056 student satisfaction should improve significantly by providing students with instant and progressive feedback on their understanding of the course and its content
5112057 the use of the ars tool will empower all students with the capability to actively engage in these learning sessions in ways which were previously not possible for many
5112058 at uq we are lucky to have such a large number of teaching staff dedicated to improving the learning outcomes of our students
5112059 each of the successful applications proposed an innovative teaching initiative
5112060 i look forward to hearing the feedback on how students have benefited from the implementation of these projects

5112071 the total impairment charge taking into consideration the alinta retail business and the writedown of the tamar construction costs is expected to be 452 million
5112072 bbp may receive an additional incentive payment upon successful delivery of the project which is currently on time and budget for delivery in august 2009

5112085 never say never but i cant see it happening i cant see it working it would be sad i think these bands that start playing again some of them get carried away and they write an album and they start saying its the best thing we ever done and then it just isnt we dont want to be one of those bands we dont want to be doing this next year i could maybe see us playing again in some of the countries that were not touching this year but lets see if we kill each other when were in north america on a tour bus

5112158 we the undersigned petition the prime minister to respect the result of the irish referendum and abandon the attempt to ratify the lisbon treaty
5112159 the irish referendum on the lisbon treaty has resulted in a decisive no vote however politicians across europe are calling for the ratification of the treaty to go ahead the british government are planning to put the lisbon treaty to its third and final reading in the lords next wednesday 18 june this would complete its ratification in the uk we believe that the prime minister should respect the result of the irish referendum and abandon the attempt to ratify the lisbon treaty
5112160 the rules of the treaty and the eu are clear all 27 member states must ratify the treaty for it to come into force there is no question of ignoring the irish vote or bulldozing irish opinion ireland clearly cannot be bound by changes which it has not ratified equally there is no appetite for a return to years of institutional negotiation the eu as a whole needs to find a way forward for all countries that allows the eu to focus on the big policy issues that confront us

5112162 when she looked at her palm she imagined that her life line was getting shorter this morning she realized that her life was becoming unbearable every morning she would play games with herself just to get through the day like telling herself that today something wonderful was going to happen that the next time the phone would ring it would be good news that would change her life or that she was going to get a surprise in the mail the quiet hysteria and awful despair had started when she finally began to realize that nothing was ever going to change that nobody would be coming for her to take her away she began to feel as if she were at the bottom of a well screaming no one to hear

5112169 carlos tevez will be back for the portsmouth match next week and wayne will be much sharper and much fitter and in the second half it started to show for him but unfortunately campbell also picked up an injury and i had to take him off so we were asking wayne to play through the middle when hes really needing games and it was a big ask
5112170 im not discussing anyone i think we have a good squad the same squad as last year and when tevez comes back and wayne gets games that will be my strike force
5112171 thats what it was last season and im happy to continue with that there are 37 games left so it is not a disaster we have shown before we can come from behind

5112173 i think too often in the last few years newcastle have bought players that havent been quite good enough for whatever reason
5112174 sometimes they havent settled sometimes they havent seemed to understand what it means to play for newcastle united
5112175 the three that weve got so far do and the next three must as well and if that means waiting then so be it
5112176 anyone can collect players because there are hundreds around but good players who can play at newcastle not everyone can do that

5112234 all these so called nontraditional capabilities have moved into the mainstream of military thinking planning and strategy where they must stay
5112235 rumsfelds dismal strategic decisions resulted in the unnecessary deaths of american servicemen and women
5112236 responsible for america and her allies going to war with the wrong plan
5112237 violated fundamental principles of war dismissed deliberate military planning ignored the hard work to build the peace after the fall of saddam hussein set the conditions for abu ghraib and other atrocities that further ignited the insurgency disbanded iraqi security force institutions when we needed them most and constrained our commanders with an overly restrictive policy
5112238 with like minded and compliant subordinates who did not grasp the importance of the principles of war the complexities of iraq or the human dimension of warfare
5112239 tied the hands of commanders while our troops were in contact with the enemy
5112240 the most significant transformation in the american conduct of war since world war ii and the invention of the atomic bomb was not technological but cultural social and political the removal of the american people from the conduct of war
5112241 no other human activity gives it greater scope no other has such incessant and varied dealings with this intruder

5112243 i play one on a tv show and have played them before and people have seen me as that frankly i can do a lot more and different stuff i dont want to limit myself
5112244 there is always this fear in hollywood that oh characters need to be likable and relatable and i dont know if thats necessarily the case i think that characters need to be human and they need to be recognizable but they dont have to necessarily be likable
5112245 that opens a whole world of comic possibilities i enjoy playing essentially unlikable characters and really committing to it and digging in
5112246 the one thing that really amazed me about dwight was that people love him hes so obnoxious hes mean and petty but people are gaga for him as a character they feel for him and adore him and its just because its well written and a specific characterization its real
5112247 everyone says we have a dwight in our office everyone says that which is pretty astonishing dwight is an amish beet farmer paper salesman with militant fascistic tendencies
5112248 but everyone feels they have a dwight in their office
5112249 great are you going to give out my address too
5112250 my first real dealing with rainn was a rehearsal session at my house that we had for house of 1000 corpses
5112251 within 15 minutes rainn took off all his clothes and was diving into the swimming pool total rock star behavior hes a rocker at heart
5112252 he can be touching and dramatic or off the wall and hilarious depending on the situation
5112253 hes whatever he needs to be he is a demi god that has come to earth to grace us with his multiple talents which include comedy unfiltered sarcasm and the ability to retain his dignity while riding a tricycle into a pool
5112254 show me your karate show me your karate punch ok
5112255 the elder wilson says and the boy shrinks into a ball
5112256 what separates them is that dwight is very tightly wound and i think fish is very loosely wound
5112257 dwight may not be the brightest bulb but hes very exacting and rigorous and there is a kind of philosophy that guides everything he does in that way hes very thoughtful and fish is completely thoughtless really fish lets it all hang out and is loose and just wants to be a rock n roller
5112258 is not profound were not dealing with citizen kane here but its nice to have a story that has some heart to it
5112259 its this movie about a guy with these kids but hes the one who needs to come of age
5112260 a couple irons i have in the fire have a little more darker edge to them
5112261 my ideal movie to make is one i have actually written a second draft on one ive been working on with oscar nominated juno director jason reitman called bonzai shadowhands about a down and out alcoholic ninja
5112262 its a very dark comedy the most messed up version of the karate kid you can imagine that fits my sensibility well
5112263 he knows how to make anything real thats what youre looking for in a comedy these days a guy who can take an outlandish situation and make it somewhat honest and believable hes just a fantastic actor while his technique has been used to make really funny tv and movies what he hasnt had the opportunity to do yet is use that to simply move people in dramatic moments

5112271 this is more than sit back and watch tv this is lean forward and get immersed tv
5112272 josh is the genuine article he brings an authenticity to a show that goes to difficult locations and is rich with detail we think this will appeal to our core audience who like information to be credible but in an entertaining package
5112273 as an explorer and someone who loves to travel this show is the perfect vehicle for me
5112274 you wouldnt have to pay me to do this i would do it without tv cameras
5112275 after three years it felt a bit constricted we wanted to be as ambitious as possible with into the unknown covering the past present and future

5112281 when i go in at quarterback im not just coming off the bench
5112282 my arms are loose my legs are loose ive already been playing im sweating different things like that
5112283 i think the fact that hes on the field more now in different packages has helped him as a quarterback because hes getting more confidence and he stays in tune with the game so were excited about his play and seeing him play quarterback some and throw the ball
5112284 every box of shells i have burnt up would buy a steak
5112285 the time i spent in the field at current prices of labor would nearly build our home if you calculate the returns in pounds of food and cash values it is not a good business and i might add that he who looks at these sports from this angle will never be a real sportsman

5112304 one element of good design is to allow these workers to come back year after year if they turn out to be good workers
5112305 what that does is it shifts the incentives in favour of playing by the rules and having access to a job year after year after year rather than by blowing your chances by not complying in one year
5112306 in the next few months growers will be informed of their water allocation for the 2008 2009 growing season
5112307 with water supply at critical levels there is every indication that this allocation will not increase from last year and in some cases it may be less
5112308 research shows that it is possible to grow profitable crops on reduced water supplies but management systems must change
5112309 growers need to know more about the exact water they need how to access additional irrigation water and understand more about the allocation decision making process
5112310 they also need to know about how to maintain the long term health of their vineyard
5112311 having more knowledge about the market empowers growers to make more strategic decisions

5112324 its like when you fart one of them hot ones in jeans and its all contained in one area then after a moment from the sudden change in temperature and reversal your underwear or pants for those who go commando feels intensely cold so you think did i just shit myself and you readjust in your seat or hike your pants and see ifn you can feel anything moist you feel nothing if fact theres no smell but you cant help but think its a possibility for that temperature change does not make it feel right so you dismiss yourself to the bathroom to check regardless and then you feel relief glorious relief

5112424 i think its good that they are embracing the church more this country needs hope and needs healing and i think the church has the answers
5112425 i think when we are really able to express what our flaws and our failures could be to me beings a healing process not only externally but internally
5112426 no one of us is perfect everyone of us is a sinner and by the grace of god we have a relationship through him through his son jesus christ and that is a foundational part of any person who should be leading our country

5112470 when i reached out to the church i felt like i had been condemned because of my lifestyle
5112471 i basically told him in so many words to go to hell
5112472 the church must step forward and clarify it as a disease like any other disease
5112473 if were not willing to tell our members in our churches that being homophobic is a sin then were really shucking and jiving
5112474 in as much as we particularly in our ministry do not encourage unfaithfulness that we call adultery or fornication were not going to change that particular principle
5112475 when we have local agencies to provide testing on sundays after services the numbers of persons actually going in the room and getting tested have been very low
5112476 we hope hell come out but i can see why he might not want to risk coming out like that

5112490 the implications are that china will be the commercial leader of the world
5112491 it will also deserve and demand leadership in global institutions
5112492 we can model the economy and show that by 2035 it will be as big if not bigger than the united states economy will be at that time and by the middle of the century it will be twice the size of the u s economy at that time
5112493 weve done numerous things to the landscape that took away these water absorbing func tions he said
5112494 i sense that the flooding is not the result of a 500 year event said jerry dewitt di rector of the leopold center for sustainable agriculture at iowa state university
5112495 were farm ing closer to creeks farming closer to rivers without ade quate buffer strips the water moves rapidly from the field di rectly to the surface water
5112496 weve lost 90 percent of our wetlands said mary skopec who monitors water quality for the iowa dnr
5112497 with that volume of rain youre going to have flooding theres just no way around it said donna dubberke a meteor ologist with the national weather service in the quad cit ies
5112498 this is not just because someone put in a parking lot
5112499 why should we have two 500 year floods within 15 years
5112500 something in the system has changed said pete kollasch a remote sensing analyst with the iowa dnr
5112501 the only thing i can point my finger at is global warming but theres no proof of that
5112502 it doesnt have the resil ience built into it that you need to withstand disturbances in the system
5112503 thats not an act of god thats an act of city council
5112504 weve done numerous things to the landscape that took away these water absorbing functions

5112508 were touring europe at the moment always a great place to be last night was such a great gig but we all had a late night
5112509 russia was incredible not only was it a country that we had yet to tour in the past but it was a prime example of how music can bridge cultural and language divides anti flag do not believe in segregation were all one people
5112510 the way things are now makes it so much more inspirational to have been there to spread our message i mean who knows how many have been killed or displaced
5112511 some people love it some hate it i guess some people fear change
5112512 its certainly a record that weve been most proud of and excited by its a record where we put our best foot forward and took a chance at experimenting its like life to not be afraid of change in that respect personally the record has been an amazing experience and brings some really exciting moments when we perform it live
5112513 were so excited about coming back we had such a blast last time we visited weve been meaning to return but its an issue of fitting it into our schedule which as you know is quite hectic
5112514 were in the midst of the european tour at the moment as were going to be working on our new album in october and maybe november hopefully having it completed before coming to australia
5112515 trust me youre never too young to get into music we believe in getting our message out to anyone and everyone the more the merrier
5112516 dont get me wrong though australian crowds are special they bring that extra element to each live show its something we all enjoy and we hope that we can give something back when were there later this year

5112539 with our business model and what were trying to accomplish were not going to have any travel in the playoffs should no 3 seed alexandria and edinburg advance the whole series would be shifted to alexandria and we will play all three games in alexandria
5112540 its a travel thing its not anything against the fans or whats happening in edinburg or anything of that nature
5112541 its just that the fact that youre spread out all over the map and to travel after a wednesday game to go to alexandria and play one or go to edinburg and play one then leave right away and travel 12 hours just doesnt make sense
5112542 it really is a tough break but ill tell you what coyotes manager vince moore has won as good on the road as he has at home

5112580 se o objetivo da campanha realmente eliminar a rub ola ent o por que vacinar quem j foi vacinado
5112581 por que obrigar a vacina o de quem j teve a doen a fato mais que comprovado que a pessoa que j teve rub ola nunca mais a ter

5112584 when i reached out to the church i felt like i had been condemned because of my lifestyle
5112585 i basically told him in so many words to go to hell
5112586 the church must step forward and clarify it as a disease like any other disease
5112587 if were not willing to tell our members in our churches that being homophobic is a sin then were really shucking and jiving
5112588 in as much as we particularly in our ministry do not encourage unfaithfulness that we call adultery or fornication were not going to change that particular principle
5112589 when we have local agencies to provide testing on sundays after services the numbers of persons actually going in the room and getting tested have been very low
5112590 why is cbc paying attention to michael phelps well hes possibly the greatest amateur athlete of all time and the biggest story of the olympics
5112591 phelps is amazing this guy is dominating his sport like no other like wayne gretzky and michael jordan in their day
5112592 michael phelps is the worlds best swimmer right now and he is on the verge of fulfilling a great achievement

5112624 in the next few months growers will be informed of their water allocation for the 2008 2009 growing season
5112625 with water supply at critical levels there is every indication that this allocation will not increase from last year and in some cases it may be less
5112626 research shows that it is possible to grow profitable crops on reduced water supplies but management systems must change
5112627 growers need to know more about the exact water they need how to access additional irrigation water and understand more about the allocation decision making process
5112628 they also need to know about how to maintain the long term health of their vineyard
5112629 having more knowledge about the market empowers growers to make more strategic decisions
5112630 it was like winning the lottery without having to buy a lottery ticket

5112653 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions

5112655 boredom may allow the brain to recast the world in productive ways
5112656 daydreaming too can be a kind of constructive self entertainment psychologists say especially if the mind is turning over a problem
5112657 the world can be divided in many ways rich and poor democratic and authoritarian but one of the most striking is the divide between the societies with an individualistic mentality and the ones with a collectivist mentality
5112658 if asias success reopens the debate between individualism and collectivism then its unlikely that the forces of individualism will sweet the field or even gain an edge
5112659 the rise of china isnt only an economic event its a cultural one the ideal of a harmonious collective may turn out to be as attractive as the ideal of the american dream
5112660 have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has you have blessed the work of his hands so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land 11 but stretch out your hand and strike everything he has and he will surely curse you to your face

5112664 we hope to form the cabinet soon and are holding consultations with potential coalition partners
5112665 i dont think you can control the entire world from one centre
5112666 there are big nations there are huge populations there is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world so what we have to do is instead of unilateral actions act all together make common decisions and have consultations with the world a new world order if i can say it should emerge
5112667 there are so many important issues like the nuclear issue iraq the caucasus and afghanistan
5112668 iran is definitely having some influence on these issues so we are talking
5112669 unless they bring some comprehensive changes in the security this deployment will not affect peoples confidence

5112672 before we know it 45 countries will be negotiating with us
5112673 in a sense the u s will act as indias sherpa at the nsg
5112674 the indians will need to convince the nuclear suppliers group that it should give the same kind of international treatment in terms of civil nuclear trade to india that the united states would have just given bilaterally
5112675 without any change to the draft that was circulated to them recently
5112676 the tension has eased considerably there is no more confrontation
5112677 i appeal to you that after your armed forces leave georgian territory to start serious thinking and discussions about further negotiations a further search for ways to conduct relations in order not to sow discord between our countries for good
5112678 lets not sow discord for future generations i dont appeal to your mercy but i appeal to your pragmatism and simple common sense i think the time to make the right decisions has come

5112690 they say that when we come to a beauty salon we come with the expectation that were going to be relaxed in a different frame of mind
5112691 if we come here and we see someone who has gone through so much pain and misery so automatically that gives us that low feeling also they have a point

5112696 we may or may not have found an animal of indeterminate origin that were not going to show you any of the evidence for
5112697 i saw them on tv they are very cute i am just waiting to hold them in my arms and breastfeed them i dont know if i can do it to all but i will try
5112698 this is a very rare pregnancy something i have never witnessed over my past 33 years in this profession the babies are doing well but they still need a lot of care
5112699 what they need most is a dwelling to live in
5112700 i hope the government will give them an apartment with the help of allah they will make it but i think that it will be difficult
5112701 the victory of the will of the resistance and a means for persisting in the conflict with the israeli occupation
5112702 we ask israel to change its conditions for releasing prisoners and we ask for the release of all prisoners without exception
5112703 the release of prisoners only to those who use force against israel transmits a message of weakness and surrender to pressure while the release of prisoners to pragmatic elements as part of the peace process encourages the policy by which dialogue with israelis leads to these achievements for the palestinians
5112704 instead of taking a position of attacking terror the government is freeing terrorists with blood on their hands in exchange for nothing while gilad shalit continues to rot in jail the inevitable result is that terror organizations will understand that they can send more terrorists to carry out more attacks in israel and theyll know that one day they too will be freed
5112705 if john says im going with so and so you cant count on that the next morning
5112706 mccain frequently forgets key elements of policies gets countries names wrong forgets things hes said only hours or days before and is frequently just confused

5112708 partisan talking points of which i have read many and find quite amusing
5112709 allows mccain to again flex his manchurian candidate military cred
5112710 its a bit strange for us really because were kind of up on the mountain and i think its actually the people back down here at home that went through more trauma than we went through
5112711 we will work on accomplishing it within the coming weeks
5112712 such a decision will be followed by some logistical measures which need to be taken by both countries in order to put the agreement into effect
5112713 the ones we know about have committed criminal offenses in syria
5112714 we inquired about other people and we are still waiting for a response from syrian officials
5112715 later the cabinet will issue a separate decree for an embassy in syria
5112716 then all that remains in front of us are procedural steps which the two foreign ministries will be tasked with taking
5112717 the syrians do not need an embassy to operate in lebanon they have their intelligence as well as their allies
5112718 referring the issue of lebanese prisoners in syrian jails to committees is equivalent to killing it we all know that forming committees will not help in resolving the issue
5112719 demarcating borders in the shebaa farms area will help liberate the occupied territory whereas excluding it aims at creating pretexts for hizbullah to hold on to its arms
5112720 we are not saying that to turn our back to discussing a defense strategy for lebanon but to say that there are other important issues which need to be discussed during national dialogue sessions
5112721 we need to address economic and social issues as well as ways to implement the decisions that were taken during earlier dialogue sessions
5112722 the first couple weeks of motherboard availability on intels latest and greatest integrated graphics chipset have been tumultuous first our competition threw together a demo booth which stated baldly that hp laptops with g m 45 did not accelerate blu ray at all while theirs naturally did of course the intel system was running vista aeroglass while the competitive system was not and no specifics about which memory or cpus each was using were given it was clearly not an apples to apples comparison but the fact that the intel cpu was pegged at 100 is just as clearly an indication hardware acceleration was not working ill not try to puzzle out why the competition is of course going to try to put themselves in the best light possible but it was unfortunate fud next extremetech did a very unflattering review on the intel dg45id board while most of their criticisms concentrated on gaming they threw in a paragraph about blu ray playback as well ill be honest i skipped everything regarding gaming its not and never will be my focus but they brought up a couple of troublesome issues they too did not see hardware acceleration on g45 blu ray playback they updated this a couple of days later with a correction presumably someone from intel got involved to tell them about the proper bios settings showing the acceleration working now but a less than stellar benchmark the only one they ran remains on the hd hqv test intel scored a paltry 30 out of 100 while i question the value of some of the hd hqv tests when evaluating blu ray a topic for another time they are in fact valid tests

5112882 that evening however saakashvili went for the military option the georgian military launched a massive artillery attack on tskhinvali followed the next day by a ground assault involving tanks
5112883 this was a city with no pure military targets full of civilians who had been given no warning and were expecting peace talks at any moment

5112908 did peak oil happen no we didnt have a crisis that warranted this 150 oil
5112909 the impact of those folks coming onto the scene was greater than the effect of speculative investors
5112910 people in the know saw that paper assets stocks and bonds would get into serious trouble
5112911 they figured the only safe haven was tangible assets there was a complete panic out of paper and into physical assets they moved not for speculation but for protection

5112920 tahun lalu sekali lagi universiti al azhar menyatakan hasrat membatalkan mou itu kerana kadar pelajar lulus masih di tahap 20 hingga 30 peratus lalu memaksa kami membuat rayuan lagi

5113003 islam is much closer to christianity on that level than mormonism
5113004 each god through his wife or wives raises up a numerous family of sons and daughters indeed there will be no end to the increase of his own children for each father and mother will be in a condition to multiply forever and ever as soon as each god has begotten many millions of male and female spirits and his heavenly inheritance becomes too small to comfortably accommodate his great family he in connection with his sons organizes a new world after a similar order to the one which we now inhabit where he sends both the male and female spirits to inhabit tabernacles of flesh and bones thus each god forms a world for the accommodation of his own sons and daughters who are sent forth in their times and seasons and generations to be born into the same the inhabitants of each world are required to reverence adore and worship their own personal father who dwells in the heaven which they formerly inhabited

5113012 the animal rights movement is not concerned about species extinction an elephant is no more or less important than a cow just as a dolphin is no more important than a tuna in fact many animal rights advocates would argue that it is better for the chimpanzee to become extinct than to be exploited continually in laboratories zoos and circuses
5113013 as long as humans have rights and nonhumans do not as is the case in the welfarist animal welfare framework then nonhumans will virtually always lose when their interests conflict with human interests thus welfare reforms by their very nature can only serve to retard the pace at which animal rights goals are achieved
5113014 to those people who say my father is alive because of animal experimentation i say yeah well good for you this dog died so your father could live sorry but i am just not behind that kind of trade off
5113015 if the death of one rat cured all diseases it wouldnt make any difference to me

5113017 americas new extremists what you need to know about the animal rights movement
5113018 even granting that we humans face greater harm than laboratory animals presently endure if research on these animals is stopped the animal rights view will not be satisfied with anything less than total abolition
5113019 if my father had a heart attack it would give me no solace at all to know his treatment was first tried on a dog

5113161 bio haz cleanups are usually voluntary assignments unless were shorthanded for some reason weve found its not wise to force the assignment on guys that dont feel comfortable with it
5113162 these guys are used to cleaning up oil gasoline and chemicals you cant just toss anyone into a zone strewn with body parts and expect them to perform if youve ever seen a guy vomit into his respirator well that can be a worse sight than a splatter of intestines scraped off of a rock
5113163 sure the stench can be bad if the cleanup happens in the summer like this one did but it has its advantages too the medical crew comes in first and takes whatever whole pieces of the body they can find torso limbs if theres anything left its our job to clean up what remains after that tissue bodily fluids tiny parts thats where the bees are helpful the bees are attracted to the blood there was a whole swarm of them buzzing around this one pile of stones near the tracks so we shooed them away and dug down a bit and sure enough there was a finger in there we would have missed it otherwise

5113165 doesnt matter if youre using your tongs to pick up an eyeball a piece of brain or just a lump of tissue it all goes into the red bio haz bags and gets sealed up you cant think of it as human its all just waste in the end

5113392 well we may be able to get that down payment done for you but as im sure you know the less you put down today the more youll have to pay off on the car so this payment is likely to go up what were you looking to pay on the car for payments

5113411 an honest reflection of the fact that for many of my colleagues in that weekly prayer breakfast there is a lot of focus on christ
5113412 what ive gotten out of that is a respect for my colleagues belief

5113414 on the other hand i dont know of anyone who has been forced to attend this event

5113457 im mentally comparing your home to mine in hopes i can feel like im better than you

5113459 that guy doesnt comform to our southern norms and must be subtly punished over period of years
5113460 i may not be a psychologist but i am a mother
5113461 i think the ability to procreate like any common tree sloth makes me somehow brilliant even though my kid starts fires while i pat myself on the back
5113462 that guy uses words with multiple syllables that a hick like me is unfamiliar with
5113463 im so arrogant and such a religious bigot that i assume that my choice of religion has an absolute monopoly on the truth

5113465 i want a huge wedding that will cast a frustrating shadow over both of our lives for a year and i expect you to know that without me saying it because my mind has become delusional from too many chick flicks and cheap romance novels
5113466 if other people dont define me ill be a word without meaning
5113467 im too simple minded or just stupid to think for myself so i let a guy who screams himself hoarse and cries in front of dozens of people do my heavy thinking for me

5113477 let no one keep defrauding you of your prize by delighting in self abasement and the worship of the angels taking his stand on visions he has seen inflated without cause by his fleshly mind and not holding fast to the head

5113488 oh lord help me to utter words which are gentle and tender because tomorrow we may have to eat them

5113490 oh thats fine we want to make sure you are totally satisfied with your ring and your shopping experience at spence
5113491 oh yes that is way too big that is definitely not a size 6 we told her we needed the ring for the party and she said it was fine to return it after and wished us a good time at the party
5113492 ini tidak biasanya namun saya langsung masuk pasar pegawai saya juga sudah datang dan masuk termasuk pegawai lainnya
5113493 ini waktu yang menurut saya tepat untuk pembakaran sekaligus mampu mengaburkan petunjuk
5113494 kami sebenarnya sudah mengantongi nama orang orang yang mengonsumsi miras tapi kami tidak berani gegabah
5113495 dari masing masing penyidik tinggal mengerucutkan saja jika benar tinggal menangkap
5113496 kalau bicara soal itu masih 50 persen dan masih jauh
5113497 terus terang untuk mengungkap ini sangat sulit dan butuh kecermatan
5113498 saya kebagian membuka tiga pintu utama bagian belakang di lantai satu dua dan tiga sendirian
5113499 biasanya justru banyak telat jam 08 00 lebih tetapi ketika kejadian pintu dibuka lebih maju dari biasanya
5113500 tidak pernah ada bel pintu selalu dibuka tepat waktu pukul 08 00 wib
5113501 kami hanya mengikatnya dengan rafia kalau ada orang masuk pasti bisa tetapi selama ini nggak ada yang berani
5113502 sementara pintu pintu yang menuju gedung ramayana seharusnya dibuka 08 30 wib
5113503 tetapi lazimnya pintu rusak itu tidak pernah secara resmi dibuka oleh petugas justru pintu jeruji baja ini kerap dibuka sendiri oleh pedagang ketika pasar turi mulai ramai petugas hanya menutup setiap sore dengan tali
5113504 kadang setiap hari pintu itu masih terikat tali rafia namun ada kalanya sejak pagi sudah bisa dilewati
5113505 semua yang dinilai janggal dalam kebakaran sudah diperiksa apakah pelaku masuk lewat pintu itu atau tidak kami belum bisa menyimpulkan
5113506 pagi itu penjaga toko itu datang terus membuka toko namun di sela sela membuka toko dia mendapati seorang berjalan di lorong ke arah keluar dengan sempoyongan bisa jadi mabuk
5113507 bahkan penjaga toko itu mengatakan kalau ada yang menjamin keluarganya dia bersedia membunuh orang yang dimaksud tersebut
5113508 kalau biasanya saat awal akan jualan suasana riuh oleh saling sapa dan suara rolling door dibuka saat itu dari sekitar arah blok c ada suara gebrakan
5113509 yang pasti bukan bagian dari suara rolling door yang dibuka seperti biasanya sangat berbeda
5113510 untuk lebih lanjutnya kami sudah tidak ingat lagi pastinya suara itu bukan ledakan
5113511 dia terlihat berjalan sendirian ciricirinya di bawah mata bagian kiri ada bekas luka sementara di lengan kanannya terdapat tato
5113512 saya nggak ketemu lagi orang itu setiap hari saya sanggong saya cari sendiri nggak ketemu
5113513 lho bukankah ciri yang disebutkan saksi ini mirip ciri ciri dugaan pembakaran kedua di pasar turi tahap iii 9 september 2007
5113514 termasuk haryono juga diperiksa polisi tetapi hingga saya buka stan di pgs ini haryono dan dua karyawan saya tidak lagi kembali
5113515 dia haryono hanya melihat ada asap dan suara orang berteriak teriak mereka segera menyelamatkan sebagian barang dagangan dan diri masing masing
5113516 hitam jelas hitam nggak hitam pekat sih tetapi kalau putih pasti tidak
5113517 saat itu pintu toko belum terbuka terus saya serahkan kunci tokonya ternyata sudah tidak bisa digunakan lagi
5113518 ketika saya tanya ke petugasnya mereka bilang masih mau ambil air
5113519 kalau habis untuk apa datang seharusnya pergi dulu untuk ambil air bukan berdiam tidak berbuat apa apa
5113520 tentu saja saat kejadian itu fasilitas tersebut tidak bisa lagi digunakan
5113521 saya tahu orang dengan ciri seperti itu di pasar turi hanya satu namanya aa
5113522 saya tidak tahu kalau dia inisalnya aa dia menyabut nama lengkap aa red tapi kalau ciri cirinya seperti itu bercodet di bawah mata bertato di lengan saya sempat melihatnya di lorong antara pasar turi tahap i dan iv
5113523 tapi saya curiga mereka semua jumlahnya 12 kok menenteng botol satu satu apalagi disini antarpedagang saling tahu sekalipun tidak saling kenal
5113524 saya mengira bantahan polisi itu prematur karena di lantai dua tidak ada warun juga tidak ada genset di sekitar botol kami juga tidak pernah diperiksa terkait temuan botol itu
5113525 botol dan isinya yang ditemukan di kebakaran pasar turi kedua 9 9 seperti temuan botol dan isinya di kebakaran pertama 27 6 bukankah di lokasi kebakaran kedua tidak ada warung
5113526 mk datang pertama kali di pasar turi sejak syamsul kepala uptd pasar turi syamsul arifin red menjabat kepala pasar turi setahun lalu
5113527 dia sering tidur di lorong kantor uptd itu sama kelompoknya mulai kebakaran pertama
5113528 sekitar tiga pekan setelah kebakaran pasar turi di kampung gundih sempat ada rapat khusus membahas mk dan nasib pedagang pasar
5113529 pertemuan sepakat berada di belakang pedagang dan meminta mk tidak menganggu pedagang
5113530 banyak yang menyaksikan anak buah mk menyingkir dan mk gelisah
5113531 kami menyaksikan mk di balik para penjaga pusat grosir itu dan di sampingnya ada m
5113532 sejak saat itu sm sering berseberangan dengan kepentingan pedagang hpp
5113533 tiga bulan sebelum terbakar sm mengajak para pedagang agar membeli kios di pusat grosir anyar di surabaya
5113534 saya tidak pernah melihat ciri ciri itu dan nama itu di pasar turi
5113535 beliau mk red itu adalah sesepuh sambil menyebut salah satu etnis red yang ada di pasar turi dia merupakan keamanan internal pasar turi yang dibayar oleh uptd tapi dia bukan pns maupun pedagang
5113536 bagaimana ini saya kok dijelek jelekkan itu fitnah saya tidak pernah mengancam ar dia menyebut nama lengkap
5113537 pasar turi akan direvitalisasi yang artinya ada dua bangunannya dibenahi atau dirombak total
5113538 saat kebakaran pertama 26 7 saya sedang mengantar dan menunggui anak saya di tk taman kanak kanak kejadian kedua saya sudah pulang dan berada di rumah
5113539 karena penasaran saya akhirnya menghubungi teman untuk mencari tahu rencana pembangunan pasar turi pasar turi kebakar tapi kok nggak ada yang susah ada apa ini
5113540 namun hanya satu mobil yang masuk ke dalam pasar turi di depan toko restu itupun bukan mobil pemadam yang yang memiliki tangki air tetapi mobil perlengkapan
5113541 lho ternyata setelah semua selang siap kok ternyata hanya satu selang yang menyemprot
5113542 saya sempat marah kok hanya satu yang menyemprot apalagi tidak lama airnya habis
5113543 kami melihat semua petugas makan siang bersama di lokasi kebakaran hanya ada petugas pmk dari pt bogasari yang masih bekerja
5113544 alatnya macet petugasnya eker ekeran berselisih red saya ikut stres melihatnya namun akhirnya berhasil naik tetapi setelah sampai di atas eh air yang keluar kecil tidak bisa menyemprot jadinya turun lagi
5113545 bagaiamana api bisa merembet ke tahap empat sementara media untuk merembetnya api tidak ada mustahil beton bisa menjalarkan api
5113546 dua sumur yang ada di sisi barat pasar turi diketahui kering dan hanya berisi sampah sedangkan sumur pompa yang ada di bawah tahap vi tidak bisa dimasuki mobil pmk yang akan menyalurkan selang pemadam
5113547 sepertinya dua tandon ini tidak pernah dibuka selama kebakaran bahkan dilihat juga tidak pernah
5113548 saya berani membuktikan jika tandon itu tidak pernah disentuh pmk para pedagang curiga jika pmk sengaja tidak menggunakan air dalam tandon tandon pasar turi
5113549 untuk pemadaman di lantai ii dan iii petugas hanya bisa melakukan dari atas mobil pemadam mobil tangga red sedangkan untuk naik ke lantai ii dan iii secara perorangan sambil membawa selang cukup berbahaya dengan adanya api yang menjilat di sekitar tangga naik
5113550 karena angin ini membuat api menjalar ke bangunan tersebut secara cepat
5113551 sedangkan aa itu tidak punya codet dan bertato saya tahu karena saya biasa bertemu keduanya di selasar bawah ramayana lorong antara tahap i dan tahap iv pasar turi red
5113552 setelah itu biasanya dia dapat uang hampir sama dengan saya hanya dia cukup berbicara dan tidak mengemis seperti saya dan anak anak
5113553 di antara orang orang yang menyebar ke blok arah barat ada yang memiliki ciri bercodet tapi apakah didalamnya ada r saya tidak kenal
5113554 selain lupa saat itu banyak asap dan sedikit gelap hanya badan dan tangan yang memegang botol plastik berisi cairan warna kuing itu
5113555 saksinya sendiri tidak ada satupun yang diajak ke tkp tempat kejadian perkara red
5113556 kalau aa dia menyebut nama lengkapnya saya kenal dia sering di pasar turi soalnya istrinya menjual aksesori seperti kalung dan gelang
5113557 karena yang bikin onar masih menantu saya jadi saya diminta menyelesaikan
5113558 saya bukan jagoan saya ini hanya orang bawahan kenalannya sama orang orang yang di bawah saja
5113559 saya bertanggjawab disini pasar turi red jadi siapapun yang masuk pasar turi tidak boleh berbuat onar
5113560 kalaupun ada pengakuan tanpa bukti material kami tetap tidak bisa menangkap sedangkan ada bukti material tanpa bukti pengakuan kami juga tidak bisa melakukan hal itu penangkapan red

5113562 harusnya bulan bulan ini juli hingga oktober hasilnya dipresentasikan ke wali kota namun keburu kebakaran ya tidak jadi
5113563 swasta sempat menawarkan pembangunan dengan sistem bot build operate and transfer red selama 25 30 tahun
5113564 tim pimpinan h warsito itu dikuatkan dengan sk hpp tugasnya menjadi tim lobi pedagang dengan investor
5113565 saya dengar pertemuan dengan chondro dihadiri sejumlah pejabat pemkot uptd pasar turi dan mr yang mengatasnamakan perwakilan pedagang
5113566 namun kami tidak mau karena sudah dikecewakan akibat ditelikung dalam pembahasan sebelumnya
5113567 empat bulan sebelum kebakaran kami bertemu pejabat disperindag di hotel elmi dan menanyakan kelanjutan rencana pembangunan itu
5113568 informasinya uang itu untuk biaya pengamanan agar api tidak merembet ke bangunan tahap iii tapi uangnya saya tidak tahu diberikan kepada siapa yang pasti tujuannya seperti itu
5113569 itu pun berlangsung selama tiga hari bersamaan dengan waktu terjadinya kebakaran yang menimpa tahap i ii dan iv
5113570 chondro sebenarnya adalah bekas pedagang pasar turi namun sekarang sukses bergerak di bidang properti di jakarta
5113571 kami diajak ke pasar tanah abang melihat proyek pembangunan kata chondro inilah salah satu karya investasinya di jakarta
5113572 dia hanya boneka tetapi siapa yang menggerakkan semua orang bisa menebak arahnya
5113573 ada beberapa investor yang juga maju tapi sing nggowo yang membawa red malah pak djoko ketua hpp pasar turi djoko sudjiono red
5113574 kami mengambil pelajaran dari pembangunan pasar pasar sebelumnya yang pembangunannya mengabaikan keinginan pedagang
5113575 mumpung pemkot belum memulai kami berinisiatif mencari investor karena ini kan zamannya keterbukaan
5113576 saya tidak ingin pembangunan berikutnya ada sengketa dengan pt ka
5113577 saya bilang ke direktur pt ka ini persoalan penyelamatan pedagang pasar turi karena tanahnya milik pt ka kami ingin mengembangkan beliau setuju apalagi ada direktur pengelolan aset yang penting nanti kami membayar sewanya
5113578 kalau nanti dibangun lagi kemungkinan pasar turi akan dikelola oleh holding nya pemkot pt surya karya utama sku
5113579 pemkot tetap menggandeng pt ka karena jika bertumpu di lahan milik pemkot sendiri akan sangat sempit untuk sebuah pusat grosir
5113580 begitu bapak bambang dh red jadi wali kota pada 2003 beliau memerintahkan semua pasar dipelajari dan ditingkatkan salah satunya pasar turi
5113581 polanya mulai terbaca sekarang metodenya melarang seluruh pedagang masuk ke pasar turi sekalipun di stan yang tidak terbakar

5113689 my co workers and i had proposed models in which meltwater gets to the bed when a lake fills a crevasse thus driving the crack down
5113690 sarah das and her colleagues have observed it more than niagara plunging into greenland
5113691 over wide areas the ice sheet and outlet glaciers speed up in response to the surface melt reaching the bed and lubricating the flow
5113692 it will remain difficult to make realistic prediction of the evolution of the ice sheet in a warmer climate
5113693 calving of an iceberg changes the balance of forces near the front causing the glacier to speed up
5113694 calving rates are generally greater in summer than winter and we expect them to increase in a warming climate which our observations over the last several years as temperatures warm in greenland seem to confirm
5113695 there should be more melt higher on the ice sheet and therefore more lakes form ing inland
5113696 if these lakes cause fractures to the bed in regions not currently being lubricated this could be significant

5113785 i think the industry committee played an important role in focusing on the need for canada to maintain the space industry and to have the industry suit canadas needs as opposed to almost letting it slip through our fingers and become militarized by being taken over by a u s defence manufacturer
5113786 it would have been ironic for example with the melting of the polar ice cap and the disputed arctic terrain to have our satellite fall into the hands of the americans who are one of the key countries disputing our border in the arctic
5113787 the u k and australian governments had negotiated extensions for their companies but our government harpers government has done absolutely nothing to stand up for canadian industry hes cozying up to george bush he should be standing up to george bush and saying its not fair to discriminate against canadian companies
5113788 were a defence partner with the americans were a security partner with the americans were a trade partner with the americans we do not deserve to be treated as second class partners when it comes to the aerospace industry
5113789 our view is that the space sector in canada is very important it provides us with all kinds of capabilities that are necessary for us in areas such as environmental protection national sovereignty even national defence this technology plays an important role in ensuring the safety of our troops and is a vital capability it also creates a very good return on canadian public investment in terms of leveraging other investments from the public sector and job creation
5113790 the government of canada continues to seek solutions for industry which would be consistent with canadian laws and values and which would attempt to minimize to the greatest extent possible legal risks and costs for both industry and the government of canada
5113791 i was once minister of trade in the chr tien government and not only in trade but also defence so ive had some experience in dealing with that and its a rough road it doesnt matter what the colour of the government is in ottawa its a very tough challenge dealing with it
5113792 i think canada should be proud of it successes but always vigilant because as we see in the space industry without vision without government leadership and without the dollars to actually develop the technology the industry can quickly flounder
5113793 it is an important canadian capability that is waning we are far below the average g8 spending on space and slipping behind weve had a number of very high profile achievements recently such as the canadarm2 that is on the international space station weve had dextre go up weve had the phoenix project that has a piece of canadian technology on mars right now
5113794 but all of these are basically the grand finales of these programs when you actually see it on tv going up into space it means the program is over essentially but theres nothing else coming through the pipe
5113795 i have written to the minister calling on him to act now and appoint a permanent head to the csa because we are lacking leadership at the csa and we have been for three years
5113796 theres no single guiding policy and the result of that is that a lot of people in government and in industry are standing around with their hands in heir pockets waiting for the government to decide in which direction we want to go and theyre left to reading tea leaves to find out what is the priority of the canadian government
5113797 the risk is that without very clear rules of the road and international cooperation space will become another militarized frontier that it will be a source of conflict rather than cooperation right now the rules of the road are not clear and we dont want to have a survival of the fittest in space where the most powerful dominate
5113798 canada is trusted in the u s as a trade defence and security partner and is respected by the world as a multilateralist
5113799 we should be in a really good position to compete globally with both the eu countries and with the u s every industrialized country with a defence or aerospace industry recognizes a need to validate its industry through its own procurement that has always been the case in canada too
5113800 completely ignoring the industrial benefits side of defence and aerospace procurement
5113801 theyre supposed to give 75 per cent of the value of the contract back to canada but so far we dont know how much the in service support is worth how much is 70 per cent of zero we dont know what the absolute number is because we dont know how much the maintenance is going to be worth over 20 years
5113802 we dont only want to change the screws on the airplane or change a little thing we also want to find solutions to make it fly longer and better it involves brain it involves knowledge it involves research and development and it involves engineers its much more than just bolts and screws
5113803 when a company develops those solutions then you can export that knowledge and you can do the same work on the fleets of another country for example so thats where your industry gets wind beneath its wings
5113804 we hold their hands then let them go thats when our tears begin to flow
5113805 as we die so die the righteous and what benefit do they reap for their deeds 7 behold even as we so do they die in grief and darkness and what have they more than we from henceforth we are equal 8 and what will they receive and what will they see for ever behold they too have died and henceforth for ever shall they see no light
5113806 nevertheless they perished and became as though they had not been and their spirits descended into sheol in tribulation
5113807 in our troubled days we have toiled laboriously and experienced every trouble and met with much evil and been consumed and have become few and our spirit small

5113810 let each individual of you pasture the sheep henceforward and everything that i shall command you that do ye 60 and i will deliver them over unto you duly numbered and tell you which of them are to be destroyed and them destroy ye
5113811 observe and mark everything that the shepherds will do to those sheep for they will destroy more of them than i have commanded them 62 and every excess and the destruction which will be wrought through the shepherds record namely how many they destroy according to my command and how many according to their own caprice record against every individual shepherd all the destruction he effects 63 and read out before me by number how many they destroy and how many they deliver over for destruction that i may have this as a testimony against them and know every deed of the shepherds that i may comprehend and see what they do whether or not they abide by my command which i have commanded them 64 but they shall not know it and thou shalt not declare it to them nor admonish them but only record against each individual all the destruction which the shepherds effect each in his time and lay it all before me
5113812 take those seventy shepherds to whom i delivered the sheep and who taking them on their own authority slew more than i commanded them

5113881 on august 14th 2008 warner brothers announced that the release of harry potter and the half blood prince would be delayed until july 17th 2009
5113882 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

5113958 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5113959 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5113960 we are waiting for more support from other countries because this is not a war between russian and georgia its a war between civilization and barbarism

5113977 there is a chilling effect of a cease and desist letter or a legal threat that claims an aspect of a bloggers work could lead to liability even when those claims are not well grounded
5113978 in the developed world bloggers can be punished through lawsuits
5113979 as blogging expands and more people are aware of it
5113980 if youre slandering you can be sued whether you have a blog or not
5113981 youre not immune to defamation charges just because youre a citizen speaking your mind
5113982 if youre going to be responsible enough to manage a site where people post such things you should be able to detect when things are defamatory and take them down
5113983 the problem is that technology is outpacing the ethical responsibilities people havent thought through the ethics of all this

5114000 entendemos que en este momento los precios de los combustibles y especialmente de la gasolina est n muy altos y esto tiene que ver especialmente con lo que pasa con los precios internacionales por eso el gobierno va a hacer un esfuerzo especial
5114001 este fondo revitalizado va a ir en auxilio de las personas
5114002 esperamos que en esta nueva etapa operatoria del fondo esto va a tener un impacto de un cr dito de en torno a 40 significa que las personas van a pagar por cada litro de bencina alrededor de 40 menos
5114003 las situaciones especiales requieren de an lisis especiales por lo tanto el gobierno no se cierra ni descarta ninguna alternativa
5114004 vamos a seguir trabajando y ciertamente no descartamos a priori ninguna de las alternativas que pueda echar una manito al bolsillo de las personas

5114007 o sea estamos multiplicando por 3 25 y si es necesario va a haber m s para explicarlo sencillo este proyecto ingresa ma ana es de discusi n inmediata y si se aprueba las bencinas debieran bajara a lo menos en 50 apunt
5114008 aqu hay una inyecci n de us 200 millones cuyo objetivo es que cuando cada chileno o chilena meta 5 litros de bencina saldr 50 o 45 pesos menos por litro si el petr leo sigue subiendo habr otra inyecci n
5114009 pagar menos no le importa el color del gato le interesa que cace ratones lo importante es que la bencina baje
5114010 no descartamos a priori ninguna de las alternativas que pueda ayudarle al bolsillo de las personas
5114011 vamos a hacer un esfuerzo muy significativo de us 200 millones entendemos que es un asunto delicado para las familias
5114012 vamos a potenciar un mecanismo que estaba en operaci n pero obviamente estamos conscientes que en los mercados internacionales han estado subiendo mucho los precios de las gasolinas mucho el precio del petr leo y di sel y esto tiene mucho impacto
5114013 las situaciones especiales requieren de an lisis especiales por lo tanto el gobierno no se cierra ni descarta ninguna alternativa
5114014 vamos a seguir trabajando y ciertamente no descartamos a priori ninguna de las alternativas que pueda ayudarle al bolsillo de las personas
5114015 lo que significa que las personas van a pagar por cada litro de bencina alrededor de 40 pesos menos
5114016 se va a producir un cambio sustantivo en la capacidad que tenga este fondo de influir en el precio
5114017 y esperamos que est aprobado en el curso de la semana
5114018 el ministro de hacienda junto con el comit pol tico han informado la disposici n del gobierno para abrir el di logo en relaci n al tema del impuesto a los combustibles pero de marzo en adelante
5114019 si el petr leo sigue subiendo habr otra inyecci n
5114020 lo importante es que la bencina baje ahora el instrumento que se utiliza es el m s adecuado t crees que a la gente le importa si es por esta v a o por esta otra v a lo que le importa es pagar menos por bencina porque est muy cara
5114021 pero tambi n es importante no perder de vista que hay partes importante de nuestra sociedad en especial los consumidores de bienes importados que se benefician y lo que est ocurriendo ahora es que con un d lar m s bajo en parte estamos contrarrestando este efecto de precios internacionales m s altos
5114022 las personas van a pagar por cada litro de bencina alrededor de 40 pesos menos de lo que habr an pagado sin la operatoria
5114023 las situaciones especiales requieren de an lisis especiales y por lo tanto el gobierno no se cierra ni descarta ninguna alternativa
5114024 precio del petr leo sube en un 30 a 40 los costos directos
5114025 entendemos que en este momento los precios de los combustibles especialmente de la gasolina est n muy altos y esto tiene que ver especialmente con lo que pasa con los precios internacionales por eso el gobierno va a hacer un esfuerzo especial y un aporte de us 200 millones al fepc y este fondo revitalizado va a ir en auxilio de las personas que por estos d as por ejemplo se van a ir de vacaciones y van a usar el auto intensivamente
5114026 en esta nueva etapa operatoria del fondo esto va a tener un impacto de un cr dito en torno a los 40 estos ignifica que las personas van a pagar por cada litro de bencinas alrededor de 40 pesos menos de lo que habr an pagado sin este sistema
5114027 las situaciones especiales requieren de an lisis especiales y por lo tanto el gobierno no se cierra ni descarta ninguna alternativa
5114028 en estos momentos lo que vamos a hacer es potenciar un mecanismo que ya estaba en operaciones y al cual le vamos a dar a n m s fuerza con este incremento adicional de us 200 millones pero obviamente estamos conscientes de que en los mercados internacionales han estado subiendo mucho los precios de las bencinas mucho el precio del petr leo del diesel y esto tiene un impacto y por lo tanto vamos a seguir trabajando y ciertamente no descartamos a priori ninguna de las alternativas que pueda
5114029 4 remember ye the law of moses my servant which i commanded unto him in horeb for all israel with the statutes and judgments 5 behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord
5114030 27 and as it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment
5114031 27 for the son of man shall come in the glory of his father with his angels and then he shall reward every man according to his works 28 verily i say unto you there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom 1 and after six days jesus taketh peter james and john his brother and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart 2 and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his raiment was white as the light 3 and behold there appeared unto them moses and elias talking with him
5114032 if satan could have gotten a hold of moses body he could have used it as a tool for worship
5114033 satan new gods plan of using moses and wanted to destroy his body to prevent gods plan
5114034 there is no indication in the old testament that moses is the 2 nd witness satan would not know that was gods plan and wouldnt even know there would be 2 witnesses during the end times
5114035 well those are signs of his first coming but god wouldnt have a sign of his 2 nd coming before his first coming therefore enoch must be around for the 2 nd coming when it happens

5114069 why dont one of yall just work on different days
5114070 that was an unusually smooth trip wasnt it nothing like last week for sure
5114071 i wanted to tell you after our trip last week i called publix and spoke with their manager for several minutes about not having any five pounds of flour stocked
5114072 no i called and we had a good talk about the flour he promised me theyd do a better job keeping it stocked i also told him how the attitude around there was bad last week
5114073 hey grandma do you remember when i was younger what you used to tell me quite a lot from the time i was around ten until i was well into my teenage years about getting old
5114074 you used to tell me very emphatically that if you ever started acting like a meddling old woman who gets herself out of sorts over stupid things and makes a habit out of complaining about trivial imperfections in service that you wanted me to tell you without being mean about it you said you never wanted to be like that
5114075 but i have always used five pound bags of flour i told that there manager if he couldnt keep em stocked wed just shop somewhere else i told him good
5114076 grandma you cant go raising hell every time a store doesnt have bananas that ripen quickly enough or the employees dont tapdance over to you and offer to rake your front yard its just not a good thing to do
5114077 if we dont make a stand and get businesses to do right theyll keep on giving us a bad deal
5114078 make a stand you make a stand for human rights or freedom of religion you dont make a stand over bags of flour
5114079 they should keep that in stock its important and its important to let businesses know when they let you down
5114080 all right pretty lady you put all your weight on me and were gonna get you to your seat
5114081 that was an incredibly sweet and thoughtful thing you just did

5114086 the secret of life is enjoying the passage of time
5114087 using your self knowledge to plumb the depths of your life experiences to improve your writing
5114088 i cant believe this place doesnt even have five pound bags of flour whats publix coming to
5114089 i dont want any other size bag i want a dang five pound bag of flour
5114090 okay okay jeez grandma just settle down all right its all fine lets just finish looking down this aisle
5114091 and look at the rest of the place it looks like they havent restocked in forever and the attitude around here is bad too i dont like the direction this place is going at all
5114092 if my granddad asks if you have plans later for gods sake say yes or youll be pruning the trees in his front yard

5114100 there will be a lot more apples being used for cider and juice production
5114101 we have three orchards in this area and four farms near rochester in sodus and they really got hit bad out there about a month ago
5114102 we are not as close to the lake as some growers and it totally missed us we have just dodged a bullet
5114103 the biggest place where we got wiped out was the fresh fruit apples
5114104 i have 30 000 bushels that we will be able to sell in stores and markets of the fresh fruit apples
5114105 its terrible because you are wiped out until next season
5114106 theres usually a late frost in spring which can hurt the orchards and then you always have to worry about the hail
5114107 the apple crop around utica and the mohawk valley is going to be very good and there should be quality apples around for folks
5114108 if people have any environmental concerns theres a much smaller carbon footprint from a local grower
5114109 if hail hits an apple it doesnt necessarily mean the apple is destroyed
5114110 it just means that you cant sell it at the retail level
5114111 jesus was baptized which means we have to be baptized to go to heaven
5114112 we should sin more so gods grace will be even greater abound
5114113 so many of us as were were baptized into his death
5114114 therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death
5114115 since saul was already saved why does the bible have the phrase referring to the past event that already happened
5114116 it should have said having called on the name of the lord
5114117 31 and they said believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house 32 and they spake unto him the word of the lord and to all that were in his house and he took them the same hour of the night and washed their stripes and was baptized he and all his straightway
5114118 we dont know how old the people are in his house therefore anybody can get baptized including infants
5114119 13 then cometh jesus from galilee to jordan unto john to be baptized of him 16 and jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and lighting upon him
5114120 5 and there went out unto him all the land of judea and they of jerusalem and were all baptized of him in the river of jordan confessing their sins
5114121 38 and he commanded the chariot to stand still and they went down both into the water both philip and the eunuch and he baptized him
5114122 we baptize you in the name of the father the son and the holy ghost
5114123 28 saying did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach and behold ye have filled jerusalem with your doctrine and intend to bring this mans blood upon us
5114124 18 and this did she many days but paul being grieved turned and said to the spirit i command thee all of these verses are examples of the authority of jesus lets look back at matthew 28 19 and the preceding verse 18 and jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth 19go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost
5114125 you see that a person is justified by works and not by faith grk pistis belief alone
5114126 8for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god 9not of works lest any man should boast
5114127 6and if by grace then is it no more of works otherwise grace is no more grace but if it be of works then it is no more grace otherwise work is no more work
5114128 18yea a man may say thou hast faith and i have works shew me thy faith without thy works and i will shew thee my faith by my works
5114129 a man is going to question our faith if we dont have works to back it up
5114130 24ye see then how that by works a man is justified and not by faith only
5114131 however before god belief is what saves us not our works
5114132 27labour not for the meat which perisheth but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath god the father sealed 28then said they unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of god 29jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of god that ye believe on him whom he hath sent
5114133 so then my beloved even as you all have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling for it is god who works in you both to will and to work for his good pleasure
5114134 christ loved the church and gave himself up for her that he might sanctify her having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word
5114135 not everyone who says unto me lord lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but he that does the will of my father in heaven
5114136 faith if it have not works is dead in itself
5114137 what good is it my brothers if someone says he has faith but does not have works can that faith save him
5114138 you see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone
5114139 27labour not for the meat which perisheth but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath god the father sealed 28then said they unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of god 29jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of god that ye believe on him whom he hath sent
5114140 36he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life and he that believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abideth on him
5114141 12wherefore my beloved as ye have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling 13for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure
5114142 21not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven 22many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works 23and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity
5114143 40and this is the will of him that sent me that every one which seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and i will raise him up at the last day
5114144 wherefore god also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name 10that at the name of jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth 11and that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father
5114145 30and brought them out and said sirs what must i do to be saved 31and they said believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house 32and they spake unto him the word of the lord and to all that were in his house 33and he took them the same hour of the night and washed their stripes and was baptized he and all his straightway
5114146 but if we died with christ we believe that we shall also live with him
5114147 he that believes and is baptized shall be saved but he that disbelieves shall be condemned

5114241 the final stage is recognition that a leap does not defy gravity unresolved problems remain unresolved in the transfer of skills and practices the recognition that an intuitive leap cannot defy gravity matters more largely because it corrects a frequently held fantasy about technology transfer this is that importing a procedure will clarify a murky problem more often the technical import like any immigrant will bring with it its own problems

5114247 la guardia civil considera que s lo hay dos causas para realizar salidas urgentes aquellas en las que el interno necesita asistencia hospitalaria y aquellas en las que se trata de un caso de urgencia vital actualmente s lo realizan stas ltimas por no tener medios humanos suficientes para hacer los dos
5114248 esto supone que si un interno se rompe un brazo como no corre riesgo su vida puede permanecer hasta dos d as a la espera de ser trasladado a un centro m dico por el acompa amiento policial obviamente se le atiende en la enfermer a del centro penitenciario pero de forma meramente paliativa porque no hay medios especializados para m s
5114249 nos ha pasado que nos encontramos con que un preso tiene una sobredosis de droga y que ante la imposibilidad de trasladarlo a un hospital tenemos que ser nosotros mismos los funcionarios y el personal m dico los que tenemos que establecer una guardia para comprobar cada media hora que sigue respirando
5114250 si a esto se une que los traslados para consulta m dica se han reducido tambi n mucho por el mismo motivo se podr n imaginar el sobreesfuerzo que esto supone para los funcionarios y tambi n para los propios reclusos que continuamente pierden sus citas m dicas por problema ajenos a ellos
5114251 generalmente nos dicen que s lo pueden llevar entre 4 y 6 y el resto queda pendiente para otra ocasi n pero esto es un gran trastorno porque se les ha tenido que pedir cita en ocasiones se les han hecho pruebas cuyos resultados van a conocer etc de todas maneras lo peor es la lista de espera que se va generando y que no hace sino crecer y crecer
5114252 porque los m dicos est n cumpliendo con sus obligaciones y los funcionarios tambi n pero por una cuesti n ajena como es la del acompa amiento policial todo ese trabajo no est fructificando y los traslados suspendidos se acumulan haciendo que todos lo que los nuevos se sigan retrasando m s

5114285 when you ask god you rise to his level you must ask god to ask god is perfectly all right it is your duty to ask god words must be said and the thoughts must correspond to the words it is true enough that the divinity knows all but he requires that true words be said the mother may know that to maintain life the child requires food but milk is given only when the child asks for it
5114286 you mean prayers work he can only give us what according to him we need or what we deserve is it not will the lord like to give us all that we ask for in our prayers to him under such circumstances what is the use of prayer
5114287 be constant in prayer and give charity and worship with the worshipful and seek help with patience and prayer though it is indeed hard except for the humble
5114288 feel that you are a hundred per cent dependent on god he will look after you and save you from harm and injury when you go to bed offer thankful homage to him for guiding and guarding you throughout the day activity must be dedicated to god the highest good then it will provide health of body and mind

5114305 why use these awkward lines like and the world will receive his blessings
5114306 obama is correct in saying that the world is ready for someone like him a messiah like figure charismatic and glib the bible calls that leader the antichrist and it seems apparent that the world is now ready to make his acquaintance

5114311 while strands of christian especially protestant theology have adopted the more rationalistic stance of plato throughout history many theologians have affirmed the aesthetic as a central medium of both revelation and truth particularly neoplatonic theologians such as bonaventure this emphasis on the aesthetics has received renewed interest in contemporary theology due to the work of hans urs von balthasar jean luc marion and jeremy begbie at the core of these theological aesthetics or aesthetic theologies is a rejection of the rationalistic axiom which assumes that truth is communicated only in cognitive propositions rather there is a mode of truth telling that is unique to the aesthetic or affective that cannot be reduced to cognitive propositions appeal is often made to the liturgy itself as an example of this particularly the rich eucharistic liturgies of orthodox and catholic traditions where all of the senses are engaged in order to communicate the truth of grace theological aesthetics has entailed a double development both a renewed interest in arts and a retooling of theology in response to aesthetic reality

5114317 was the first modern muslim to suggest that hindus and muslims constituted two separate nations in india
5114318 the command of god was that the mussalmans could not be friends of non muslims
5114319 wants to see the mussalmans only as mussalmans we have learnt all our policies from religion we believe that every ideal which is derived from any source other than the quran is patent heresy this applies to politics also
5114320 the khilafat movement was an assertion of the muslim identity in india
5114321 because the movement itself was basically anchored in religion it had the ultimate effect of intensifying the indian muslims loyalty to islam in strengthening this loyalty the khilafat movement had significantly contributed towards the subsequent muslim assertion of a separate religio political identity under the pakistan plank
5114322 there can be no peace or tranquility in this land if we the muslims are duped into a hindu dominated federation where we cannot be the masters of our own destiny and the captains of our own souls
5114323 we do not inter dine we do not inter marry our national customs and calendars even our diet and dress are different
5114324 while burma is being separated from hindoostan it remains a mystery to us why pakistan is to be forced into the indian federation the choice now facing the muslim community is between reconstruction in asia and redestruction in india
5114325 it is true that the ground for muslim separatism was prepared when islam entered the subcontinent and all efforts to provide a bridge between hindus and muslims failed for practical purposes however the gradual crystallisation and realisation of the idea of pakistan is related to the period of british rule
5114326 it is not permissible for a mussalman to be under the leadership of a non muslim whether wholly or partly

5114343 because of the increasing of lawlessness the love of the greater number will cool off
5114344 in the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here for men will be lovers of themselves lovers of money self assuming haughty blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful disloyal having no natural affection not open to any agreement slanderers without self control fierce without love of goodness betrayers headstrong puffed up with pride lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of god having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power wicked men and impostors will advance from bad to worse
5114345 im a biology student in college and have yet to read a textbook that says there is irrefutable evidence that we come from apes
5114346 that well fits events since 1914 as there has been a huge increase in the distresses from such calamities
5114347 what does putting money in the tip jar have to do with morality i thought that was charity
5114348 uh no those who were sinning by fornication homosexuality and beastiality during biblical times were destroyed ever heard of noahs ark or sodom and gomorrah
5114349 the fact that the planets orbit the sun similarly to electrons orbiting the nucleus of a molecule is remarkable
5114350 some fundamentalists claim that creationism rather than evolution explains pre human history
5114351 creationism has done more harm to serious notions of belief than anything in modern history
5114352 have they found any solid evidence that shows there was a transition from apes to humans somewhere in the timeline no they havent
5114353 there occurred a war in the heavens michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon and his angels fought against them however they did not prevail and there was no room for them in heaven the great dragon was cast down that ancient snake known as devil and satan and his angels were also cast down with him
5114354 what started us looking at this issue is the fact that senator mccain has declared his intention to maintain us forces in iraq for a hundred years
5114355 that means that mccain wants to control babylon for at least a century
5114356 we believe that the end times is near based on the pattern of wars earthquakes and other strange phenomena weve been witnessing since the start of the new millennium
5114357 given that it may be imminent the person who controls babylon must be the antichrist since obama wants to get out of iraq he cant be the antichrist either concluded jenkins
5114358 what clinched it for us was that the name mihai means who is like the lord
5114359 as far as were concerned that was enough it means that mccain might easily pretend to be the redeemer
5114360 many people think that the antichrist will be a evil seeming leader but in fact the bible tells us that he will be charming
5114361 and when you stand praying if you hold anything against anyone forgive him so that your father in heaven may forgive you your sins
5114362 the mothers soul should be the focus not the soul of the aborted baby

5114364 anyone who loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me anyone who loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me and anyone who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me
5114365 my son do not despise the chastening of the lord nor detest his correction for whom the lord loves he corrects just as a father the son in whom he delights
5114366 as many as i love i rebuke and chasten therefore be zealous and repent
5114367 this is the moment when the rise of the ocean began to slow
5114368 when was the last time that a presidential candidate was so cocky
5114369 for they receive and accept with pride their own works
5114370 a black man as president of the united states scares the hell out of me
5114371 blessed is he that waits and comes to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days
5114372 and i saw one of his heads as if it had been mortally wounded
5114373 for god so loved the world he gave his only begotten son jesus to die on the cross for our sins so that we may not die but have everlasting life in the house of the father
5114374 for if god is for us who can be against us
5114375 all these things must occur they are as birthing pains
5114376 i am secretly a muslim terrorist dark lord i thank you for giving me the power to destroy gods nation the united states by forcing its population through use of the liberal activist judges to undergo forced abortions forced homosexual relations and veganism
5114377 if rain threatens the opening or closing ceremony beijing officials say they will set up several banks of rocket launchers outside the city to seed threatening clouds and cause them to release their rain before it reaches the capital
5114378 being caught up in the clouds with our lord jesus and taken to heaven
5114379 the lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of an archangel and with the trumpet call of god and the dead in christ will rise first then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air
5114380 therefore you also be ready for the son of man is coming at an hour you do not expect
5114381 and it will occur after the initial attack on israel you know the one where the army was ten times ten the size of israel its in various books in the bible
5114382 i am against you o gog chief prince of meshech and tubal
5114383 persia cush and put will be with them all with shields and helmets also gomer with all its troops and beth togarmah from the far north with all its troops the many nations with you
5114384 invade a land that has recovered from war whose people were gathered from many nations to the mountains of israel which had long been desolate
5114385 then those who live in the towns of israel will go out and use the weapons for fuel and burn them up secondary theory would be guns as the combustible nature of them and or some kind of weapon having to do with black gold
5114386 is a special kind of wood used for coke breakers it is stronger than steel is very elastic and it burns better than coal
5114387 i will display my glory among the nations and all the nations will see the punishment i inflict and the hand i lay upon them from that day forward the house of israel will know that i am the lord their god
5114388 the sovereign lord says i will now bring jacob back from captivity and will have compassion on all the people of israel and i will be zealous for my holy name
5114389 prophesy to these bones and say to them dry bones hear the word of the lord
5114390 prophesy to the breath prophesy son of man and say to it this is what the sovereign lord says come from the four winds o breath and breathe into these slain that they may live
5114391 10 so i prophesied as he commanded me and breath entered them they came to life and stood up on their feet a vast army
5114392 son of man these bones are the whole house of israel
5114393 let us destroy them as a nation that the name of israel be remembered no more

5114396 and i saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly would was healed and all the world wondered after the beast
5114397 this is really starting to seal the deal for me i keep having dreams that obama is the antichrist im sick of him and his blind followers how can one man cure the world of all its woes
5114398 you have to fight on their level because thats all they understand
5114399 and they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast and they worshipped the beast saying who is like unto the beast who is able to make war with him
5114400 spread democracy through force and obtain a strangle hold monopoly on religion
5114401 do you people even try to actually use your minds and not just your hearts when it comes to religion
5114402 also last i checked we do not go around mocking people or tearing them down for an opinion
5114403 on here we are not discussing the policies or political values of either candidate we are discussing how and why obama fits the characteristics and profile for the antichrist
5114404 he does not want world peace nor does he want anything remotely close to that he wants to conquer kill destroy and rule with his own power at the top
5114405 world peace however that the bible prescribes to that the ac will establish will exist because it must without it the ac would not be able to rule the world or command the biggest army ever seen on this planet one world government one world religion one world monetary system etc that cannot happen in the worlds current state so in order for him to acheive ultimate power and dominion over man he must unite the countries
5114406 who is like unto the beast who is able to make war with him
5114407 cub still not going to diginfy you other than to say it must be a very small life you have there

5114415 when he was 12 years old they found him in the temple in the city of chicago arguing the finer points of community organization with the prophet jeremiah and the elders
5114416 i personally would want to see our tragic history or the tragic elements of our history acknowledged
5114417 judge not that ye be not judged for with what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged and with the measure which ye measure with it shall be measured to you again and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye but considerest not the beam that is in thy own eye or how wilt thou say to thy brother let me pull out the mote out of thy eye and behold a beam is in thy own eye thou hypocrite first cast out the beam out of thy own eye and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brothers eye

5114425 hunters need to push a new public image based on deeper traditions we are stewards of the land hunting on ground that we love collecting food for our families
5114426 people eat meat animals must be killed for people who choose to eat meat weve come a long way from the family farm because populations have exploded one can eat meat and still want an animal to be killed humanely and object to factory farms and their practices and condidtions yes this is how it was spelled in the post
5114427 lets face it some hunters just like to shoot things
5114428 some papers now make customers pay for extended obituaries or wedding and engagment again this misspelling was in the post photos maybe we should make the mighty hunters pay to put their egos in print and see how that goes

5114448 though this be madness yet there is method in it
5114449 the idea that a nation is essentially defined by a language and that conversely a common language means a common nationhood which is patently untrue for the greater part of human history and to a large extent even today
5114450 studies in the history of art vol 10 macedonia and greece in late classical and early hellenistic times
5114451 greek was rapidly becoming the language of government and big business
5114452 the lesson is clear the use of the greek language as a form of written expression does not by itself identify the ethnicity of a culture
5114453 as the macedonians settled the region following the expulsion of existing peoples they probably introduced their own customs and language s there is no evidence that they adapted any existing language even though they were now in contact with neighboring populations who spoke a variety of greek and non greek tongues
5114454 linguistic science has at its disposal a very limited quantity of macedonian words
5114455 the main evidence for macedonian existing as a separate language comes from a handful of late sources describing events in the train of alexander the great where the macedonian tongue is specifically mentioned
5114456 the evidence suggests that macedonian was distinct from the ordinary attic greek used as the language of the court and of diplomacy
5114457 what language did these macedones speak the name itself is greek in root and in ethnic termination the genealogy of eponymous ancestors which hesiod recorded has a bearing on the question of greek speech hesiod would not have recorded this relationship unless he had believed probably in the seventh century that the macedones were a greek speaking people the next evidence comes from persia at the turn of the sixth century the persians we conclude that the persians believed the macedonians to be speakers of greek finally in the latter part of the fifth century a greek historian hellanicus visited macedonia and modified hesiodus genealogy thus bringing macedon and his descendants firmly into the aeolic branch of the greek speaking family hesiod persia and hellanicus had no motive for making a false statement about the language of the macedonians who were then an obscure and not a powerful people their independent testimonies should be accepted as conclusive
5114458 having stayed in the extreme north they macedonians were unable to participate in the progressive civilization of the tribes which went further south and so when in the time of the persian wars they emerged in the horizon of the other greeks they appeared to them as non greek as barbarians
5114459 hammonds firm conclusion that the macedonians spoke a distinctive dialect of aeolic greek is unconvincing to me resting as it does on an interpretation of a bit of myth quoted by hellanicus who made aeolus the father of the legendary progenitor macedon
5114460 literary evidence and archeological evidence show that between 460 and 360 the standard of life in upper macedonia was at a primitive level and the area was remote from the orbit of greek trade and even from coastal macedonia with only two exceptions
5114461 these units were equal to those of the old kingdom
5114462 the handful of surviving genuine macedonian words not loan words from greek do not show the changes expected from a greek dialect and even had they changed at some point it is unlikely that they would have reverted to their original form
5114463 we may be sure that the greek language spread more rapidly among the inlet barbarians of the enlarged kingdom whose livelihood depended increasingly on their commercial relations with the greek speaking cities in their midst
5114464 pelasgic tyrsenoi bisaltae crestonians and edones had learnt to speak greek for they were diglossoi
5114465 upper macedonia was remote from the orbit of greek trade
5114466 macedonians from upper macedonia spoke west greek and some from the old kingdom spoke aeolic dialect known as macedonian dialect
5114467 as a question of method why would an area three hundred miles north of athens not colonized by athens use an attic dialect unless it were imported that is the attic dialect could hardly be native and its use is likely part of the process of hellenization to put the question differently if the native language of the macedonians is greek what is its macedonian dialect
5114468 as the language of the macedonian state and of the army was greek we may be sure that the subject peoples were bilingual diglottoi
5114469 they wanted the macedones to have their own esprit de corps and those of them who came from lower macedonia continued to speak the macedonian dialect among themselves and to address the king or a commander in that dialect as a sign of affection
5114470 diglossoi bilingual and that by itself speaks volume obviously there was another language in operation besides greek
5114471 overpowering his expressed intellectual preference for the greeks i e the greek part of his own nature
5114472 he used the only language in which his guards could be addressed
5114473 now xennias name at once shows him to be a macedonian since he was in ambiances entourage he was presumably a macedonian of superior status who spoke both standard greek and his native language he was the man who could be trusted to transmit ambiances message this clearly shows that the phalanx had to be addressed in macedonian if one wanted to be sure as ambiance certainly did that they would understand and almost equally interesting he did not address them himself as he and other commanders normally address soldiers who understood them nor did he sent a greek the suggestion is surely that macedonian was the language of the infantry and that greek was a difficult indeed a foreign language to them we may thus take it as certain that when alexander used macedonian in addressing his guards that too was because it was their normal language and because like ambiance he had to be sure he would be understood
5114474 not only his greek birth as has always being realized but the simple fact that he could not directly communicate with the macedonian soldiers
5114475 his alien culture and provenance were not only obvious in an accent it was a matter of a language

5114494 all people of faith christians jews muslims animists everyone know the same god
5114495 the difficult thing about any religion including christianity is that at some level there is a call to evangelize and proselytize theres the belief certainly in some quarters that if people havent embraced jesus christ as their personal savior theyre going to hell
5114496 obama doesnt believe he or anyone else will go to hell but hes not sure hell be going to heaven either
5114497 i dont presume to have knowledge of what happens after i die when i tuck in my daughters at night and i feel like ive been a good father to them and i see that i am transferring values that i got from my mother and that theyre kind people and that theyre honest people and theyre curious people thats a little piece of heaven
5114498 if we all register and vote we will have the first black president in the history of america

5114500 a passage that is so radical that its doubtful that our own defense department would survive its application

5114503 am i required in a democracy to conform my efforts in the political arena to his bloody notion of what is right with regard to the lives of tiny babies

5114518 for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord
5114519 but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord
5114520 but god commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us much more then being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him
5114521 whoever will call on the name of the lord will be saved
5114522 but hes risen from out of nowhere and women faint in his presence

5114540 in my estimation the oregon country has been considerably over rated in some respects the willamette valley is the principal country susceptible of farming and for this purpose the soil is very rich and handsomely situated but as a general thing the country is destitute of timber the timber used for farming purposes is principally fir though there is a considerable quantity of oak it is short and scrubby not much of it fit for rails the productions of oregon have also been overrated from the best information i could get concerning the wheat crops they would not average over fifteen bushels to an acre though it is true the last year was unfavorable with the right sort of farming 25 bushels may be raised to the acre on the average grass remains green all the winter in the valleys but i do not think we can raise much corn in this country the winter of 1845 was pleasant but the last winter was cold and there was a good deal of snow some of the cattle of the last emigrants which came into the valley poor died last winter the rainy season continues to the middle of april and sometimes till may it seldom rains during the summer
5114541 i am highly pleased with this country and so far as i can now say shall spend the remainder of my days in it it has assuredly the most healthy climate in the world many persons now here who have removed from state to state in search of health and found it not are now hearty and robust capable of performing any kind of labor grass has been very fine and abundant for the last six weeks when wheat is well put in you can safely count on 30 bushels an acre hemp tobacco and flax do well here it is a good country for sheep there is sufficient water power to carry on manufacturing to any extent i have built my house in a commanding situation and have a fine view of the country for ten miles around and it is quite refreshing on a warm summers day to feel the invigorating breeze from the cascade mountains we have a most excellent spring within sixty yards of our house near which we have made our garden i am convinced that this is as fine a country as can be found any man disposed to be industrious and who would be satisfied any where would be satisfied in this country
5114542 i arrived in the wallamette willamette valley on the 30th of september and my calculations are all defeated about oregon i found it a mean dried up and drowned country the yam hill is a small valley destitute of timber i soon got sick of this place and then went to the mouth of the columbia river i can give oregon credit for only one or two things and these are good health and plenty of salmon and indians as for the farming country there is none here wheat grows about the same as in illinois corn potatoes and garden vegetables cannot grow here without watering the nights are too cold here in summer the soil is not as good as in illinois the face of the country is hilly and high mountains covered with snow all summer and small valleys the mountains and hills are covered with the heaviest timber that i ever saw we have had a very hard winter here snow fell two feet deep and lay three weeks by reason of which hundreds of cattle have died of starvation the thermometer fell to three degrees above zero prairie grass here is the same as in illinois there is no timothy or clover mechanics are very numerous here of the ships that sailed from new york last april but one arrived and she was ice bound for 50 days in latitude 59 1 2 it is supposed the other has gone to her long home a united states man of war was recently wrecked at the mouth of the columbia money is very scarce here and they have a kind of currency here orders on stores and scrip they value property very high but if they would put things at cash prices they would be about the same as they are in the states oregon is rapidly filling up with young men but no girls of whom two thirds are dissatisfied and many would return to the states if they were able but the road is long and tedious and it is hard for families to get back my trip was pleasant until i got to the south pass after that the country was rugged and bad roads tell young men if they intend coming to oregon to drive no teams unless it is their own we were uninjured by the indians though they were very saucy they have no manners they worship idols and i saw one of their gods at the mouth of the river there is no society here except the camelities carmelites i shall return to the states next spring dont believe all that is said about oregon as many falsehoods are uttered respecting the country

5114577 to come and show us up were worse than they are
5114578 at the commencement of the very serious depression last year we were employing at pullman 5 816 men and paying out in wages there 305 000 a month
5114579 i canvassed the matter thoroughly with the manager of the works and instructed him to cause the men to be assured that the company would do everything in its power to meet the competition which was sure to occur because of the great number of large car manufacturers that were in the same condition and that were exceedingly anxious to keep their men employed
5114580 the result of this discussion was a revision in piecework prices which in the absence of any information to the contrary i supposed to be acceptable to the men under the circumstances
5114581 this result has not been accomplished merely by reduction in wages but the company has borne its full share by eliminating from its estimates the use of capital and machinery and in many cases going even below that and taking work at considerable loss notably the 55 long island cars which was the first large order of passenger cars let since the great depression and which was sought for by practically all the leading car builders in the country
5114582 i can only assure you that if this company now restores the wages of the first half of 1893 as you have asked it would be a most unfortunate thing for the men because there is less than sixty days of contract work in sight in the shops under all orders and there is absolutely no possibility in the present condition of affairs throughout the country of getting any more orders for work at prices measured by the wages of may 1893
5114583 to further benefit the people of pullman and vicinity we concentrated all the work that we could command at that point by closing our detroit shops entirely and laying off a large number of men at our other repair shops and gave to pullman the repair of all cars that could be taken care of there
5114584 also for the further benefit of our people at pullman we have carried on a large system of internal improvements have expended nearly 160 000 since august last in work which under normal conditions would have been spread over one or two years
5114585 there has been some complaint made about rents as to this i would say that the return to this company on the capital invested in the pullman tenements for the last year and the year before was 3 82 percent there are hundreds of tenements in pullman renting for from 6 to 9 per month and the tenants are relieved from the usual expenses of exterior cleaning and the removal of garbage which is done by the company

5114588 do fashions change in a bewildering way and a most expensive way to us manufacturers but they have a way of changing so radically that new goods may be wholly unsalable if they bear any resemblance to the dress goods in demand last year why simply because a woman who buys a new dress wants a pattern and a color wholly different from that of her last years frock in order that there may be no question as to its being a new frock she not only wants a different design but a very different one so that he or more probably she who runs may see that it is a new dress

5114617 and often nothing happens at all i told one timid colored woman that i was sure she thought much more about the neighbors than they did about her
5114618 dont believe what they say about negroes bringing down property values they often live in shabby houses because thats all they can get look at the nice houses on my own street do you think theyre worth any less than before white people take fright signs go up all round for sale if theyd wait theyd get their price if they sell in panic they lose but its their own prejudice theyre paying for a month later their house is worth what it used to be sometimes even more because of all the negroes who want to get a house

5114626 so i picked up some speed a stone hit me i am proud to this day that i had no weapon on me something told me to stop and something told me to go on they called out faster nigger faster and something told me no and something yes so i went faster
5114627 when i reached the big street there was a bus right there and i got in but before i even sat down every window on that side was broken i moved over out of the glass and every window on the other side was broken too the driver stopped the bus which was the last thing i wanted he sent for the police and they took our names but i didnt dare to give my right name because of my wife and children i got off the bus some long way off and sat down on the edge of the sidewalk for twenty five minutes trying to pull myself together then i got up but there was hardly any strength in my legs

5114694 once ive given them a new mission that we are going to proceed deliberatel in an orderly fashion out of iraq if they come to me and want to adjust tactics then i will certainly take their recommendations into consideration and i have to look at not just the situation in iraq but the fact that we continue to see al qaeda getting stronger in afghanistan and in pakistan we continue to see anti american sentiment fanned all cross the middle east and we are overstretched in a way that we do not have a strategic reserve at this point
5114695 it is indisputable that weve seen violence reduced in iraq thats a credit to our brave men and women in uniform the 1st cavalry of fort hood played an enormous role in pushing back al qaeda out of baghdad we honor their service but this is a tactical victory imposed upon a huge strategic blunder we contribute our entire foreign aid to latin america is 2 7 billion approximately what we spend in iraq in a week it is any surprise then that youve seen people like hugo chavez and countries like china move into the void because weve been neglectful of that
5114696 we have spent billions of dollars lost thousands of lives

5114700 i understand the frustration caused by our mistakes in this war i sympathize with the fatigue of the american people but i also know the toll a lost war takes on an army and a country it is the right road it is necessary and just
5114701 my friends the war will be over soon for all intents and purposes although the insurgency will go on for years and years and years but it will be handled by the iraqis not by us i think that clearly my fortunes have a lot to do with whats happening in iraq and im proud of that weve been in japan for 60 years weve been in south korea for 50 years or so that would be fine with me as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed

5114719 even as a kid i always knew i wanted to be an actress but i just didnt know how to pursue it especially in el paso i never had the courage to do it
5114720 she pulled her uncle to some offices so he could investigate where they had acting classes he thought it was very cute
5114721 i had a really good job too complete with a 401 k but i decided to leave it even though i knew that a career in acting was uncertain my parents thought i was crazy for giving up that steady paycheck
5114722 i know its just a matter of time before she becomes a star
5114723 i think thats when i became legitimate in peoples eyes even though i had done a ton of work on stage it didnt matter that i was busting my butt
5114724 i always get cast as the generic katy or suzie
5114725 its tough because im very proud of being bicultural and bilingual but for some reason casting directors dont see me as a latina they see me more as italian greek or lebanese
5114726 at first it felt like my career was over because i wouldnt be able to audition but the move pushed me more into independent filmmaking which has also been a dream of mine
5114727 i really admire her for taking a bold step like this
5114728 theres a whole new niche for short films and she came along at the right time
5114729 she has a knack for these smaller films and she likes to be in charge
5114730 shes just so positive about everything and failure is not part of her vocabulary
5114731 shes got such an energy and an attraction about her if you look at other celebrities they have that too she bounces back faster than anyone i know
5114732 with all of the rejection an actor has it almost seems like an impossible dream but each year you get further along im not a big name yet im not a regular on a series but i will get to that point
5114733 i never saw myself as a comedienne but it turns out that a lot of the work ive done is in comedy comedy is harder to do it almost has to be like a sixth sense
5114734 i would love to do a series of shorts in el paso also for the film festival circuit
5114735 i dont have a problem with it but thats like a curse in the movie business you never say your age you always say youre the age they need for the role i hope that changes
5114736 rumors a while back that jimmy was out of prison maybe in florida and that he was in the witness protection program in the program hell get housing and everything else he needs
5114737 involved fbi agents from all the offices that were in the region working nonstop in what was the largest manhunt ever that focused on el paso
5114738 when this happened the chagras were jet setting to vegas
5114739 one of their lawyers is the current mayor of las vegas they were high rollers
5114740 its ironic that the one who really caused the most trouble who did the most harm and was the most culpable is the one who has been released hes been in jail a long time one can only hope that hes come to terms with what happened
5114741 if he was in witness protection we probably wouldnt even have his alias
5114742 lou esper lees uncle masterminded the entry into his office on north mesa which was like a fortress back then so the two soldiers could get inside
5114743 a flashy lawyer is murdered in the crime infested border town of el paso texas
5114744 the producer called me and said they were writing this character for me
5114745 that woman is written incredibly delicious shes a middle aged latina who completely blows these women away because she doesnt fit stereotypes
5114746 she is so typical of a mother in law especially one who has a son and she thinks he can do no wrong
5114747 she has to come back maybe well see her come back protecting her son i dont think weve seen the end of her
5114748 shes a lot like marcia cross character bree van de kamp in that she will fight to the end to protect her family
5114749 shes quite the opposite of susan mayer played by teri hatcher susan is passive and kind of missing the boat until it hits her right in the face
5114750 every scene was so well written so on the money so precise and so well conceived
5114751 theyll tell me youre a no nonsense woman i love when you beat them at their game of gambling
5114752 hopefully we who some might call us pioneers that are still struggling in doing these kinds of roles will make it safe for them to write more characters like this
5114753 it comes from the shows like dynasty and melrose and it lends itself to a diversity of writing
5114754 it stands out because its risky especially for older women its an escape from reality
5114755 its like an adult o c i dont think the stories are that believable like i dont think my moms sleeping with one of my friends but i guess you never know its just fun to watch those things on the show
5114756 the mayor of houston city council people theyve all come up to me to talk about the show theyll say my wife loves the show and i tell them you love it too admit it males are watching the show too which is great
5114757 its one of the best shows ive seen in a while
5114758 people see me in a coma and they ask me what will happen
5114759 i would certainly love to come out of it and kick some more butt they should bring her back at the most inopportune time for gabrielle
5114760 one of your deepest fears is what is going on in the mind of your mother in law
5114761 does this old broad remember what i did and if she does what is she going to do with me

5114768 the reality is that for 15 years at least south ossetia and abkhazia have been independent in fact

5114773 he was working closely with justin smith both inside and outside
5114774 hes going to be a good quarterback for a long time
5114775 im disappointed i had a lot of family and friends here and i didnt give them a lot to cheer about
5114776 we just didnt get into any rhythm we didnt make any plays i probably held the ball too long and we made a lot of mental errors
5114777 weve been friends since 2005 when we both came out in the draft
5114778 and i just encouraged him and he encouraged me weve been buddies for a while now so its good to see him out there he played well tonight hopefully things work out for him
5114779 i was ready to run before i had the ball
5114780 its me i havent left you im well im fine im here
5114781 theres a lot of people i still care about here in the bay area
5114782 i love coming back to stanford although i didnt have a chance to go back this trip the bay area is familiar to me and i always liked the bay area
5114783 when i get that many runs i think just throw strikes and be aggressive
5114784 everything was working with that many runs just continue to pound the strike zone
5114785 every time we come here we get some crazy games
5114786 we start out good with the uribe home run and we took advantage of the guy not throwing strikes he was all over the place and when he tried to find the plate we didnt miss them
5114787 i was trying to do too much trying to be very detailed on every pitch and i let it get the best of me
5114788 we have a very good team in all aspects of the game
5114789 we can play defense hit and pitch and our bullpen is very good i think were doing a good job of bringing the same effort level every day
5114790 you come in with the same game plan read up on the pitchers check out the scouting report and thats baseball
5114791 he worked ahead in the count and moved the ball through the strike zone
5114792 he didnt straighten anything out he was sinking it stayed on the corners and was pretty good at it

5114799 after several weeks when obama suffered his worst two moments of the campaign and the republicans have been concentrating all their fire on him
5114800 well it is now 9 month and i have still not receiver any answers to the questions i posed to raul liive in this post on the skype forum
5114801 washington reuters barack obama will claim the democratic presidential nomination on tuesday after winning the support of a wave of uncommitted delegates and pushing rival hillary clinton to the verge of defeat
5114802 tonight we mark the end of one historic journey with the beginning of another
5114803 tonight i can stand before you and say that i will be the democratic nominee for president of the united states
5114804 i know this has nothing to do with the aclu but it has to be said
5114805 he wants to bring us all together and change how the government works
5114806 do you think things are more efficient when they are larger or smaller
5114807 do you think the government has shown that it works better when it is larger or smaller
5114808 and barack wants to make it bigger how is that going to make government more efficient

5114856 in saying that as a person of faith obama believes that things will work out and that we will get the president we need he may be picking up on the sovereignty of god whose ways are perfect but one hopes he understands that god in his sovereignty can visit catastrophe on a wayward people if we are spiritually unwise in our choice of leaders we may well get a spanking we need
5114857 mccain answers questions by telling stories obama answers like an academic i think people like storytellers better than professors they will like mccains simple yes and no responses obama tries to show he would be a good leader by recognizing nuance and complexity mccain tries to show he would be a good leader by being decisive
5114858 to grant that abortion is a moral issue but to duck when human life begins is at best inconsistent one would think it is vital no pun intended to think though exactly that question obamas unguarded line about not punishing a daughter of his with a child really hurt him in the pro life movement
5114859 obama has correctly refocused the abortion question on how women experience pregnancy and abortion for far too long the discussion has focused solely on fetuses as if they exist somehow independent of the women in whose bodies they reside
5114860 whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective
5114861 answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5114862 obama will be hammered by the religious right for that pay grade answer
5114863 specious obama has made that very determination in opening the law wide to the killing of the unborn
5114864 specifically says that neither biologists nor doctors nor theologians can agree upon the moral status of the fetus
5114865 absolute certainty that the woman herself does have moral status then the conservative thing to do is to protect the womans interests first
5114866 still does not answer the question of what to do when there is a conflict with the rights of the woman
5114867 if he believes in human rights at the moment of conception then he ought to be against embryonic stem cell research ivf and even the so called rhythm method
5114868 which has the effect of timing intercourse not only to prevent conception but also to allow conception at a time when the fertilized egg will drop into a uterus that is not at the right time of month for implantation
5114869 evaded the question of whether he will or will not continue to support embryonic stem cell research as long as the scientists say it is necessary
5114870 odd not to ask it after all if you are going to talk to someone about religion youd be interested to know their thoughts about the central figure in their religion
5114871 is why there were not representatives from other faith communities who are also voting this is a multi religious nation
5114872 personal testimony and scripture citation are both treasured by evangelicals
5114873 mccains knowledge and strong stance for what is just and right he also expressed a sense of humor that i have not seen before

5114892 the title suggests i am saying people should stay together
5114893 its more that i am saying dont leave the marriage for the wrong reasons
5114894 there are definitely emotional health and quality of life benefits that can accrue from a long marriage
5114895 but the conventional view of marriage doesnt bring that to us
5114896 theres a false assumption from movies and novels that there is some breakthrough moment but it is over emphasized
5114897 its almost never as palpable as a hollywood story line so much of what is done in marriage therapy is getting a couple to work on new solutions to an old problem
5114898 the underlying assumption is we know each other so well
5114899 thats baloney we are endlessly complex and always changing once romance wears off we tend to block the complicated places within ourselves those places where we are most scared in that way boredom is sort of dynamic self protection
5114900 after lots and lots of years of working with couples you can develop some good ideas on what people can do to get along better
5114901 but where couples succeed is when they ask wait we can get along better but whats the point those couples are asking why is it worth doing the eight resolutions they can get to a deeper level and grow

5114918 she hasnt really been the subject of a negative campaign since late february when the obama folks decided they had the nomination locked up and started to play it safe

5114931 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5114932 it was very surprising that these subjects would still have cells floating in their blood so long afterward
5114933 the antibodies that we isolated are remarkable antibodies they grab onto the virus very tightly and they virtually never fall off
5114934 that allows them to kill the 1918 virus with extreme potency meaning it takes a very small amount of antibody
5114935 the thought is the first influenza that you see during life is the one that you have the best immunity to
5114936 if we can learn the rules about how these antibodies work we may be able to design antibodies to lots of other viruses
5114937 this study tells us that human beings can make long lasting immune responses to bird influenza

5114943 obamas trip was a little rah rah for me even but it shows he can connect with a lot of people and we need connecting
5114944 i know obama supports the troops too but hes not as much of a military supporter
5114945 i agree with a lot of the reasons we went into iraq but not all of them being there and seeing the people makes me think we should be there and help get them to a better place
5114946 i dont think whoever is elected will really change the economy

5114949 when i was in prison in vietnam i like other of my fellow pows was offered early release by my captors most of us refused because we were bound to our code of conduct which said those who had been captured the earliest had to be released the soonest my friend everett alvarez a brave american of mexican descent had been shot down years before i was and had suffered for his country much more and much longer than i had to leave him behind would have shamed us
5114950 mr gregory andrea mitchell thats a pretty clear contrast ms andrea mitchell oh absolutely and you know there was the crisp immediate forceful response by john mccain clearly in a comfort zone because he was with his base and barack obama taking a risk in going there but seeing an opportunity and a much more nuanced approach the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because that what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama mr gregory right ms mitchell he seemed so well prepared
5114951 no it was something more extreme and i think more important john mccain is the single most prepared person to be president in my lifetime and i aint young didnt you vote for jfk ed im not that old but you did go to college when he was in office okay okay dont rub it in last night mccain exhibited a grasp of the issues and an ability to communicate them extempore in a concise manner that were exceptional unlike the frequently bumbling bush and the evasive obama he knew precisely what to say on the big issues georgia radical islam energy he puts to mind the legendary presidents of a more distant past teddy roosevelt truman eisenhower and carries with him a pride to be american that surpasses even reagan for me because it is fraught with that personal history we all know

5115003 will not in itself change the everyday lives of the men women and children whose rights it champions
5115004 for this we need the political commitment of states international cooperation and the support and good will of the public at large to create and implement a range of intensely practical programmes designed and undertaken in consultation with indigenous peoples themselves
5115005 i observe with concern the human rights violations suffered by members of the charco la pava community such as arbitrary displacement from their lands loss of housing and destruction of agricultural crops and other abuses such as the excessive use of force and detaining of members of the community that have opposed the construction of the hydroelectric project including women and children
5115006 there are around a million indigenous people in colombia belonging to more than 80 different indian american groups with over 60 separate languages nearly all of these groups have been victims of forced displacement or are threatened by it as a result of the internal armed conflict
5115007 in many cases losing their territory and moving into the entirely foreign environment of the cities threatens the very survival of the group and its individual members
5115008 indigenous peoples are among the first to suffer from increasingly harsh and erratic weather conditions and a generalized lack of empowerment to claim goods and services to which other population groups have greater access
5115009 indigenous communities are often the custodians of unique knowledge and skills and the genetic and biological diversity in plant and animal production that may be vital in adapting to climate change approximately 80 per cent of the worlds remaining biodiversity is found within indigenous peoples territories

5115038 thats at the front of our mind rather than worrying about whether were going to be fifth fourth or whatever

5115128 it will be great for some of our guys to play against geelong its a wonderful opportunity so we are looking forward to it
5115129 its pretty simple why they are so good they have a lot of talent they are very mature very slick and probably have got four of their best players sitting on the sideline last night and they will probably come back in next week
5115130 but again we will recover and front up and send them out there and have a shot at it
5115131 i think they are going to be a big problem for a lot of teams in september they are very well coached and to a man they played their part for the team they are right up there with the best teams we had played this year
5115132 teams that are going to play the kangaroos in the finals i think watch out because they have hit form at the right time their key players are playing well they are playing very structured and very good footy
5115133 absolutely edwards and hamish and thommo nathan thompson next week you cant play them all in the same side though so if you are in one of those positions you have to perform
5115134 whatever happens between now and the end of the year and we can put our hand over our heart and say we are going to play in september after today i just look at the young players we have brought in over the last two years and we are really heading in the right direction

5115201 when israel releases prisoners only to groups that exert force it sends out the message that it gives in to pressure and that the use of violence and kidnapping are effective ways of acting against israel
5115202 instead of adopting a resolute stance against terrorism the kadima labor government continues to release hundreds of prisoners in return for nothing
5115203 the government insists on fixing the damage it causes by inflicting significantly more damage
5115204 a government that had not given in to hizbullah and hamas demands in the past would not have to give in to fatah today by releasing prisoners in return for nothing
5115205 this government which has reached the end of the road both physically and morally is releasing the prisoners in exchange for nothing continuing to jeopardize israeli citizens security time and again
5115206 the government should be reminded that the homes of the terrorists who carried out the tractor attacks in jerusalem have yet to be destroyed and they are already hurrying to release the next tractor drivers
5115207 crushes the publics faith that murderers and terrorists will receive their due punishment and will harm israeli citizens security and the efforts to release gilad schalit one can only imagine how the free release of more than 200 terrorists will impact the level of demands that hamas will put forward
5115208 but we are continuing to insist that israel must release all the palestinian prisoners from its jails this is the only way to move forward with the peace process
5115209 our people want to see all the prisoners released and not only those belonging to fatah
5115210 hamas wants the release of prisoners belonging to all the palestinian factions this is the basis on which we are trying to reach a prisoner exchange agreement with israel
5115211 we are anxious the federal government understands that there will be very significant growth in freight over the next 10 to 15 years a doubling of the freight task and 90 per cent will be export orientated
5115212 it means we can no longer look at road and rail separately but using them as a combined form of transport as part of a national supply chain
5115213 our road infrastructure is pretty good but our rail infrastructure has been under done for decades
5115214 road and rail is an integrated solution we need both as a solution
5115215 we spent time looking at rail it has to be significant infrastructure to qualify for the fund

5115308 that means you will also have less drug reaching the normal tissue
5115309 right now what we are doing is so called passive targeting which is using the leaky vasculature of the tumour but a more active targeting would be attaching a peptide or antibody to the nanotube drug one that will bind more specifically to the tumour which should further enhance the treatment efficacy

5115395 sedang kebinasaan sudah didepan mata perlu apa kamu rewel rewel semua omong kosong siapa yang salah kita sendiri beng kauw sendiri yang terpecah belah pheng hweesio kau sungguh gila kau mengatakan ingin berserikat dengan orang orang gagah di kolong langit artinya dengan partai partai yang dinamakan lurus bersih huh sekarang mereka justru mau membasmi kita kau mau berserikat dengan mereka
5115396 kalo yo kauwcoe masih hidup dengan mudah kita bisa menaklukkan enam partai yang menyerang kita
5115397 kalu yo kauwcoe masih hidup segala apa tentu berjalan licin perlu apa disebutkan lagi aduh ia tak bisa meneruskan perkataannya karena hawa it im cie menerjang ke dalam isi perutnya
5115398 swee poet tek taysoe apakah aku boleh mendapat tahu tujuan yang sebenarnya dari agama kalian
5115399 jika kau mesti hilang jiwa karena gara gara agama kami kami sesungguhnya merasa tak enak hati kau sekarang hanya bisa hidup beberapa jam lagi biarlah sebelum mati kau mendengar rahasia agama kami leng sian sianseng apa boleh aku menceritakan
5115400 beng kauw dimulai di negeri tay sit kok dan pada zaman kerajaan tong barulah masuk ke tionggoan pada masa itu kaisar tong telah mendirikan kuil kuil untuk agama kami beng kauw mwnyamaratakan semua pengikutnya dan mereka itu jika berharta diharuskan menolong rakyat miskin kamipun tidak diperbolehkan makan makanan berjiwa atau arak oleh karena selama beberapa turunan agama kami selalu digencet oleh pembesar pembesa rakus maka kerap kali saudara saudar kami memberontak misalnya saja sedari zaman phoe lap phoei kauwcoe di masa pak song song utara entah sudah berapa kali pemberontakkan beng kauw
5115401 dalam tahun kian yam di zaman lam song song selatan ong cong sek kauwcoe memberontak di sin cioe sedang dalam tahun siauw hin ie ngo po memberontak di kioe cioe sesudah itu dalam tahun siauw teng pada zaman kaisar lee cong thio sam ciang kauwcoe memberontak di daerah kangsay dan kwitang sebab bengkauw sering sekali bermusuhan dengan pembesar negeri dan menimbulkan pemberontakan pemberontakan maka kalangan pembesar negeri menamakan agama kami sebagai mo kauw dan melarangnya
5115402 untuk mempertahankan kehidupan maka kami terpaksa bekerja dengan bersembunyi kamipun bermusuhan dengan partai partai lurus bersih dan permusuhan kian lama kian menghebat sehingga mereka dan kami seakan akan api dan air
5115403 tentu saja di antara anggota anggota beng kauw terdapat juga manusia manusia yang rendah martabatnya mereka itu sering digunakan oleh partai partai lurus bersih sebagai bukti bahwa agama kami adalah agama yang sesat dengan demikian nama beng kauw jadi makin merosot
5115404 namaku swee poet tek dan sesuatu yang tak boleh dikatakan aku tentu takkan mengatakannya
5115405 siapa kepotong dia perih siapa berdosa dia tahu dalam hatinya
5115406 sedari kerajaan song direbut oleh bangsa mongol permusuhan antara beng kauw dan kerajaan makin menghebat selama beberapa keturunan pemimpin pemimpin agama kami telah menugaskan diri sendiri untuk mengusir kaum penjajah dengan mempersatukan semua orang gagah di seluruh negeri sayang sungguh dalam tahun tahun yang belakangan beng kauw tidak mempunyai pemimpin dan sebab memperebutkan kedudukan sebagai kauwcoe tokoh tokoh beng kauw jadi saling bunuh antara pentolan pentolan kami ada yang mengasingkan diri dan ada pula yang mendirikan agama lain dan mengangkat diri sebagai kauwcoe sesudah beng kauw berantakan permusuhan dengan partai partai lurus bersih makin besar dan sebagai akibatnya kau bisa lihat sendiri kami sekarang sedang menghadapi bencana goan tin hweeshio bagaimana pendapatmu apakah aku berdusta
5115407 sesudah berada begini dekat dengan kebinasaan perlu apa kau berdusta
5115408 eh aku telah mengajukan satu pertanyaan yang belum dijawab olehmu apakah jawabannya memalukan kau sehingga kau tak berani membuka mulut
5115409 aku tahu aku tahu bahwa sebelum aku menjawab kau tak bisa mati dengan mata meram
5115410 kau tanya mengapa aku tahu jalanan jalanan rahasia dari kong beng teng mengapa aku bisa sampai disini tanpa diketahui oleh siapapun jua baiklah aku akan menjawab dengan sejujur jujurnya jawabanku ialah yo po thian kauwcoe pemimpin agamamu sendiri berdua istri yang pernah membawaku kemari
5115411 jalanan rahasia kong beng teng adalah sebuah rahasia besar tempat itu adalah tempat suci dari agama kami biarpun yo cosoe seorang kong beng soe cia walaupun wie toako berkedudukan sebagai hoe kauw hoat tong mereka belum pernah menggunakan jalanan itu hanyalah kauwcoe seorang yang boleh menggunakannya mana bisa jadi yo kauwcoe mengajak kau seorang luar berjalan jalan itu
5115412 jika kau mendesak juga aku harus menceritakan peristiwa yang terjadi pada 25 tahun berselang
5115413 baiklah biar bagaimanapun juga kamu takkan bisa turun dari gunung ini dengan masih bernyawa kamu takkan bisa membocorkan rahasia hai cioe tian tak salah apa yang dikatakan olehmu jalanan rahasia itu adalah tempat suci dari agamamu memang hanya kauwcoe yang boleh masuk ke situ siapa yang melanggar dosa besar tapi orangnya yo po thian telah masuk ke situ yo po thian telah melanggar peraturan agama secara diam diam dia membawa yo hoejin masuk ke situ
5115414 bukan saja begitu yo hoejin telah membawaku masuk ke situ
5115415 aku bukan anggota beng kauw biarpun masuk di jalanan itu aku tidak melanggar peraturan agama
5115416 sekarang loolap sudah berusia 70 tahun lebih di waktu masih muda baiklah loolap akan menceritakan rahasianya
5115417 apa kalian tahu siapa adanya loolap yo po thian adalah soehengku yo hoejin adalah soemoyku pada sebelum menjadi pendeta loolap she seng bernama koen bergelar hoen goan pek leng chiu
5115418 tak bisa salah lagi pada waktu itu bangsat tua seng koen telah mengangkat kong kian seng ceng pendeta suci kian sebagai guru untuk menghilangkan permusuhan itu pendeta suci itu rela menerima 13 pukulan cit siang koen dari giehoe siapa nyana seng koen malah sudah mendustai gurunya sendiri sehingga kong kian taysu meninggal dunia dengan penasaran
5115419 giehoe orang yang membinasakan seantero keluargamu bernama hoen goan pek lek chioe bukan baiklah boe kie akan mengingat nama itu dibelakang hari anak tentu akan mewakili ayah untuk membalas sakit hati
5115420 kalapnya giehoe sehingga ia sering membunuh orang yang tidak berdosa kedatangan dan desakan berbagai partai di boe tong san sehingga kedua orang tuaku terpaksa membunuh diri semua adalah gara gara bangsat tua seng koen
5115421 kita semua tengah menghadapi kebinasaan dan sama sama menanggung penderitaan hebat tapi seorang yang gagah tidak boleh memperlihatkan kelemahannya dan berteriak teriak seperti kau
5115422 sedari kecil kita telah ditunangkan siapa tahu diam diam yo po thian juga mencintai soemoy ku itu belakangan dia menjadi kauwcoe dari beng kauw dan pengaruhnya besar sekali ayah dan ibunya soemoy adalah manusia manusia yang kemaruk akan pengaruh sedang soemoy sendiri tidak mempunyai pendirian yang teguh akhirnya soemoy menikah dengan yo po thian tapi sesudah menikah ia merasa tidak beruntung dan kadang kadang membuat pertemuan denganku supaya pertemuan tidak terganggu ia ingin sekali mencari tempat yang aman dan nyaman
5115423 yo po thian sangat mencintai soemoy ku dan ia tidak pernah membantah kehendak sang istri waktu soemoy menyatakan keinginannya untuk melihat lihat jalanan rahasia kong beng teng biarpun merasa sangat berat ia sudah meluluskan juga demikianlah jalanan rahasia itu yang selama ratusan tahun dipandang sebagai temnpat suci dari beng kauw menjadi tempat pertemuanku dengan nyonya kauwcoe
5115424 ha ha ha ha puluhan kali aku mondar mandir di jalanan itu apa heran jika hari ini aku bisa mendaki kong beng teng tak kesukaran apapun jua
5115425 pernikahanku telah digagalkan oleh yo po thian dia terang terang mencintai istriku setelah menjadi pemimpin mo kauw yo po thian merampas istriku yang tercinta permusuhanku dengan mo kauw adalah permusuhan yang tidak bisa berdiri di kolong langit bersama sama pada hari pernikahan yo po thian dengan soemoy ku aku datang memberi selamat dan turut minum arak kegirangan tapi di dalam hati diam diam aku bersumpah bahwa sebegitu lama seng koen masih bernafas aku pasti akan membunuh yo po thian aku pasti akan membasmi mo kauw sudah 50 tahun aku bersumpah baru kini aku berhasil
5115426 kini baru kutahu sebab musabab dari kematian yo siauw coe
5115427 kalau bukan menggunakan racun kau tentulah sudah menyerang secara gelap seperti perbuatanmu hari ini
5115428 sebab kuatir aku mencelakai dia secara menggelap berulang kali soemoyku memperingatiku ia mengatakan bahwa jika aku membinasakan yo po thian ia takkan mengampuniku ia mengatakan bahwa dengan mengadakan pertemuan gelap saja ia telah berdosa besar terhadap suaminya bila yo po thian dibinasakan maka perbuatan itu dianggapnya sebagai perbuatan terkutuk yang pasti akan dihukum oleh langit
5115429 kalau benar yo po thian binasa dalam tanganku aku tentu sudah mengampuni beng kauw
5115430 malam itu aku bertemu lagi dengan suomoy ku di jalanan rahasia itu sekonyong konyong kami mendengar suara nafas yang datang dari jurusan kiri itulah kejadian yang belum pernah terjadi orang luar takkan bisa masuk ke jalanan itu sedang anggota beng kauw takkan berani masuk kami kaget dan lalu menyelidiki ternyata suara nafas itu suara nafasnya yo soeheng yang sedang berduduk dalam sebuah kamar ia memegang selembar kulit kambing dalam tangannya dan selebar mukanya berwarna merah ia sudah mengetahui rahasia kami bagus sungguh perbuatan kamu berdua katanya sesudah berkata begitu paras mukanya berubah biru sesaat kemudian warna biru berubah merah lagi perubahan ini silih berganti sampai 3 kali yo cosoe apa kau tahu sebab musababnya
5115431 kejadian itu sudah terjadi karena yo kauwcoe sedang melatih diri dalam ilmu kiun koen tay lo ie
5115432 waktu masih hidup karena menghargai aku yo kauwcoe telah mengajar aku pokok pokok dari kian koen tay lo ie sin kang sesudah berlatih belasan tahun aku hanya mencapai tingkat dua dalam latihan selanjutnya hawa tulen dalam badanku mengamuk dan coba menerjang keluar dengan memecahkan batok kepalaku biar bagaimanapun juga aku tidak bisa menguasai hawa itu perubahan 3 kali pada paras muka yo kauwcoe merupakan tanda bahwa ia sudah mencapai tingkat kelima dari ilmu tersebut ia pernah memberitahu aku bahwa di antara kauwcoe agama kita ciong kauwcoelah dari keturunan kedelapan yang memiliki kepandaian paling tinggi dan sudah mencapai tingkat keenam dari kian koen tay lo ie
5115433 kalau tidak sukar ilmu itu tentu tidak dianggap sebagai ilmu pelindung agama kita
5115434 tujuan dari kian koen tay lo ie sinkang ialah menjungkir balikkan dua rupa hawa yaitu hawa
5115435 goan tin taysu apakah kau boleh memberitahu kami cara bagaimana yo kauwcoe sudah berpulang ke alam baka
5115436 sesudah kamu kena it im cie dalam dunia ini hanya ada empat golongan manusia yang bisa menolong
5115437 kamu hanya bisa ditolong dengan kioe yang sin kang dari boe tong siauw lim go bie dan it yang cie dari it teng taysoe kalu ditolong dengan salah satu ilmu itu kamu akan bisa bergerak untuk sementara waktu janganlah mimpi bahwa kamu bisa menolong diri sendiri dengan mengerahkan lweekang dan dengan memperpanjang waktu aku bicara terang terang itu semua tiada gunanya sebagai ahli ahli kelas utama dalam rimba persilatan kamu tentu tahu bahwa biar mendapat luka yang lebih berat lagi sesudah menjalankan pernafasan begitu lama sedikit banyak kamu sudah mendapat kemajuan tapi sekarang bukannkah sebaliknya daripada mendingan badanmu jadi makin kaku
5115438 melihat perubahan paras muka yo soe heng aku kaget soemoyku tahu bahwa ia berkepandaian sangat tinggi dan dengan sekali menghantam ia bisa membinasakan aku toosoeko katanya dalam hal ini akulah yang bersalah lepaskan seng soeko dan aku rela menerima segala hukuman mendengar perkataannya yo soe heng berkata dengan suara parau aku hanya bisa menikah dengan badanmu tidak bisa menikah dengan hatimu sehabis berkata begitu kedua matanya terbuka lebar seperti sedang mangamati sesuatu di tempat jauh dan sesaat kemudian dari kedua mata itu keluar darah yang mengalir turun dengan perlahan tubuhnya kelihatan kaku dan ia tidak bergerak lagi soemoyku terkejut dan berteriak toa soeko toa soeko po thian po thian mengapa kau ia berteriak berulang ulang
5115439 sebab yo soeheng tidak juga bergerak dengan membaringkan hati soemoyku menarik tangannya dan lantas saja ternyata bahwa tangan itu tangannya mayat soemoy meraba dadanya ia memang sudah mati kutahu hatinya tidak enak dan ia merasa menyesal maka itu aku segera coba membujuknya dengan berkata soemoy menurut penglihatanku toasoeko telah membuat kesalahan pasa waktu melatih diri dalam serupa ilmu yang tinggi mengalirnya hawa tulen terbalik dan ia tidak dapat ditolong lagi soemoyku mengangguk benar katanya ia tangah melatih ilmu kian koen tay lo ie yang sangat luar biasa pada detik latihan yang sangat penting ia mendapat tahu rahasia pertemuan kita biarpun bukan binasa dalam tanganku tapi ia binasa karena gara garaku baru saja aku ingin membujuk lagi tiba tiba ia menuding ke jurusan belakangku sambil membentak siapa itu
5115440 huh huh yo po thian mengatakan bahwa ia menikah dengan orangnya tapi tidak menikah dengan hatinya aku sendiri aku berhasil merebut hatinya soemoy tapi tidak bisa mendapatkan menusianya dalam seluruh penghidupanku ia adalah seorang yang paling dihormati dan paling dicintai olehku kalau bukan gara gara yo po thian kami berdua tentu sudah terangkap menjadi suami istri yang bahagia kalau bukan yo po thian menjadi kauwcoe dari mo kauw maka soemoyku tentu takkan menikah dengan manusia itu yang usianya lebih tua dua puluh tahun lebih daripadanya yo po thian telah mati aku tidak bisa berbuat sesuatu lagi kepadanya tapi mo kauw masih malang melintang di dalam dunia waktu itu sambil menuding jenazah soeheng dan soemoyku aku berkata aku seng koen bersumpah untuk menggunakan segala rupa kepandaianku guna membasmi beng kauw sesudah berhasil aku akan datang kemari lagi dan di sini untuk menggorok leher sendiri di hadapanmu berdua sebagai penebus dosa ha ha ha yo siauw wie it siauw kamu semua akan segera binasa seng koenpun tak akan hidup lebih lama lagi maksudku sudah tercapai dan dengan segala senang hati aku akan menggorok leher sendiri untuk mengawani kamu semua ke alam baka
5115441 selama beberapa tahun setiap saat aku memikiri daya upaya untuk menghancurkan mo kauw
5115442 sesudah turun dari kong beng teng aku pulang ke tiong goan dan mencari muridku cia soen yang sudah lama tak bertemu di luar dugaan begitu bertemu aku diberitahukan bahwa ia sudah menjadi salah satu hoa kauw hoat ong dari mo kauw
5115443 ia malah coba membujukku supaya aku turut menyeburkan diri ke dalam agama siluman itu ia mengatakan bahwa mo kauw bertujuan untuk mengusir kaum penjajah aku gusar tak kepalang tapi aku segera menekan kegusaranku karena kuingat bahwa mo kauw sudah berakar dalam dan mempunyai banyak orang pandai sehingga dengan sendirian aku pasti tak bisa berbuat banyak jangankan aku seorang diri sedangkan sebuah perserikatan dari orang orang gagah seluruh rimba persilatan belum tentu bisa menghancurkannya aku menarik kesimpulan jalan satu satunya ialah menjalankan tipu supaya mo kauw terpecah belah dan anggota anggotanya saling bunuh membunuh hanyalah dengan cara itu mo kauw bisa dihancurkan
5115444 pada waktu itu paras tak berubah aku hanya mengatakan bahwa urusan itu urusab besar yang harus dipikir masak masak
5115445 beberapa hari berselang aku berlagal mabuk arak dan coba mencemarkan kehormatan istri muridku dengan menggunakan kesempatan itu aku membunuh ayah ibu istri dan anaknya cia soen aku mengerti bahwa dengan berbuat begitu ia akan marah besar dan coba mencari aku untuk membalas sakit hatinya kalau dia tidak berhasil mencari aku maka menurut dugaanku ia akan melakukan perbuatan yang gila gila ha ha kata orang mengenal anak tidak seperti ayahnya mengenal murid tidak seperti gurunya aku mengenal watak muridku itu dia anak sangat baik tapi seorang pemarah yang mudah menjadi gelap ia tidak bisa memikir panjang panjang ia tidak bisa meneliti siasat orang
5115446 kalau begitu semua penderitaan gie hoe adalah akibat dari tipu busuknya bangsat tua itu
5115447 dengan menggunakan namaku cia soen telah membinasakan orang orang gagah dalam kalangan kangouw tujuannya ialah untuk memaksa aku keluar untuk menemui dia ha ha mana bisa aku menuruti kemauannya rahasia tentu saja tak bisa ditutup biarpun dia menggunakan namaku tapi orang tahu bahwa pembunuhan pembunuhan itu dilakukan olehnya dia menanam banyak sekali permusuhan hutang hutang darah itu semua masuk kedalam buku hutang beng kauw
5115448 yo siauw cioe tian wie it siauw dan yang lain lain apa kamu mau bicara
5115449 goan tin taysu apakah kau bisa mengampuni jiwa anakku ibunya ialah kie siauw hoe dari go bie pay ia belum masuk ke dalam beng kauw
5115450 membabat rumput harus membabat sampai diakarnya aku tak mau memelihara harimau kecil untuk jadi biang penyakit
5115451 kau suruh aku jangan bingung hhm kau sendiri tentu saja tidak bingung bagimu paling baik bila ayahku dibinasakan orang supaya kau bisa mencelakai aku kalau aku telah mati kau bisa berkuasa di sini
5115452 kejelekan coe jie karena racun dan masih dapat dirubah tapi kejelekan nona cilik itu adalah dari pembawaannya dan tak dapat diperbaikki lagi
5115453 kalau begitu poet hwie berbekal obat sehingga biarpun terkena it im cie ia masih bisa bergerak
5115454 sebaiknya aku yang pergi menyelidiki terlebih dahulu kalau sudah tak ada bahaya barulah siocia keluar
5115455 kami ayah dan anak telah dibokong musuh dan kami tengah menghadapi kebinasaan
5115456 apakah kau takkan menggunakan kesempatan ini untuk membalas sakit hati tak sudi kami disiksa olehmu jalan yang paling baik adalah membunuh kau terlebih dahulu
5115457 poet hwie moay moay bagaimana keadaanmu selama beberapa tahun ini
5115458 tadi goan tin hweeshio masuk ke sini tiba tiba ia menghilang apa dalam kamar ini ada jalan lain
5115459 sesudah kena pukulan ceng ek hong ong ia terluka berat
5115460 barusan ia kabur dan aku menejarnya ia masuk ke kamar ini da lantas menghilang dia adalah musuh besarku aku mesti cari dia
5115461 kalau kau tak tahu duduknya persoalan janganlah campur campur urusanku
5115462 dia adalah musuh besar dari keluargaku karena kuatir dia mencelakaiku maka ayah sudah merantai kaki tangannya sekarang kami berdua ayah dan anak kena it im cie dia pasti akan menggunakan kesempatan yang baik ini untuk membalas sakit hati jika kami jatuh dalam tangannya celakalah
5115463 nona apakah kau akan berusaha membalas sakit hati dengan menggunakan kesempatan baik itu
5115464 siocia kau selalu bercuriga bahwa aku akan membunuh kau kalau mau dengan mudah aku sekarang bisa berbuat begitu tapi aku tak punya maksud jahat
5115465 nona aku ingin sekali mengejar pendeta itu apakah di sini tak ada lagi jalan lain
5115466 biarpun mesti mengejar ke ujung langit aku tak bisa mengampuni dia
5115467 nona ini pincang dan kakinya diikat dengan rantai bagaimana ia bisa lari begitu cepat
5115468 tak heran jika ibuku mengatakan bahwa wanita pandai sekali menipu orang hari ini bahkan poet hwie moay moay merasa tak halangan untuk membokong aku
5115469 kupercaya ada lain jalanan hanya ku tak tahu di mana alat untuk membuka pintunya
5115470 sungguh mengherankan aku bahkan pernah membawa obor untuk menyelidikinya tapi tetap tak bisa mendapatkan alatnya
5115471 mungkin sekali memang tidak ada alat rahasia untuk membuka pintu
5115472 musuh berada di depan keadaan sangat berbahaya sebaiknya kau mengikuti saja dari sebelah jauh
5115473 celaka kepala gundul itu bersembunyi dan mendorong batu untuk membinasakan kita

5115482 it simply took for granted that the students felt they had been racially discriminated against it was not interested in what mr williamson had to say about the matter
5115483 an allegation that one is racist or discriminates against others is a very serious allegation failing to investigate such a serious allegation fully and fairly was a very serious breach of duty

5115490 the finding is significant because it changes our understanding of how light input from the eye can affect activity and sleep patterns
5115491 this suggests that we have discovered an additional mechanism for regulating nocturnity and diurnity that is located in the light input pathways of the eye
5115492 the significance of this research for humans is that it could ultimately lead to new treatments for sleep disorders perhaps even eye drops that would target neural pathways to the brains central timekeeper
5115493 currently one in 28 americans age 40 and over suffer from blindness or low vision and this number is estimated to double in the next 15 years
5115494 our discovery of the switching mechanism in the eye has direct relevance with respect to the eventual development of therapies to treat circadian and sleep disorders in the visually impaired

5115514 i was able to theoretically confirm that planned design changes to the current bifilar fault current limiter being developed by siemens and american superconductor would decrease ac losses in the system my calculations are good news for the future of the device
5115515 i modelled the bifilar design as an infinite stack of superconducting tapes in which adjacent tapes carry current in opposite directions i was able to find an exact solution for the magnetic fields and currents that are generated in such a stack of tapes once i calculated how the magnetic flux penetrates into the tape i then could calculate how much energy is lost in each current cycle for different tape widths and spacings between adjacent tapes
5115516 although all pleasures are good and all pains evil epicurus does not believe that all pleasures are choiceworthy or all pains unchoiceworthy instead one should calculate what is in ones long term self interest and forgo what will bring pleasure in the short term if doing so will ultimately lead to greater pleasure in the long term

5116059 when i first heard forgiveness i could not imagine forgiving someone for doing such heinous acts to children i thought it would be letting him off the hook
5116060 boy have i been taught a lesson in life forgiveness is not about letting them off the hook its about continuing on with our journey it frees up our soul in a way you let go of the anger
5116061 were not jesus for other human beings forgiveness is a process
5116062 putting yourself in the perspective of the person who hurt you rather than just demonizing them
5116063 most people think you are forgiving the perpetrator and theyre off scot free and you get nothing

5116092 in every case our particular vocation in gods service arises from our response to the basic call to radical availability
5116093 deepen their appreciation for gods creation while interacting with and engaging in discussions about the wonder of gods unique design

5116096 to jesuss way of thinking there is no place in the kingdom that is gods kingdom for evaluating how important someone is on the basis of their power possessions money or social respect
5116097 the anabaptists were neither institutionalists mystics nor pietists for they laid the weight of the emphasis upon following christ in life
5116098 brotherhood of love in which the fullness of he christian life ideal is to be expressed
5116099 now that we are more aware of the distance between anabaptism or between jesus and mennonitism we can no longer identify the two as was done before with a good conscience either the commitment to jesus and the anabaptist model will be strengthened undercutting the mennonite identification or the commitment to constituency loyalty and relevance will be strengthened and then it is more clear that anabaptism in not our message

5116101 h e must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me
5116102 only if we can empathize with this threefold rejection the self evident axiomatic sweeping rejection of both quietism and establishment responsibility and the difficult constantly reopened genuinely attractive option of the crusade
5116103 how do the life and teachings of jesus influence our lives
5116104 in the current social context we must rediscover the primacy of the church as a fellowship of the redeemed a people of god not building and institutional programs we need to bring the church out from under the social and political orders and see it once again as gods highest order in the world as gods redeemed people the church is our first identification we are called to be members of the body of christ a living dynamic fellowship the covenant membership is our identity our relationship and our security
5116105 im not interested in telling you a story im not interested any longer in painting a picture of a specific place i want to invite you to pay attention to this miraculous world in which we live
5116106 theyre just doing this so they can sell the land more easily and make more money
5116107 while some might prefer to have this land remain undeveloped thats not an option
5116108 these lands will be developed albeit in a careful way that is emblematic of kiawah
5116109 have indicated a willingness on a voluntary basis to reduce substantially these entitlements and as a result reduce allowable density
5116110 its an important area that should be left as is
5116111 looking at an aerial photo it looks like its designed to prevent the spit from being cut off from the next storm
5116112 you talk about fairness whats unfair is that future homeowners will eventually see this area erode and then theyll start crying for sandbags and sea walls just like on the isle of palms
5116113 were going way beyond the pale to be extra sensitive
5116114 in this moment in time with our understanding of the coming sea level rise anything that takes away the dynamics of our islands and increases beachfront development is madness
5116115 theyve tried to do that in north topsail beach near wilmington n c which is crowded with buildings but theyve failed
5116116 one reason i refuse to bother with the whole security circus is that i think it glorifies and thus encourages the wrong behaviour it makes heroes out of security people as if the people who dont just fix normal bugs arent as important in fact all the boring normal bugs are way more important just because theres a lot more of them
5116117 i think the openbsd crowd is a bunch of masturbating monkeys in that they make such a big deal about concentrating on security to the point where they pretty much admit that nothing else matters to them
5116118 revels in exposing vendor security holes because they see that as just another proof that the vendors are corrupt and crap which admittedly mostly are
5116119 both camps are whoring themselves out for their own reasons and both camps point fingers at each other as a way to cement their own reason for existence
5116120 you need to fix things early and that requires a certain level of disclosure for the developers
5116121 you also dont need to make a big production out of it
5116122 what does the whole security labelling give you except for more fodder for either of the pr camps that i obviously think are both idiots pushing for their own agenda
5116123 any situation that allows the vendor to sit on the bug for weeks or months is unacceptable as is any situation that makes it harder for people who find problems to talk to technical people
5116124 so the whole embargoes are good mentality is just corruption from the vendors
5116125 but on the other hand disclosure should not be the goal
5116126 have a model where security is easier to do in the first place that is the unix model but make it easy for people to report bugs with no embargo but privately

5116249 no reports of violence between russian and georgian forces instead most of the violence came from russian supported militias
5116250 it is difficult to convey the sheer scale of the russian military presence
5116251 you want to be the guy in that situation to get the job done and you expect those type of situations and when you get a chance to do it execute the way you want it feels great
5116252 that was a gut wrencher there when you lose that kind of lead in the ninth inning especially with two outs and to be able to come back and win the game
5116253 you certainly dont look forward to games like this but when its all said and done the fact that we lost the lead and still came back to win i think it tells you a lot about the makeup of the team
5116254 you cant really blame the pitchers for what they did when your defense sometimes gives them too many outs more than three a good ballclub is going to be able to execute and capitalize on that and thats what they did
5116255 youve got to learn from that and try not to make the same mistake
5116256 we had that feeling everybodys coming together and swinging the bat really well and you never know whos going to get that big hit
5116257 clayton struggled a little bit in this one where he didnt have his command that he had in the last few starts but thats an important sign that he was able to just get outs when he needed to
5116258 if he goes out there and pitches that way every day then we have a good shot at winning
5116259 we have a feeling that we can do some special things
5116260 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5116261 but how much time it will take it depends definitely on how georgians will continue to behave
5116262 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5116263 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5116264 we are waiting for more support from other countries because this is not a war between russian and georgia its a war between civilization and barbarism
5116265 i do not know where my children are and you can imagine how i feel about it

5116309 my opponent has not voted for one renewable energy bill
5116310 and hes voted for all the tax breaks for the oil companies thats reverse of where we should be right now
5116311 instead we look at wind turbines out in the water if a storm knocks them down we dont have to worry about them destroying the ocean
5116312 theyre tired of being 50th in graduation rates and theyre tired of these schools falling apart right under them and they want to see real reform in education

5116316 the subcommittee should have begun preparing for a flood of injured troops coming through the system on day one

5116332 our focus on key drivers of growth remains consistent resulting in continued strong financial results mr bassat said
5116333 growth in the australian and new zealand employment business has been driven by ongoing migration from print to online a growing presence in sme healthcare education and government markets improved yield and the introduction of product extensions through standout amp premium ads
5116334 more than 77 per cent of job seekers time is now spent on seek and over the past 12 months we have increased job ad volumes by more than our two closest competitors combined
5116335 with increased sales capability and new content partnerships seek learning had a strong second half and with continued leverage of the seek brand we expect this momentum to continue paul bassat said
5116336 im tired of being humble and saying the right things

5116343 i think its better to have ideas you can change an idea changing a belief is trickier life should be malleable and progressive working from idea to idea permits that beliefs anchor you to certain points and limit growth new ideas cant generate life becomes stagnant
5116344 honestly i hope i can get a goal every game
5116345 im getting my legs back so thats a key and i have confidence now that i can get goals in back to back games im getting my second chance and im making the most of it
5116346 i was surprised that i was able to get there to the ball
5116347 i thought someone would cut me off before i got there i just took off
5116348 ive spoken to him a couple of times and expressed my feelings about him being a scorer
5116349 i knew that when hes 100 percent healthy he can score hes getting fitter and stronger and hopefully it can continue
5116350 the financial district is definitely a male dominated world with very few women in it
5116351 i wanted to have a very strong and sensual female energy take over and become the center of attention with the women as the smartest persons in the room
5116352 and i wanted to do something outside the proscenium theater this summer because there are so many amazing places around manhattan
5116353 i started walking around discovering some great places around lower manhattan
5116354 and these spaces informed the creation of characters with a vocabulary and prop design growing out of each space
5116355 its interactive in terms that there are observers who are not just interested in theater and dance but people who just happen upon the sites tourists locals construction workers blue collar white collar i love that it makes dance seem less rarefied
5116356 this setting is more intimate more communal the women who were alienated before will become part of this festive lounge and nightclub feel
5116357 its exciting because theres no telling whos watching or what their reactions will be there are a lot of variables that we have no control over
5116358 i let you live way up in my penthouse which you claimed was just a shack i gave you seven children and now you want to give them back

5116368 eu costumava imaginar como seria estar na pele de um campe o agora j sei sinto me normal
5116369 the players put on the field what we did with them in training we realised more than the other games in pre season what we need to do
5116370 but well need more quality in the future if we want to win the premier league or champions league well need more than this
5116371 lampard is not brazilian hes english but he touched the ball very well it was his style the same with ballack we have a style its impossible to say to deco foul people thats not his style
5116372 i only give the players the freedom to play and allow them to express their style this is a chelsea performance not a scolari performance
5116373 im happy with anelka i said to him you will have three or four chances you need to make one or two goals for me and for the people i want people to believe in you more than before
5116374 theyll go away for a few days now to the national team thats frustrating but this is a fifa date
5116375 well have six or seven players at training and start building some ideas for the game against wigan well hope the others get back in condition and well be ready
5116376 youre not going to break into the top four no one is this year spurs have got a squad and cant even win at middlesbrough so you start forgetting about them the top four are on another level
5116377 when they play pass and move its very difficult to stay with them
5116378 michael has an ankle injury and it has swollen up very badly and hell be out for maybe two or three weeks which is unfortunate
5116379 ryans got a hamstring injury so it was disappointing to get these injuries on top of what were missing anyway i havent got too many complaints we did our best with the resources we had available
5116380 carlos tevez will be back for the portsmouth match next week and wayne will be much sharper and much fitter and in the second half it started to show for him but unfortunately campbell also picked up an injury and i had to take him off so we were asking wayne to play through the middle when hes really needing games and it was a big ask
5116381 im not discussing anyone i think we have a good squad the same squad as last year and when tevez comes back and wayne gets games that will be my strike force
5116382 thats what it was last season and im happy to continue with that there are 37 games left so it is not a disaster we have shown before we can come from behind
5116383 in spite what everyone thinks were working really hard to bring quality players in
5116384 i think too often in the last few years newcastle have bought players that havent been quite good enough for whatever reason
5116385 sometimes they havent settled sometimes they havent seemed to understand what it means to play for newcastle united
5116386 the three that weve got so far do and the next three must as well and if that means waiting then so be it
5116387 anyone can collect players because there are hundreds around but good players who can play at newcastle not everyone can do that
5116388 all i wanted to do was burn a amp amp amp cd with some music and it wouldnt work
5116389 i actually really liked it it was a good combination of sweet and salty
5116390 chefs are trying to be more playful and incorporate new kinds of whimsy
5116391 we brought it down to the boardwalk and put it in a case just to see if people would react and they reacted
5116392 i didnt think it would be very good but once i tried it it was good
5116393 years ago i think food tended to be more traditional and less fun
5116394 its the melding of both these worlds the high end and the low end
5116395 full path to mysql eg path to mysql or d xamppfiles mysql bin
5116396 it would include lots of gear space a heater and music system i would have a bike stand in it and a workbench with a few saws in it and a place to tie flies it would have to be comfortable enough so that else and i can go outside and play guitar
5116397 everyone is to bring into the church and the process of new creation everything he has whatever he brings with him and whatever he can do
5116398 i dont think i know how to be a youth minister
5116399 she was actually going stronger than i wanted on the back but it seemed better to let her have her head than pull all the run out of her
5116400 she responded real well when that horse came up on her
5116401 its great to see so many people out on the course
5116402 everyone is so inspired people are charging after their goals its really a fun event
5116403 its great to see so many people out on the course
5116404 everyone is so inspired people are charging after their goals its really a fun event
5116405 she was way out in front she was gone the whole time
5116406 ive been in the triathlon community a long time but this is always my favorite day
5116407 i find a lot of inspiration here especially when you see people of all shapes and sizes and walks of life giving it their all
5116408 you can see people come across that finish line who must be thinking wow i really did this amazing thing
5116409 until this i just enjoy having a good time here sixth place is ok
5116410 riding my bike i only said on your left twice
5116411 i think i heard it about a thousand times as people passed me but at least i got to say it twice and hey i didnt crash
5116412 i felt so inspired to see that i can do it
5116413 i know i can do it again and ill do it better now im motivated to train harder and get in better shape
5116414 the titus concept money for my best and highest good
5116415 what thoughts or beliefs have i held for so long that i dont even remember holding them anymore that might be between me and my conscious intentions can i remember a time when i held a silly belief that kept me from happiness
5116416 i should wait a few days before i call her back so she wont think im needy or clingy
5116417 im going to call her now because i want her to really be able to appreciate what i am and im not i know she may not like what i show her and that will be as perfect as if she cant get enough
5116418 how is she sharing this passion with others does she have an interest in sharing this passion with others on a larger scale
5116419 all i know is that all those bilateral meetings can be done in alofi on thursday
5116420 as far as we are concerned the interim prime minister is registered and is due to arrive with the other leaders on monday
5116421 obviously there is a timeline that the leaders hold fiji accountable to the interim government will explain its side of the story before pacific leaders decides on a mechanism to retain the integrity of the forum which at this time is paramount
5116422 the rest of the member countries have been part of the process through the joint working group forum foreign affairs ministers meeting and the forum ministerial contact group
5116423 to single out two countries i think is not fair
5116424 parents should take the initiative to spend more time with their children
5116425 often parents send their children to school for the sake of education yet rarely walk with them to school and have a chat with their teachers on their progress
5116426 the well being and success of children is at your hands the parents so it is clear now that everything starts from home
5116427 ive watched the secret 5 times since easter everytime i watch it it makes my heart race im so excited about what ive seen im going to plaster up posters all over my walls to remind me of what ive seen in the secret
5116428 the titus concept money for my best and highest good
5116429 what part of my information would i like to share with this stranger
5116430 i was at the public library earlier and speaking to one of the librarians about getting more copies of
5116431 the figure we arrive at is more than 3 trillion our calculations are based on conservative assumptions they are conceptually simple even if occasionally technically complicated a 3 trillion figure for the total cost strikes us as judicious and probably errs on the low side needless to say this number represents the cost only to the united states it does not reflect the enormous cost to the rest of the world or to iraq
5116432 5 dollars for the statue 1 000 dollars for the story that goes with the statue
5116433 ah i see you have returned to my shop are you ready for the story
5116434 we want to go to monkstown and then on into dublin
5116435 ahh lookit im nearly falling asleep here have you any dacent music
5116436 its lovely of you to have such concern for a friend youre a credit to her
5116437 shes my little sister sure i worry about her there were eleven of us to start with but there arent many of us left
5116438 i have a good life im well travelled and i smoke 20 a day
5116439 everywhere germany france america mexico brazil last year i went to amsterdam and it was really very excellent indeed
5116440 the only places i havent been yet are australia and china sure theres plenty of time for that yet i suppose
5116441 i dont know if it was a paternity issue or criminal
5116442 pose is enough into this extend and now suck this and stand up front of her face and force fellatio
5116443 everyone is to bring into the church and the process of new creation everything he has whatever he brings with him and whatever he can do
5116444 we are starting a new group for the 11am mass
5116445 we will be singing the same songs as we do now
5116446 but we will be doing them in a praise and worship style
5116447 we need to change our tax policies change our immigration policy we made the u s a magnet an attractive place for the best and the brightest in the world and we frustrate that by saying you get a ph d here and that doesnt matter right now were throwing you out thats very self destructive behavior
5116448 we save too little we consume too much we borrow too much from the rest of the world we use energy in a profligate and wasteful fashion
5116449 i think that our window for policy change is very short
5116450 i think if we dont in the next few years four five years make the necessary adjustments what youll see is something that looks a little like the trajectory of the british empire in the 20th century its not that britain collapsed its that it just slowly faded away in significance in power and wealth
5116451 at one level a post american world is a sign of american failure and at another its a sign of glorious success
5116452 why is this happening because countries around the world are doing what weve been telling them to do for the last 60 years open yourself up to capitalism to free trade to technology
5116453 yea man f ing red green yellow whatever you going to let some little colored lamp dictate how you run your life you wanna be treated like an adult act like one
5116454 i am sorry for the man who cant feel the whip when it is laid on the other mans back
5116455 old mcdonald had a farm and bingo was his name o
5116456 can i resolve whatever it is thats causing this anger
5116457 im not a bad person i just did a bad thing
5116458 there are these two bulls standing at the top of this hill looking down into a valley full of cows
5116459 do i have the time energy inclination to get that
5116460 i could quit eating these if i really wanted to
5116461 whatsoever god hath joined together let no man cast asunder
5116462 therefore with the growth of technology the human race is faced with tremendous crisis
5116463 so the kind of thought thats going on all around us begins to take over in every one of us without our even knowing it
5116464 is to be engaged in and enjoyed for its own sake as one of the arts
5116465 at wikipedia org and as such is available under the
5116466 that is the best ive ever played in the city tournament for the whole week that is absolutely the most confident ive played
5116467 she made one bogey and i won that hole other than that there was nothing to win
5116468 today was one of those days where i was like you want me to make this shot
5116469 whenever it looked like the door was open she just slammed it shut on me no 9 the door was open then it was slammed shut no 10 the door was open then it was slammed shut
5116470 my main thing was i wanted a fourth win because there are a couple of ladies still playing in the tournament who have four plus i wanted a back to back because there are only a few ladies still playing who have gone back to back
5116471 you set the standard so high and you lose one series and ask whats wrong
5116472 thats what were saying weve been riding the wave so long we have to get another wave
5116473 jeremy would start and i would finish i told him during the anthem im going to come in and save it for you
5116474 but if he doesnt pitch like he did we dont have the chance to win he did a great job
5116475 you talk about the definition of a save and thats it
5116476 lewis showed a lot of moxie out there we were playing no doubles on defense so that first ball drops in jensen had to bow his neck and thats what he did
5116477 it tightened up a little bit but im not coming out of the game because of something like that
5116478 it should be fine im not planning on missing my next start
5116479 im sure in the next 48 hours well have a lot better feel for whats happening
5116480 its not exactly where we want to be but weve got a shot
5116481 a 6 4 road trip is a good trip but i just look at my two starts and we lost both of them
5116482 if we won both it could have been a great trip
5116483 it was great for me because id been struggling last month
5116484 i got on my mechanics a little bit better now im keeping my head straight too
5116485 we wonder if theyre getting tired and volquez gets upset for us even asking about it
5116486 i have no comment on anything to do with him
5116487 ive just been working extremely hard day in and day out im a new freshman so im trying to get into the playbook as much as i can just learn as much as i can be like a sponge and absorb everything coach tony gibson and coach scott shafer are trying to teach me and just go out there and try to compete hard every day
5116488 i think just the coverage aspect and being patient because being a defensive back one thing a lot of people dont know you have to be really patient stay in your back peddle and things of that nature
5116489 ive realized that im pretty good at that but one thing that i have to get a lot better on is just being more physical at the line like getting off of blocks and stuff of that nature i think that will come with time were working real hard every day so i think ill be okay
5116490 i actually played safety about two days ago they finally gave me a little work at safety but mainly ive been trying to master the corner position its pretty new to me coming into college in high school i was pretty much a safety and only played corner on a need basis so theyre pretty much trying to help me master the corner position and i think theyre going to work me in at safety too but who knows
5116491 both of those guys are extremely talented both of them are very knowledgeable about the game and know the playbook one thing that surprised me is both of them are real helpful they help me and boubacar cissoko out with whatever questions we have they help us out so thats been a very positive thing those guys are both very talented and i expect them to have a big year

5116515 during my time with novara i realised there was a big failure in the irish marketplace in terms of low cost starter websites there are over 45 000 businesses in ireland that dont have a website at the same time more and more people are moving to the web to find products and services
5116516 the other problem is the recession is reducing the amount of money businesses out there can spend on developing a web presence irish people are interested in new services that they can find online if youre not listed on google then youre invisible as far as the public are concerned
5116517 we started looking into this a year ago and we did a feasibility study with enterprise ireland the fact of the matter is ireland needs to develop more services that can be exported and we believe omniserve has an important role to play going forward
5116518 we will fight this every step of the way he said

5116525 ho visto una buona salernitana sono soddisfatto della prestazione che abbiamo offerto e per la vittoria non tutti i giocatori sono in forma cercheremo di esserlo ad inizio campionato aver battuto il cesena non mi da una soddisfazione ulteriore col cesena ho tanti ricordi e per uno strano scherzo del destino me lo sono ritrovato di fronte al debutto sulla panchina della salernitana il pubblico dellarechi fantastico non mi aspettavo nel periodo di ferragosto di trovare settemila persone per una gara di coppa italia
5116526 una mia rete e la vittoria della squadra inizio migliore non poteva esserci la salernitana gi in buona forma per il campionato dove faremo cose importanti in questo modulo di castori 4 2 3 1 ndr mi trovo molto bene gioco in una posizione pi avanzata e posso puntare meglio verso la porta
5116527 abbiamo avuto la personalit di non scomporci davanti al loro gol iniziale
5116528 siamo stati bravi a non scomporci dopo il gol a reagire subito se non fosse arrivato subito il pareggio le cose si sarebbero complicate gran gol e assist a soncin e stato solo un caso ride ndr ora ci attende il bari una buona squadra sar una partita da preparare a cominciare da marted una sconfitta comunque non pregiudicherebbe la stagione
5116529 dispiace molto per questa eliminazione che secondo me immeritata soprattutto alla luce delle tante occasioni avute e non finalizzate per se devo esprimere un giudizio devo dire che il rimini non mi dispiaciuto tanto vero che ho detto ai ragazzi che hanno fatto del loro meglio certamente dobbiamo migliorare diverse cose ma in generale credo che siamo sulla strada giusta difesa ballerina sul gol abbiamo lasciato il loro giocatore un po troppo libero di fare un cross facile e anche sul gol di gerbino ci siamo fatti anticipare mentre sul calcio dangolo siamo stati solo sfortunati
5116530 sono contento la squadra ha fatto una prova maiuscola i ragazzi hanno
5116531 non mi piace perdere nemmeno a carte figuriamoci in coppa italia noi per cercavamo un atteggiamento di squadra con grande concentrazione e solidit e posso dire che si visto nel secondo tempo abbiamo giocato un p meglio anche se ci siamo complicati la vita da soli negli ultimi dieci minuti prendendo quel gol nel finale

5116652 today the commonwealth state and territory governments have placed the australian consumer front and centre as we took an important step on the road to achieving a single national consumer law
5116653 these reforms will bring australias consumer protection laws into the twenty first century and reflect the rudd governments commitment to a seamless national economy
5116654 business is also set to benefit from a reduction in compliance costs as nine sets of consumer laws are folded into a new single national consumer law
5116655 this agreement is another clear example of the fresh approach that the rudd government is taking to cooperative federalism
5116656 the ministerial council has agreed to propose to the business regulation and competition working group brcwg that all australian jurisdictions agree to adopt a national consumer law based on the consumer protection provisions of the trade practices act
5116657 todays agreement builds on mccas earlier agreement to introduce a new national product safety regulation and enforcement system as well as the agreement of the state and territories to transfer their responsibilities for the regulation of consumer credit to the commonwealth
5116658 i would like to thank my ministerial colleagues and the officials for the spirit in which they have conducted negotiations and moved along reform proposals in sight of yet another historic agreement

5116692 we are hopeful of providing private fishers family with some long awaited answers and ask on their behalf that the media respect their privacy at this sensitive time
5116693 in addition the team is undertaking a preliminary examination of records relating to the two royal australian air force personnel also missing in vietnam

5116695 t his is the 21st century isnt it at least in that vast swath extending from berkeley to berlin and to beijing with an outrigger in moscow anything geo could only refer to economics welfare had replaced warfare tankers had replaced tanks balance of payments the balance of power at least in the berlin berkeley belt all of us were playing win win games wheeling dealing and consuming chanting no more war we worried about soft politics and soft power how to battle aids and desertification sars and subprime crises say hello to vladimir putin and his stand in dmitry medvedev by attacking georgia they have raised the curtain on a post world war ii premiere they have launched the first real war in greater europe since 1945 so forget about mr saakashvilis bluster and bumbling think revisionism and expansionism terms beloved by diplomatic historians trying to explain the behavior of rock the boat states a revisionist power wants back what it once had an expansionist power wants more for itself and less for the rest the r amp e syndrome is a handy way to explain all of mr putins strategy in the past eight years draw an arc from the baltic to the caspian and then start counting moscow has unleashed a cyberwar against tiny estonia formerly a soviet republic it has threatened the czech republic and poland with nuclear targeting if they host u s antimissile hardware on their soil that could not possibly threaten russias retaliatory potential it has exploited small price disputes normally resolved by lawyers screaming at each other to stop gas deliveries and thus show ukraine belarus and former warsaw pact members who runs the common house of europe to recall mikhail gorbachevs famous phrase mr putin has always reserved the harshest treatment for georgia tbilisis mortal sin was the attempt to get out from under the bears paw and snuggle up to the west alas neither the u s nor the eu was prepared for the return of the 19th century they thought that clausewitz was dead once and for all that it was win win games now and forever that russia lured by respectability and riches would turn into a responsible great power apparently george f kennan the diplomat and historian had it right to him is attributed a very apropos aphorism russia can have at its borders only vassals or enemies at least we now know one thing dreams of multipolarity of governance by committee are premature revisionist powers are never responsible
5116696 ne jamais frapper un ours sur le nez quand il nest pas encha n
5116697 la russie ne peut avoir ses fronti res que des vassaux ou des ennemis
5116698 as we got there a twin engined aircraft came over our heads flying quite low enough for us to notice and look up
5116699 literally as we watched it come over our heads more or less like a flash what i almost thought was a microlight came across and the twin engined plane smashed into it straight on and totally destroyed it it just fell apart as if it was made of balsa wood it was unbelievable
5116700 the twin engined aircraft banked heavily to the left and i think its right propeller came off
5116701 we thought it was trying to recover you are just thinking go on it seemed to get its height back for a little bit but then it nose dived into the trees we heard a deep rumble as it obviously crashed
5116702 i saw a plane travelling east coming down sharply straight towards the woods
5116703 i immediately thought it looked like something was wrong then at the last minute just 50 feet up the pilot managed to pull up the nose of the plane it looked like he was trying to save the plane from the trees but then i realised the plane was going down
5116704 we know about them the problems is we dont have any hostages so we cant do any exchange
5116705 we estimate 500 ossetian civilians were kidnapped and taken away by georgian forces from the south of tskhinvali
5116706 the conservative party should be the party of change but change that goes along with the customs and manners and traditions and sentiments of the people rather than change according to some grand plan
5116707 i am going to be as radical a social reformer as mrs thatcher was an economic reformer and radical social reform is what the country needs now just as margaret thatcher mended the broken economy in the 1980s so we want to mend britains broken society in the early decades of the 21st century its dealing with the issues of family breakdown welfare dependency failing schools crime and the problems that we see in too many of our communities
5116708 he wasnt tough enough with his team when i want someone to go i simply tell them and then thats that you have to be tough about it
5116709 isnt as good as he thinks he is not by a long chalk
5116710 connor was a member of a loving family he was known to the police but not for anything serious as of yet there is no motive but it is very early days
5116711 we really need to trace the driver of the cab as he may hold the key to the identity of the suspect
5116712 his logic is that since mugabe is saying the deal currently on the table gives the prime minister a lot of powers then he must assume that position and tsvangirai becomes president
5116713 what is it youd like to happen in this situation
5116714 id like to be able to use the photo without complicating a 3 party situation with discussions of money
5116715 loss in appreciation for the friend loss of interest in the business connection with the friend
5116716 does the photographer know what effect shes had with her counter offer
5116717 does she realize that the feelings that she inspired from her counter offer might effect any future business like sorry were not interested
5116718 can the photographer truly afford to loose the business of my client on a long term basis
5116719 we are a little surprised by your response im sure you have better offers than to be published in a major magazine i will be informing insert name of magazine here that your photo will not be available as a choice for the article they are publishing tomorrow morning
5116720 i will be informing said magazine that your photo will not be available as a choice for the article they are publishing tomorrow morning
5116721 we have lots of reports of 30 or 50 animals in one place
5116722 they are obviously gathering for a reason but right now we are not sure what that is or how they know to show up at these spots
5116723 there is already collaboration in terms of information sharing and there will probably be more in the future
5116724 none of the tags have been resighted in the northern gulf
5116725 that doesnt mean none of the sharks have traveled there the tags could have been shed or they might not have been seen but after tagging 700 you think theyd have spotted something up there
5116726 when you talk about a species that travels thousands of miles and knows no political boundaries collaboration between scientists is essential
5116727 we wanted to know what the whale sharks were doing in a school of tuna
5116728 these guys see a lot of stuff out there and they never think to contact us and we had not been contacting them
5116729 a third of our sightings are of groups of animals
5116730 we had a sighting of 30 or so a few weeks ago off the coast of texas
5116731 how do 30 animals know to show up for what is a 12 hour spawning event
5116732 now thats a wonderful mystery its what were trying to figure out
5116733 why wasnt god watching why wasnt god listening why wasnt god there for georgia lee

5116745 i dont think youll be getting the large quantities of rain youve had in the last few days itll just be showers
5116746 i thought i would be nervous but once i got into it i felt good when the judges went around after i was finished i felt the nerves start to react
5116747 my understanding in talking to the family was he was advised by the judge that should he see her at school he should turn and walk the other way
5116748 we will place him at an off site location so he can continue his education until this matter is resolved
5116749 i think what has come out of this is this is a lose lose situation for everyone the victim and her family are traumatised the whole school community is in shock at whats happened
5116750 the first thing is its obviously totally inappropriate secondly the fact this young woman will have to see that guy every day i have to wonder what the judge was thinking
5116751 we deal with a lot of the victims in these cases and were only too aware of the ongoing ramifications for the victims i have trouble understanding where the judges head is in all this
5116752 with continued income and population growth malaysian food consumption is shifting away from starchy staples such as rice and cassava and more toward wheat based products including breads and bakery products meat dairy products seafood fruit and vegetables
5116753 with limited domestic production of many agricultural products food demand is expected to increase and to be met largely by imports
5116754 despite applied tariffs on agricultural commodities being mostly low or zero other trade barriers such as tariff quotas and license requirements of a range of agricultural products could restrict access to malaysias market
5116755 in addition there are malaysian government controls on domestic prices for some food products such as wheat based products and sugar these controls could hinder growth in australias exports of these commodities to malaysia
5116756 i often use samso as an ambitious example of how to cope with the big challenges that our own country faces in the race to become independent of fossil fuels
5116757 i think samso has set an agenda for the climate issue and alongside other projects it has shown that this is possible
5116758 sellers coming to the market in the middle of the summer holiday season tend to be more motivated london in particular appears to be having its own special summer sale with over 21 000 pounds off in a month
5116759 progress and prospects on water for a clean and healthy world
5116760 its not very popular to talk about toilets and excrement and where to go when you are menstruating this is something that makes people feel uncomfortable
5116761 five thousand children die every day of diarrhoea because of a lack of hygiene and sanitation and nobody really cares
5116762 we have to understand that what we eat and the products we buy have an immediate implication for the availability of the worlds water resources
5116763 surprisingly 20 million europeans need access to safe and affordable sanitation
5116764 now weve stopped discussing whether or not there has been climate change or where or who has been contributing to it
5116765 now its all about its there and we have to live with it and the question is okay what to do how to adapt
5116766 our inability to see beauty doesnt suggest in the slightest
5116767 i dont know what to feel so many emotions so much excitement i just want to see my mum
5116768 its been nothing but an upwards rollercoaster but its been nothing but fun
5116769 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination
5116770 we now can study how iaps contribute to the development of cancer in a living animal and develop drugs to prevent or thwart the disease
5116771 cancer cells thrive by disabling the molecular machinery that tells sick cells to die
5116772 by removing the ring we wanted to see whether we would trick the machinery to turn back on and thats what happened cells die more readily making it much more difficult for cancer to be established
5116773 we need to use genetics to sort out which individual iaps contribute to tumors and which iaps we need to target in order to cure cancer
5116774 this was a very big step in understanding what role iaps play in cancer but it isnt the last
5116775 we would like that to be the case there is nothing technologically keeping us from making it so
5116776 one reason people dont exercise is because they feel like it is too strenuous with the wii they get the workout but there isnt that negative feeling
5116777 even if you cant get out and jog you may be able to get the exercise on the wii
5116778 i cant control it so im stuck with what i get
5116779 je ne te parle pas du dilemme qui sest abattu cruellement sur moi tout coup enfin si je vais ten parler un peu quand m me

5116785 et hop jai asperg tout le monde maman elle sest calm e la pleureuse aussi
5116786 theres so much emotion going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
5116787 the beijing olympics has witnessed the greatest olympian of all time michael phelps of the usa
5116788 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
5116789 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
5116790 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
5116791 it cant be described well never ever see it again
5116792 hes a nice guy a good bloke and the last few years ive never seen him change
5116793 its been nothing but an upwards roller coaster and its been nothing but fun
5116794 its like 90 yards of a touchdown it was so close but i didnt have much of a response
5116795 its disappointing i didnt win i have no regrets it certainly was a close race
5116796 rodo amb la c mera a laltura dels ulls i faig que els actors es moguin en el pla

5116798 no visible flaws in her person equating to flawless teeth flawless skin
5116799 never has any media outlet called me to check the athletes ages
5116800 the fig has received confirmation from the international olympic committee that all passports are valid for all gymnasts competing in the beijing olympic games
5116801 stringent control measures are taken at the time of athlete accreditation for all official fig competitions further all athlete ages for the beijing olympic games are consistent with the fig records for all past fig competitions
5116802 he wont have any future in new zealand or anywhere if he cant get sponsorship
5116803 there will be no drives in new zealand and there will be no drives in australia
5116804 women have made a tremendous contribution to the defence of australia for more than 100 years and today are among the leaders in the australian defence force serving in key operational positions
5116805 by the end of the vietnam war more than 68 000 women had served and tens of thousands more volunteered to help australia in times of war there are more than 7000 women serving in todays australian defence force
5116806 over the next two or three quarters we expect uk gdp growth to be slightly negative or zero satisfying the conditions of technical recession
5116807 but the bigger danger of a major uk recession can and must be prevented
5116808 our central scenario envisages that uk bank rate would be cut to 4 75 in the fourth quarter of 2008 followed by an additional cut to 4 5 in the first quarter of 2009
5116809 but if the bank of englands monetary policy committee decides not to cut rates in the next three to six months growth prospects would be worse
5116810 a marked slowdown in uk activity is highly likely over the next 18 months
5116811 a very sharp deceleration in consumer spending growth in reaction to falling house prices and the acute squeeze on household disposable incomes
5116812 you can never let yourself think you have won gold we just had to make sure we got across the finish line safely
5116813 it was fantastic it was not easy having a boat one point behind they were an inspiration
5116814 the high point in our campaign was when we got pippa
5116815 it was the hardest thing for us to get pippa to come sailing with us we needed the perfect person to join the team and then we needed money all of those things came at once it meant we could really get the campaign running and then there was a possibility that we could win a gold medal
5116816 i watched the girls win gold in athens and i wanted it too
5116817 it was about watching the wind and the tide and sailing really well as a team
5116818 winning an olympic gold medal means you are the best at what you do in the world and that feeling is particularly special
5116819 you cannot describe what sarah and i have been through for the past four years together and the last two for pippa and us we know we are the best job done
5116820 there werent any tears but we were quite close when we were being towed along the wall and you could see our supporters the rest of team gb parents and it hit home that we have done something really special and we have done it for them
5116821 its a great start for the team and we are in good positions in a lot of other classes hopefully we can make them count
5116822 i think there must be an element of luck here because it is a very difficult venue all the sailors would say that im very glad to have come through it unscathed
5116823 i think the rate has increased by about 50 times
5116824 if you want to commit suicide it is up to you but you do not have the right to kill your country

5116826 im planning to make a new blog that will fit the criteria ng mga sites
5116827 each cockroach produces 600 babies in their lifetime and we have more than 100 entrants so our success to date is that we are reducing 60 000 cockroaches without using any chemicals at all and thats the beauty of it
5116828 the termite queen is like an egg laying machine so with every queen we get rid of 100 000 termites immediately
5116829 we went out with the soldiers and a lot of them helped us because we know them
5116830 i didnt think we had a winner because a lot of people brought big ones and there were many almost as big as this one
5116831 the prize money is fine but we spent quite a lot of money to get it
5116832 every termite will emit co2 from their gut because when they consume the wood and digest it they get wind
5116833 with every degree the global temperature rises the life cycle of each bug will be shorter the quicker the life cycle the higher the population of pests
5116834 we know very well well not be about to win the war against insects they have been here much longer than us cockroaches were here 350 million years ago
5116835 we used to live plain and simple a wall was a simple brick wall but now we have decorated walls that insects hide behind
5116836 i applied for a job in the late 1960s and was given a choice between marketing and what my poor english thought was
5116837 the first thing id like to do to my mum is just hug her said phelps whose parents separated when he was young
5116838 ive literally seen her for about 30 seconds this whole time
5116839 its been nothing but an upwards rollercoaster but its been nothing but fun
5116840 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination
5116841 the economy and gas prices are always on your mind but michaels success helps you forget depressing things
5116842 if you want to commit suicide it is up to you but you do not have the right to kill your country
5116843 i didnt feel my trigger shaking but i guess it was
5116844 i have not thought about it much this week but nick if you are interested i am keen to play
5116845 el ltimo censo realizado el pasado mes de mayo por la consejer a de medio ambiente de la junta de andaluc a en relaci n a la presencia de lep ridos en esta zona nos ha animado a retomar las actuaciones que llevamos a cabo a principios de a o y que dieron como resultado la reducci n en un 70 por ciento de los da os provocados por conejos
5116846 el t rmino municipal de montilla es el que presenta la densidad de ejemplares m s baja con 93 conejos por kil metro cuadrado
5116847 la colaboraci n prestada por todos los sectores implicados y especialmente por la sociedad de cazadores por las cooperativas y por los agricultores que fueron comunicando los diferentes da os que iban detectando en sus vi edos fue determinante hace unos meses para disminuir la poblaci n de conejos y de liebres hasta el punto de registrarse un 70 por ciento menos de da os que en las dos campa as anteriores
5116848 velar por el equilibrio del ecosistema ya que aunque es verdad que los conejos han sido muy da inos en los vi edos de la zona tampoco podemos olvidar que son precisos para el mantenimiento de nuestro h bitat natural
5116849 respetar en lo posible la vegetaci n de los bardales y de las lindes entre las fincas
5116850 medidas que se est n llevando a cabo con xito en otras comarcas agr colas
5116851 people have been given the power to create their own movies and share them and its opened the gates for other forms of media
5116852 a lot of people enjoy playing games and theyre excited by the idea of making games but they dont know how to go about it
5116853 the desire has been there for a long time but its only now the technology is making it easier to put the power into peoples hands
5116854 its empowering people it makes people feel they made something cool
5116855 what is unique is we do it in a way the casual audience can be the game designer with boom blox anyone can get in there and create
5116856 the games are so huge and expensive these days and theres only so much game you can give a consumer so it makes sense to expand it out to a huge audience of people
5116857 even if only 1 percent of players get into creating thats a ton of content you can offer that extends the life of the game
5116858 a lot of companies turn to youtube to raise awareness of global concerns like renewable energy climate change or poverty now socially conscious businesses are following suit by leveraging their brands to showcase important issues and encourage people to get involved
5116859 its the companys opportunity to get into pretty personal communication and interaction with its own customers
5116860 they strengthen their brand by putting a face to things customers can hear and see them talk
5116861 the earthkeeper channel on youtube is one of several vehicles by which we seek to engage consumers in a dialogue around the environment and climate change
5116862 the reason we chose to sponsor a contest on youtube is because video is such a popular and powerful medium that allows consumers to explore very creative stimulating methods of communicating their messages
5116863 companies have an interest to be perceived as socially responsible but they want to sell their products at the same time
5116864 youtube is a new vehicle and companies are offering these types of media therefore the spots are not completely altruistic theres an element of both selling and doing good
5116865 he not only indicated the problem of climate change but he also set a new form of demonstration short clips brief presentations
5116866 no company can ignore the whole climate problem i have no doubt that the pr department of every company is telling their bosses we have to have a presence because its part of being in business today
5116867 you want to drill we want the royalties for the american people and we want that to pay for renewable energy resources
5116868 to punish anyone who takes part in a political religious or ethnic demonstration or protest in any form at an olympic site during the 2008 beijing games
5116869 there was a 20 percent increase over 2006 in convictions of citizens under chinas overly broad state security law that is often used to silence government critics
5116870 i resign the highest office in the land to become president of the united states
5116871 there is no nation on earth powerful enough to accomplish our overthrow our destruction should it come at all will be from another quarter from the inattention of the people to the concerns of their government from their carelessness and negligence i must confess that i do apprehend some danger i fear that they may place too implicit a confidence in their public servants and fail properly to scrutinize their conduct that in this way they may be made the dupes of designing men and become the instruments of their own undoing
5116872 you switched 1 times more when the doors were shrinking
5116873 people still consider linux to commands line and os meant for geeks and professionals

5116875 the west is losing the new cold war while hardly having noticed that it has started
5116876 she the secretary handed the form back to me and said i had to pick one otherwise someone would pick his race for me
5116877 at first i was shocked that they would say i couldnt check both boxes
5116878 she said the computer system that was just updated takes only one race but so many kids that live here in kenosha are not just white or not just black i cant see how a state can only see one
5116879 im holding out i want a better explanation than what theyve given me
5116880 say for instance if 100 parents decided to leave that part blank or the race couldnt be determined then based on those 100 kids the race would be allocated or distributed based on the racial breakdowns already present in a given district
5116881 i think its a good thing finally there is going to be a change and this has been a long battle
5116882 it kind of shows just how the state of wisconsin stands on biracial children when they make them choose who they are
5116883 im sad because im not only one race im black and im white
5116884 as a means of making men outwardly honest of converting vagabonds most useless in one hemisphere into active citizens in another and thus giving birth to a new and splendid country a grand centre of civilisation it had succeeded to a degree perhaps unparalleled in history
5116885 this year he was a half lap behind hes closing the gap
5116886 every time you come to a meet like this youre excited to run
5116887 afterwards youre even more excited because you see the possibilities its doable
5116888 just because one can see spirit does not mean one can handle a spirit
5116889 if i profess with the loudest voice and clearest exposition every portion of the truth of god except precisely that little point which the world and the devil are at that moment attacking i am not confessing christ however boldly i may be professing christ where the battle rages there the loyalty of the soldier is proved and to be steady on all the battlefield besides is mere flight and disgrace if he flinches at that point
5116890 i cannot and i will not vote for sen john mccain as a matter of conscience
5116891 unfit for command swift boat veterans speak out against john kerry
5116892 shenzhen practice direct election is to election law of concrete implementation is opposition method original intention of revivification
5116893 here is some info but according to what we have heard from several sources this is much more than just an emotional relationship according to staff and former staff members they claim that todd is a pathological liar the board privately has said that todd has been lying to them all along we are praying for those around todd to demand for him to get the help he needs before thrusting him back into ministry like they did 2 5 years ago when he had an affair with a different staff member we are praying for todd his family along with others that have been impacted through this
5116894 so i would have to make out with you to get it
5116895 this movie is the equivlent to metallicas black album josh
5116896 i sometimes think why oh why has velcro not taken off
5116897 i was having a hard time at school in terms of being crap at everything with no discernible talent
5116898 every four years you usually get to look at these guys try to go native think of president bush in his brush clearing outfit
5116899 but if youre president the day job does involve a suit and it can be awkward when youre not in work clothes
5116900 everyone knows how fast a picture can go from local novelty to worldwide laughingstock
5116901 it shows hes not trying to be like everyone else its part of the visual message that hes crafting in an odd little way it adds to the not pandering in a conservative middle america suit like a 50 year old tax lawyer wears
5116902 it would be inappropriate if mccain looked as stylish as obama he has a different physique hes a different age and hes much more conservative
5116903 he does have occasional fun with a wider flashy tie
5116904 not all senators can wear that but it looks right on him

5116939 the kingdom of heaven may be compared to someone who sowed good seed in his field 25but while everybody was asleep an enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and then went away
5116940 the kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that someone took and sowed in his field 32it is the smallest of all the seeds but when it has grown it is the greatest of shrubs and becomes a tree so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches
5116941 the kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed in with three measures of flour until all of it was leavened

5116949 oberon had a meeting yesterday thurs aug 14 with his doctor stephen denigris to discuss the results of the biopsy they did on the golfball sized tumor lesion they discovered during his recent colonoscopy he says it is indeed cancerous and colon cancer is aggressive and nasty however it is far enough up that it can be surgically removed along with about a foot of the descending colon left side he said that it appears to be less than a year old so the chances of a complete removal of all cancerous tissue are excellent there is concern that some of the cancer cells may have migrated into ozs lymph nodes which would be a really serious problem requiring radiation and chemotherapy
5116950 so tomorrow is the full moon and i know that many of you will be doing ritual for oz anyway and id like to see us return to this tradition so im calling a rolling thunder for oberon to begin at 9 pm thats always local time and thats for saturday august 16th for those across the international dateline for whom it is already saturday or if its more convenient to pick it up when it rolls across to sunday august 17th thats fine as well generally we continue the roll for at least 48 hours to accommodate people who hear about the roll late and just to keep pushing the energy and accelerating the wave

5116970 the organizations very nomenclature the national council of la raza is hate speech to the core despite all the contortions of the group raza as its latin cognate suggests reflects the meaning of race in spanish not the people and thats precisely why we dont hear of something like the national council of the people which would not confer the buzz notion of ethnic racial and tribal chauvinism

5116979 at present telephone numbers used primarily for business public use emergency service numbers and fax numbers may not be listed on the do not call register
5116980 the discussion paper seeks community views on whether the eligibility requirements should be expanded to allow the registration of all telephone and fax numbers on the do not call register
5116981 i would encourage all interested stakeholders to participate in this consultation so a range of views can be taken into account

5117006 he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways
5117007 he shall send his angels and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds from the one end of heaven to the other
5117008 they are mine adversaries because i follow the thing that is good
5117009 the tares are the children of the wicked one the harvest is the end of the world the reapers are the angels as therefore the tares are gathered and burnt in the fire so shall it be in the end of the world the son of man shall send forth his angels and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things which offend and them which do iniquity and cast them into a furnace of fire

5117011 neither pray i for these alone but for all them that shall believe in me
5117012 i pray that thou shouldest keep them from the evil
5117013 we live in the world as in a pest house christ prays that his saints may not be infected with the contagious evil of the times

5117036 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins

5117045 unhealthy relationship on an emotional level with a female member of his staff
5117046 studies show that participants disapproved of infidelity that involved sexual intercourse disapproved less of emotional only infidelity and were most disapproving of relationships that involved both sexual activity and emotional connection glass amp wright 1985 thompson 1984

5117086 it would probably have been better and less painful walking but hopefully i havent made the old injury worse because that means i can come back
5117087 no if i felt i was really doing damage i would have stopped but it is horrible when you have to drop out especially when it is the olympic games so many people have worked hard to get me here and in some ways it is quicker to keep going because you are just left out there on your own if you stop somewhere

5117089 the skate park we have now is about 20 years old and while it was a good park when it was built its kind of at the point where it needs to be replaced

5117098 the safir ambassador satellite carrier was launched today and for the first time we successfully launched a dummy satellite into orbit
5117099 this was a step towards the launching of an iranian military satellite but the road is still long
5117100 prestige wise a two kilogram satellite waving an iranian flag in space would be enough but capability wise even if the satellite is launched it will be a tiny research satellite without any real ability
5117101 for 30 years the iranians have failed to launch a project that was both commercially and economically successful
5117102 i can only assume its due to ongoing management and organization difficulties competing iranian institutions that inhibit one another
5117103 the launching of an independent satellite is of great national importance to the iranians and it is definitely a significant part of their missile plan

5117106 but as you have probably gathered by now as wonderful as the physical evidence is this website is not about physical evidence
5117107 rather than use physical evidence to show that the bible is most probably true we again go back to intellectual evidence and logical proof to show that the bible is necessarily true we can know that the bible is true because it claims to be true and proves it by the impossibility of the contrary
5117108 we use rational thought therefore we can know that the bible is true attempting to use logic to try to disprove the only possible source for logic would be self refuting
5117109 the word god is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses the bible a collection of honourable but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish
5117110 rather than use physical evidence to show that the bible is most probably true we again go back to intellectual evidence and logical proof to show that the bible is necessarily true we can know that the bible is true because it claims to be true and proves it by the impossibility of the contrary
5117111 the rudd government is serious about attracting and encouraging sustainable development opportunities for australias vast north and this meeting with community and business leaders in cairns is an important part of the process
5117112 gaining an understanding of local views and priorities is critical to northern australias ongoing development and its economic social and environmental prosperity
5117113 the government is committed to working closely with northern jurisdictions including local government as well as business and communities to achieve the best possible outcomes for northern australia

5117116 the national e health transition authority nehta has identified some valuable privacy considerations for the proposed iehr system
5117117 the suggestion that individuals should be able to opt in to an iehr system is welcome as this promotes genuine choice
5117118 it is also important that there is specific legislation for the system to ensure there are robust privacy protections in place
5117119 my office argues strongly in favour of sensitivity labels being in place at the start of the project
5117120 this would be of prime importance to say a patient who is suffering a sensitive condition such as a mental or sexual illness
5117121 the sensitivity label would prevent a healthcare worker in an area unrelated to the patients illness from accessing this information
5117122 it is a priority of the rudd government to reinvigorate australias trans tasman links given their fundamental importance
5117123 this year marks the 25th anniversary of the very successful cer trade agreement between australia and new zealand which is internationally recognised as a model for its quality and comprehensiveness
5117124 cer has underpinned a major mutually beneficial expansion and deepening of trans tasman economic links
5117125 addressing the lack of specific cer provisions enshrining a liberal regime for trans tasman investment flows will improve what is already recognised internationally as a model trade agreement
5117126 both phil goff and i were heartened by the significant progress made in geneva last month as committed members of both the wto and the cairns group we are keen to secure a successful conclusion to the round

5117128 the rudd government strongly values our excellent relationship with new zealand and todays meeting was yet another indication of the way in which we are continuing to deepen our trade and economic integration for the benefit of both nations

5117137 i feel it most when we eat together because the food on the table is not enough

5117139 the lack of an unambiguous population policy reflects a lack of seriousness in promoting long term economic growth and
5117140 our studies show that if the philippines had followed the population growth trajectory of thailand between 1975 and 2000 the per capita income would have been at least 22 percent higher and there would have been 5 million less poor people
5117141 the catholic church knows how to mobilize its members not to vote for anti life politicians
5117142 some priests and some lay ministers were calling me an abortionist they were calling me a worker of satan

5117154 its not how young you are its how old you arent
5117155 while the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5117156 no that is not the case the 1970 camaro is in fact the first of the second generation camaros there might be some parts interchangeability with the 69 camaro but a 1970 camaro has more in common with a 1981 camaro or a 1976 nova platform wise than it does with a 1969 camaro
5117157 the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5117158 you can make these up to one week in advance

5117167 it was a lot of hard work and it took us four years to get there
5117168 it was almost as if i announced we had a death in the family
5117169 i always joke that were chemists in a chemistry lab we tweak things and if something doesnt work we throw it out and try something different
5117170 we want people that want to teach they enjoy working with children and theyre always willing to develop and try new things we pick and choose people who would work well with our team
5117171 we didnt really spend a whole lot of time on that
5117172 we went in with our game plan and we worked with it

5117199 in areas where there is no csa office these private appointments give parents the opportunity to discuss any issues or concerns about child support face to face with a customer service officer
5117200 the impact of separation can be overwhelming and parents will have many concerns as everyone in the family adjusts to their new circumstances but with the goodwill and cooperation of both parents many families manage the challenges very well
5117201 its important for parents to get access to the support services they need and understand all their options when it comes to child support
5117202 there will be free csa information booklets available about all aspects of separated parenting including maintaining a relationship with kids from a distance and tips and hints for people who are re partnering
5117203 the rudd government is serious about attracting and encouraging sustainable development opportunities for australias vast north and this meeting with community and business leaders in normanton is an important part of the process
5117204 gaining an understanding of local views and priorities is critical to northern australias ongoing development and its economic social and environmental prosperity
5117205 the government is committed to working closely with northern jurisdictions including local government as well as business and communities to achieve the best possible outcomes for northern australia
5117206 talking directly to people in normanton and representatives from surrounding shires gives me a greater understanding of the critical issues and challenges they are currently facing
5117207 these meetings will help guide the office of northern australias future priorities and inform future regional policy development
5117208 its a show about life and love and the message that love might not come from the most conventional place and it might defy class structure but if its true then breaking convention is your only option

5117237 there are many things about 1734 that are different the placement of the elements the firm dedication that the clan is ones spiritual family the necessary shamanic essence and not believing in the goddess but knowing her as an every day part of your life we are a religion of life and vitality and we hold all life in respect and reverence above all else we choose to live in harmony and balance we do not claim an actual dogmatic descent as far back as neolithic times wiccans retain the spirit of the ancient ways of reverence in a way similar though not related to some native american traditions and ideals
5117238 self reliance creativity study and independent thinking are hallmarks of the tradition
5117239 a positive life affirming spirituality a non dualist non racist non sexist non exclusivist bi polar ecologically oriented faith dedicated to the preservation of holy mother earth the revival of the worship of the old gods in a modern context the achievement of the fullest of human potentials and the creation of a peaceful world of love freedom health and prosperity for all sentient beings
5117240 usually magick oriented with an additional focus on of the divinity of each participant and honoring the goddess and god
5117241 the name new reformed orthodox order of the golden dawn was coined since it was a wholly new tradition it was orthodox since it took its beliefs from the ancients and it was a magical order as was the hermetic order of the golden dawn nroogd considered themselves their spiritual and magical successors
5117242 our religion does not concern itself solely with the gods and goddesses we seek the old mysteries of the land and honor the landvaettir land spirits who dwell in the trees and rocks and are tied to the land and waters we also honor our ancestors both those who have gone to the other worlds and those such as the disir who remain connected to middle earth in order to watch over and protect their families we of the asatru believe that the goal of living is to lead a worthwhile and useful life and we reject both the decaying fabric of modern culture as well as the phony moralisms of those who would plunge us back to the dark ages our values are based on individual liberty tempered with responsibility as outlined in the nine noble virtues courage truth honor fidelity discipline hospitality industriousness self reliance and perseverance in keeping with this independent spirit we reject religious hierarchy and dogma even as we respect learned teachers and the ways of our faith
5117243 adf was founded on the principle of open and free neopagan worship we believe the gods and goddesses are real and that their worship should not be limited to a select few rituals magic and lore are things everyone should be able to experience and create while we often hold a variety of opinions we are unified and committed to providing a well researched and completely open tradition of druidry for anyone seeking the old ways
5117244 our approach to the reconstruction of the old faith is to begin with the earliest evidence we have of the nature of this faith and to proceed carefully to modern times incorporating parts from all along the historical and pre historical spectrum in this way we hope to overcome the disadvantage of the christian interlude and restore some semblance of continuity in our ceremonies you will find the obervance of the honor pledges which have taken the place of the sacrifices of less gentle times and the recognition of the devoted ones of our tribe our ceremonial artifacts and regalia are historically authentic reproductions whenever possible of the actual items used by the ancient druids and celts of europe and the british isles
5117245 do as thou wilt shall be the whole of the law thou hast no right but to do thy will
5117246 the illuminates of thanateros are the drinkers of the dual ecstacises of sex and death gnosis the most important techniques are those which adjust subconscious belief subconscious belief controls both the self or selves and the world so long as this is never forgotten one can structure a ritual or spell with just about any form of symbolism from tibetan tantra to icelandic runelore chaos magic boldly encourages the meta tradition which takes anything and everything that is effective from all traditions to create an explosive mixture so on with the pursuit of the great work of magic with whatever forms of techno shamanism tantric goetia or greco egyptian quantum physics we can make work for us

5117402 im just going to see if angel wants to dance
5117403 also you shouldnt be here my tribe has booked this whole hotel for their reunion
5117404 my names lorraine im what you might call a gypsy except not exactly im from well all over but i was born in prague and spent most of my childhood in arizona

5117406 im sorry i was having a good nap when you woke me not quite me yet
5117407 i was just surprised to see anyone out here most of the people here are old and boring and dislike swimming pools so i was almost as surprised as you were to see a lovely creature like you gracing this humble spread
5117408 usually id have escaped the weird by now but youre also cute and american and my age three things tuscany lacks hardcore
5117409 ive noticed that when i get anywhere near my romani relatives i suddenly become a public speaker

5117413 im not going to die i dont want to die it would wreck my social life
5117414 i can see it in your eyes i can smell it on your skin
5117415 tell me it involves christian bale and a palatial villa on the beach

5117420 not vampires cordelia though you should watch out for a few of them
5117421 this is what i can tell you whoever she was watch out for her shes the only one who can save you but she might kill you in the meantime
5117422 i think you might have a charmed life or something plus the teflon ego
5117423 if this is charmed then i totally dont want to see uncharmed
5117424 i noticed how the sexy dance was all about angel except the part where it totally wasnt
5117425 i mean not like i want to be your co mascot in the slayer pride parade or anything but that was bitchy you made everyone hate you in less than five minutes
5117426 it was pretty damn effective except that youre you and didnt take the hint that i was a hetero ho bag
5117427 i dont let people brush me off without getting in a last word
5117428 besides you were being stupid i can handle other things but that was just like hi and im a six year old with issues
5117429 you were the only one brave enough to come after me
5117430 and you pissed me off pretty hard and i dont let that go well i mean you didnt even give me the look of shared drunken groping shame that was harsh
5117431 so was telling me how you dont like me that much
5117432 i dont though i mean well i do sort of but we dont like each other i mean not like and really not like you know
5117433 in an alternate dimension far far away maybe there is a buffy and cordelia

5117435 and ill always be there to save you from the legions of demons and vamps who seem to want the pleasure of your company
5117436 as solzhenitsyn stared at the cross drawn in the dirt his entire perspective changed he knew he was only one man against the all powerful soviet empire yet he knew there was something greater than the evil he saw in the prison camp something greater than the soviet union he knew that hope for all people was represented by that simple cross through the power of the cross anything was possible

5117447 we have agreed that mr mugabe will be president whilst i become prime minister a prime minister cannot be given responsibility without authority and be expected to deliver

5117453 mccain will have problems getting a high turnout among those voters unless he finds some way to identify with them some way to make them think that a hes not connected to bush and b his economic plan is superior to obamas
5117454 john mccain continues to hear the concerns of rural families thats why he has made every effort to engage these voters on his plans to create jobs and provide relief for working families

5117461 bilateral relations have reached a stage where leaders can exchange views in a frank and candid manner on a broad range of issues and they dont have to avoid discussing anything
5117462 while i was shopping just across the street i heard a huge explosion
5117463 body parts were flying through the air i immediately realized that farooqs party was targeted and he was probably dead
5117464 we had received information that we would be targeted by groups within azamiyah and within the awakening movement itself
5117465 hello world oh jeez sorry its just me in here
5117466 that they all get the concept of growing and eating fresh vegetables
5117467 you told her that yourself that they all converged on her maybe maybe she wasnt meant to be there

5117475 cenotaph london november the 9th remembrance sunday were going can you organise a government parking space for the suv
5117476 cant believe this is only the first time weve been asked though ive never been invited to the legions festival of remembrance either

5117480 i remember the first year i wore one of these stabbed myself god knows how many times getting the damn thing into my greatcoat
5117481 but the blood on your fingers reminded you that you were alive jack
5117482 thats the one they recite at the festival of remembrance isnt it
5117483 thats right september 1914 when the war was less than two months old everyone was so enthusiastic and they all thought it would be over by christmas i knew different though and couldnt say a damn word
5117484 lets get back to saving the world from aliens then kids

5117488 mmmm no doubt shag mr darcy all wet shirt and grumpiness
5117489 just maintenance gotta be a bit better about that now that i cant take her home for a tune up whenever she needs it
5117490 had a dream didnt want to go back to sleep right away
5117491 it was a good dream i just wanted to hang onto it for a little longer
5117492 not as much as id like really at first the first few weeks it was hard waking up in our bed and remembering that he was gone but it isnt as hard now and i like the dreams theyre the only way ill ever see him again in this life at least
5117493 sometimes i forget youre a theist you think theres something after this then
5117494 in my better moments yes you dont i take it
5117495 my people didnt go in much for theology they sort of
5117496 i cant seem to manage the good dreams its all fire and daleks and i dont know if id want to anyway there are too many
5117497 i guess after nine hundred years that would be the case
5117498 and it just seems to follow me everywhere i go
5117499 so it seems everyone keeps insisting otherwise but the truth is that i wouldnt have to go about fixing everything if i didnt seem to break anything i touch
5117500 do you think that its possible just possible that your semi immortality may have given you a skewed perspective on the subject
5117501 from the moment i met and fell in love with aral i knew this is where i would be some day he was ten years older and he came from a planet with a life expectancy forty years shorter than my own if you think youre the only person to have ever loved someone knowing you would lose them well think again death follows everyone doctor
5117502 there are quite a few possibilities to choose from after all
5117503 and i dont think its important to know or even think you know not as important as believing that something does that this isnt it
5117504 thats all right and its also all right to tell me when youre having one of those days
5117505 where would you like to go tomorrow past future somewhere far beyond the bounds of your nexus
5117506 actually i think it might be time i went home just to visit
5117507 if we aim for two months after i left we can arrive just in time for gregors birthday celebrations there are some truly spectacular fireworks
5117508 i do love fireworks course best time for fireworks on barrayar is actually about six hundred years in the future but the ones over the river in your time are quite nice too
5117509 there you are did i promise you a beach or didnt i
5117510 its no fun at a beach if you cant feel the sand between your toes is it safe
5117511 how should i know everywhere we go seems to be dangerous for all i know this sand tries to eat you or something
5117512 look im taking off my shoes if the sand tries to attack me just save yourself
5117513 weve only been here five minutes ill hold off on that verdict for a bit its not my first day with you after all
5117514 well trouble does seem to find me ill grant you that
5117515 does the trouble find you or do you find the trouble you reckon
5117516 now dya see what i was trying to tell ya we can i dont understand how tbe honest i dont really care how its possible think the tardis may have something to do with it but it is possible if you want
5117517 i know ive always known deep down but earlier i wanted to show you how much and you saying no well it hurt a lot especially as i knew the tardis told me what she had done so that i could stay with you but you wouldnt listen would you
5117518 im sorry rose i didnt know its what ive always wanted a life with you and i knew i couldnt have it
5117519 but now oh rose now i can we can oh i have such dreams for us rose such dreams as you can never imagine
5117520 harmless you said just need an understanding ear you said they werent looking for understanding they were looking for lunch
5117521 now come on shake a leg unless youre looking forward to being yniac lunch
5117522 is that gonna be your excuse every time you cock it up then
5117523 whinging wont fix it now rose nothing for it but to follow the plan and lure it into a deserted area until help arrives come on then up these stairs i think i hear it coming
5117524 yniac are not the most intelligent of creatures rose he knows that we came into this building but he doesnt have the sense of smell of a tracker nor is he likely to think of opening closed doors he should just wander the building endlessly confused that should give jake enough time to follow our signal and get some backup out here to capture it
5117525 yes well they dont have a very refined sense of smell but they are particularly good at hearing so we just need to keep quiet and well be fine
5117526 well to start with i cant remember anytime i was hiding with the other you that included you feeling me up
5117527 rose doctor where are you wait im getting a signal over here guys
5117528 rose doctor there you are all clear weve got the beastie in a containment unit and the boys are loading it onto a truck as we speak you know you really ought to look into carrying some blasters so you dont have to keep hiding in closets its not very torchwood you know running and hiding youll give us a bad name
5117529 ah but jake the running and hiding is half the fun
5117530 make sure those containment units are sent directly to the green unit jake what this guy lacks in smarts he makes up for in determination i dont want him getting loose before we can figure out a way of getting him home
5117531 sometimes maybe i put off making decisions that maybe i should have taken earlier
5117532 to make decisions in the long term interests of the country you have to take quite tough decisions quite early on so that you can get things done within the life of a parliament
5117533 i absolutely believe that if wed have had that election that gordon brown would no longer have been prime minister and that the conservatives would have been the largest party in a hung parliament
5117534 brown compounded calling off the election by then saying it was nothing to do with the polls which was a massive mistake it was a lie and it was treating people like fools
5117535 it was a big roll of the dice to do it without any notes no autocue no funny business there was a moment when i lost my train of thought but no one really noticed
5117536 i regret that my government driver took some of my papers home while i was on my bike
5117537 the problems are not confined to large institutions that are overexposed to u s subprime loans

5117544 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation is that clear enough
5117545 why did saakashvili take on russia with 10 000 soldiers maybe he was thinking somebody would help us but nobody did we hope saakashvili disappears from georgia because hes a bastard
5117546 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed 10 ossetian villages at once these leaders must be taken under protection
5117547 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
5117548 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation is that clear enough

5117553 the government has squandered an opportunity to deal with cumulative impacts that were understood eight to ten years ago
5117554 the message that was coming from the alberta cabinet in particular was rapid development
5117555 a lot of work has been done to explore different options and gather scientific input
5117556 it shouldnt make any difference where you live there ought to be a common basis for making decisions about exceptional circumstances and i think anybody who uses the nhs for their care is entitled to expect that
5117557 if you have a patient from cheshire they have a very good record most of the time we apply to cheshire they tend to fund patients that have exceptional circumstances if we apply to the manchester primary care trust then in the eight applications weve made theyve only accepted one for funding in 2006

5117559 2009 will be my fortieth year of playing tennis thirty seventh year of teaching tennis and thirty fourth year of coaching for my living
5117560 2009 will be my twenty third year of involvement in ministry ministry is much different than coaching tennis people have to trust you over skill acquisition in sports you can be a great coach a lousy person and still succeed but in ministry you can not be a great pastor a lousy person and succeed over a period of years you build a number of relationships with people who want to work alongside you and are in agreement with your methods this is success in ministry who works along side tells you everything about that person

5117628 streaming is a technique that processes a file in a continuous flow this allows the file to be displayed on a browser or player before its entirely transmitted unlike a downloaded file a streamed file is not stored on the users hard drive this makes a more attractive format for paid content distribution
5117629 method of making video audio and other multimedia available relatively quickly via the internet
5117630 the video file is never actually downloaded since the packets are discarded after they have been decoded and viewed because the timing of packet arrival is so important streaming servers use the realtime transport protocol rtp instead of the http protocol normally used for web content rtp uses udp instead of ip for transport with no attempt to retransmit lost packets this also allows the content to be multicast potentially reducing server load considerably
5117631 the percentage of companies using streaming video to promote product launches online will increase from 29 to 35 during the next 18 months whats more while only 13 of companies currently use streaming video to enhance their online customer service this number is expected to jump to 45 in the next 18 months

5117648 then hes got the nerve to stand up there on television and talk about how he believes in alternative energy its just not true
5117649 are you gonna have somebody whos going to tell you the truth about how were gonna change america or somebody whos gonna run the same old tired campaigns that have been run every few years

5117652 when home sales began to slow at the start of the downturn home builders offered buyers incentives instead of reducing prices to stimulate demand the incentives included cars tuition and credit card payments and even cash a sign is posted in front of a bank owned home that is for sale in richmond calif now federal investigators are questioning whether some of those incentives misled lenders and caused them to write mortgages that were artificially inflated contributing to todays home price crash

5117654 we know it happened on more than a few occasions where the intent was to obtain financing that the borrower would not have otherwise qualified for it is fraudulent that banks should have been more proactive in protecting against this form of deception is no excuse

5117657 the kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that someone took and sowed in his field 32it is the smallest of all the seeds but when it has grown it is the greatest of shrubs and becomes a tree so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches
5117658 the kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed in with three measures of flour until all of it was leavened
5117659 i will open my mouth to speak in parables i will proclaim what has been hidden from the foundation of the world
5117660 explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field
5117661 the one who sows the good seed is the son of man 38the field is the world and the good seed are the children of the kingdom the weeds are the children of the evil one 39and the enemy who sowed them is the devil the harvest is the end of the age and the reapers are angels 40just as the weeds are collected and burned up with fire so will it be at the end of the age 41the son of man will send his angels and they will collect out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers 42and they will throw them into the furnace of fire where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth 43then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their father let anyone with ears listen 44 the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field which someone found and hid then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field 45 again the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls 46on finding one pearl of great value he went and sold all that he had and bought it 47 again the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and caught fish of every kind 48when it was full they drew it ashore sat down and put the good into baskets but threw out the bad 49so it will be at the end of the age the angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous 50and throw them into the furnace of fire where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth 51 have you understood all this
5117662 therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old

5117665 the moment of my life when the dowsing rod suddenly went down hard as far as i was concerned i was on my way
5117666 at the end it was just shut the eyes and keep pounding away
5117667 i knew the greeks were coming but there was just so much belief
5117668 you do whatever you can and what we had wasnt enough
5117669 the british quad did everything we hoped of them but those chinese produced something incredible
5117670 im proud of what ive done im just disappointed with the medal we got
5117671 you wish youd won it but i just won silver and i rowed in the most enjoyable crew i ever rowed in the best nine guys and two coaches
5117672 we used our get out of jail card but must admit thought we had blown it when shaun didnt pass to ben and give him the monday morning headlines
5117673 we were well in control but dropped too much ball and eventually ran out of gas we played dumb at times and need to put that right
5117674 we saw qin go with his easy routine and i felt good about going with my difficult one
5117675 then i saw him split his legs and i knew that little mistake meant there were medals up for grabs

5117678 russian troops should leave georgia and we have an understanding to this end with russian president dmitry medvedev
5117679 now these principles should be accepted by georgia and need to be followed with guarantees from russia the council of europe and the osce the organization for security and cooperation in europe i hope this will happen in the near future we expect relevant information
5117680 u s military transport aircraft are reported to have been airlifting some humanitarian cargoes to tbilisi airport
5117681 the position of the russian federation is unchanged we shall support any decision the people of south ossetia and abkhazia will make in conformity with the united nations charter the international convention of 1966 and the helsinki act on security and cooperation in europe
5117682 i listened to george bushs statement and was surprised the facts he cited are untrue

5117686 heres a woman thats successful takes care of herself looks amazing and she took the steps to get there it doesnt happen unless you take charge shes a great role model for many many women
5117687 when i was in my 30s 50 just seemed so ancient to me
5117688 i was in high school when she hit it big
5117689 now that her first young fans are in their 30s we look at madonna as sort of a harbinger of the future for us and the future looks pretty good
5117690 is that aging is not the inevitability that we might have assumed by watching our fathers now in their 50s and 60s madonna is proof that exercising and eating right at an early age pays off
5117691 i want to know who her doctor is its really hard to believe shes 50 she looks 40 and she just keeps going at it living life and loving life
5117692 put a picture of a 50 year old woman today next to one from my mothers generation
5117693 we look at least 10 to 15 years younger than they did
5117694 also 50 really is a new beginning for so many women
5117695 many have accomplished a number of their goals already their children are getting older for the first time they can really think about themselves and ask what do i want from life
5117696 as the cliche goes i guess its better than the alternative
5117697 i just dont feel like what 50 should feel like
5117698 i remember my grandmother at 50 her hair was completely white my mother too was just at a very different place in her life than i am now
5117699 shes done a remarkable job of marketing herself and shes always been able to reinvent herself
5117700 im sure shes happy to be an inspiration to women and men of any age
5117701 is not quite the benchmark for her as it seems to be in the media who have been talking about her 50th since she turned 40
5117702 even a good trend worn on the wrong person is a bad trend
5117703 i have to say that the mega shoulder pads werent the most attractive
5117704 women loved and continue to love them because they made their hips look smaller
5117705 i think ponchos look ridiculous they make people look like a tent
5117706 you see them at american apparel in bronze or orange and i wonder who looks good in that show me the one woman who looks good in that i think weve lost it
5117707 mini s meant that women could stride along and were no longer encumbered by hemlines that was very liberating and inventive
5117708 john fairchild forcing the midi in 1967 hurt the fashion world
5117709 who wanted those hobbling lengths after a decade of liberation
5117710 without a doubt the ultra low rise jean with the belly baring cropped midriff tank top is the worst look ever
5117711 a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5117712 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5117713 we know very well that the inguri hydropower plant supplies electricity to dozens of thousands of georgian and abkhaz homes and we are well aware that strategic facilities of this kind could be targeted in provocations and even terror attacks

5117718 every thought we think changes our biochemistry your hormones are all effected by your thoughts pay attention to things that bring you joy when i read the newspaper i look for the good news
5117719 we believe in the separation of church and state but we do not believe in the separation of faith and politics
5117720 i dont happen to agree with everything either of the candidates teach or believe but they both care deeply about america theyre both patriots and they have very different views on how our nation can be strengthened weve got to learn to disagree without demonizing each other and we need to restore civility in our civil discourse and thats the goal of the saddleback civil forum
5117721 it means i believe that jesus christ died for my sins and that i am redeemed through him that is a source of strength and sustenance on a daily basis i know that i dont walk alone but what it also means i think is a sense of obligation to embrace not just words but also through deeds and expectations that god has for us and that means thinking about the least of these acting justly loving mercy and walking humbly with our god
5117722 our judeo christian principles dictate that we do what we can to help people who are oppressed throughout the world i would like to tell you that i still think that even in the worst places in the world today they still harbor this hope and dream someday to be like us and have freedom and democracy we remain my friends the most unusual experiment in history and im privileged to spend every day of my life in it i know what it is like to be without it
5117723 at what point is a baby entitled to human rights
5117724 at the moment of conception i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5117725 i am pro choice because ultimately i dont think women make these decisions casually rather they wrestle with these things in profound ways
5117726 one of the greatest freedoms we have here in america is the freedom of speech even the freedom to protest this meeting thats a good thing but we have to learn how to have civility in our civilization how to stop being rude how to stop demonizing each other and how to have a discussion and a debate because we all want america to be a greater place
5117727 its just so hard because were still living with it every day were working with his creative contribution
5117728 as we stand here today there are animators who are animating
5117729 we were so proud of the work that he has done and the contribution that hes made and one of the things is that hes never actually going to ever see what an amazing gift he gave to us
5117730 when i look at my children the indescribable beauty in their small movements the way they bow their head into my chest each unique little moment so unprecedented those are moments of pure free form in the shape of life
5117731 oh now theyre really gonna get it now theyre gonna finally spend the money appropriately on a strong business model
5117732 about the criticism that he offers a sort of glib new age christianity
5117733 the bibles theme is about redemption and atonement not finding meaning and solving problems
5117734 the average message i teach on a weekend contains fourteen passages of scripture i am a multi generation pastor which many of these critics dont i am a bible scholar ive had six years of greek and hebrew they dont know what theyre talking about
5117735 now ive got three advanced degrees ive had four years in greek and hebrew and ive got doctorates
5117736 the small group structure is the structure of renewal in every facet of christianity including catholicism
5117737 the first reformation begun by martin luther was about the creeds i e doctrine our doctrines were established by the first reformation
5117738 the small group structure is the structure of renewal in every facet of christianity including catholicism
5117739 the saddleback civil forum changes the face of american politics pastor rick warren stakes out common ground for the common good in presumptive presidential nominees first joint appearance
5117740 we believe in the separation of church and state but we do not believe in the separation of faith and politics
5117741 i dont happen to agree with everything either of the candidates teach or believe but they both care deeply about america theyre both patriots and they have very different views on how our nation can be strengthened
5117742 weve got to learn to disagree without demonizing each other and we need to restore civility in our civil discourse and thats the goal of the saddleback civil forum
5117743 the two hour event attended by nearly 5 000 church members in the main auditorium and remote overflow venues began with warren posing questions first to sen
5117744 of inquiry into four categories including stewardship leadership worldview and americas role in the world the questions covered a wide range of topics ranging from the candidates values vision and virtues as applied to many of the critical issues of interest to the faith community and general public including a discussion on abortion traditional marriage stem cell research education religious persecution world orphans the theory of evil in the world and their vision for the future of america at home and abroad
5117745 when warren asked obama about what christianity means to him on a daily basis the senator responded
5117746 if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not practice the truth
5117747 but what it also means i think is a sense of obligation to embrace not just words but also through deeds and expectations that god has for us
5117748 and that means thinking about the least of these acting justly loving mercy and walking humbly with our god
5117749 in response to that same question about his personal christian faith mccain replied
5117750 i admire the islam theres a lot of good principles in it
5117751 i would like to tell you that i still think that even in the worst places in the world today they still harbor this hope and dream someday to be like us and have freedom and democracy
5117752 we remain my friends the most unusual experiment in history and im privileged to spend every day of my life in it i know what it is like to be without it
5117753 at what point is a baby entitled to human rights
5117754 at the moment of conception i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5117755 i am pro choice because ultimately i dont think women make these decisions casually
5117756 after both candidates had departed the stage warren concluded the evening by reminding the live television radio and internet audiences that
5117757 i appeal to you brothers to watch out for those who cause divisions and create obstacles contrary to the doctrine that you have been taught avoid them 18 for such persons do not serve our lord christ but their own appetites and by smooth talk and flattery they deceive the hearts of the naive
5117758 the saddleback civil forum was established to promote civil discourse and the common good of all
5117759 relieving chronic pain may just be the most misunderstood concept in healthcare unfortunately the story of specialist pain services in scotland is one of chronic failure it mirrors all too often the experience of patients being fobbed off with even higher doses of painkillers and the promise of future help which never materialises
5117760 one of the problems here in scotland is that the service is fragmented
5117761 people have to go all over the place to find appropriate services for them there is not equal access for everyone
5117762 from my meetings with people who are living with chronic pain i take the message that what counts most is having their pain recognised and to be cared for by professionals who project a sense of empathy and of optimism that the pain can be managed
5117763 because we recognise this as extremely important to patients and their families the scottish government has accepted the recommendation from nhs quality improvement scotland that chronic pain should be recognised as a long term condition in its own right
5117764 going in a city with tiles and cement and invading it this is the most addictive game i have ever played
5117765 i guess that was my way to be an artist its linked to my personality
5117766 that was in paris at the end of the 90s that was a kind of an accident because i was not involved in graffiti or street art it was just an idea which came to me because at this time i was doing some canvas made with mosaic tiles in a digital aesthetic i realized that the mosaic tiles were a perfect medium to be put on walls and outside in the streets
5117767 i just remember that i hated practicing sports i was more sex drugs and rock n roll i grew up in a suburb of paris i was interested in punk music i didnt know what else to do and like anybody else i had to find something to do in my life
5117768 i use a rubiks cube like a painter uses paint they are my color palettes and by twisting hundreds of them i create a canvas i like this idea because it is totally unexpected but the result is awesome
5117769 i dont expect anything special from onlookers i like the idea that there are as many reactions as onlookers
5117770 i never tell the name of the next city i can say that i have never been in south america i really have to go there one of these days
5117771 sometimes people understand the language a bit but usually they dont care they just want to enjoy the music which is really easy to do
5117772 i try to impress myself first or just be happy with what ive done i also like to make people smile and appreciate my artwork
5117773 it was quite easy to produce this hoody all over print is easy to print from now on the challenge is to do attractive garments without patterns no
5117774 hey ill try to write the most abstract biography ever
5117775 there are also a lot of advantages to the net but if you mess up online and talk shit in some discussion forum then i think you can get into some real trouble down the line
5117776 truth emerges too late for kim gerry the more things change the more they top commentators
5117777 i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get how many things that are so smart its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie didnt get it still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy im like i get it this is so high brow and so fucking smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie you know what fuck dc comics thats all i have to say and thats where im really coming from
5117778 goal is also more of the same in iron man 2 we want to do what worked for us last time im talking about telling more of the story of a guy put in extraordinary circumstances who has a family now and hes dealing with these forces
5117779 we havent committed to any change at dc at this point
5117780 the properties into viable movie product in an intelligent way so that we introduce them like planes on a runway they have to be set up the right way and lined up the right way and all take off one at a time and fly safe and fly straight
5117781 theres a massive interest and knowledge in the comic book industry and it takes time to sort of catch up and understand the characters and the history where theyve intersected with each other and what their worlds are thats part of the education that were going through
5117782 we have no idea where chris is going with this
5117783 a guy whos really just the sort of macgyver type
5117784 its a very very awesome prison i majored in architecture in college and design is how i actually started in for super max designing that prison it had to be the kind of thing that was a character in and of itself
5117785 were in a world where instead of just trying to contain a guy whos really big youre trying to contain a guy who can in the case of icicle who can freeze things what kind of a cell would a guy like that need in order to have his powers neutralized so to escape from super max they have got to go through the most elaborate heist weve ever seen involving superpowers because the prison itself kind of has superpowers
5117786 snyder and co have pulled it off remember that feeling of watching sin city on the big screen and being blown away by what a faithful translation of the source material it was in terms of both content and visuals triple that and youll come close to watching watchmen even alan moore might be surprised at how close the movie is to the book march cant come soon enough
5117787 yeah i think its a great idea for freddy if they use billy bob he will reinterpret the character and thats what you want you dont want somebody just copying me
5117788 we look at it as a different dimension the laws of physics are different here is not science fiction at all its much more attuned to mythology to psychology to history than it is to science
5117789 i think the audience would be insulted if you did because then you feel this obvious pressure to appeal
5117790 to keep them occupied and give them an outlet for privacy theyve been given these virtual reality modules

5117807 we have assumed that for the first 72 hours we should rely on no one but ourselves because thats how long it takes for help to come

5117813 the major difference between a thing that might go wrong and a thing that cannot possibly go wrong is that when a thing that cannot possibly go wrong goes wrong it usually turns out to be impossible to get at or repair

5117822 your happiness and your pleasure is entirely up to you you have to work and earn it and install your own moral values
5117823 complaint of the west against radical islam why do they have to keep asking god why cant they as it were make up their own minds well its much harder to install your own moral values than to have them imposed by other people or by the system
5117824 the project of the west the nietzschean project has been to drive out religion and to produce a secular society in which men and women make their own values because morality is gone then suddenly radical religion returns from the third world how can you not laugh at that how can you not find that a deep historical irony

5117839 furthermore in april 2006 the four priests making this presentation with our bishop and two other priests of our diocese met with bernard cardinal law at his residence in rome at that meeting we discussed our plight with him
5117840 there are currently 60 active clergy we believe 9 will opt to stay in the episcopal church 51 will remain in a temporarily realigned diocese with the southern cone 5 are not interested at this time in working for full communion 46 are truly interested if we add our seminarians currently on the priesthood track and our retired clergy the number becomes 59
5117841 our best guess is that approximately 59 clergy are willing to pursue an active plan to bring the diocese of fort worth or a significant portion of it into full communion with the holy see if this be gods will

5117872 terrorism goes against the common interests of the people of all ethnic groups in china
5117873 it is a crime conducted by only a small group of people and is not due to ethnic or religious problems
5117874 curbing terrorism in accordance with the law will help us to win support from all ethnic groups and enhance unity
5117875 i am very disappointed by some articles and some news about china and the criticism of the games
5117876 for example i read that the sun never shines in beijing but when i look out of my window there it is
5117877 i really hope they understand why the ioc was right to bring the games to beijing because china will definitely be more open afterward
5117878 this has truly been a green olympics in which development has been achieved with an emphasis on environmental suitability
5117879 it is one of the great legacies of the games the people of china will reap the benefits for years to come

5117882 eight gold medals and 17 medals in total in one weekend is a superb and unprecedented achievement
5117883 the whole country has been watching and has been thrilled by team gb we are immensely proud of what they have achieved so far and inspired by their performance

5117900 it has come to our attention that representatives of hamed ehadadi an iranian basketball player may be contacting nba teams to discuss the possibility of signing mr ehadadi to an nba player contract
5117901 we have been advised that a federal statue prohibits a person or organization in the united states from engaging in business dealings with iranian nationals
5117902 its our pleasure for one player from iran to one day play in the nba
5117903 i am sure he will play there this season because he has played great at the olympics he is a talented player he is ok for beginning in the nba after practicing a few years you will see that he will be one of the great players
5117904 the iranian basketball federation supports him to play in the best situation for his basketball career
5117905 we would like for him to go to a place where he will play not sit on the bench thats very important for our basketball and also for him
5117906 the league office has sent a letter to its 30 teams instructing that they are forbidden to even discuss a contract with ehadadi

5117925 indeed the real false belief maker in this situation is not the biologically innate neural structure in humans but rather the practice of philosophy
5117926 could you be mistaken about your c fibers seeming to fire
5117927 what neural event is that of c fibers seeming to fire
5117928 are there any neural states which are concomitant with c fibers seeming to fire
5117929 its just as if my c fibers were being stimulated
5117930 the fact that seems to seem is an expression without a use is a fact about the notion of appearance not a tip off to the presence of phenomenal properties for the appearance reality distinction is not based on a distinction between subjective representations and objective states of affairs it is merely a matter of getting something wrong having a false belief
5117931 the antipodeans do not have the notion of entities known incorrigibly but only of reports which are incorrigible and which may be about any sort of entity
5117932 no better way of finding out whether somebody is in pain than by asking him and that nothing can overrule his own sincere report
5117933 eliminative and reductive materialism should both be abandoned and with them the notion of mind body identity
5117934 this amounts to saying once again that the materialist should stop reacting to stories such as that about the antipodeans by saying metaphysical things and confine himself to such claims as no predictive or explanatory or descriptive power would be lost if we had spoken antipodean all our lives
5117935 we should stop asking questions about what counts as mental and what does not and instead recall that incorrigibility is all that is at issue in puzzles about the antipodeans
5117936 the post modernist cannot simply be refuted by showing some sort of inconsistency within his reasoning indeed many post modern thinkers have held that some degree of inconsistency is inherent in every conceptual scheme

5117958 one of the claims made by the supporters of strong ai is that when i understand a story in english what i am doing is exactly the same or perhaps more of the same as what i was doing in manipulating the chinese symbols it is simply more formal symbol manipulation that distinguishes the case in english where i do understand from the case in chinese where i dont i have not demonstrated that this claim is false but it would certainly appear an incredible claim in the example
5117959 no reason whatsoever has been offered to suppose that formal principles are necessary or even contributory to understanding since no reason has been given to suppose that when i understand english i am operating with any formal program at all
5117960 there are really two subsystems one understands english the other chinese and its just that the two systems have little to do with each other
5117961 not only do the two subsystems have little to do with each other they are not even remotely alike the subsystem that understands english assuming we allow ourselves to talk in this jargon of subsystems for a moment knows that the stories are about restaurants and eating hamburgers he know that he is being asked questions about restaurants and that he is answering questions as best he can by making various inference from the content of the story and so on but the chinese system knows none of this whereas the english subsystem know that hamburgers refer to hamburgers the chinese subsystem knows only that squiggle squiggle is followed by squoggle squoggle all he knows is that various formal symbols are being introduced at one end and manipulated according to rules written in english and other symbols are going out at the other end the whole point of the original example was to argue that such symbol manipulation by itself couldnt be sufficient for understanding chinese in any literal sense because the man could write squoggle squoggle after squiggle squiggle without understanding anything in chinese
5117962 i entirely agree that in such a case we would find it rational and indeed irresistible to accept the hypothesis that the robot had intentionality as long as we knew nothing more about it
5117963 the only real locus of intentionality is the man and he doesnt know any of the relevant intentional states he doesnt for example see what comes into the robots eyes he doesnt intend to move the robots arm and he doesnt understand any of the remarks made to or by the robot nor for the reasons stated earlier does the system of which the man and robot are a part
5117964 what the chinese room argument shows is either trivial or completely wrong
5117965 of course john fails to understand the meaning which is there to be had in the case of the chinese room the computationalist has already granted this

5117968 a man who said the sort of things jesus said would not be a great moral teacher he would either be a lunatic on a level with the man who says he is a poached egg or else he would be the devil of hell you must make your choice either this man was and is the son of god or else a madman or something worse but let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher he has not left that open to us he did not intend to
5117969 a great moral teacher was not a liar and was a bit insane
5117970 jesus belief and or his reasons may have been completely appropriate within his cultural context
5117971 after all it was not terribly unusual for mortal individuals to be called gods of some form or another
5117972 in fact it is not at all clear what exactly the historical jesus meant in claiming himself to be the son of god if he made such a claim at all
5117973 ok you got me he was a fraud there is that what you wanted to hear
5117974 i made quite the effort to not talk about jesus at all
5117975 since most people are not willing to call jesus a liar or lunatic the christian argues we are therefore compelled to accept jesus at his word he was is actually the son of god
5117976 the four witnesses the rebel the rabbi the chronicler and the mystic
5117977 but my students at oxford eyes were not on the stories themselves they were looking for the historical jesus they would boil down the gospels different stories into one to dish up a single digestible jesus and so would lose the flavor of these four wonderful courses the gospels offer us a far more inviting exciting and nourishing meal than any such reduction can encourage us to look for in the four witnesses that whole meal is here to be enjoyed he has quite the penchant for the extended metaphor which i found charming but may annoy some readers the gospels claim to relay truths to which no words are really adequate this books readers will see how elsuive the gospels jesus can be the gospels resort to poetry over and again we will watch our writers circle some deep dark insight looking for words and ways to do it justice most of us now take more readily to music
5117978 the fact that they completely ignore jesus life before he was 30 goes a long ways to showing that they are not really interested in objective history in itself

5118013 the lack of an unambiguous population policy reflects a lack of seriousness in promoting long term economic growth and
5118014 our studies show that if the philippines had followed the population growth trajectory of thailand between 1975 and 2000 the per capita income would have been at least 22 percent higher and there would have been 5 million less poor people
5118015 the catholic church knows how to mobilize its members not to vote for anti life politicians

5118018 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5118019 but how much time it will take it depends definitely on how georgians will continue to behave
5118020 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5118021 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5118022 we are waiting for more support from other countries because this is not a war between russian and georgia its a war between civilization and barbarism
5118023 i do not know where my children are and you can imagine how i feel about it
5118024 the players put on the field what we did with them in training we realised more than the other games in pre season what we need to do
5118025 but well need more quality in the future if we want to win the well need more than this
5118026 lampard is not brazilian hes english but he touched the ball very well it was his style the same with ballack we have a style its impossible to say to deco foul people thats not his style
5118027 i only give the players the freedom to play and allow them to express their style this is a chelsea performance not a scolari performance
5118028 im happy with anelka i said to him you will have three or four chances you need to make one or two goals for me and for the people i want people to believe in you more than before
5118029 theyll go away for a few days now to the national team thats frustrating but this is a
5118030 well have six or seven players at training and start building some ideas for the game against wigan well hope the others get back in condition and well be ready
5118031 youre not going to break into the top four no one is this year spurs have got a squad and cant even win at so you start forgetting about them the top four are on another level
5118032 when they play pass and move its very difficult to stay with them ive had good backing terrific backing to bring in
5118033 the average briton is being recorded 3 000 times per week

5118035 it is a most astonishing experience i was in the open space in front of my house when my friends drew my attention to the sky where i saw a vividly luminous shooting star with a luminous tail unlike any shooting star i had before seen coming from the south moving slowly across the sky and reaching the top of arunachala disappeared behind it because of its singularity we all guessed its import and immediately looked at our watches it was 8 47 and then raced to the ashram only to find that our premonition had been only too sadly true the master had passed into mahanirvana at that very minute 35

5118041 on the campaign trail john mccain claims that he fought to expose jack abramoff and his corrupt cronies
5118042 it was a scandal that rocked the country linking all the way to the bush white house and republicans in congress sending two former republican congressmen to prison
5118043 but now desperate to raise campaign cash to run more negative attack ads john mccain is cozying up to jack abramoffs cronies
5118044 ralph reed a key business partner of jack abramoff helped the convicted former republican lobbyist launder 2 million dollars through a front group to finance a gambling campaign
5118045 now ralph reed has signed up to raise money for john mccain reed has even been appointed to mccains victory 2008 team
5118046 ralph reeds murky connections to jack abramoff run so deep it cost him a race for lt governor in georgia
5118047 while most people now see ralph reed as a tainted man raising tainted money john mccain sees him as a source of campaign cash

5118054 being able to have something like that to shoot for it made those days when i was tired and i didnt want to be there
5118055 im just thankful for him having done what he did
5118056 the sport of swimming has come a long way so far and i think it can go even further
5118057 mike is opening a lot of doors with what hes doing

5118059 one of the things im really looking forward to is getting back to baltimore
5118060 hes more naturally suited for longer distances itll be change for him but i think itll be a good one
5118061 when we train every day sometimes there are workouts you dont like dont want to do bob says youre putting money in the bank
5118062 i guess i put a lot of money in the bank over the last four years and we withdrew pretty much every penny in the bank after bob and i both grab a little break itll be time to start depositing
5118063 we didnt protect the quarterback the way you have to
5118064 our communication from the coaches and on the field wasnt what it should be

5118108 my personal view is that when we weigh up the moral consequences of our decision to work with business and because the relationship enables us to get things done more efficiently and effectively the collaboration is entirely appropriate and justified
5118109 companies have become in effect the largest overseas development agencies with the growing recognition that trade and markets are the most important drivers for development lines of responsibility are getting blurred every sector is exploring new roles working relationships and ways of doing business partnerships are fast becoming the preferred mechanism for delivering sustainable development
5118110 absolutely the right thing to do as we have the same objectives in mind
5118111 you will not always agree and you have to go into it knowing that but at the end of the day as a company we are all about sustaining communities and without sustainable businesses we will not have business at all it is therefore vital that business gets into the debate
5118112 we are going to need the kind of transformation that i can see really only coming from business and ngos not from governments
5118113 as leaders of some of the worlds top companies and ngos gathered it was impossible to tell them apart as their discussions proceeded it was striking not only how well they knew each other but also how tolerant they were of each others foibles
5118114 companies and ngos are responsible to their own constituencies they also act as checks on one another but it should worry us that they need to step in where governments have failed because neither companies nor ngos formally answer to us as citizens

5118121 you were very antagonistic to my views on species i well knew this would be the case i must freely confess the difficulties and objections are terrific but i cannot believe that a false theory would explain as it seems to me it does explain so many classes of facts
5118122 if the analogy of two phenomena be very close and striking while at the same time the cause of one is very obvious it becomes scarcely possible to refuse to admit the action of an analogous cause in the other though not so obvious in itself
5118123 the consilience of inductions is exemplified principally in some of the greatest discoveries
5118124 the theory of universal gravitation and of the undulatory theory of light are indeed full of examples of this consilience of inductions the history of the undulatory theory was a succession of felicities and it is precisely the unexpected coincidences of results drawn from distant parts of the subject which are properly described
5118125 the evidence in favor of our induction is of a much higher and more forcible character when it enables us to explain and determine cases of a kind different from those which were contemplated in the formation of our hypothesis the instances in which this has occurred indeed impress us with a conviction that the truth of our hypothesis is certain no accident could give rise to such an extraordinary coincidence no false supposition could after being adjusted to one class of phenomena so exactly represent a different class when the agreement was unforeseen and uncontemplated that rules springing from remote and unconnected quarters should thus leap to the same point can only arise from that being the point where truth resides
5118126 absolute knowledge that species die and other replace them two hypotheses fresh creation is mere assumption it explains nothing further points gained if any facts are connected

5118128 science is unable to prove that x does not exist
5118129 by what right does the pastafarian assume presumption in the matter
5118130 by what right does the theist assume presumption in the matter
5118131 t o place the burden of proof on those who are arguing for the inexistence of anything especially something so far removed from empirical investigation is essentially stacking the deck in ones favor it is simply a burden which nobody can possibly bear
5118132 that the theist should accept the burden of proof fully allowing for the possibility that such a burden might be met
5118133 the burden of choice will be resolved by the values underlying the choice process
5118134 there never was any jesus what is your justification justification why should i my claim is beyond reason but true nonetheless
5118135 im not so naive as to think that reason is all powerful
5118136 some things exist that are currently beyond our reason what this then means is that we live in a world that we perceive through both reason and what assumption faith
5118137 the religionists is placing these particular assumptions beyond questioning of any kind
5118138 we simply must take some things for granted gods existence or a belief in gods existence according to the theist is simply one of these things while fsm and the belief in fsm are not
5118139 by rational i simply mean obeying the rules of proper belief and argumentation

5118147 in the future africa will become a powerful engine driving the growth of the world
5118148 the most important thing is the development of infrastructure in order to boost the momentum for african growth
5118149 the experiences of japan and other asian countries tell us that improvements in transportation infrastructure play a critical role in attracting private investment
5118150 the theme of the conference very much captures the impressive achievements of many african countries
5118151 in terms of overall economic progress average annual economic growth in sub saharan africa has been above five per cent since 2004 reaching 6 per cent in 2007 one percentage point higher than the world average
5118152 with a concerted drive by african governments and their development partners we can accomplish these goals for a better world
5118153 the world bank groups goal for africa is straight forward over the next 15 years or so during this generation your leadership generation i believe africa can become a new pole of global growth just as weve seen over the past years that china india and others have become complementary poles of growth to the developed countries

5118177 looking at the positives in the service sector new orders continue to remain above the water level of 50 points showing ongoing expansion that will flow through to general activity in the months ahead three of the four major regions showed some level of recovery while canterbury westland remains steady albeit at a lower level than on average
5118178 on the flip side many of the issues hampering businesses at present persist with potential customers enquiring but often holding back from ordering and the high cost of petrol limiting peoples additional cash for discretionary spending evidence of this can be seen in the retail sector with four consecutive months of decreased activity
5118179 the third quarter looks set to be another tough one for the service sector of retailers in particular we wouldnt be surprised to see real sales contract again

5118184 it was a good time of year for us to go up there and its not crowded with other people
5118185 when you have to go to the depths we did from a physical and a mental point of view and to come out on the positive side it is certainly going to hasten the development of your players
5118186 they know they can go to the well and keep going to well and thats important
5118187 but perhaps because of pressure from us or perhaps because of the anxiety of where the scoreboard was they didnt take them
5118188 we managed to take ours and i think we finished the game reasonably on top
5118189 this is a new team with a lot of new players in it and its very young in its infancy
5118190 weve been under a lot of pressure as a group and weve responded i think magnificently weve had two really top games now after a lot of people were writing us off when a side can get up and do that its always satisfying

5118202 por primera vez hay una izquierda que se juega la carta de la democracia eso ha fortalecido el sistema como ha ocurrido en chile y brasil el caso de venezuela es distinto porque el gobierno venezolano no cree en la democracia como tal sino en una democracia autoritaria que restringe libertades y que sigue una pol tica econ mica que ha fracasado en todo el mundo no existe un solo caso en el que una pol tica centralista intervencionista y estatizadora haya tra do beneficios por eso cay la uni n sovi tica por eso china dio un vuelco tan incre ble y por eso es que cuba es un pa s mis rrimo aqu tampoco va a triunfar con un m nimo de lucidez cualquiera se da cuenta que esa pol tica conduce al fracaso al empobrecimiento y a la corrupci n
5118203 ser a bueno para estados unidos y para el resto del mundo que ganara obama quien es un gran orador pero no al estilo latinoamericano sino de ideas y argumentos con experiencias concretas y quien a pesar de salir de una comunidad hist ricamente discriminada no adelanta un discurso de resentimiento ni de victimismo sino de que hay que actuar
5118204 los pueblos se equivocan y a menudo lo pagan caro
5118205 por regla general los pueblos tienen los gobiernos que eligen tener y luego la pagan car simo deber a servir de escarmiento

5118230 you can call allaah with any name at all however it must be a name that is good and beautiful
5118231 bi asmaaillaah il husnaa yaa muqsit yaa naafi yaa jaami
5118232 and unto allaah belong the most beautiful names so call upon him with them
5118233 allaah the most high has names and attributes which his book the quraan has come with and his prophet sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam has informed of there is no room for anyone from the creatures of allaah the most high whom the proof has been established upon him to refute or deny them
5118234 and they are not known except by what allaah described himself with so he is all hearing all seeing and those who describe him do not reach the full extent of his attribute and one is not to go beyond the quraan and the hadeeth in describing him so we say just as he allaah said and we describe him with what he used to describe himself and one is not to go beyond the quraan
5118235 so we and all of the salaf from the people of the hijaaz and tihaamah and al yemen and al iraaq and ash shaam and misr egypt our math hab way is that we affirm for allaah what he affirmed for himself
5118236 and they believe that allaah is called by his beautiful names and described by his attributes which his prophet sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam named and described him with
5118237 and indeed the imaams have agreed that the attributes should only be taken as tawqeefiyyah restricted to the texts and it is not permissible that allaah be described except with what he described himself or with what his messenger sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam described him with
5118238 ahlus sunnah are unanimously agreed in confirming the attributes that are reported in the book and the sunnah and believing in them according to the literal meaning and not as figurative meanings
5118239 the names are to be taken as tawqeef restricted from the book and the sunnah and the consensus ijmaa
5118240 the names of allaah and his attributes are not known except by the tawqeef restrictive texts from the book and the sunnah or the consensus ijmaa and one is not to enter into them with analogy qiyaas
5118241 and the names of allaah and his attributes are tawqeefiyyah restricted to the texts and ahlus sunnah do not affirm for allaah anything but what he affirmed for himself in his book or what has been authenticated from the messenger of allaah sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam
5118242 so it is correct that it is not permissible that allaah be named with any name except what he named himself with
5118243 the names of allaah the most high are taken as tawqeef restricted to the texts of the quraan and the sunnah
5118244 but they are in reality tawqeefiyyah we have with this proofs that are reliable
5118245 we have o people of the sunnah and following the salaf in considering the affirmation of tawqeef restriction regarding the names of al baaree allaah the magnificent and exalted from the legislator reliable lofty proofs that fulfill the goal because whatever is not confirmed from the legislator it should not be taken in unrestricted reliance upon it and the basic principle asl is prohibition regarding issues of belief until a proof of allowance is established so if it is confirmed then it is tawqeefee within the restriction of the texts
5118246 and the conglomerate of statements regarding the affirmation of the attributes is the statement that the salaf of the ummah were upon and its imaams and it is that allaah is described by what he described himself with and by what his messenger described him with and that is to be safeguarded from at tahreef distortion of meaning at tamtheel likening with the creation at takyeef describing how they are and denial of them there is nothing like him ash shooraa 11 these at tahreef at tamtheel at takyeef and are not to be applied to his self his attributes nor to his actions
5118247 the seventh is that whatever is used to refer to him and regarding the matter of the names and attributes then this is tawqeefee restricted to the texts of the quraan and the sunnah
5118248 and unto allaah belong the most beautiful names so call upon him with them and leave off those who deviate regarding his names they will be punished for what they used to do
5118249 say o muhammad but the things that my lord has indeed forbidden are al faw hish great evil sins every kind of unlawful sexual intercourse etc
5118250 and follow not o man i e say not or do not or witness not etc that of which you have no knowledge e g ones saying i have seen while in fact he has not seen or i have heard while he has not heard verily the hearing and the sight and the heart of each of those you will be questioned by all h

5118266 there have been dozens of alleged sightings but have you or anyone you know actually seen either bigfoot or an actual person using amazons 400 electronic reader
5118267 my gut instinct is that there will be a wide disparity about what rates are quoted on these sites and what they actually end up with and not necessarily due to the borrower
5118268 all the sites may not collect all the data thats necessary to give an actual price quote

5118276 i think theyve been outstanding the way theyve conducted themselves although they may be coming from a fairly low base from some of their predecessors in the way theyve gone about it
5118277 i think also off the floor seeing the guys the way they interact with the public the reporters you look at kobe bryant every photo they want taken hes been obliging
5118278 i think theyve really taken on the challenge not only to resurrect the reputation of what goes on the court but what goes off the court
5118279 we dont have to celebrate individual things they act like theyve done it before which they have
5118280 assured that georgians will not continue to use military force
5118281 if i would ask you in response to the same question how fast the american forces can leave iraq for example the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there
5118282 well iraq was a grave threat we had no choice etc
5118283 if youre asking me if id rather finish fourth or fifth id much rather finish fourth that obviously gives you a better chance of a premiership
5118284 our main focus is to make the finals for a start as it is every year and were still not over the line there yet so we need to make sure we get there
5118285 thats at the front of our mind rather than worrying about whether were going to be fifth fourth or whatever
5118286 weve got to take some positives out of the game because were still in the mix and weve got big games to come against collingwood and brisbane
5118287 weve got to get some of our players back into form some of our guys are in good form

5118300 from tomorrow russia will begin the withdrawal of the military contingent which was moved to reinforce russian peacekeepers after the georgian aggression against south ossetia

5118311 younger children seem more interested in setting short term goals for their learning in the game compared to older children who are more interested in simply playing and the actions of playing
5118312 thus younger children may show a greater need for focusing on small aspects of a given problem than older children even in a leisure based situation such as playing video games
5118313 the big picture is that there are several dimensions on which games have effects including the amount they are played the content of each game what you have to pay attention to on the screen and how you control the motions
5118314 this means that games are not good or bad but are powerful educational tools and have many effects we might not have expected they could
5118315 these forums illustrate how sophisticated intellectual practices to improve game play mimic actual scientific reasoning
5118316 gamers are openly discussing their strategies and thinking creating an environment in which informal scientific reasoning practices are being learned by playing these online video games

5118320 fast forward almost a year and the mccain campaign has begun to implement some of the same tactics
5118321 i think it shows the campaign is willing to play with the technology and enable their supporters to participate in that flurry of web activity a little supporter participation can go a long way towards feeding energy into a campaign

5118328 we have set up a working group to look into the use of cctv and produce atl guidelines on best practice for schools and colleges throughout the uk
5118329 certainly we would want staff to be involved in decisions about the use of cctv in schools and strict safeguards for its use
5118330 it will be great for some of our guys to play against geelong its a wonderful opportunity so we are looking forward to it
5118331 its pretty simple why they are so good they have a lot of talent they are very mature very slick and probably have got four of their best players sitting on the sideline last night and they will probably come back in next week
5118332 but again we will recover and front up and send them out there and have a shot at it
5118333 i think they are going to be a big problem for a lot of teams in september they are very well coached and to a man they played their part for the team they are right up there with the best teams we had played this year
5118334 teams that are going to play the kangaroos in the finals i think watch out because they have hit form at the right time their key players are playing well they are playing very structured and very good footy
5118335 absolutely edwards and hamish and thommo nathan thompson next week you cant play them all in the same side though so if you are in one of those positions you have to perform
5118336 whatever happens between now and the end of the year and we can put our hand over our heart and say we are going to play in september after today i just look at the young players we have brought in over the last two years and we are really heading in the right direction
5118337 what kind of person would take a pot shot at someone walking off the field

5118347 i am delighted wall street recognizes that the troubled national economy is not indicative of the robust business climate and continuing economic health here in texas

5118371 ninety percent of patients with huntingtons disease have chorea and many suffer terribly its hard to describe the torment that these people undergo we had several patients who experienced a dramatic improvement in their quality of life some patients who hadnt been able to attend church for years were able to do so others were able to go out to a restaurant and have a meal for the first time in years its impossible to over emphasize what this has meant to some patients who are able to reclaim part of the life that they have lost due to this disease
5118372 patients and families with huntingtons disease maintain a courageous hope for progress
5118373 on one hand the fda approval of tetrabenazine represents only a small step forward this medication helps patients control their movements better but is not known to slow the underlying progression of the disease on the other hand the fda approval represents a giant symbolic breakthrough since tetrabenazine is the first drug ever approved in the united states for any aspect of huntingtons disease it is an honor to be part of the extended community of patients families and researchers trying to find a better way forward
5118374 my mother and many others have died without the benefits of tetrabenazine
5118375 since the medication was invented in the 1950s worldwide it has been give to close to a million people we have a tremendous amount of information about its benefits potential side effects how to treat the side effects and dosing suggestions this is day to celebrate for huntingtons patients and their families
5118376 our study reveals potentially clinically relevant differences in the gene expression of different cancer types and represents a reference framework for interpretation of smaller scale functional studies
5118377 this segregation of tumors into three groups with distinct expression patterns is surprising clearly the developmental trajectory provides a meaningful background for capturing large scale differences in gene expression across diverse conditions
5118378 shifting our focus from single sets of genes or processes to the biology of aggregates on the order of the entire transcriptome is likely to be useful in establishing highly robust molecular correlations between seemingly unrelated disease phenotypes

5118618 some of them are wearing a bit too little maybe but i can accept it
5118619 i think were quite open now this sort of thing is normal now on tv
5118620 im only 19 so i dont know what it was like then
5118621 at first i couldnt imagine dancing in front of so many people im normally quite shy but when i dance i get a bit crazy you have to
5118622 we just try to do cute things to make people laugh its a great feeling to be able to do that
5118623 if you feel your clothes coming loose or your bra slipping it can be a bit scary but you cant panic or at least let it show
5118624 today i was very very nervous because i was the favorite to win the tournament
5118625 in a final if you play your best you can win for sure but i think today i played more with my mind than my body
5118626 were trying to get ready were trying to win a gold medal each game is very important to us
5118627 ourselves we are the only obstacle i think we have we have to stay humble and if we play the way weve been playing so hard we should win
5118628 we played an excellent team spain it shows how far we have come
5118629 defensively we were in tune and when we get defensive stops it allows us to get out and run which we do best we just have to continue having the same effort every night we step on the court
5118630 they wanted to make a statement in this game playing against us and they did
5118631 they sent a message to everybody in the tournament now everybody knows that theyre for real and theyre very serious about this and are playing with a purpose
5118632 germs viruses and secrets the silent proliferation of bio laboratories in the united states
5118633 consequently no agency is responsible for determining the risks associated with the proliferation of these labs
5118634 nobody is checking to see if people being approved to work with anthrax or other biological agents actually have the scientific skills to work with it
5118635 im truly humbled to have another chance now and am blessed with my newfound academic success

5118640 vamos a hacer las acciones que sean necesarias para regresar la legalidad al partido
5118641 siempre y cuando haya un acuerdo de una direcci n que nos lleve a un buen puerto a una direcci n adecuada
5118642 creemos efectivamente que se puede ver si hay condiciones pol ticas o no para hacer una elecci n pero no puede ser unilateral tiene que ser una decisi n colectiva
5118643 por su puesto que veremos las acciones legales y pol ticas a seguir y tambi n los esquemas de apertura y negociaci n que sean necesarios
5118644 nosotros tenemos toda la disposici n de dialogar pero no vamos a aceptar ninguna imposici n y vamos a hacer las acciones que sean necesarias para regresar la legalidad al partido
5118645 permiti que 438 presuntos secuestradores fueran encarcelados con el auto de formal prisi n respectivo y sujetos al proceso penal federal que establece la ley bajo la jurisdicci n del poder judicial de la federaci n

5118650 i suddenly had a burst of energy and knew i had a lot more life left in me and thats when i woke up to the sound of the first song i ever bought
5118651 i would love to thank mick jagger and the rest of the stones personally i feel they really did help wake me from my coma
5118652 i just feel real confident when i get to the plate right now
5118653 to be able to go out there and crush the ball against a team like detroit was really something
5118654 im going to get a tape of this one and run it over and over during the winter
5118655 our entire pitching staff had a bad day and when that happens you are going to get embarrassed
5118656 our offense came ready to win this game but when you give up four runs in three of the first five innings it takes all the wind out of your sails
5118657 i felt good before the game and then before i could blink they had five hits
5118658 i was just shocked they werent all good pitches but they werent all bad either
5118659 hes on an incredible run streak and im just enjoying sitting there and watching it
5118660 theyre trying you just got to keep on being positive with them bring them back to where they were before
5118661 i dont want to lose obviously its not easy but the effort its there guys want to catch the ball they want to hit the ball they want to throw strikes theyre just not doing it right now
5118662 it aint always easy and this year has been tough for us i think it should make you hungrier to come out and play starting tuesday you never want to be a part of something like 100 losses but you cant play 500 the rest of the season unless you take care of tuesday night
5118663 what can you do you cant flip flop the whole team with another 25 guys all they can do is give me the effort this is what we have and this is what were going to finish the season with hopefully we can get better
5118664 i just didnt execute some of my pitches got away with some guys kept making plays behind me when they score some runs it makes it easier to win
5118665 they had a couple of different defining moments where they could have jumped up and changed the momentum of the game
5118666 its not like they werent trying 7 2 its a lot closer ballgame than that

5118680 how many people have died as a result of environmental policies like the banning of ddt
5118681 id say millions because it was the most effective weapon against malaria right now methyl bromide is supposedly being banned for ozone depletion but i think this is really an attack on refrigeration because thats what cfcs and methyl bromides are used for the storage and transportation of food if you look at the environmentalists policies they say they want to reduce world population to 500 million and 2 billion and the best way to do that would be to destroy the world food system that would create mass starvation thats the way to achieve their aim

5118760 events such as logar will happen again because occupied afghanistan looks at all actors that are established in the interest of america with an eye of hostility
5118761 you have to convince your government to put an end to the occupation of afghanistan so that the afghans are not killed with your hands and so that you are not killed with the hands of the afghans

5118780 five years ago the power shortage in mumbai was not as acute as it is now since we will be having it and bpo companies on the premises we need un interrupted power supply throughout
5118781 we pay rs 7 50 per unit of electricity to the maharashtra state electricity board our own power generation unit will cost us only rs 4 50 per unit which works out around 40 per cent cheaper
5118782 landlords are thinking of reducing the outgoing costs of the retailers in the malls even if the retailers can save rs 2 per day on consumption of 5 000 units of electricity they can save rs 10 000 per day and rs 3 lakh per month thus more and more malls are looking at having a captive power unit on the premises
5118783 this concept is relevant for the shopping malls and commercial spaces in the city malls are considered to be indulging in unwarranted commercial electricity consumption and commercial establishments can save themselves from power cuts

5118893 texas has been a leader in the movement to increase transparency of state and local government spending
5118894 citizens become better informed voters when they can see how their tax dollars are being spent spending transparency also puts governments on notice that they can no longer get away with spending tax dollars in wasteful duplicative or self serving ways
5118895 instead of having to walk into dozens of different government buildings or painstakingly search all over the internet to find how tax dollars are being spent you can simply go to texasbudgetsource com
5118896 transparency forces government to be smarter about how it spends the taxpayers money
5118897 it creates a culture of transparency that guards against waste
5118898 the texas public policy foundation has been a longtime champion of transparency in government spending
5118899 not only have we shown the possibilities through the legislation that passed last year but texasbudgetsource com provides a template that other states can follow to make government spending more accessible to taxpayers

5118926 newer evidence describes how curcumin interacts with certain proteins to generate anti cancer activity inside the body were focusing on the pathways that are most involved in cancer and trying to optimize for those properties
5118927 most of the interaction between our compound and the overactive protein comes from what are called hot spots on the proteins surface
5118928 for each spot we can design small chemical fragments and link them together to make a molecule this is what computer aided design and modeling can do

5118930 but most of the compounds weve made have been more potent than curcumin against the cancer cells

5119056 you have to vet their ideas and let them come back with a recommendation that you reject or agree with
5119057 even though you want to just make the decision you need to give them an opportunity to be part of it
5119058 when it comes to keeping up technically with smart people you wont youve got your own areas to cover
5119059 some bosses feel compelled to make decisions about things that theyre completely unqualified to make so everyone ends up in total misery over it
5119060 even if people arent happy theyll respect that youre standing behind your decision
5119061 really intelligent people want to see action and results however it gets done
5119062 i might make suggestions based on my experience but i expect him to take the lead
5119063 i think its important for every technical manager to realize he or she is a guide not a chief
5119064 you may lead the expedition in that you know where you want to end up but youve got to trust your hunter to hunt and your coachman to take care of the horses
5119065 the tendency is to go for the shiny new thing and prioritize that over billable work
5119066 if they see us move on one or two ideas it really helps morale
5119067 if i kept her in a standard role as an analyst i wouldnt get a third of the stuff im getting from her now
5119068 to assume that someone is smart in every endeavor of life is akin to setting them up for failure
5119069 youre lucky to have your team and they are going to take you to your destination youre not taking them there
5119070 ive seen so many managers especially those who came from the programming ranks feel threatened by their team
5119071 feeling threatened by someone else being good at their job is poisonous
5119072 sometimes ill get really technical on them to see if they know what im talking about
5119073 if its false bravado theyll catch on pretty quick that they dont know what im talking about and have to concede that i do know more than they do
5119074 a good it staff offers training documents with screenshots and yes holds hands
5119075 how do i deal with them it depends on how bleeped off i want to make everyone
5119076 instead of saying you did this wrong and pointing out their mistakes i cushion the blow by simply explaining what happened
5119077 everything was fine and then my system just blew up whatd you guys do
5119078 i try to say something like yeah this software stinks
5119079 but you have to be careful not to push them beyond their limits they can make a mistake
5119080 if i never hear from someone that probably means theyre fighting through something thats ruining their productivity
5119081 she wanted to know why that happened her desire for knowledge really tickled me
5119082 its someone who grows along with the help you give them they take the knowledge you give them to solve one problem and are able to apply it to another problem
5119083 if people arent calling that probably means theyre getting frustrated
5119084 my dream user is someone who actually listens to what i say
5119085 i dont mind if people call a lot ignorance is fine but listen to what im telling you and follow through take notes if you have to and dont be afraid be receptive and respectful as ive been to you
5119086 my it career improved a lot after i had kids i listen to crying at both places
5119087 atas nama kedutaan besar as dan rakyat amerika saya ingin mengucapkan selamat kepada anda semua dan selamat merayakan hari kemerdekaan
5119088 this is the first case that ive seen in my 12 years in a situation where you have patients with legitimate and serious problems who are receiving a drug that is not authorized by the food drug and administration
5119089 the patient must utilise the technology usefully in the correct perspective instead of dissection discussion and hair splitting
5119090 the internet which is very useful to most of us can supply ideas to the patient to gain knowledge to pose intelligent questions to the urologist and forget the actual purpose of the visit to the doctor
5119091 the urologist may have a tough time treating such patients successfully and satisfactorily
5119092 being promoted to bbc one and gaining a wider audience
5119093 the doctor said well it looks like hes got all the symptoms of west nile virus
5119094 i called the state health department because i needed to know how long he was going to be sick
5119095 i was just bawling i thought he was going to die
5119096 he was diagnosed with epstein barr virus which is pretty much the same thing but you dont die from it
5119097 i dont blame him because all the doctors are doing it
5119098 id like to know how many people have been told they have west nile
5119099 this has been going on since west nile came into utah some doctors will base things on symptoms and not do tests
5119100 like any medical test they can be expensive and if people dont have insurance then sometimes the doctor will go ahead and try to help the patient
5119101 whether theyre helping or not may be something of a question
5119102 he said well it sounds like youve got west nile
5119103 it was really strange it was just contradictory to what we had heard on the news and what seemed to be happening everywhere
5119104 i ended up going to the doctor in the springtime
5119105 they found out that i was really anemic the question i have now is did i ever really have it am i immune to it am i going to get it again
5119106 people who have been told they have it are out on the lake not really worrying about it
5119107 i cant imagine how many people have been told that
5119108 maybe theres something seriously wrong that they dont know about and they say nah its west nile
5119109 we try to do education for physicians and stuff like that thats the best we can do is try to educate people of what tests to draw and those kinds of things
5119110 thats the only way to tell for sure if theres west nile
5119111 people throughout the world see new zealand as a green untouched and beautiful country this is what our two largest industries tourism and food production are in large part built upon
5119112 we have a natural advantage over other countries in the world in this regard and we can and should continue to use it as a point of differentiation because consumers are increasingly making their purchasing decisions based on environmental factors

5119117 i dont know if i can do it to all but i will try
5119118 i love my laptop couldnt live without it but i really hate it too
5119119 a lot of these laptops are assembled in china and lets face it they are flimsy
5119120 the parts last a certain length of time and thats it
5119121 theyre tougher to work on take more expertise and create potentially a lot longer downtime to fix if they have to be shipped to a service center theyre very frustrating
5119122 were not building nuclear bombs here why do i have to type in so many passwords
5119123 they cant get online at a friends house so they cant pick their football draft in their football pool so i need to fix this situation immediately
5119124 i get beat up by users every single day who want to be able to do whatever they want and have us support it
5119125 as far as i know my grandmother never saw doctor who but i am sure she would have been intrigued excited and above all flattered
5119126 despite the fact that studies on the dangers of pathological gaming and its treatments were known the defendant didnt consider its obligation to warn users of the dangers of dependence
5119127 at the current time there exists no expert recognized by his peers who proposes that vlts are the cause of pathological gambling
5119128 in using the message in moderation a game remains a game the defendant puts the responsibility of pathological gambling on the user
5119129 the only way to get the water out of the valley next to the highway is through pumps and hoses going across the road and every time a car passes over it stops the flow
5119130 its just a matter of getting it cleared out so the rain thats coming throughout this evening and overnight can flow freely and not cause any further trouble
5119131 if we can get those opened up itll greatly diminish the amount of water up there
5119132 canadian doctors believe in the fundamentals of access based on need not on the ability to pay
5119133 its important to acknowledge that there are lots of reforms that are needed in the system
5119134 no one in our organization is interested in defending the status quo weve got some real problems in our health care system
5119135 we need to be constantly advocating for the improvement of the public system
5119136 delete the unicode section dont waste time telling us about unicode it doesnt affect us or our jobs
5119137 have to make a judgment in the next little while as to whether or not this parliament can function productively
5119138 mr dion says he doesnt support the government but wont say whether he will defeat us or not
5119139 my husband and i were on the 134 east heading home to glendale in the rightmost lane on the freeway all of a sudden this troll in a honda odyssey comes right up to our rear bumper and stays there not for one not for two but for nearly 3 exits i took this picture in my side view mirror while my husband was driving i didnt know that driving the speed limit at 65 mph in the slowest lane of traffic was illegal if he was so offended why didnt he pass to the left like hes supposed to do eventually he had a rare stroke of brilliance and did just that though not without glaring at us while he sped away as if we wronged him somehow
5119140 its everything that we usually see in a three or four week period packed into about two days
5119141 oh they make me sick because they are so much in love
5119142 infelizmente uma super abund ncia de sonhos paga com um crescimento potencial de pesadelos
5119143 we lifted the body from the water like a gown
5119144 takes very broad things in life and breaks them down into their simplest form its like cooking down cocaine into crack youre really just taking whats important and putting it into a very small amount of words
5119145 a band whose talent and proficiency at times seem s boundless
5119146 in short hes a talent more people ought to know about
5119147 better than getting laid finding god and winning the lotto combined
5119148 whose ugly face and horrible voice do i want to have to deal with
5119149 there is no need to say anything about dida hes had his problems but has won everything with milan he is recovering and wanted to remain as a demonstration of his character
5119150 he is perhaps misunderstood but has always shown a desire to continue
5119151 he ronaldinho didnt expect the warm reception he received here
5119152 the olympic national team has restored some opportunities for him today everything depends on him again he is very happy and dependent
5119153 it was not expected that the injury would keep him out for so long
5119154 the tendonitis remains and gives him some slight annoyances but we have time and well take it time to care for it the injury correctly so well have a season without problems

5119160 la brecha entre los docentes y los alumnos en lo que hace a las nuevas tecnolog as y los temas inform ticos sigue siendo grande los chicos saben m s que sus profesores y eso es un problema que se vive a diario en los colegios de la regi n
5119161 el problema por ah se da con los profesores que tienen varios a os dando clases apunta mana massi directora del normal n 1 de la plata los docentes j venes ya vienen con un bagaje en temas inform ticos que los coloca en otro lugar con respecto al alumnado pero es cierto que muchos docentes con varios a os de experiencia a veces les agarra una psicosis cuando comprenden que los chicos en ese terreno ya les sacaron varios cuerpos de ventaja
5119162 un doble desaf o pedag gico interesant simo porque por un lado se debe capacitar al docente y por el otro seguir formando a los alumnos para que vayan a la par de los avances tecnol gicos ahora se est n ultimando los detalles de un plan de alfabetizaci n digital financiado por el bid y que comenzar su etapa preparatoria durante el segundo semestre est claro que los docentes fueron formados con la matriz del libro como elemento central y los chicos en cambio con una cultura tecnol gica que les resulta absolutamente familiar por eso el desaf o es achicar esa brecha y acompa arla con la estructura necesaria para que no quede en palabras y nada m s
5119163 el docente sabe que ese es un gran d ficit sostiene massi por su parte en nuestro caso sabemos que los chicos incorporan conocimientos tecnol gicos de manera mucho m s acelerada que el cuerpo docente y tratamos de manejarlo con la incorporaci n de m s tecnolog a entendemos que es la mejor forma primero para que el chico pueda seguir ampliando esos conocimientos y segundo para que el profesor se siga capacitando en su tarea cotidiana
5119164 siguen siendo pocos los docentes que tienen un conocimiento cabal de computaci n o internet en general son los alumnos los que tienen que ense arles a sus maestros de qu se trata la cuesti n y es algo bastante l gico los chicos nacen en un mundo tecnol gico y eso hace que incorporen los nuevos conceptos de un modo natural y r pido mientras que los profesores tienen que afrontar el desaf o con varios a os sobre sus espaldas sin haber agarrado tal vez una computadora en toda su vida
5119165 its a great team effort everybody just has a great time getting ready for the fair they enjoy this part just as much as they do during the fair
5119166 hamburgers hotdogs 20 30 cases of that to get started we do prime rib sandwiches weve got about 100 cases of prime rib sandwiches coming in 20 bags of potatoes for our potatoes oreily
5119167 you always want the tradition because people come back for tradition everybody comes for the sausage sandwich everybody comes for the cup of milk everybody comes for the baked potato but you always want something new to bring a little more excitement
5119168 by tomorrow morning youll see thousands of people on the grounds and theyll have this fair up and running within three days from stands this size to the whole midway

5119170 they probably didnt have it in stock so instead of calling to find where it is in stock hes probably going to every wal mart in a 30 mile radius to track it down
5119171 after someone sneezes is credited to st gregory the great but the pagan romans and greeks had similar customs
5119172 its illegal for us to provide a copy of that to you if your corporate offices need one theyll need to call our station to have a copy sent to them

5119174 i thought that it would be nice to spend some time with you
5119175 i told my friends that i was going to go out with my son and they were impressed

5119180 by him going overseas and talking with the israeli government and the people who mean the most to the united states i think what hes doing is great
5119181 what hes showing now is that he has the experience to go out and reach out to these people and to say to them hey this is barack obama
5119182 by him going overseas and talking with the israeli government and the people who mean the most to the united states i think what hes doing is great

5119184 eu esperava dificuldades assim mesmo todo jogo decisivo e o atl tico mg se fechou muito bem e tem velocidade um time encardido chato de se jogar contra um bom time por isso tivemos dificuldades e merecemos vencer
5119185 ganhar na estr ia fundamental e natural que o fluminense n o tenha vencido com supremacia e com show de bola o time vai competir e essa a maneira com a qual vai resgatar a auto estima para fazer partidas melhores
5119186 tive a infelicidade de fazer um gol contra a bola veio cruzada fui me antecipar e acabei botando para dentro
5119187 n o foi culpa do rbitro mas sim do bandeirinha que estava na linha do lance foi um erro t cnico grosso mas n o acho que tenha sido para ajudar algu m fomos prejudicados mas isso acontece com outros clubes tamb m
5119188 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5119189 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5119190 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5119191 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5119192 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5119193 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n

5119195 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar

5119198 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5119199 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5119200 dont be selfish dont try to impress others be humble thinking of others as better than yourselves dont look out for your own interests but take an interest in others too you must have the same attitude that jesus had though he was god he did not think of equality with god as something to cling to instead he gave up his divine privileges he took the humble position of a slave and was born as a human being
5119201 all it would take is a little fanning of the flames of discontent and china could suddenly become a paper tiger
5119202 the government will find funds the project is essential to our country
5119203 our economic climate scares away investors even in politically unstable afghanistan investments are pouring into the country by billions
5119204 we do not have war like afghanistan does but we have flourishing red tape which is a bureaucratic war
5119205 the organization is extremely resilient and its influence although limited to southern xinjiang seems to be growing
5119206 the prison authorities are also worried about the influence of hizbut followers on other inmates
5119207 for most uighurs who are activists though some of them are very religious in their islam their main goal is sovereignty for xinjiang hizb ut tahrir doesnt support that they support a worldwide caliphate not any one independent region
5119208 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
5119209 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
5119210 lean forward and put your weight on your front foot
5119211 just lean back and put your weight on your back foot like surfing
5119212 we see it all the time people who are standing dont hold on while the bus is moving at a consistent speed and suddenly have to lunge for the straps or poles when the bus slows down because they lose their balance

5119222 estamos hablando de un disturbio emocional de alto riesgo que se manifiesta muy particularmente entre los 18 y 30 a os de edad que de no ser atendido adecuadamente puede degenerar en suicidio
5119223 la situaci n es realmente preocupante si consideramos que el ndice de suicidio en la bipolaridad es de un 25 por ciento y la mitad de los dos millones que padecen la enfermedad son subcl nicos es decir consideran que su cambiante estado de nimo es un problema existencial y s lo se limitan a tomar alg n antidepresivo
5119224 los cuadros depresivos agudos o la euforia desbordada s lo pueden ser da inos si no hay un seguimiento m dico y de ah la necesidad de acudir a ser diagnosticados en cualquier cl nica de salud
5119225 se tienen ya tratamientos m dicos efectivos para esa enfermedad el problema es que una alta proporci n de los potenciales pacientes no saben que tienen la enfermedad o aprenden a vivir con comportamientos impredecibles que les ocasionan problemas en el trabajo o en sus relaciones interpersonales
5119226 el tama o del reto es de dos millones de mexicanos de los cuales apenas la mitad reciben atenci n por falta de recursos econ micos y programas destinados a la salud mental
5119227 y ah la explicaci n de muchos accidentes o suicidios pues un bipolar no mide consecuencias del peligro ni de su comportamiento
5119228 en amate puntualiza llegan pacientes con trastorno bipolar a quienes en los hospitales oficiales se les neg atenci n o los enviaron a sus casas con s lo un tranquilizante no existe una real labor de diagn stico de esta enfermedad en los programas m dicos gubernamentales cuando es ya un problema de salud p blica
5119229 tengo pocos amigos porque en algunas ocasiones me volv a violento y en otras no dejaba de hablar euf ricamente lo que los incomodaba ahora ya me controlo pero no puedo ocultar mi irritabilidad cuando algo no me parece bien
5119230 me cort las venas pero mi hermana se dio cuenta y me trasladaron al hospital
5119231 no dorm a y me sent a llena de energ a y alegr a hasta que empec a tener alucinaciones que hicieron que mis padres me llevaran al doctor
5119232 el paciente en estado de man a o de euforia puede beber en exceso o consumir sustancias como producto de su descontrol emocional
5119233 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms
5119234 gatineau wal mart workers awarded contract arbitrator imposes only labour pact for retailing giant in north america
5119235 we are disappointed that at first glance the agreement will have a significant impact on our business model
5119236 the reason that we have so many well funded libertarians in america these days is not because libertarianism suddenly acquired an enormous grass roots following but because it appeals to those who are able to fund ideas libertarianism is a politics born to be subsidized
5119237 seedorf is playing with a lot of continuity and reliability
5119238 ambrosini was great i dont know if the fact that he wasnt convicated for the national team had anything to do with it but he played very well
5119239 i dont agree with it ambrosinis omission for marcello lippis squad but if he reacts this way then its fine
5119240 there is always lots of competition at milan the good thing is we have strikers that allow us to opt for various solutions
5119241 pato doesnt necessarily have to play every game it would be detrimental to him
5119242 at the moment abbiati is best as dida has been out for so long but im sure dida will return to form
5119243 if nesta kaladze and maldini dont show signs of recovery then we will bring in another defender however right now we have to think about their recoveries
5119244 what happened to the scrub in the green tube i like that one better
5119245 i cant help it i love me a cute swimdress
5119246 i spent a lot of time listening to the hotel bands or the bands playing around the bonfires and cookouts its a small island so there were beaches everywhere i was always watching live musicians play so for inspiration for this album i went back to various beaches around the world in italy indonesia and elsewhere and just let the music flow
5119247 almost an unplugged affair recorded the old fashioned way with everyone playing live in the studio at the same time and just a few overdubs afterwards im really pleased with it and to have so much vocal talent on one album is tremendous
5119248 the presidents a dummy and the attorney generals a crook
5119249 its like anything else you go through a natural grieving process i was shocked i was sad i was angry
5119250 he only had one speed and that was straight ahead if there was something he thought was wrong he was out to change it no matter what
5119251 thats going to be the most important thing to keep his memory alive the things he believed in and he was about for us that are left thats what weve got to do
5119252 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5119253 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5119254 it took me longer to get to the birds nest than normal the crowds are really anticipating this hes their big name and the new face of chinese sport
5119255 anyone else noticed that a usa team without phelps would currently have as many gold medals as great britain
5119256 just wondering if you know of any other athletes who like our very own beccy romero have won medals in two completely different sports what an amazing achievement
5119257 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5119258 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5119259 i have tried not to make it additional pressure and to look at this as just another race
5119260 but it winning the world championship has given me confidence that i am in such good form
5119261 i dont really think about being the youngest i just want to get out there and compete and be the best i can
5119262 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5119263 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5119264 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

5119267 the breach actually took place near a creek in a side canyon that leads to the grand canyon the main people affected were residents of a reservation in the canyon
5119268 la seconda guerra mondiale inizi nel 1939 e fin nel 1945
5119269 we won 4 0 but more important the chelsea fans saw a beautiful game we have to keep this going and we can every game every week
5119270 we played more aggressive than last season and portsmouth were surprised with our team this is a chelsea performance but well need more quality in the future
5119271 i think the owner is happy like the other fans
5119272 the full backs jose bosingwa and ashley cole are good when they go forward they cross very well dribble very well we played as a team

5119274 need pop window with certain info in it help me please
5119275 popup and the information i require to go inside this box is in this search result php id
5119276 gt when i try to configure it myself i can either get the pop up box to open but without any info in it at all or if i change it round a bit im getting the information to show up but not in the box it comes up as a full size webpage
5119277 sometimes maybe i put off making decisions that maybe i should have taken earlier
5119278 to make decisions in the long term interests of the country you have to take quite tough decisions quite early on so that you can get things done within the life of a parliament
5119279 you appoint good people and trust their decisions but you have to know when to step in william hague has really helped me because he made all the mistakes the first time round
5119280 i absolutely believe that if wed have had that election that gordon brown would no longer have been prime minister and that the conservatives would have been the largest party in a hung parliament
5119281 brown compounded calling off the election by then saying it was nothing to do with the polls which was a massive mistake it was a lie and it was treating people like fools
5119282 it was a big roll of the dice to do it without any notes no autocue no funny business there was a moment when i lost my train of thought but no one really noticed
5119283 i regret that my government driver took some of my papers home while i was on my bike
5119284 it shouldnt make any difference where you live there ought to be a common basis for making decisions about exceptional circumstances and i think anybody who uses the nhs for their care is entitled to expect that
5119285 what patients need to do is to find out from those who are making the decision what the basis of that decision is and if they dont think its reasonable if they dont think it compares appropriately with decisions that are taken elsewhere ask why not
5119286 if you have a patient from cheshire they have a very good record most of the time we apply to cheshire they tend to fund patients that have exceptional circumstances if we apply to the manchester primary care trust then in the eight applications weve made theyve only accepted one for funding in 2006

5119294 i got this one after being bitten by a moray eel
5119295 i got this one in honors biology summer school science class the burns were so bad i got benched from marching band for two weeks couldnt even be in a parade or nothin just sat at home alone in my room clutching my trombone playing a mournful dirge of longing and despair listening to my comrades play happier tunes somewhere off in the melancholy distance
5119296 could you get me a glass of water my spots are showing
5119297 in that day you shall know that i am in my father and you in me and i in you

5119303 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5119304 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5119305 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5119306 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5119307 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5119308 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5119309 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5119310 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5119311 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

5119314 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5119315 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5119316 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5119317 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5119318 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5119319 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5119320 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5119321 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

5119326 the industry has struggled badly with both skilled workers but more particularly people to do the harvest he told abc radio today
5119327 there is no question that there is a dire shortage
5119328 its such a dramatic announcement for the pacific workers who have been looking for work for generations she told abc radio
5119329 the situation can be quite dire in terms of unemployment
5119330 its the schemes really a chance to go from being nearly unviable to being economically prosperous
5119331 there are workers coming back with roughly about five or six thousand new zealand dollars
5119332 what this does is it shifts the incentives in favour of playing by the rules and having access to a job year after year

5119337 i dont know why at this office we only certify a veterans status
5119338 meanwhile we have a waiting list of 90 other people who want to buy licenses
5119339 weve determined that 30 percent of the people listed as medal of honor winners never received the medal
5119340 in all 20 to 40 percent of all military records showing honors or qualifications for special government assistance are fraudulent it breaks the law to make fraudulent claims and breaks others to use them to gain benefits but the fbi and federal courts are overloaded with drug and violent crimes so most people get away with this
5119341 children will call in to say their father is representing himself as a medal of honor winner or disabled veteran
5119342 well hear that a wife has tried to get military honors for her deceased husband only to be told he was not even a veteran the problem is that you can download all the documents the services used to issue and fill them out yourself and then give them to the veterans administration or other authority who dont have time to check everything
5119343 a man can say he was bitten by rats in a pow cell and escaped running six miles in his skivvies until he reached friendly troops and it sounds more convincing than most stories that are actually the truth which is usually nowhere near that dramatic
5119344 anyone can obtain a blank dd 214 and falsify it
5119345 if the va and veterans organizations would insist on this form they could cut way down on fraud if a fraudulent claimant is presented with it hell just refuse to sign it
5119346 were not talking about guys just telling stories in a bar were talking about people cheating the government and the public out of millions of dollars and cheating legitimate veterans by using up money and time they speak in our schools and churches and if their names arent removed from records then historical documents are false
5119347 remain s confident of growing our profitability in the current financial year
5119348 our focus on key drivers of growth remains consistent resulting in continued strong financial results mr bassat said

5119353 we were surprised by the severity of the residual sleep apnea in postoperative patients
5119354 the majority of individuals still had moderate to severe osa
5119355 the second surprising finding of this study was that despite the persistence and severity of the disease most people thought their sleep apnea was resolved after their weight loss and only a few still used cpap
5119356 why do you look for the living among the dead

5119358 everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink but you have saved the best till now
5119359 why does this fellow talk like that hes blaspheming who can forgive sins but god alone
5119360 why are you thinking these things 9 which is easier to say to the paralytic your sins are forgiven or to say get up take your mat and walk 10 but that you may know that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins
5119361 i tell you get up take your mat and go home

5119368 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
5119369 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
5119370 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
5119371 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
5119372 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

5119379 we must do everything we can to make sure that we achieve in the future a cyrillic internet domain name it is a pretty serious thing it is a symbol of the importance of the russian language and cyrillic
5119380 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

5119383 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5119384 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5119385 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5119386 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5119387 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5119388 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5119389 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5119390 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5119391 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5119392 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5119393 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5119394 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5119395 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5119396 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5119397 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5119398 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5119399 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5119400 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5119401 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5119402 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5119403 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5119404 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5119405 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5119406 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5119407 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5119408 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5119409 we would like to see san diego become a foreclosure sanctuary
5119410 theres as much in there as we want eventually you are just going to go backward and weaken the films
5119411 there are no commentary or interviews its like a reality tv show
5119412 celebrate their bodies and the joy of wreck beach and the joy of social naturism
5119413 people can start discounting body shame that theyre raised with
5119414 you see every movement in a persons body i enjoy this more than anything else
5119415 i appreciate what people are doing here we need to do it a bit longer
5119416 last year we had a whole family show up from hong kong
5119417 the government has squandered an opportunity to deal with cumulative impacts that were understood eight to ten years ago
5119418 the message that was coming from the alberta cabinet in particular was rapid development
5119419 a lot of work has been done to explore different options and gather scientific input

5119434 what grieves the holy spirit sin does paul urged christians to avoid lying to one another acting in anger toward one another stealing from one another and holding unwholesome conversations among themselves eph 4 25 29 christ went to immeasurable lengths to free you from your sin continuing by choice to live in sin is an affront to god a blatant rejection of his grace
5119435 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5119436 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5119437 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5119438 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5119439 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5119440 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5119441 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5119442 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5119443 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

5119447 weve been coming since they got here theres always coats for kids and the food bank and its a great way for the community to give back a little bit
5119448 were collecting money for the ips schools so they can get school supplies or uniforms for people less fortunate just to help them out
5119449 our colts fans are always generous with their heart and pocketbooks and we hope that they will help us out and contribute very well to this campaign

5119455 how does this happen i really love children and if they could see how well i care for their children when they are in my care then they would see that there really is no other place that will care for their child like i do
5119456 your cars not starting right your battery may be going out
5119457 while a marked slowdown in activity is likely over the next 18 months even if interest rates are cut when inflation peaks the correct policy decisions are still needed to ward off the threats of a serious and prolonged recession
5119458 the longer the mpc waits before cutting rates the bigger the danger that the economic situation would deteriorate
5119459 our view is that the threats to growth are more serious and more immediate than the risks of higher inflation
5119460 our central scenario envisages that the uk bank rate would be cut to 4 75 per cent in quarter four 2008 followed by an additional cut to 4 50 per cent in quarter one 2009
5119461 a marked slowdown in uk activity is highly likely over the next 18 months even if interest rates are cut in line with our central forecast but if the mpc decides not to cut rates in the next three to six months growth prospects would be worse than in our central scenario
5119462 british businesses are already being squeezed by the rising cost of raw materials and weakening export prospects in the slowing european market despite a weaker pound
5119463 these pressures together with the bleak outlook for domestic growth are taking an inevitable toll on firms confidence in their own ability to do business
5119464 theres a strong relationship between business confidence and the actual performance of the economy and with so many firms remaining downbeat we can expect uk economic growth to remain weak well into next year
5119465 this rapid re adjustment during the last three months comes as some discretionary sellers choose not to enter the market leaving a higher proportion of forced sellers who price more aggressively
5119466 while those who do not have to sell are holding off sellers who are also looking to buy are strongly placed to negotiate an equal or larger reduction in the price of the property they are buying
5119467 in addition buyers currently benefit from the best choice in years
5119468 for example properties that are architecturally desirable or in tight school catchment areas are increasingly attainable
5119469 buyers with specific requirements should take a long term view to try and secure their dream home
5119470 the lack of mortgage finance is central to the problem and perhaps that is where policymakers attention should be focused as the banks cant or wont sort out the mess they were instrumental in creating
5119471 in the meantime sellers need to continue to price to sell present their homes to be the best on the street and promote them better than the rest to really stand out

5119515 assessing the condition of oil related infrastructure cleaning up oil spills or other environmental damage at oil facilities engineering design and repair or reconstruction of damaged infrastructure assisting in making facilities operational distribution of petroleum products and assisting the iraqis in resuming iraqi oil company operations
5119516 the fact that the department was planning for the possibility that it would need to repair and provide for continuity of operations of the iraqi oil infrastructure was classified until march 2003
5119517 this prevented earlier acknowledgement or announcement of potential requirements to the business community
5119518 the u s considered such contingency planning necessary because of saddam husseins actions in kuwait in 1991 when iraqi forces damaged 750 wells
5119519 that destruction resulted in an environmental disaster as well as a tremendous blow to kuwaits oil production capability
5119520 from behind the obsidian mirrors of his wraparound sunglasses ray rodon surveys the vast desert landscape of southern iraqs rumailah oilfield a project manager with halliburtons engineering and construction division kellogg brown amp root rodon has spent months preparing for the daunting task of repairing iraqs oil industry working first at headquarters in houston and then out of a hotel room in kuwait city he has studied the intricacies of the iraqi national oil company even reviewing the firms organizational charts so that halliburton and the army can ascertain which iraqis are reliable technocrats and which are saddam loyalists
5119521 rodon represents the vanguard of what is expected to be a growing army of halliburton employees in iraq where the u s is preparing to embark on the grandest exercise in nation building since its occupation of japan after world war ii at the center of that undertaking will be u s companies with halliburton probably chief among them
5119522 indeed texans wearing kbr baseball caps are arriving by the planeload at kuwaits airport
5119523 the liberation of iraq couldnt come at a better time for halliburton whose business has been dogged by a host of troubles from a slowdown in domestic oil production to nightmare asbestos litigation last year revenues declined 6 to 12 6 billion and the company reported a net loss of 984 million but ceo dave lesar who took over when his predecessor dick cheney went to washington is starting to put halliburtons problems behind it he has cut costs sold unproductive assets curtailed money losing overseas operations and devised a bold plan to settle asbestos related lawsuits
5119524 the dod through its us army logistics civil augmentation program logcap iii contract with kbr tapped the company in november 2002 to develop the contingency plan implementation of the plan is being executed through a separate contract kellogg brown amp root now holds with the us army corps of engineers
5119525 kbr was selected for the iraq contract based on the fact that kbr is the only contractor that could commence implementing the complex contingency plan on extremely short notice

5119534 the dollars continuing uptrend is a key factor depressing commodities in general and triggering heavy sales in gold
5119535 inflation will restrict the feds ability to cut rates plus we have weaker growth in europe so the euro has been suffering
5119536 the dollar is coming out top at the moment so people have been liquidating commodities
5119537 not surprisingly the dollar is stronger and weighing on the commodity complex at large
5119538 with the rest of the world now joining the u s in slowing down the prospects for holding the dollar have brightened considerably
5119539 theres a perception that demand for commodities might be weakening

5119544 my information is that the impeachment vote will not take place
5119545 from a position when everyone was saying why should he go
5119546 this little higher number is probably the result of lower gas prices the economy remains pretty weak and consumer sentiment reflects that
5119547 there is little doubt among consumers about the likelihood of a recession
5119548 the financial market turmoil has meant that our funds rate reductions have led to less credit expansion to households and businesses than would typically be the case
5119549 the second half of 2008 will likely be extremely sluggish
5119550 well see some alleviation of the inflation pressures and having oil and other commodities come down so strongly helps
5119551 well its just experience its just hard thats whats bad about this deal here i was looking forward to getting a lot of laps under our belt here and getting comfortable and making sure everything was together underneath me and we were going to have a great day it just didnt work out
5119552 i could move around i wasnt tight at all which is really good for us i felt like it was coming to me there but i was just riding around there being good and just trying to get to the first pit stop and get a good feel on the car but was just unlucky
5119553 it wasnt a bad run actually it probably shouldve been a little better than that we had a tough time getting the balance right ever since we showed up here maybe something funny about this car but we were way too tight when we showed up and then way too loose and then swapped back and forth in the race just couldnt get it right and we should be able to run with our teammates were working really hard at it carl was just a little better than we were and david right there at the end on old tires was a little faster than us so well just work on it and get a little better
5119554 yeah it is we were on one side of it then the other then the other and just kept chipping away at it
5119555 we had a great car the 3m ford fusion just ran really good the pit stops were phenomenal but i couldnt get a hold of the race track like i needed to ever since we showed up here this weekend the car hasnt been exactly right way way too tight and then the very last practice too loose so we sort of jumped the fence there and never did get it balanced right
5119556 we had a good aaa ford it was good on the long runs you know the race just worked out in our favor we had a few long runs our car had good forward bite all day the 99 and 18 were probably the fastest of the field but we made an adjustment it seemed every stop and kept getting a little better if it wouldve been a 500 mile race i wouldve had something for em
5119557 dont mess up youve got to get a good points day its always fun to try to win the thing you dont want to put yourself in a bad position and take yourself out of a good top five finish and then finish 15th with it we could just all we can do and our car was fast and had good speed the pit stops were awesome from our aaa crew and just a good solid day its fun to be here at michigan
5119558 it was a struggle to say the least we were way off we were really good here in the spring and probably had a car fast enough to win the race but we were just really off today all my teammates ran good we got better at the end these guys did a great job on pit road and great adjustments we just struggled all day
5119559 really hard work from my guys they made good adjustments and got it better at the end we had some really good green flag transitions on our pit stops on pit road and we gained a bunch of spots during those green flag stops track position is real important if we wouldve been 15th or 16th on the last re start we probably wouldve finished somewhere back in there they got me the track position and that helped get a decent finish out of the day
5119560 i havent really thought about it at all to tell you the truth im more than a little frustrated with the way we ran there this is probably one of our best tracks like i said we ran good enough to win in the spring and carl and all of those guys used the stuff we had in the spring and then went out and beat us with it we did a little bit different stuff because we just couldnt get the handle on it all weekend we got here and right off the truck we werent right and just could never hit it so even though we finished fifth thats a bright spot but disappointed with how we performed
5119561 we always knew we could run this way if we just went a whole weekend without making many mistakes
5119562 it definitely wouldve been great to win but you dont want to take an unnecessary risks and take out a top five finish and finish 20th or something a win wouldve been great but the 18 and 99 were just a little better than us and after we didnt pit that last run we were kind of going to be sitting ducks depending on how the cautions worked out but i just drove as hard as i could and tried not to make any mistakes and at this point in the season a third place is great but a win wouldve been better but a 20th wouldve been just about devastating for us trying to make the chase
5119563 not specifically jimmy would make mention that were going to have a good points day if you just dont screw up were going to have a good points day if you just maintain no not specifically he wasnt telling me the car numbers of guys who were having trouble but you can see when some of the guys are a lap down or when youre passing them things like that you can use your own good judgment and tell whos struggling but specifically he wouldnt tell me anything
5119564 i think weve got a good engine department with roush yates racing engines thats something thats important jack is very particular on fuel mileage at all these big tracks we probably put a little more effort into this race than some of the others maybe we take a few more chances and really get pumped up a little bit more being that theres such a presence of ford racing people here and a lot of jacks employees and familys up here so we dont anything out of the box we just always are making sure that we cross our ts and dot our is when we come up to michigan because it is an important race for our team owner and its fun to see him happy when we leave here michigan
5119565 i cant believe my good fortune ive been in the presence of really fast company starting with mark martin here in 1988 we didnt win in 88 but we were in contention from the very beginning and of course he put his mark on our program and on our cars and our strategy and on our thinking doug yates and the guys did a really good job on the mileage it didnt turn out to be a mileage race i think everybody was looking forward to when we would actually race for it other than watch people drop off through fuel problems but it was great to watch all the cars as the crew chiefs and pit crews worked themselves through the day i dont think anybody had a real bad pit stop certainly there wasnt a penalty for speeding of for losing a tire and on a race like this that runs so many green flag laps thats something thats hard to recover from i know the 48 had a problem where they had to make an extra pit stop and that ruined their day but everybody did a super job and as the crew chiefs and the drivers and the engineers commiserated on all the programs made their adjustments toward the end of the day they were able to salvage the situation so that everybody was in the top 10 and certainly except for kyle busch finishing up there we had a chance to have two or three winners actually four winners out of the top five
5119566 i had a lot of fun how about that it was a challenge all day actually we didnt qualify very well and obviously starting 27th makes it a little tense early in the race but carl did a great job with the car coming through the field and then back and forth with the balance of the race car trying to keep up with the race track and with the competitors whether we take two tires or four tires actually got behind a little bit after a two tire cycle back to four tires and we were pretty loose there and the 18 was able to stretch a pretty big lead so having the ability to pit again and work on the car was a relief and carl did a great job from there on out
5119567 bob just did a great job everyone the crew did an unbelievable job and the greatest part is that we didnt give up more bonus points to kyle hes just so strong every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us so thats what we just have to keep doing is go out here and try to win the next three events and go into this chase on even ground but the guys are doing great bob made great adjustments and that was the key to the race
5119568 my psyche and mentality is pretty much fixed on im the greatest race car driver that ever lived know what im saying what it helps with if you dont think that thats what david pearson told me that if you dont believe that you dont belong in a race car what it helps with is points im sure kyle feels the same way its just that when we beat him its a 20 point spread and it goes the other way i finished second to him a few times this year and thats frustrating
5119569 yeah everyone does deep down you really have to believe in yourself and i think everyone who performs at a high level in every sport does i was watching the olympics and it struck me you see individuals that achieve so well and they achieve such great things and theres all the other folks who dont and just having the guts to go out there and jump in the water and swim or go run 100 meters in front of the whole world and compete you know you have the chance to lose but you just have to do the very best you can thats all you can do
5119570 we have very few words over the thing we make the team that fared the best on a good week like this that won they get their chance last by that time were out of time so we dont spend much time dwelling on things gone right but we do take things apart and for the missed opportunities or missteps we agonize over it and we commit not to have those things re occur
5119571 bob did a great job the car has to be able to do it we had at times in the race that car wouldnt and its very frustrating but bob stayed on top of it and as a driver you can only do as much as a car will do and bob just gave me a great car
5119572 its great i feel a little lonely in the decisions i have to make on many subjects at many different times but carl demonstrated to me and as david ragan does and as matt kenseth did before him and greg biffle did that hes going to be as good in this business as anybody ive ever known and hes going to stay there for a long time so i was right on recognizing he had potential and very quickly after he won his first race at charlotte i told him ill stay in the business as long as you drive these cars and i hope that ive got job security for a long time now on account of that
5119573 i was anxious to see i was hoping hed close the gap and actually move into the 12th position i understand hes tied for 13th and not far away but the fate of david as it relates to the chase will be based on whether hes involved in a wreck at a bad time or whether we break a part which winds up being my fault and whether the other people that are in the top four or the back four positions in the top 12 have better luck than he does in terms of how well things develop on the race track but david is doing everything that he can i know yesterday he had a wreck in the nationwide race where he let it get away from him and i said okay daid you can wreck once in a while youve had your wreck for a while now lets focus on making sure we stay on the black stuff today but hes matured more than i couldve imagined this year for his age hes 21 or 22 years old and its amazing when carl came onto the scene i think he was already 26 and mark martin was 28 jeff burton was 28 greg biffle was 28 so david ragan is way ahead of everybody thats currently driving for us in terms of what hes doing at his age because the other guys werent involved with us at that time were learning from david and when we get it figured out well be able to do for him what he needs to have done same as we tried to do for everybody else
5119574 its great for me just for the reasons we talked about its the site of my first race in cup and we run so well here that its just fun we usually get a chance to go visit the folks at ford go to jacks museum in livonia theres always fun stuff going on around the race and its enjoyable
5119575 its great for me this is an occasion where we have two suites actually one inside the track and one outside that we celebrate with our customers and employees weve got about 3 000 employees in the area that work on prototype cars for all the manufacturers and we have a great time with that and of course this is my private playground i told somebody this is my playground and they misunderstood what i meant as an avocation im an aviator and i come out here and this is my aeromatics box i come out here and test and i do loops and i do rolls and just kick up my heels and have a great time its really home for me its a chance to play in front of the home crowd it means a lot to ford motor company it means a lot to me
5119576 im guardedly optimistic that well be able to put four cars in the chase that wont be the same as when we put five in but carl based on the way that the structure of the chase is will be in better shape than any of the other guys can be based on the number of points hes got from the wins hes had and carl certainly is a strong favorite within my group of prospects of being able to close the deal and i dont think we can win the next four times so i dont think well quite be able to establish parity with the bonus points that kyles going to have but if we could get close and then we can beat him on the race track consistently through the chase more than he beats us i think it could be just fine im counting on that but im hoping that matt kenseth makes it in that greg biffle holds his seat and that not wishing the 99 any bad luck but that theyll have their chance to do well in there as well
5119577 bob osborne crew chief and all the guys in the pit crew did a great job and the greatest part of todays win was that we didnt give up any more bonus points to kyle
5119578 weve got to try to go out and win the next three events and enter the chase on even ground
5119579 at chicago when we had our trouble it came down to kyle and jimmie and jimmie lost it on the restart
5119580 kyle is really good on the restarts and i didnt want to have to go through that pain today
5119581 pretty much nothing he was just able to take off on those restarts and get a pretty good run through one and two and once he got that gap it was just over well take it at least we know we can keep up with the 99 edwards
5119582 there was still a twinkle in his blue eyes yeah major
5119583 i was sitting down having a cigarette and he spotted me and made a beeline to me he got all of his security to close in so johnny couldnt get to me
5119584 guys on behalf of jgr just a little background i got a call late last night kind of informing that hey there was an issue after the race doing the dyno they found a piece there again im not going to go into technical detail on what it was cause i am not even sure yet on the race car so there was a piece there that wouldnt let the pedal apparently go all the way down in the dyno and show like we had less horsepower than we actually did so let me just say first and foremost that we that was a really poor and foolish decision on the part of our key guys there at jgr i want to apologize to nascar to our partners to toyota guys a couple guys chose to make a decision there that impacts all of us to me the frustrating part is you know why i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint that wanting to show that we have less horsepower than ever before and wanting to make it look like were handicapped you know even more than we actually were i understand that but that is not an excuse i think for us we kind of feel like i know with us with the engine shop thats kind of badge of honor you win that engine dyno good for you we felt like the past few years and mark cromquest and those guys really feel like they want to win that thing so to me to come back after youve been chopped to come back and then win it again thats awesome thats a great story so that wasnt able to be told so now were sitting here going over issues from the guys it sounds like again they made a poor decision on our part so we apologize to our partners and we think going forward hey were going to have to address some of those things no matter what nascar does were going to address those issues in house figure out exactly what happened and those responsible and hey theres going to be punishment for them you know thats just part of life you cant do that you put everyone else at risk so any questions you guys have along those lines feel free to fire away knowing that i dont have all the details on it but i have a pretty good idea
5119585 yea i think for us any violation is a serious one so i think you know keep in mind it wasnt an on track issue in no way was the caron the track issue in no way was the car we had on the track we were racing anything other than it should have been you know that would have been an extremely big deal even that so off the track going through the dyno again i understand the guys frustration i think theres probably a few of the guys on the nationwide team wanting to make a point and so well go through it hey we have had some pretty hard stuff weve done in the past before and well continue to do that in the future
5119586 yea i think for us look if you cant come in whatever business you are in and do it the right way you know whats the point we want to do it to get the satisfaction do it the right way if you ask nascar weve been a great partner throughout the years and i think with them and trying to do things the right way so yea that was the last thing and i still think that our guys will say that was a mistake on our part and was not intentional this one here is clearly if it turns out what it is thats an intentional opportunity to lead someone astray so were not going to do that
5119587 yea i would say if it was an on track thing it would definitely stain them but being an off track things and trying dinking around with the dyno personally i dont see how it would affect those wins there but again hey its still a serious issue with nascar even if it is off the track working the dyno so there was no reason for that
5119588 yea i have had some conversations with a couple of our key guys and i got a pretty good idea but not enough now that i want to say heres exactly what it was and now enough to say heres what im going to do but ive got a pretty good idea of who the guys are on the nationwide team that are responsible
5119589 we have and i met with a couple of those guys there and really i think its frustrating to everyone at this point i think what happened is our guys were doing it based on joe gibbs racing they want what is best for us keep in mind what you do with our motives also reflects poorly on toyota it looks like hey now they are involved in something that they dont want to be involved in i think for us it was clearly a joe gibbs racing you know our guys did it and it was im sure discouraging for them again hey we are in the middle of an owners points chase too you know so i think at the end of the day i keep going back to our guys we want to win the engine dyno thing thats the frustrating thing to me thats satisfaction not to go out there playing games
5119590 rising energy costs impact all sectors of our economy but agriculture producers in texas now have new opportunities to streamline operations reduce costs and remain competitive
5119591 to help farmers and ranchers face these significant challenges this program will identify incentives to move toward more energy efficient farms reducing energy costs increasing available capital spurring economic growth and improving the working environment
5119592 investing in our communities through improved energy efficiency in farming operations is a win win opportunity for state agriculture
5119593 we want to make texas made products available to every market in the world and we can keep prices competitive when farmers operate efficiently
5119594 i plan to disrupt this convention with my body and my voice
5119595 but ive been praying for this my whole life and yet i still havent found the one
5119596 my psyche and mentality is pretty much fixed on that im the greatest race car driver to ever live
5119597 thats what david pearson told me he said if you dont believe that you dont belong in that race car
5119598 the greatest part is we didnt give up more bonus points to kyle
5119599 hes just so strong every time i win and he finishes second thats a 20 point spread for us thats what we just have to keep doing is to go out and win the next three events and go into this chase on even ground
5119600 hes been the guy that weve got to race on these mile and a half and two mile race tracks hes been decent at other race tracks too but not as stout as he is at these and theres a lot of those in the chase
5119601 weve still got some work cut out for us yeah its a 20 point swing so weve got to live with it weve got to take it and hopefully we can make up for it somewhere else
5119602 i knew he was going to hang back and get a run on my bumper like jimmie at chicago i wasnt going to let that happen
5119603 i didnt want to have to go through that pain so i just did everything i could to have the best restart i could and it worked out great
5119604 somebody said its going to come down to just me and kyle
5119605 i hope its just me and kyle itd be nice to just have to beat one other guy but i have the feeling that this chase is going to be spectacularly competitive
5119606 its great to be locked in and have everything go our way so far this year but weve got three more races left here before the chase starts and then weve got 10 more to keep it up throughout the chase
5119607 theres a lot of room there that still anything can happen
5119608 they told me it was 1 30 so i slowed down chilled down a little bit i watched the handball in the olympics
5119609 i couldnt figure it out i was watching norway and romania
5119610 we knew coming into spring training that he would make our rotation
5119611 we slipped him right into the 3 hole and hes done just a great job
5119612 weve watched his pitch counts all year and try to give him an extra day when we could but ill tell you this his stuff is as good right now as it was early in the year which is saying a lot
5119613 it goes to show what good shape hes in and how hard he works and hes got the mental toughness
5119614 enough of all the curse this the curse that the goat the black cat or the 100 years without winning the world series
5119615 truthfully we gave him every opportunity to win a baseball game
5119616 but ill tell you what he toughed it out he was out of gas
5119617 thats all they had to do get me out of the lineup and wed score runs
5119618 hes just got to finish it out the way hes throwing theres no reason to expect that he wont
5119619 he puts a couple more wins on the board quickly i think youll start hearing a few whispers about the cy young
5119620 youve got to remember this young man came up as a starter made an all star team as a starter then we put him in the bullpen where he had to learn to pitch in pressure situations and get out of trouble
5119621 hes got more equipment now more experience hes got the split finger for left handed hitter hes got the nice slider for right handed hitters and hes got a darned good fastball for both hes got the tools hes a better pitcher now obviously than he was when he started
5119622 ive got to call my wife and get my two kids to work a little bit
5119623 when you turn the ball over five times in any football game youre going to have a hard time winning
5119624 i just didnt make a good decision throwing the ball during that interception
5119625 you just have to learn from it hopefully i can take something away from that drive and allow it to benefit me in the future
5119626 were executing for the most part in different facets of the game were doing a lot of things well right now
5119627 getting ahead of the hitters keeping the pitch count down i wanted to finish the game for sure
5119628 had a pocket full of horses fucked the shit out of bears
5119629 i wasnt nervous and i hit a pretty good 5 wood
5119630 the hole was wide open but there were rocks everywhere and i was just trying to give myself a par chance unfortunately it just didnt work out
5119631 i left a few shots out there but i had a very good day with the putter even if i would have come in second i would have been really happy my goal coming into this tournament was to try and make the top 15
5119632 ive been doing this a long time and i know nights like tonight arent acceptable for whatever reason
5119633 theres a million reasons why i could tell you things happen but you know its a bottom line business
5119634 they made some plays that with a little game planning wouldnt have gone quite like that
5119635 this is a precision game and timing youve got to be right on
5119636 weve just been off a couple of clicks i have no concerns at all that itll start coming around
5119637 weve got to get our timing down i dont want to go through the litany of reasons why it doesnt matter weve just got to get meshed together
5119638 each time out he is making a statement establishing himself as a legitimate top of the order starter in either league
5119639 i havent been a part of or seen a team swinging the bats as well as we are right now
5119640 reported sunday that italian team premiata montegranaro made public sunday that they have also signed a well known former nba player
5119641 i am happy that a player that has made basketball history would come to montegranaro he is very motivated and he has been staying in shape to show up at our camp in good shape we will discover with work in the gym if he will be a key player for our team now its too soon to say that
5119642 we are asking for a humanitarian trust fund to be used to deal with the vestiges of slavery that 35 million african americans still suffer from like housing education and economic development in our communities
5119643 i was wondering about how my father would feel about this whole thing and i sensed his presence

5119647 i wanted to open a gallery and my friend wanted to open a bar i said no he said we can do both
5119648 lele called and the first thing out of her mouth was why dont you open a gallery and bar with me
5119649 still i couldnt see how an emerging artist gallery would work without some kind of daily income about 4 years ago i thought what about liquor a full service gallery with dedicated space and a full service bar
5119650 galleries are always quiet spaces but i felt there were younger potential collectors who were i wouldnt say intimidated but galleries werent an obvious connection for them art in this country hasnt always been that integrated into the culture
5119651 since we opened weve had a number of people who have bought their first piece of art here thats really satisfying thats when i feel like the vision succeeded
5119652 i wanted there to be a lot of life around the artwork
5119653 we have thousands of people come through here in a month
5119654 good bouncers who watch out for the art most of our employees are artists or have worked with art weve had such good clientele from the beginning we didnt build this for the money but to do something really special and i think people sense that
5119655 the next morning the guy brought it back and said im sorry

5119658 it has become clear to me over the last several years that the greatest obstacle to a fair trail for most defendants is public fear of and prejudice against defendants charged with gang related crimes as well as those who are alleged to be members of gangs

5119667 in exchange for the charter a corporation was obligated to obey all laws to serve the common good and to cause no harm early state legislators wrote charter laws and actual charters to limit corporate authority and to ensure that when a corporation caused harm they could revoke its charter

5119679 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5119680 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5119681 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5119682 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5119683 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5119684 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones

5119703 the snow and the ice slid out from underneath him
5119704 he was seen to attempt to ride the snow and stay above the surface however at some stage he has been engulfed by the large amount of snow and ice
5119705 we police were aware at that stage that a person had been engulfed by the snow and that a search had taken place by witnesses to no avail
5119706 people do need to be aware that the cornices in the high country can become unstable after a period of warmer weather

5119711 i really dont know how a little girl in china might respond to being told your teeth are not good enough but doesnt that happen all the time in hollywood
5119712 the people were so emotionally involved if you asked them whats the most moving episode i think the majority would tell you that moment with the little girl in red clothes now the chinese people feel they are fooled the psychological hurt is enormous
5119713 this is a continuum that started back on 9 11 to reform law enforcement and the intelligence community to focus on the terrorism threat

5119716 if properly implemented this should assure the public that people are not being investigated by agencies who are not trained in how to protect constitutional rights
5119717 the fbi will need to be vigilant both in its policies and its practices to live up to that promise
5119718 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information

5119734 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5119735 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5119736 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5119737 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5119738 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5119739 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5119740 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5119741 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5119742 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5119743 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5119744 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5119745 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5119746 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5119747 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5119748 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5119749 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5119750 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen

5119782 you would have to shop around for a good price and see what you could get even if it meant 20 or 30 each way we would certainly look at flying with a different airline
5119783 we are reluctantly introducing modest baggage fees due to ever rising costs to all airlines associated with baggage security screening and extreme rises in the cost of jet fuel
5119784 today due to increased security screening which is a necessary fact of life it costs us more to process a bag than its owner
5119785 gostei do verton porque foi ele quem desafunilou o jogo no segundo tempo o jogo estava muito por dentro e ele conseguiu colocar velocidade pelos lados amparado tamb m pelo maur cio e pelo conca pecamos no cruzamento no ltimo passe mas ele foi muito bem hoje
5119786 no segundo tempo conseguimos equilibrar o jogo com a entrada do verton e por m ritos dele a defesa do galo acabou se confundido o verton se imp s em campo
5119787 fiquei muito feliz de estrear com essa bela vit ria com muita garra e ra a n s v nhamos trabalhando para que essa estr ia fosse boa e hoje consegui dar minha contribui o sa mos muito felizes com esses tr s pontos
5119788 nossa equipe uma equipe jovem que est amadurecendo durante o campeonato acho que quando eles tiveram o jogador expulso faltou um pouco de malandragem para girar a bola ter calma para criar a oportunidade de fazer o gol
5119789 a gente tinha quatro cinco jogadores para tr s deles na verdade foi uma desaten o nossa
5119790 a gente sai um pouco frustrado porque se preparou muito forte para vencer esta partida acho que fizemos uma atua o razo vel mas para vencer o palmeiras ficou provado que n o basta jogar razoavelmente
5119791 os resultados positivos deixam a equipe emocionalmente bem conseguimos cinco vit rias consecutivas no brasileiro e agora teremos tr s jogos seguidos no rio para garantirmos a perman ncia no g 4 quem sabe podemos at brigar pelo t tulo brasileiro
