750072 that just because content sits on googles knol site it wont gain any ranking authority from being part of the knol domain
750073 i found one third of the pages listed on the knol home page that i tested ranked in the top results
750074 i came away feeling that being on knol does indeed give pages an advantage they might not get if theyd been hosted on some other brand new website

750150 howard mentioned in that portfolio interview that he had second thoughts about it after finding out much money they made given the state of the company im sure he feels some sort of pressure to keep money flowing in
750151 its pretty easy to add hot water to a bowl of oatmeal and depending on what else is in it its a healthy alternative to the pastry case i would much rather have instant oatmeal than stinky breakfast sandwiches and a space consuming oven
750152 the grief associated with losing a branch of a ubiquitous coffee chain can be hard especially when finding an alternative location can require the use of the sun to navigate a skill mostly lost to history that and the ability to walk 100 feet
750153 he had 2nd thoughts about it after finding out much money they made
750154 would people go this berserk if the local dunkin donuts closed
750155 we are flattered at the outpouring of support to our company the stores and the partners but our analysis and economic models show that these stores are not viable long term the decision to close these stores while certainly excruciating to make is a well considered and is not subject to change
750156 funny how all the store closings are getting dms to push out people they dont like to make room for more favored displaced partners
750157 and if more stores supposedly do close over this so what there is so much internal competition because there are 1 too many stores and 2 too many stores too close together as far as im concerned closing 600 stores is not enough only two stores in my entire region are closing thats it only two not near enough
750158 wow this pr person should run for office that was a pretty decent job of not answering the question at all i can see an obama trevino ticket now they can impress and inspire folks without really saying much of anything but saying it very well
750159 ill give you a call if i need anything else

750162 all starbucks stores in australia are closing from 2pm onwards presumably monday for all partners to attend meetings related to critical and time sensitive business decisions is there anything else happening in any other markets
750163 former starbucks employees would also need a bit of extra training in how to texturise milk because we use a manual system here and they use a semi automatic
750164 oh the economy is bad and we are laying people off
750165 then show up at the conference call with nothing but bad manners
750166 what about the coffee another strip mall store really does that new partner understand starbucks purpose etc
750167 what happens when 17 becomes your standard and then 16 is only one off and then 15
750168 howard amp co seem so disconnected from the world hes created that he experiences everyday what with the people that surround him and the affluent life hes adjusted to and the world his companys actually in
750169 and peter gibbons senior vice president of global manufacturing operations who led manufacturing operations has been promoted to executive vice president global supply chain operations
750170 i fully understand the seriousness of these actions and the concerns you may have but please be assured that we will treat all departing and remaining partners with respect and dignity
750171 yes you are the best we have but you make too much money yes you could run 20 stores and you help every dm constantly but you make too much money yes your record and awards far exceeds anyone in the region but you make too much money yes the other dms have had compliance calls and problems but you still make too much money
750172 the company has lowered its fiscal 2009 store opening target in the u s to approximately a negative 60 net new stores which includes a nearly 225 company operated store decline and approximately 165 licensed net new stores internationally starbucks is planning to open approximately 900 net new stores in fiscal 2009 two thirds of which are expected to be licensed as it factors in the current global economic climate with a cautious approach in the uk and western europe capital expenditures for fiscal 2009 are now expected to be approximately 750 million which reflects the reduced store targets for the u s and international segments
750173 not on board with the passion and mindset starbucks needs
750174 thank you starbucks for positively impacting my life so that i could impact others i appreciate that time in my life
750175 and terminated partners will be treated with respect and dignity and will be able to manage their own departure from the building
750176 i mean really its a coffee shop if a starbucks closes go to another i have never really understood what drives people to a starbucks instead of a smaller local place
750177 and although indie shops may have a good atmosphere the love for coffee and the training arent as in depth
750178 rose this way we have to stay on the ship as long as possible

750189 even though the picture of the girl in the tight purple shirt skeeves me out big time
750190 starbucks apparently isnt investing much time in clover training at its stores
750191 weve never purchased parts or service from starbucks in the past and were not going to start now
750192 ever have a french press cup of coffee well we are automating the french press coffee experience so that you get a french press cup of coffee every time from a machine in a coffeehouse setting
750193 well i have this product that replicates and improves on the french press style of brewing coffee which under the close supervision of a well trained brewista creates a perfect cup of coffee in just under a minute using an inverted vacuum driven brewing method and precise calibration of every aspect of the brewing process

750277 consumers dont move that fast there is no question that digital media is exponentially increasing in importance but there are lots of reasons that that statement is not going to prove to be correct largely because theres a whole group of consumers out there who like print media

750279 its been a wonderful run denver but its time to admit that we can no longer be a two newspaper town

750331 would you like to have every guy here absolutely but business side is the business this guy suggs loves football he wants to be here i know that and i know hes worked himself really hard in the offseason to be in great shape baltimore colts
750332 right now we need to get the fluid out of his knee and get that thing settled down a little bit
750333 it feels great to be out the league for two years and then to jump back in it

750342 youre hearing the songs in the moment with the energy of everyone playing together
750343 we allowed ourselves the time to rewrite as we saw fit
750344 the sophomore album was written more or less in about two weeks if you added up all the days we actually wrote this one we stretched over an entire year
750345 not let me tell you about my boyfriend its not puppy love although there is some fun and levity on this record
750346 steve earle steve earle please write a song for me
750347 its in the understanding of loss and pain and in the stories and specific songs
750348 i believe that an artist has an ethos that attracts a fan ours is intricately woven into our need to express ourselves as songwriters
750349 i also think you try harder connect deeper and play better when you wrote the song you are singing
750350 i think they have such a good sense of themselves
750351 they know who they are and they have a good vision for where they want to go with their music i think theyve just made an awful lot of good moves in their career
750352 on the first one we knew we were good songwriters but we didnt know we were good country songwriters
750353 but it comes in a lull in the campaign june and july you know the primary is over it tends to get a little dull usually the negative ads havent appeared yet and so its sort of a perfect time to begin the guessing game
750354 if theres anything is some guys closet some local reporter who has covered this person for eight or 12 or 16 years might know about and might it get out before the candidate has committed to an embarrassing choice
750355 we dont even know if the candidates have really decided some of the names floated now are the candidates being nice to people who have no chance but floating their names helps them with their local constituents
750356 i cant comment on the process that were going through i apologize for being so obtuse
750357 when we start commenting you really get on a slippery slope and sometimes thats unfair to the people that are under consideration
750358 i think particularly someone like barack obama who is such a controlling politician and works so hard to make sure that everything is leak proof i imagine he probably has led us completely astray and might have a really explosive surprise in store because thats the way he wants to be

750368 most of all john steinway sounds so good because they never compromise on quality each wood piece raw wood has to be perfect they store away the wood in perfect housing for decades perfect materials or they dont build next and this is only true of steinway each man did one job only for the rest of his life you made one little part and you made it perfectly and no one could take your job away because you were the only one of maybe three people in the world who could do that tiny but crucial job we felt very special everyone knew everyone we all knew who was building what and wed come and check that it fit perfectly fifty a hundred times if we had to
750369 dont ever get anything but a steinway and dont ever get it rebuilt unless the guy worked directly for steinway even now they are still the same and will never change
750370 he said if we do this deal with google yahoo will become part of googles pole
750371 and microsoft he said would not be strong enough in this market to be a pole of its own
750372 the alleged comment is inconsistent with our stated position and inconsistent with any comment we recall making
750373 yahoos staying in the market theyre going to be a competitor going forward there still will be three large aggressive competitors competing across the board in internet services
750374 if microsoft is successful in swallowing up yahoo one will be gone
750375 i am writing to urge you to direct your office to take quick and decisive action by launching a formal investigation into the proposed business transaction between google and yahoos search advertising business
750376 the impact of such potential market concentration in both internet search and search advertising left in the hands of one company at the very least warrants rigorous scrutiny we must ensure that the proper consumer safeguards and transparency are put in place to protect privacy
750377 the ability to data mine online behavior in order to find specific consumers interested in specific products is a big part of googles revenue stream and business plan if google is allowed to control over 90 percent of internet searches those data mining capabilities will be unmatched and will soon make it impossible for any competitor to crack googles stranglehold on web advertising
750378 both companies have taken important steps in this agreement to ensure that user privacy is protected
750379 any suggestion that google and yahoo are merging vast databases of personal information is simply false while we may share some search terms to obtain sponsored search results from google we will not share personal information about our users without consent
750380 the internet advertising model does not work without the trust of our users most of what we do is offered to consumers for free and users can leave at any time we can only succeed if our users trust us and our privacy policies

750401 dr sayeh is a consummate world bank bureaucrat and would not even dare to speak any language other than what the ifis stand for i think she would simply carry out whatever assigned task is given her and would not advocate for nor inspire changes
750402 for technocrats such as sayeh to bring about any meaningful changes with regard to policy direction at the fund there will need to be total overhaul over the governance structure the policy format is not a technical issue but rather a mixture of politics and power in the imf and sayeh does not have the backing to shift the policy of the institution

750437 the corporate pressure and the ratings terror are intensifying all the time and the situation is not simple i find myself in the last bastion of male dominance and realizing what hillary clinton might have realized not long ago that sexism in the american society is more common than racism and certainly more acceptable or forgivable in any case i think my post and hillarys race are important steps in the right direction
750438 i believe that either today or tomorrow and im not privy to his schedule sen obama will be landing in iraq with some other senators who make up a congressional delegation mcain told a campaign fund raising luncheon
750439 if it is true that obama is going to iraq this weekend it is a very serious mistake for mccain to have disclosed it publicly
750440 please strongly discourage congressional offices from issuing press releases prior to their trips which mention their intent to travel to the aor and or the dates of that travel or their scheduled meetings such releases are a serious compromise to opsec
750441 oh field stop playing into fears and reckless paranoia obama will have plenty of protection from the
750442 i think that weve proven that both parents are important in the success of a family so no i dont believe in gay adoption
750443 john mccain could have been clearer in the interview in stating that his position on gay adoption is that it is a state issue just as he made it clear in the interview that marriage is a state issue tucker bounds a campaign spokesman said in a statement
750444 we are pleased that senator mccain clarified the remarks and we thank the senator for once again re iterating his belief that issues concerning marriage and family laws should be left up to the states not the federal government

750449 sixteen years after brett favre came to the packers he is returning for a seventeenth season he has had a great career with our organization and although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage brett will be in camp tomorrow although there has been uncertainty regarding bretts return ted thompson and coach mccarthy had previously discussed this and have had a plan in place coach mccarthy will talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly no matter what i look forward to another successful season for the packers and our fans this has been a tough situation but the packers will make the most of it

750451 rather than engage in divisive ballot initiatives we must have a dialogue and cooperation and mutual efforts together to provide every child in america to fulfill their expectations
750452 i am a strong supporter of affirmative action when properly structured so there it is not a quota but it is acknowledging and taking into account some of the hardships and difficulties that communities of color may have experienced continue to experience and it also speaks to the value of diversity in all walks of american life
750453 forgive me my sins and help me guard against pride and despair give me the wisdom to do what is right and just
750454 when he wrote forgive me there was too much space between forgive and me so he probably doesnt feel he needs to be forgiven

750463 people are scratching their heads about your opposition to the surge
750464 katie couric senator mccain senator obama says while the increased number of us troops contributed to increased security in iraq he also credits the sunni awakening and the shiite government going after militias and says that there might have been improved security even without the surge whats your response to that mccain i dont know how you respond to something that is as such a false depiction of what actually happened colonel macfarland was contacted by one of the major sunni sheiks because of the surge we were able to go out and protect that sheik and others and it began the anbar awakening i mean thats just a matter of history in fact as spencer ackerman and ilan goldenberg have reported the record firmly establishes the opposite instead of being caused by the surge the key signs of the anbar awakening occurred not only before that strategy was implemented but before it was ever conceived
750465 well if that scenario evolves then i think its obvious that we would have to leave because if it was an elected government of iraq i dont see how we could stay when our whole emphasis and policy has been based on turning the iraqi government over to the iraqi people
750466 there are neighborhoods in baghdad where you and i could walk through those neighborhoods today

750470 controversial leaders in the history of a country known for government corruption and vice
750471 the new yorker may think as one of their staff explained to us that their cover is a satirical lampoon of the caricature sen obamas right wing critics have tried to create but most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive and we agree
750472 we cant afford to be divided by race we cant afford to be divided by region or by class and we cant afford to be divided by gender which by the way that means bernie youve got to clean up your act next time this is a family affair
750473 sen obama told bernie mac that he doesnt condone these statements and believes what was said was inappropriate
750474 before these guys go i want them to know that i had heard a rumor that they had suggested that i had nothing by them on my ipod that is not true i love wilco

750476 yeah yeah i know but no disrespect to waiters and waitresses but i am quite sure that its not rocket science some of those brothers in the kitchen would probably make fine waiters
750477 i mean you would have to be able to understand them when they describe the menu you know how your cousins are

750481 hi i am mandy her real name may i take your order
750482 mandy are you in college my husband and i were just having a conversation about area colleges
750483 as affordable coverage is made available individuals should purchase health insurance while there are differing approaches within the party about how best to achieve the commitment of universal coverage we stand united to achieve this fundamental objective through the legislative process
750484 we believe that as you make health care more affordable people will be able to buy that health a basic principal how we get there is a matter of legislative process
750485 if you look at everybody here people got along very well youll see that whatever it is the final document here on the platform is one that we are all going to fight for in full force as we get to the convention and i think we are all pleased with the result and we are one big happy family and now we just want to grow we want to reach out to the independents we want to bring some republicans that have been left out so they can also join our effort to elect senator obama as the next president
750486 in recent years weve seen an administration put forward a false choice between the liberties we cherish and the security we demand
750487 we will restore our constitutional traditions and recover our nations founding commitment to liberty under law we reject illegal wire tapping of american citizens we reject torture we reject sweeping claims of inherent presidential power we will revisit the patriot act and overturn unconstitutional executive decisions issued during the past eight years
750488 the way that people respond to summer madness the weather is hot and girls are dressing less and checking out the fellas to tell em whos best

750500 the two wars were fighting in the middle east issue
750501 we feel pretty confident that it is going to impact somewhere along the southern western gulf coast near the upper middle texas coast
750502 it hasd been there for five or six days so it had to go somewhere
750503 we are just going to watch it and get ready
750504 the state is preparing for tropical storm force winds beginning at midnight tomorrow night for our area but right now it is expected to stay 120 miles offshore from southeast texas that does put us on the wet side of the storm and early predictions are between two and four inches of rain with a maximum of six inches we want to go ahead and tell people that they need to be prepared and top off their tanks because they will likely be affected by the storm monday night or tuesday morning and they could lose power remember these are early predictions and we will obviously know more at the next conference call
750505 i thought i could will it away i didnt realize how i wasnt thinking clearly
750506 its a fairly common phenomenon but its not normal and it needs treatment
750507 we finally have a mouse model we can use to study postpartum depression which has been a major limitation in the field until this point

750509 im praying for us to find our way back to one another
750510 they try to pretend you dont exist if i write the letter and you dont sign it it will just give them another opportunity to pretend you dont exist if we write it together it shows that we are together in this
750511 this will do nothing but piss her off even more
750512 oh ive been really mean and horrid to this woman who obviously loves my son perhaps now would be a good time to apologize

750514 learning at this age is a great joy as you are not answerable to anyone nor is there any obligation you feel young when you learn something new people treat you with respect and encourage you also you can learn at your own pace
750515 you have plenty of time in hand further studies have shown that constant learning has the ability to keep dementia at bay by giving work to your brain you are not idle and dont give way to depression you spend your time following your interests
750516 the course helped me keep abreast of environment scenario and gave an insight into laws i was not aware of at a higher level studying at this age helps you be more alive and occupied the whole experience of taking notes preparing for the examinations and the investigatory project was thoroughly enjoyable
750517 i enjoy chanting slokas and wanted to learn sanskrit to get pronunciations right and understand the meaning of the mantras better the whole thing was wonderful as i was not looking at marks or rank when i enrolled in fact it was my sanskrit teacher who egged me on to enrol
750518 a few could discourage you by pointing out to physical ailments general weakness or lack of alertness and speed
750519 everything is available online these days and you can learn anything at the click of a mouse

750526 lloydy was criticised as much as anyone early in the year and its probably no surprise that his and the older guys turnaround in form is what has really sparked the rest of the team
750527 weve got a lot of young guys playing good footy but the older guys are probably leading the way
750528 its tough to get around melbourne when they get their numbers back
750529 i think in the past essendon has been prone to have a good win and then take the foot off the pedal but this years been a different story
750530 we came out against richmond a few weeks ago in a similar position and we got beaten out of the midfield and we ended up losing so a big focus this week was to actually bring in our defending pressure in the last quarter and help us get over the line
750531 one of my least successful albums its just gone gold after 42 years

750534 clearly the most expensive case fbis ever undertaken and the most scientifically compelling case
750535 our goals are more of the same the idea that he said hes iron man in part 1 its one thing to say it and its another thing to actually evolve to the point where you can live in a heroic fashion you know they say the superhero movie always needs to follow and i said who is that guy get him out of here we want to do what worked for us last time in a way that evolves were talking about a guy who is put in an extraordinary circumstance and the people that are around him and how that creates a sense of family and how that disrupts whatever forces that we have to say that are working in his life i like the idea of an iron man 2 that youre able to understand various points of view youre able to touch on some subjects that are a lot more far reaching while still grounding it in entertainment
750536 sherlock holmes we start october 6 th guy ritchies take on it was that its like well be making a contemporary version of a very classic portrayal of exactly how it was but its not telling one of the stories from one of the books or anything like that watson its all there the cool thing about sherlock holmes was hes actually a very skilled martial artist so its going to have elements of that its not just his deduction and all that stuff its going to be a very action packed version of that to me its really exciting
750537 im always training im big into martial arts were putting together a team of people were going to try to do something a little more transcendent and interesting i love the idea of martial arts and bare knuckle boxing before the queensbury rules where it was all kind of proper it was this real balls to the wall brutal type stuff guy ritchies a martial artist and martial arts student so were going to have a real fun time doing all that

750595 10 year agreement which began september 12 1991 and was to continue for a period of
750596 move those crates full of gold and silver certificates down in the philippines out into the global banking financing and economies while using
750597 it appears to me that our country is literally being hollowed out our economy is being hollowed out
750598 its clear that something was terribly amiss on that day with our people who were in charge they didnt even follow standard operating procedure
750599 they steal elections with the same ease that they steal women and little girls
750600 a jury said in 1999 that it was a us government conspiracy including the highest individuals at the highest levels of the united states government i have no reason to disbelieve them
750601 if they would do that then to martin luther king jnr at a stage now where we have a law that defines enemy combatants we all could be enemy combatants just by dissenting from what this administration does and they could do the same thing to us
750602 the american people were once again abandoned they were abandoned by their own government and secretary michael chertoff has gotten off scott free on this
750603 they needed food and water and instead they were sent men with guns and blackwater mercenaries were hired to patrol the streets of new orleans this is criminal how can we have mercenaries patrolling the streets of america
750604 you had an administration that was awol and they had the nerve to bring other folks up on criminal charges for even being conscientious objectors
750605 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
750606 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
750607 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
750608 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
750609 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
750610 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
750611 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
750612 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
750613 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
750614 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
750615 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
750616 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
750617 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy

750619 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
750620 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people

750677 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
750678 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
750679 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
750680 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
750681 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
750682 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
750683 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans

750707 prep trials are taking place within a changing landscape of hiv prevention research
750708 disappointing results have emerged from recent studies of vaccine and microbicide candidates while male circumcision was found to be partially effective at preventing hiv transmission in some populations and is being rolled out in some african countries
750709 although still unproven human clinical research prep is considered one of the promising clinical interventions against hiv currently in development
750710 by mid 2009 more people will be enrolling in prep studies than in both hiv vaccine and microbicide efficacy trials combined advocates and communities affected by hiv need to understand prep and its implications for the aids advocacy and global health agendas and government and private funders committed to global health must step forward now to ensure that prep research is fully funded
750711 we cannot wait for the study results to begin to prepare for the optimal use and delivery of prep
750712 instead we should look ahead to consider all of the possible outcomes of these trials and make real plans for making prep available to those who can benefit from it as quickly and safely as possible if it is proven effective
750713 this report provides an important overview of prep research and lays out the many difficult issues that are critical for advocates communities and public health experts to understand as trials continue and report results
750714 we cannot shy away from discussing issues such as potential drug resistance the difficulty of adhering to a once a day pill regimen for people who are not sick or the cost of providing prep this report and todays meeting lay the groundwork for these important discussions
750715 meet at the picnic shelter across the road from the meigs point nature center
750716 statin and resveratrol in combination induces protection against myocardial infarction in hypercholesterolemic rat
750717 the levels of cholesterol triglycerides ldl c were found to be increased and hdl c level was found to be decreased in hc group when compared to control treatment with resveratrol significantly lowered the cholesterol triglycerides ldl c levels when compared to hc group the lipid lowering ability was more prominent in hcs and hcrs table 1 than in hcr group
750718 similarly aortic flow significantly increased hcr hcs and in hcrs groups when compared to hc group in spite of significant functional recovery in hcr and hcs groups the hcrs group was found to demonstrate more functional recovery when compared to individual treatment groups monotherapy therefore as expected resveratrol and statin showed significant recovery of postischemic myocardial function figure 1a 1e as compared to hc
750719 the values were significantly reduced in hcrs hcs and hcr treatment 37 3 6 43 3 3 and 44 4 2 as compared to the hc group 53 74 4 6 figure 2 to be more accurate combination group was found to be more effective 37 3 6 in reducing infarct when compared to statin 43 3 3 and resveratrol 44 4 2 group individually

750723 sirtris a glaxosmithkline company is developing small molecule drugs that target the sirtuins a recently discovered family of seven enzymes associated with the aging process modulation of these enzymes offers the promise of drug discovery in multiple therapeutic areas founded in 2004 sirtris was one of the first pharmaceutical companies focused on the sirtuin platform preclinical research indicates that the sirtuins play important roles in pathways for multiple diseases including type 2 diabetes various types of cancer and osteoporosis as well as neurodegenerative cardiovascular inflammatory and mitochondrial diseases
750724 in preclinical studies the nces lower glucose and improve insulin sensitivity in animal models of type 2 diabetes this occurs in key metabolic tissues including liver muscle and fat as observed in calorie restriction and with resveratrol the nces increase mitochondrial biogenesis and hold promise for treating diseases of aging such as type 2 diabetes

750728 scientists have found that the compound resveratrol slows age related deterioration and functional decline of mice on a standard diet but does not increase longevity when started at middle age
750729 a major finding of the study reported today is that resveratrol prevented age related and obesity related cardiovascular functional decline in the mice as determined by several parameters
750730 we found that while quality of life improved with resveratrol the compound did not significantly affect overall survival or maximum lifespan for mice on a standard diet compared to mice on the same diet without resveratrol

750735 that photo was taken such a long time ago but it was a good thing when this place first came to the area the boys really enjoyed themselves here
750736 we have had a business here for 30 years and it was a big event when the centre was founded
750737 there was nothing here before this is one of the original buildings in the area
750738 from a pops perspective it is great to have the grandchildren enrolled here we can get rid of them for a day
750739 but seriously it does them good it gets them talking to other kids and it teaches them discipline

750754 the mortgage market is going to be a great market in this country for a long time weve got population growth weve got people who are always going to want to live in homes that they own its going to be a great market
750755 but because this business is carefully underwritten and structured with very high attachment points to the multiples of expected losses we believe the probability that it will sustain an economic loss is close to zero
750756 well number one i think this firm has the capacity to take a lot more risk than it has in the past so from that aspect were really using our talent in a more productive way than we have had in the past i am comfortable with the risk i think we probably have one of the best overall risk managers in tom daula who oversees all firm risk and also zoe growing up on the sales and trading side mainly trading side risk management its a very strong combination so im comfortable with it do we take a lot of risk yes

750864 she loved the ballet musicals theatre and all things arty
750865 the scholarship is our way of creating a lasting memorial that will give benefit to a young up and coming talent in the hunter area and keep her alive in our hearts

750868 i want to thank dan for enabling me to see another side of garfield some of the strips he chose were slappers oh i could have left that out it would have been funnier
750869 when i looked at jon and laughed at his crazy antics i thought hes just like me as it turns out i wasnt the only one saw myself in him millions of visitors from all over the world visit garfield minus garfield and tell me they think the same thing now thanks to the awesome generosity and humor of jim davis garfield minus garfield is going to become a book and im absolutely honored to be part of it

750874 had forced the majority of the iraqi doctors to abandon their hospitals and clinics
750875 after the remarkable progress in the security situation the ministry e mailed the doctors who have fled the country in the past to ask them to return back to develop the health sector in the country
750876 we agree that the return of the fathers of medicine is important to this great country
750877 they represent a significant population of senior physicians and surgeons and their return is vital to iraqs success as a regional health care leader
750878 it was really tough to try to decide who was who and who should we hit
750879 i know at times we were ordered to strafe refugees in fact i pulled fighters off refugees at times
750880 that was a typical observation for a pilot and observer
750881 it was hell how could they not tell civilians from north korean troops
750882 they wouldnt have died like that if they had allowed the refugees to pass through their lines
750883 the u s military hardly took into consideration a risk that its massive bombing and incineration operations could take heavy tolls on civilians
750884 across a stream there were u s soldiers with a tank they blocked us
750885 my feelings were indescribable because not all of us could go
750886 and then the fire incinerated everything and spread into the cave
750887 his bowels spilled out his mother fell down and cried over his body in the shower of bullets
750888 the norm throughout europe though politically i think it would be difficult to have an explicit link with an eu directive especially one from which we are technically excluded
750889 the cat is out of the bag on id cards the government has constantly changed its mind over why id cards are being introduced and what they are for until now they have always said that they are being brought in for the good of the country
750890 this memo reveals the truth this whole exercise is subordinate to a european union diktat furthermore it is one which we do not even have to obey
750891 the beginning of a habit is like an invisible thread but every time we repeat the act we strengthen the strand add to it another filament until it becomes a great cable and binds us irrevocably thought and act
750892 give me a lever long enough and a prop strong enough i can single handedly move the world
750893 there is nothing training cannot do nothing is above its reach it can turn bad morals to good it can destroy bad principles and recreate good ones it can lift men to angelship
750894 we know too much and feel too little at least we feel too little of those creative emotions from which a good life springs
750895 its the most natural way to allow the ecosystem to perpetuate itself
750896 we dont put a blindfold on and look the other way
750897 but when such a fire does encounter one of those areas where theyve done prescribed burns itll change its intensity itll drop to the ground and allow firefighters to get a handle on it
750898 the old policy was to put the fire out as quickly as possible keep it to the smallest size the shortest duration
750899 thats not humanly possible any more in the midst of climate change invasive weeds urban sprawl and a lot of careless recreationists
750900 then they said 2070 and then they said 2050 and then they said 2030
750901 not only do i see the change but its like theyre moving the goalposts toward me and its an amazing thing
750902 we might see an ice free arctic ocean by the year 2030 within some of our lifetimes
750903 there are some scientists out there who think that even might be optimistic
750904 as near as we can tell looking at the historical record theres been ice in the arctic in the summer for at least 16 million years
750905 theres a group that makes a very strong case that in 2012 or 2013 well have an ice free summer arctic as soon as that its astounding whats happened
750906 as the ice recedes its opening up not only the arctic passage but all the resources in the arctic ocean
750907 we could think of the arctic as the refrigerator of the northern hemisphere climate system
750908 what were doing by getting rid of that sea ice is radically changing the nature of that refrigerator were making it much less efficient but everything is connected together so what happens up there eventually influences what happens in other parts of the globe
750909 the arctic really can feed back into the global climate system
750910 you know what happens when you get feedbacks you get surprises and we dont like surprises
750911 a race has developed between the waning sunlight and the weakened ice
750912 a combination of these two forces led to what we observe now and we should not ignore either forces
750913 there have been numerous models run that have looked at that and basically they cant reproduce the ice loss weve had with natural variability
750914 you have to add a carbon dioxide warming component to it
750915 we should care in the sense that what happens here is coming to us and sometimes you know a warning is a helpful thing to mobilise people
750916 are emerging significantly in the palm cement starch fuel switch geothermal hydro and biogas sectors
750917 asia is experiencing a period of rapid economic growth and governments across the region are striving to meet the ever rising energy demands of their populations and industries
750918 this need for more energy coupled with rising oil prices increased consumer awareness on environmental issues and the certain threat of climate change make an excellent case for sustainable energy and to ensure that asia leapfrogs onto a clean technology development path
750919 they have a long way to go before their full potential to immerse into carbon trading is realized

750926 daca vorbim punctual nici macar in turcia nu exista mall uri in mijlocul orasului caci galleries la fayette din paris sau el corte ingles din barcelona nu sunt mall uri dar la noi sunt si intentia unora este sa le intinda pana chiar in preajma ateneului sub privirile prostite ale unei majoritati ce isi pierde vremea cu privitul la televizor video un interviu in imagini

750933 for there is no perfect life just the one we cobble together for ourselves according to the dictates of where fortune may take us and if we are to have peace of mind we must gracefully acknowledge the truth of this

750937 the consumer is not a moron she is your wife
750938 our industry is a difficult one for the average consumer to understand mr herbert said we want to move our brand from being known to owned and that means new creative new products and a rethinking of the media plan
750939 it has been our policy to provide the media with convenient and sufficient access to the internet

750947 china and india with their rapid growth with dirty sources of energy principally coal and other hydrocarbons based sources is a problem
750948 i certainly see global warming as a threat and a threat to our well being in the future and yes in that sense a national security threat
750949 i think that we recognize that it has a strong human element but then the question becomes what do you do about it once youve said that
750950 you dont think the feds are looking for bob and phil
750951 the men who came to their apartment were not feds i cant believe that
750952 they pulled guns and told me theyd come back if i told the police does that sound like how our government behaves
750953 ive seen it before with railroad men ive known ive worked railroad security long enough with enough vets to spot it i thought i saw it before when i caught him in the rail yard and now you talking about the government seems to have set him off
750954 id say he did something hed just as soon forget that he cant some kind of post traumatic stress some can move on and live their lives some cant some exist in between almost like theyre haunted they push the memories back far enough but certain things set them off
750955 you said yourself does that sound like how our government behaves id say he knows how our government has behaved and he was a part of it his face turned white and he shuffled away like he was 90
750956 all have sinned and come short of the glory of god
750957 that all men are born to equal rights is clear every being has a right to his own as clear as moral as sacred as any other being has this is as indubitable as a moral government in the universe but to teach that all men are born with equal powers and faculties to equal influence in society to equal property and advantages through life is as gross a fraud as glaring an imposition on the credulity of the people as ever was practiced by monks by druids by brahmins by priests of the immortal lama or by the self styled philosophers of the french revolution for honors sake for truth and virtues sake let american philosophers and politicians despise it
750958 but what are we to understand here by equality are the citizens to be all of the same age sex size strength stature activity courage hardiness industry patience ingenuity wealth knowledge fame wit temperance constancy and wisdom was there or will there ever be a nation whose individuals were all equal in natural and acquired qualities in virtues talents and riches the answer of all mankind must be in the negative it must then be acknowledged that in every state there are inequalities which god and nature have planted there and which no human legislator ever can eradicate

750982 it wasnt until john mccains team started pushing it that it ended up being on the front page of the new york times two days in a row
750983 were glad the obama campaign retracted barack obamas accusation because it was absolutely false and were moving on

750986 the clintons have made a 100 million fortune since leaving the white house but a politico analysis found that hasnt kept bill clinton from taking full advantage of the publicly funded perks offered to ex presidents in fact his presidential retirement benefits cost taxpayers almost as much as those of the other two living ex presidents combined the price tag for clintons federal retirement allowance from 2001 through the end of this year will run 8 million compared to 5 5 million for george h w bushs and 4 million for jimmy carters during the same period since 2001 clinton has received more of almost every benefit available to former presidents from his pension to his staffs salaries and benefits to supplies his 420 000 phone bill and 3 2 million office rent tab both nearly surpassed the totals rung up for those purposes by bush carter and the late former presidents gerald ford and ronald reagan combined as a group they spent 484 000 on telephone service and 3 8 million on rent in the same span

751017 saat itu saya hendak pergi ke kamar mandi namun mendengar suara di luar rumah seperti benda terbakar setelah saya keluar ternyata asap dan percikan api menyala diatas rumah milik tajri dan sukri
751018 kami memang tidak menghubungi petugas damkar mengingat lokasi kebakaran berada di tengah pemukiman penduduk dimana sangat sulit di jangkau oleh kendaraan damkar
751019 korban tidak sempat menyelamatkan harta bendanya termasuk sejumlah material seperti kusen dan lainnya milik tajri yang berencana akan merenovasi rumahnya saat ini dua keluarga terebut mengungsui kerumah saudara lain yuang masuh tinggal di sekitar kalijurang
751020 sementara kebakaran di duga terjadi akibat hubungan arus pendek listrik sebab saat pertama kali saksi melihat api menyala dari bagian atap rumah yang merupakan sekat antara rumah milik tajri dengan sukri nilai kerugian di perkirakan mencapai rp 45 juta
751021 motifnya memang keinginan seketika untuk menguasai barang barang milik korban tapi ryan tak selalu lancar mewujudkan keinginan seketika itu
751022 ada tiga korban yang sempat berantem dengan ryan yaitu vincentius yudi priono wonogiri jateng guruh setio pramono nganjuk jatim dan seseorang yang disebutnya graddy marga tambunan manado
751023 ada yang bertemu di surabaya ada yang di jombang hanya satu yang tak dikenal yakni satu korban yang ryan sendiri tidak hafal namanya yakni korban yang diduga dibunuh pertama kali pada 2006
751024 mereka umumnya mudah dirayu ryan karena ada rasa cinta termasuk ada juga korban wanita yang mencintainya
751025 kalau tanda tanda psikotis gangguan jiwa yang berat tak ada tapi kalau psikopat minimnya empati dan kontrol perilaku memang ya karena perilakunya impulsif
751026 artinya tersangka membunuh dengan sadar dan paham akibatnya dia tahu mana yang benar dan mana yang salah
751027 saat diperiksa penyidik tersangka juga mempunyai keinginan kelihatan nggak normal agar terbebas dari jerat hukum itu biasa karena itu kami melakukan pemeriksaan kejiwaan dan ternyata tak ada gangguan kejiwaan yang berat
751028 dalam hubungan homoseksualitas itu tersangka lebih menyukai peran sebagai perempuan tapi kelainan seksual itu nggak ada kaitan dengan kejiwaan karena mereka yang bukan homo juga dapat mengalami gejala kejiwaan
751029 hasilnya orangtua ryan juga normal dari sisi kejiwaan tapi ibunya mempunyai sifat yang mirip dengan ryan yakni sensitif mudah tersinggung dan mudah marah bahkan di dalam rumah tangga ada dominasi ibu
751030 ryan merasa kurang mendapat perhatian ada ketidakcocokkan dengan kondisi ekonomi keluarga dan juga ada ketidakcocokkan dengan perilaku ibu ryan sering cekcok dengan orangtuanya sehingga dia menjadi impulsif dan ada rasa tak suka dengan perilaku ibu
751031 sejak kecil ryan sering mengalami kekerasan dari ibunya sehingga usia sekitar 13 tahun mengalami tekanan kejiwaan akibat memendam benci kepada ibunya
751032 the united states word should not be so carelessly broken nor its standing in the international community so needlessly compromised
751033 there is no dispute that if texas executes mr medellin in these circumstances texas would cause the united states irreparably to breach treaty commitments made on behalf of the united states as a whole and thereby compromise u s interests that both this court and the president have described as compelling
751034 im where im at because i made an adolescent choice
751035 this is not about vengeance this is not about a deterrent or about closure its about the punishment
751036 everybody wants me to say closure or vengeance im never going to have closure its just a miracle word thats going to make us feel good but it aint going to happen
751037 the law is clear texas is bound not by the world court but by the u s supreme court which reviewed this matter and determined that this convicted murderers execution shall proceed
751038 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
751039 and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
751040 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it
751041 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
751042 i rushed to the spot in search of my three children who had gone to pay obeisance at the hilltop shrine
751043 i fail to understand why god was so cruel to us
751044 we tell the enemies of god that god has saved those who will be even more painful for you
751045 as abu khabab has gone he left behind with gods grace a generation of faithful students who will make you suffer the worst torture and avenge him and his brothers
751046 a big name does not mean a big impact on the ground
751047 the bottom line is that those people are replaceable the organization has developed in such a way that it can survive and fill in any gap even if osama bin laden was to die

751053 our bitter national experience can yet help us in a possible repeat of unstable social conditions it will warn us and ward us from destructive break downs
751054 we have to think what we can do after using it the current budget up
751055 the impact of the rising fuel prices on the local economy is extremely serious

751127 ya tuhan kami sesungguhnya aku telah menempatkan sebagian keturunanku di lembah yang tidak mempunyai tanam tanaman di dekat rumah engkau baitullah yang dihormati ya tuhan kami yang demikian itu agar mereka mendirikan sholat maka jadikanlah hati sebagian manusia cenderung kepada mereka dan beri rizkilah mereka dari buah buahan mudah mudahan mereka bersyukur

751155 aku sama sekali tidak meragukan bahwa muhyiddin ibnu arabi adalah seorang pembohong besar ia adalah pemuka kalangan ahli bidah dan seorang sufi yang tidak tahu malu
751156 betapa bodohnya mereka yang menentang syekh muhyiddin ibnu arabi pernyataannya yang sublim dan tulisannya yang bernilai itu terlalu tinggi bagi pemahaman mereka
751157 ia menjawab menurut anda siapa teruslah makan aku menyadari bahwa ia tahu aku berhenti makan dan menekannya untuk menjawab pertanyaanku dengan menyebut nama allah ia tersenyum dan berkata syekh muhyiddin ibnu arabi untuk sesaat aku terkejut sehingga tidak bisa berkata kata syekh itu bertanya kepadaku tentang keadaanku saat itu kujawab aku heran sebab pada pagi ini seseorang mengatakan bahwa ia adalah ahli bidah pada saat itu anda justru tidak menyanggahnya sekarang anda menyebut muhyiddin sebagai wali al quthb di zaman ini manusia teragung yang pernah hidup guru dunia

751165 ketahuilah bahwa wujud ini satu namun dia memiliki penampakan yang disebut dengan alam dan ketersembunyiannya yang dikenal dengan asma nama nama dan memiliki pemisah yang disebut dengan barzakh yang menghimpun dan memisahkan antara batin dan lahir itulah yang dikenal dengan insan kamil
751166 ketahuilah bahwa tuhan segala tuhan adalah allah swt sebagai nama yang teragung dan sebagai taayun pernyataan yang pertama ia merupakan sumber segala nama dan tujuan terakhir dari segala tujuan dan arah dari segala keinginan serta mencakup segala tuntutan kepadanya lah isyarat yang difirmankan allah kepada rasulnya saw bahwa kepada tuhanmulah tujuan terakhir karena muhammad adalah mazhar dari pernyataan pertama taayyun awwal dan tuhan yang khusus baginya adalah ketuhanan yang teragung ini ketahuilah bahwa segala nama dari nama nama allah merupakan gambaran dalam ilmu allah yang bernama dengan mahiat atau ain sabitah esensi yang tetap setiap nama juga memiliki gambaran di luar yang diberi nama dengan mazahir penampakan atau fenomena dan segala nama tadi merupakan pengatur dari mazahir fenomena fenomena ini sedang haqiqat muhammadiyah merupakan gambaran dari nama allah yang menghimpun segala nama ketuhanan yang darinya muncul limpahan atas segala yang ada dan allah swt sebagai tuhannya haqiqat muhammadiyah yang mengatur gambaran alam seluruhnya dengan tuhan yang tampil padanya disebut dengan rab al arbab allah swt
751167 ketahuilah bahwa yang ada hanya allah beserta sifatnya afalnya maka semuanya adalah dia dengannya darinya dan kepadanya kalaulah ia terhijab dari alam ini walaupun sekejap maka binasalah alam ini secara keselurhan kekalnya alam ini dengan penjagaannya dan penglihatannya kepada alam akan tetapi jika sesuatu sangat tampak jelas dengan cahayanya hingga pemahaman tidak mampu untuk mengetahuinya maka penampakan itulah yang disebut dengan hijab
751168 alam pada hakikatnya adalah satu namun yang hilang dan muncul adalah gambarnya saja
751169 maha suci allah yang menciptakan segala sesuatu dialah segala sesuatu tadi
751170 wujud alam ini tidak benar benar sendiri melainkan terjadi melalui pancaran yang dimaksud dengan memancar di sini adalah bagaikan memancarnya pengetahuan dari allah taala seperti halnya alam ini bukan benar benar zat allah karena ia merupakan wujud yang baru alam juga tidak benar benar lain darinya karena ia bukan wujud kedua yang berdiri sendiri disamping allah
751171 hanya satu wujud dan seluruh eksistensi tiada lain adalah pancaran dari wujud yang satu
751172 allah nyata ditinjau dari penampakannya pada cipatannya dan batin dari segi zatnya
751173 dalam hal ini ada sebagian golongan sufi yang terpeleset jatuh dalam kekhilafan dari yang sebenarnya mereka berkata tidak ada kecuali apa yang engkau lihat bahwa alam adalah allah dan allah adalah alam tiada lain sebabnya kesaksian ini terjadi karena mereka belim benar benar mencapai apa yang dicapai oleh muhaqiqun kalau mereka mencapai apa yang dicapai oleh muhaqiqin maka meraka tidak akan berkata demikian dan menetapkan segala hakikat pada tempatnya dan mengetahuinya dengan ilmu dan penyingkapan
751174 ittihad adalah mustahil karena dua zat menjadi satu tidak akan mungkin bertemu antara hamba dan tuhan pada satu wajah selamanya ditinjau dari zatnya
751175 tiada sesuatupun yang setara dengannya maka hilanglah bayangan sementara bayangan terbentang maka hendaklah engkau memperhatikan lebih teliti
751176 segala sesuatu memiliki bayangan dan bayangan allah adalah arasy akan tetapi bukanlah setiap bayangan terbentang arasy bagi tuhan adalah bayangan yang tidak terbentang apakah engkau tidak memperhatikan bahwa jisim yang memiliki bayangan apabila diliputi oleh cahaya maka bayangannya ada padanya
751177 sesungguhnya engkau tidak pernah ada sama sekali dan bukan pula engkau ada dengan dirimu atau ada di dalamnya atau bersamanya dan bukan pula engkau binasa ataupun ada
751178 aku mengenal allah dengan menghimpun segala dua hal yang bertentangan
751179 dialah yang awal tanpa berawal yang akhir tanpa berakhir yang lahir tanpa jelas yang batin tanpa tersembunyi
751180 ketahuilah bahwa hadirat khayal merupakan hadirat yang menghimpun dan mencakup segal seuatu dan yang bukan sesuatu
751181 tidak ada dalam wujud ini selain allah kita walupun ada maujudun maka sesungguhnya keberadaan kita dengannya barang siap yang keberadaannya dengan selain allah maka ia masuk dalam hukum ketiadaan
751182 tauhid adalah penyaksian danbukan pengetahuan barang siapa menyaksikan maka ia telah bertauhid barang siapa hanya mengetahui ia belum bertauhid
751183 uluhiyyat ketuhanan dapat dikatakan karena ia merupakan tawajjuh kehendak zat untuk mewujudkan semua hal yang mungkin adapun zat tidaklah dapat dikatakan namaun disaksikan
751184 katakanlah jika lautan huyuli asal keberadaan alam semesta yang menerima berbagi macam gambar yang mewuudkan segala ilmu allah dijadikan sebagai tinta untuk menuliskan segala makna dan hakikat dan roh yang ada pada zatnya maka air lautan akan habis sebelum habisnya kalimat allah karena ia tidak terhingga adanya tidak mungkin satu yang terbatas bisa mengibaratkan yang tidak terbatas
751185 ya tuhan kami kami tidak mampu menghumpun pujian kepadamua sebagaimana engakau memuji dirimu sendiri
751186 yang haq adalah lautan dasarnya adalah azali pantainya adalah abadi
751187 pensucian dari orang yang mensucikan merupakan pembatasan bagi yang disucikan karena ia telah mengistimewakan allah dan memisahkannya dari sesuatu yang menyerupai jadi pensuciannya dari suatu sifat yang wajib merupakan keterikatan dan keterbatasan maka tidak ada di sana kecualai yang terikat dan maha tinggi dengan kemutlakannya dan ketidak terbatasannya
751188 yang mensucikan mengosongkan tuhan dari segala sifat sehingga dia menghilangkan kuasa tuhan yang menyerupakan tuhan menghiasainya dengan sifat yang tak pantas aritnya memakaikan tuhan dengan sifat selainnya mujassimah sedang yang berada di antara keduanya tidak mengosongkan dan tidak memakaikan artinya seorang yang arif yang beada antara tasybih dan tanzih tidak menanggalkan apa yang pantas bagi allah dan menyifatinya dengan pakaian atau sifat yang tidak pantas baginya bahkan ia berkata allah adalah yang lahir dan yang batin atau ia menyifati allah dengan lahir dan batin aspek batin merupakan hukum kesempurnaan baginya sedang aspek lahir merupakan nyatanya ia dalam segala yang ada
751189 istiwa itu diketahui artinya kaifiyyahnya tidak diketahui beriman dengannya wajib bertanya mengenainya bidah
751190 sungguh wajah hanyalah saturda namun jika engkau perbanyak cermin ia menjadi terbilang
751191 ketahuilah bahwa allah menuntut dari hambanya untuk mengenalnya sebagaimana yang telah diterangkan oleh lisan segala syariat dalam menyifatinya maka akal tidaklah boleh melampauinya sebelum datangnya syariat ilmu mengenainya pensucian dari sifat sifat baharu jadi seorang arif adalah orang yang memiliki dua pengenalan tentang allah pengenalan sebelum datangnya syariat dan pengenalan yang ia peroleh dari syara akan tetapi syaratnya hendaklah ia menyerahkan ilmu tersebut kepada allah jika allah menyingkapkan baginya tentang ilmu itu maka hal itu merupakan anugrah dari pintu pemberian zat allah
751192 tidak ada yang setara dengannya dan dia maha mendengar dan maha melihat
751193 hai vinto il nostro premio orario fai click su ok per riscuoterlo prima che scada il tempo

751195 sebagaimana kalian mempercayai mursyid dia juga harus mempercayai kalian agar kalian dapat menjaga apa yang telah diamanahkan
751196 yang lebih penting daripada ilmu ialah pemindahan ilmu tersebut dari hati ke hati
751197 kita tidak minta untuk dikenali dan menjadi sesuatu karena selagi kita menginginkannya maka kita masih belum lagi sempurna
751198 tujuan kita adalah untuk melindungi serta melukiskan nabi muhammad sall allahu alayhi wa aalihi wasallam dan sifat sifat beliau yang luhur dan agung baginya sholawat dan salam serta bagi ahli bait dan sahabat sahabat beliau yang untuk ini allah mendukung kita
751199 murid yang sesungguhnya dalam tariqah naqshbandi haqqani adalah sahabat penolong dan pendukung dari setiap pembela sayyidina muhammad sall allahu alayhi wasallam dan adalah tugas kita untuk bersahabat dan berasosiasi dengan para pembela seperti itu karena mereka berada pada jalan mawlana tak peduli apakah mereka adalah naqshbandi atau bukan
751200 sudah menjadi suatu aturan yang disepakati di antara rijal allah para kekasih allah bahwa keragaman jalan ini adalah
751201 mereka akan berada di mimbar mimbar cahaya di hari kebangkitan
751202 karena itu kita para murid dari jalan jalan tariqah mestilah pula saling mengetahui mengenal dan mencintai satu sama lain demi keridhaan allah dan nabi nya serta para kekasih nya agar diri kita mampu memasuki cahaya penuh barakah tersebut dan masuk dalam lingkaran tertinggi dari suhba persahabatan dan jamaah jauh dari furqa perpecahan dan keangkuhan
751203 kita telah diperintahkan untuk mencintai orang orang suci mereka adalah para nabi dan setelah para nabi adalah para pewaris mereka awliya kita telah diperintahkan untuk beriman pada para nabi dan iman memberikan pada diri kita cinta
751204 cinta membuat manusia untuk mengikuti ia yang dicintai ittiba bermakna untuk mencintai dan mengikuti sementara itaat bermakna hanya untuk mengikuti seseorang yang taat mungkin taat karena paksaan atau karena cinta tapi tidaklah selalu karena cinta
751205 allah taala menginginkan hamba hamba nya untuk mencintai nya dan para hamba tidaklah mampu menggapai secara langsung cinta atas tuhan mereka karena itulah allah taala mengutus sebagai utusan dari diri nya para nabi yang mewakili nya di antara para hamba nya dan setiap orang yang mencintai awliya dan anbiya melalui awliya mereka akan menggapai cinta para nabi dan melalui cinta para nabi kalian akan menggapai cinta allah taala
751206 karena itu tanpa cinta seseorang tak mungkin dapat menjadi orang yang dicintai dalam hadirat ilahi jika kalian tak memberikan cinta kalian bagaimana allah taala akan mencintai kalian
751207 namun manusia kini sudah seperti kayu kering mereka menyangkal cinta mereka adalah orang orang yang kering tak ada kehidupan suatu pohon dengan cinta bersemi dan berbunga di kala musim semi
751208 tetapi kayu yang telah kering bahkan seandainya tujuh puluh kali musim semi mendatanginya mereka tak akan pernah berbunga cinta membuat alam ini terbuka dan memberikan buah buahannya memberikan keindahannya bagi manusia tanpa cinta ia tak akan pernah terbuka tak akan pernah berbunga tak akan pernah memberikan buahnya
751209 jadi cinta adalah pilar utama paling penting dari iman tanpa cinta tak akan ada iman saya dapat berbicara tentang hal ini hingga tahun depan tapi kalian harus mengerti dari setetes sebuah samudera
751210 berjanjilah wahai manusia untuk menghentikan semua kebiasan buruk dan selanjutnya menjauhi perbuatan dosa gunakan waktumu siang dan malam di masjid beribadalah kepada tuhan dengan semangat dan memohonlah ampunan dengan meratap kepadanya
751211 kapankah allah swt tidak senang kepada hambanya yaitu ketika seorang hamba merasa terganggu dengan lamanya berdzikir secara kolektif jika cintanya pada allah swt adalah cinta sejati maka itu akan terasa seperti sekejap mata
751212 depresi dalam hati berasal dari tiga macam penyakit yaitu kehilangan keharmonisan dengan alam mengikuti kebiasaan yang menyimpang dari sunah rasulullah saw dan mengikuti orang orang yang korup dan fasik
751213 para pencari dan murid tidak menginginkan apapun bagi diri mereka kecuali yang allah swt telah tetapkan baginya dan tidak membutuhkan apapun dari alam semesta ini kecuali tuhannya
751214 ketika hati sangat mendambakan untuk menyaksikan zat allah azza wa jalla maka allah swt akan mengirimkan sifat sifatnya sehingga mereka akan menjadi tenang tentram dan merasa sangat bahagia
751215 islam berarti menyerahkan hatimu kepada tuhanmu dan tidak menyakiti orang lain baik dengan perkataaan maupun perbuatan
751216 allah tidak akan pernah mengangkat seseorang yang yang mencintai uang
751217 barangsiapa mendatangi allah swt dengan hatinya maka allah swt akan mengirimkan hati seluruh hambanya kepadanya
751218 jika para pecinta mengungkapkan cinta mereka kepadanya maka dari deskripsinya itu setiap pecinta akan meninggal
751219 dia yang bertindak menurut perintahku akan berdiri di surga lebih tinggi daripada semua awliya yang telah mendahuluiku
751220 melalui pemahaman akal saja manusia tidak mungkin bisa memanen buah dari rahasia rahasia allah tubuh manusia tidak dapat mencangkup realitas makna mengenai allah swt tubuh manusia mustahil mencapai kerajaan yang tersembunyi dari yang maha unik
751221 beliau tidak pernah menyebutkan sesuatu yang telah berlalu beliau tidak pernah menerima suatu gunjingan dan akan mengusir pelakunya dari asosiasi setiap orang yang duduk dalam asosiasinya mereka akan merasakan bahwa kecintaan akan dunia akan lenyap dari hati mereka beliau mengatakan jangan duduk tanpa berdzikir karena kematian selalu mengikutimu
751222 setiap pencari yang tidak membiasakan diri dan melatih dirinya untuk berpuasa disiang hari dan bangun dimalam hari untuk beribadah dan melayani saudaranya tidak akan memperoleh kebaikan dalam tareqat ini
751223 setiap orang mempunyai karakter baik yang bercampur dengan karakter buruk ketika kamu melakukan bayat seluruh perbuatan buruk yang telah engkau lakukan sebelumnya aku ganti dengan perbuatan baik kecuali dua hal yaitu keinginan seksual dan kemarahan
751224 ya allah jangan tinggalkan aku kepada egoku walau hanya sekejap
751225 allah swt telah menyediakan rezeki bagi hamba hamba nya siapapun yang tidak mengetahui hikmah mengenai rezeki hariannya yang allah berikan kepadanya dia akan dianggap lalai dalam thariqat naqshbandi kita
751226 orang yang dapat mencapai realitas thariqat ini sangat jarang dengan kekuatan realitas itu orang dapat meraih semua wali di dunia ini dan dengan kekuatan ilahi yang dianugerahkan ketika kalian mencapai realitas dari thariqat ini kalian dapat meraih semua malaikat satu demi satu
751227 cahaya spiritual yang allah swt berikan kepadamu di jalan ini adalah penunjuk jalan yang menerangi jalan menuju kehadirat ilahi tanpa rasa takut
751228 dalam thariqat ini memuliakan sesuatu selain allah swt adalah kafir
751229 sufi adalah orang yang telah meninggalkan dunianya hari akhiratnya dan kehadirat ilahi di belakang dan mereka yang hidup menyatu dengan nya
751230 aku tidak ingin dikenal di dunia ini setelah aku meninggalkannya karena aku tidak mengharapkan diriku mempunyai suatu eksistensi
751231 kesombongan tidak pernah memasuki hati seseorang tanpa mengakibatkan penurunan derajat pikirannya setara dengan meningkatnya jumlah kesombongan dalam hatinya
751232 kesulitan mungkin akan menyentuh orang orang yang beriman tetapi kesulitan itu tidak akan mempengaruhi orang yang berdzikir
751233 sudah tentu engkau akan mendengar kami bahkan binatang buas di hutan pun mendengarkan kami ketika kami pergi ke sana untuk berdzikir kuda kuda ini pun mendengarkan kami dan tidak akan bergerak kecuali atas perintah kami
751234 setiap orang yang berjuang di jalan allah akan disediakan rezeki baginya
751235 setiap kali zakariyya masuk untuk menemui maryam di mihrab dia mendapati makanan di sisinya
751236 tolonglah aku jika aku benar dan koreksilah aku jika aku salah orang orang yang lemah di antara kalian harus menjadi kuat bersamaku sampai atas kehendak allah haknya telah disyahkan orang orang yang kuat di antara kalian harus menjadi lemah bersamaku sampai jika allah menghendaki aku akan mengambil apa yang harus dibayarnya
751237 patuhilah aku selama aku patuh kepada allah dan rasulullah bila aku tidak mematuhi allah dan rasulullah jangan patuhi aku lagi
751238 tidak ada pembicaraan yang baik jika tidak diarahkan untuk memperoleh ridha allah swt
751239 tidak ada manfaat dari uang jika tidak dibelanjakan di jalan allah tidak ada kebaikan dalam diri seseorang jika kebodohannya mengalahkan kesabarannya dan jika seseorang tertarik dengan pesona dunianya yang rendah allah tidak akan ridha kepadanya selama dia masih menyimpan hal itu dalam hatinya
751240 kita menemukan kedermawanan dalam taqwa kesadaran akan allah kekayaan dalam yaqin kepastian dan kemuliaan dalam kerendahan hati
751241 waspadalah terhadap kebanggan sebab kalian akan kembali ke tanah dan tubuhmu akan dimakan oleh cacing
751242 ketika beliau dipuji oleh orang orang beliau akan berdoa kepada allah dan berkata
751243 jika kalian mengharapkan berkah allah berbuatlah baik terhadap hamba hamba nya
751244 suatu hari beliau memanggil umar ra dan menasihatinya sampai umar menangis
751245 mahasuci allah yang tidak memberi hamba hamba nya jalan untuk mendapat pengetahuan mengenai nya kecuali dengan jalan ketidak berdayaan mereka dan tidak ada harapan untuk meraih pencapaian itu
751246 dalam keadaan depresi engkau harus banyak beristighfar memohon ampunan allah dan dalam keadaan bergembira harus banyak bersyukur kepada allah swt
751247 sebagai pertimbangan kedua keadaan ini kontraksi menciut dan ekspansi mengembang adalah arti dari wuquf zamani
751248 aku diberi kekuatan oleh syaikhku syah naqsyband sedemikian rupa sehingga bila aku ingin memfokuskan setiap orang di alam semesta ini aku akan mengangkat mereka semua ke tingkat ihsan
751249 niat dalam berkhalwat adalah untuk meninggalkan segala hubungan duniawi dan mengarahkan diri kepada kebenaran surgawi
751250 dikatakan bahwa para pencari dalam pengetahuan eksternal harus memegang teguh tali allah sedangkan para pencari pengetahuan internal harus terikat kuat kepada allah
751251 ketika allah membuatmu lupa akan kekuatan duniawi maupun kerajaan surgawi itu adalah kefanaan yang mutlak dan jika dia membuatmu lupa akan kefanaan yang mutlak itu itu adalah inti dari kefanaan yang mutlak
751252 kalian harus berada pada tingkat yang sesuai dengan orang orang disekitarmu dan menyembunyikan keadaanmu yang sebenarnya dari mereka karena rasulullah bersabda aku telah diperintahkan untuk berbicara kepada orang orang sesuai dengan apa yang bisa dimengerti oleh hati mereka
751253 jika kalian berpikir bahwa kalian telah berperilaku baik berarti engkau salah karena memandang dirimu baik adalah suatu kesombongan
751254 manfaat yang dapat dipetik dari ziarah ke makam syaikh kalian tergantung dari pengetahuanmu tentang mereka
751255 berada di dekat makam orang orang yang shaleh mempunyai pengaruh yang baik terhadap dirimu walaupun lebih baik untuk mengarahkan dirimu kepada jiwa mereka dan hal itu bisa membawa pengaruh spiritual yang tinggi
751256 rasulullah saw bersabda kirimkanlah doa kepadaku di mana pun engkau berada ini menunjukkan bahwa kalian dapat mencapai rasulullah saw di mana pun kalian berada dan itu juga berlaku untuk semua walinya karena mereka mendapat kekuatan dari rasulullah saw
751257 adab atau perilaku yang benar dalam berziarah adalah dengan mengarahkan dirimu kepada allah dan membuat jiwa jiwa ini sebagai jalanmu wasilah menuju allah merendahkan hatimu kepada ciptaan nya
751258 kalian merendahkan hati secara eksternal kepada mereka dan secara internal kepada allah menunduk di hadapan orang lain tidak diizinkan kecuali kalian memandang mereka sebagai perwujudan tuhan dengan demikian kerendahan hati itu tidak diarahkan kepada mereka tetapi diarahkan kepada tuhan yang tampak dalam diri mereka dan itulah tuhan
751259 jalan untuk berkontemplasi merenung dan meditasi lebih tinggi dan lebih sempurna daripada berdzikir dengan kalimat la ilaha illallah para pencari melalui kontemplasi dan meditasi muraqabat dapat meraih pengetahuan internal dan mampu memasuki kerajaan surgawi dia akan diberi kekuasaan untuk melihat makhluk allah dan mengetahui apa yang terlintas dalam benak mereka bahkan gosip atau bisikan terkecil dalam hatinya pun dapat diketahuinya dia akan diberi kekuasaan untuk mencerahkan hati mereka dengan cahaya inti dari inti tingkat ke esaan
751260 diam adalah keadaan terbaik kecuali dalam tiga kondisi kalian tidak boleh berdiam diri dalam menghadapi gosip buruk yang menyerang hatimu kalian tidak boleh berdiam diri dalam mengarahkan dirimu untuk mengingat allah dan kalian tidak boleh berdiam diri ketika pandangan spiritual dalam hatimu memerintahkan untuk bicara
751261 melindungi hatimu dari pikiran jahat sangatlah sulit dan aku melindungi hatiku selama 20 tahun dengan tidak membiarkan ada satu godaan pun yang memasukinya
751262 amalan terbaik dalam thariqat ini adalah menghukum godaan dan gosip di dalam hati
751263 aku tidak senang terhadap beberapa murid karena mereka tidak berusaha untuk menjaga keadaan pandangan spiritual yang muncul kepada mereka
751264 jika hati para pengikut murid dipenuhi dengan cinta terhadap syaikh maka cinta ini mengalahkan semua cinta dalam hatinya sehingga hati itu dapat menerima transmisi pengetahuan ilahi yang tidak berawal dan tidak berakhir
751265 murid harus menceritakan semua keadaannya kepada syaikhnya dan dia harus merasa yakin bahwa dia tidak akan mencapai tujuannya kecuali melalui kepuasan dan cinta syaikhnya
751266 dia harus mencari kepuasan itu dan dia harus tahu bahwa semua pintu telah terkunci internal dan eksternal kecuali satu pintu yaitu syaikhnya dia harus mengorbankan dirinya demi syaikhnya
751267 walaupun dia telah mempunyai pengetahuan tertinggi dan mujahada kapasitas untuk berusaha yang paling tinggi dia harus meninggalkan semuanya dan sadar bahwa dia tidak ada artinya di hadapan syaikhnya
751268 para pencari harus memberikan otoritas penuh kepada syaikh dalam segala urusannya baik religius maupun duniawi sedemikian sehingga dia tidak mempunyai keinginan selain keinginan syaikhnya
751269 tugas syaikh adalah melihat aktivitas murid sehari hari memberi nasihat dan memperbaiki dirinya dalam kehidupan dan agamanya serta menolong mereka untuk menemukan jalan terbaik untuk mencapai realitasnya
751270 mengunjungi awliya adalah suatu sunnah wajiba yaitu suatu kewajiban setiap pencari paling tidak setiap hari atau setiap hari lainnya dan senantiasa menjaga batas dan kehormatan antara dirimu dengan syaikh
751271 jika jarak antara kalian dengan syaikh cukup jauh kunjungilah beliau paling tidak sekali sebulan atau dua bulan sekali agar hubungan kalian tidak terputus janganlah kalian puas hanya tergantung pada koneksi antara hatimu dengan hati mereka
751272 aku memberi jaminan kepada setiap pencari dalam thariqat ini jika dia meniru syaikh dengan hati yang tulus pada akhirnya dia akan menemukan realitasnya
751273 syah naqsyband memerintahkan aku untuk meniru beliau dan apa pun yang aku lakukan untuk meniru beliau sehingga dengan segera aku dapat memetik hasilnya
751274 namun demikian beliau juga memperingatkan para guru dalam thariqat kita tidak dapat dikenali kecuali dalam maqam yang penuh warna dan perubahan maqam at talwin siapa pun yang meniru tingkah laku mereka dalam maqam itu dia akan berhasil namun demikian barang siapa yang meniru tingkah laku mereka dalam maqam ihsan maqam yang penuh kesempurnaan dia akan tersesat dan dia hanya akan selamat dari penyimpangan itu jika gurunya memberi rahmat dan mengungkapkan realitas dari maqam itu kepadanya
751275 maqam yang penuh warna dan perubahan adalah tempat di mana para pencari berjuang keras dengan puasa ibadah khalwat dan dengan mempertahankan cinta dan penghormatannya kepada gurunya dari satu kesulitan kepada kesulitan yang lain
751276 meniru gurunya dalam tahap ini akan mendatangkan keberhasilan karena gurunya sangat ahli dalam semua urusan ini namun jika dia meniru gurunya ketika sedang berada dalam maqam kesempurnaan dia akan berada dalam bahaya seperti halnya ketika dia ingin terbang tanpa mengembangkan sayapnya lebih dahulu
751277 penting sekali bagi para pencari untuk mendaki gunung sebelum dia menikmati pemandangan di puncak untuk mendaki gunung para pencari harus melakukan perjalanan dari dunia yang rendah menuju kehadirat ilahi dia harus menempuh perjalanan dari dunia ego yang penuh realitas sensual menuju kesadaran jiwa akan realitas ilahi
751278 untuk membuat kemajuan dalam perjalanan ini para pencari harus membawa gambaran mengenai syaikhnya tasawwur ke dalam hatinya karena itu merupakan jalan terkuat untuk melepaskan seseorang dari genggaman rasa
751279 dalam hatinya syaikh menjelma menjadi cerminan dari inti yang mutlak
751280 tingkat paling tinggi dari maqam ini disebut maqam pemusnahan fana
751281 ketika aku mengalami keadaan tanpa kesadaran tinggalkanlah aku sendiri dan serahkan dirimu pada keadaan itu dan terimalah haknya atas diri kita
751282 mengenai perjalanan ini syaikh alauddin berkata kepada muridnya jalur terpendek menuju sasaran kita yaitu allah adalah saat allah menghilangkan sekat dari inti wujud ke esaan nya yang tampak pada semua makhluk ciptaan nya
751283 dia melakukan hal ini dengan maqam penghapusan ghayba dan peleburan dalam ke esaan nya yang mutlak fana sampai inti kemegahan nya mulai tampak dan menghilangkan kesadaran akan segala hal selain dia ini adalah akhir dari perjalanan mencari allah dan awal dari perjalanan yang lain
751284 pada akhir perjalanan pencarian dan keadaan yang penuh daya tarik muncullah keadaan tanpa kesadaran dan pemusnahan
751285 aku tidak menciptakan jinn dan manusia kecuali untuk beribadah kepada ku
751286 para pencari harus selalu berusaha untuk mematuhi perintah allah dan dia harus selalu berada dalam keadaan suci pertama dia harus mempunyai hati yang bersih sehingga tidak akan berpaling kepada apa pun kecuali allah selanjutnya dia harus menjaga agar bagian dalam tubuhnya tetap suci dan tidak diperlihatkan kepada orang lain yaitu dengan cara melihat dengan pandangan yang benar
751287 kesucian dada sadr terdiri atas harapan dan kepuasan terhadap kehendak ilahi kemudian kesucian jiwa yang terdiri atas kesederhanaan dan penghormatan yang tinggi kemudian kesucian perut dengan hanya memakan makanan yang halal dan pantangan diikuti dengan kesucian badan yaitu dengan meninggalkan keinginan diikuti dengan kesucian tangan yang terdiri atas keshalehan dan ikhtiar kemudian kesucian dari dosa yaitu dengan menyesali kesalahan yang telah dilakukan selanjutnya kesucian lidah yang terdiri atas dzikir dan istighfar kemudian dia harus mensucikan dirinya dari kelalaian dan kealfaan dengan mengembangkan ketakutan terhadap akhirat
751288 kita harus selalu beristighfar berhati hati dalam segala urusan mengikuti langkah orang orang yang shaleh mengikuti ajaran internalnya dan menjaga hati dari segala godaan
751289 jadilah orang yang terbimbing dengan ajaran syaikhmu sebab ajaran itu dapat menyembuhkanmu secara langsung dan lebih efektif daripada membaca buku
751290 kalian harus menjaga asosiasi dengan seorang wali dalam asosiasi itu kalian harus menjaga hatimu dari gosip dan tidak boleh berbicara di tengah kehadirannya dengan suara yang keras kalian juga tidak perlu menyibukkan diri dengan shalat dan ibadah sunnah ketika sedang bersamanya
751291 jagalah kebersamaanya dalam segala hal jangan berbicara ketika mereka sedang berbicara dengarkan apa yang mereka katakan jangan melihat apa yang mereka miliki di rumah terutama di kamar dan dapurnya
751292 jangan berpaling kepada syaikh yang lain tetapi yakinlah bahwa syaikhmu akan membuatmu tiba di tujuanmu jangan menyambungkan hatimu dengan syaikh yang lain bisa saja kalian akan terluka karena melakukan hal itu
751293 tinggalkan apa pun yang telah kalian kumpulkan semasa kanak kanakmu
751294 dalam menjaga kehadirat syaikhmu kalian tidak boleh menyimpan sesuatu dalam hatimu kecuali allah swt dan nama nya
751295 suatu ketika aku bertemu dengan syaikhku syaikh ali ar ramitani
751296 beliau berkata kepadaku syaikhmu sayyid ali ar ramitani telah menantimu sejak lama di sini aku masuk ke dalam dan syaikhku sudah siap untuk menjadi imam dalam rangkaian shalat malam setelah menyelesaikan shalatnya beliau menoleh kepadaku dan berkata wahai anakku aku telah diperintahkan oleh rasulullah saw untuk menemanimu dari masjid kubah ke sidratul muntaha tempat yang sama di mana beliau mengalami miraj ketika beliau selesai berbicara orang yang serba hijau itu membawa dua makhluk yang tidak pernah kulihat sebelumnya kami menunggangi kedua makhluk tersebut dan mengangkasa setiap kali kami naik kami mendapatkan pengetahuan yang terdapat di tingkat antara bumi dan surga itu
751297 mustahil melukiskan apa yang kami lihat dan kami pelajari dalam miraj itu karena kata kata tidak bisa mengekspresikan apa yang berhubungan dengan hati kata kata tidak bisa mengungkapkannya kecuali dengan merasakan dan mengalaminya sendiri
751298 kemudian aku mendengar suara rasulullah saw berkata kepadaku wahai muhammad baba as samasi wahai anakku jalur tempat engkau berada adalah jalur yang paling mulia dan orang orang yang telah terpilih untuk menjadi bintang dan penunjuk bagi ummat manusia akan diterima di jalur tersebut kembalilah dan aku akan mendukungmu dengan segala kekuatanku dan allah mendukungku dengan kekuatan nya layanilah syaikhmu
751299 ketika suara rasulullah saw menghilang aku menemukan diriku berdiri di tengah syaikhku itu adalah sebuah karunia yang besar berada dekat dengan syaikh yang sangat kuat yang bisa membawamu ke kehadirat ilahi
751300 nama allah bagaikan kata yang berlaku untuk semua atribut ini dan itulah sebabnya mengapa dia disebut ism al jalala nama yang paling mulia karena dia yang mahatinggi mahasuci dan mahabesar
751301 melalui pemahaman akal saja tidak mungkin bisa memanen buah dari rahasia rahasia ini tubuh manusia tidak dapat mencakup realitas makna mengenai tuhan tubuh manusia mustahil mencapai kerajaan yang tersembunyi dari yang maha unik karena bagi orang orang dalam inti yang mereka miliki hanya kekaguman dan ketakjuban sekali mereka memasuki posisi pengetahuan yang tersembunyi mereka akan tersesat pergi ke mana mana lalu bagaimana dengan orang orang dalam atribut nya yaitu mereka yang mempunyai kualitas tinggi dan masing masing menunjukkan sebuah attribut ilahi yang disandangkan dan menghiasi mereka tetap saja mereka tidak bisa dihiasi dengan inti dari nama yang mencakup seluruh nama kecuali dengan memasuki rahasia yang tersembunyi dari 99 nama tersebut pada saat itu mereka baru diizinkan untuk meraih posisi tanpa sekat terhadap cahaya dari nama yang mencakup seluruh nama dan atribut nama allah
751302 jika para pencari terus melakukan dzikir dengan nama yang mahasuci allah dia akan mulai berjalan di tempat dzikir itu yang jumlahnya ada tujuh setiap pencari yang terus melakukan dzikir allah dalam hati dari 5000 sampai 48 000 kali sehari akan mencapai tingkat kesempurnaan sehingga dia akan menjadi sempurna dalam dzikir itu pada saat itu dia akan menemukan bahwa hatinya terus mengucapkan nama allah allah allah tanpa perlu menggerakkan lidah dia akan membangun kekuatan internal dengan membakar kotoran di dalamnya karena api dzikir melalap semua pengotor tidak ada yang tersisa kecuali permata yang bersinar dengan kekuatan spiritual
751303 begitu dzikir memasuki dan menjadi kokoh dalam hatinya dia akan meningkat lagi mencapai keadaan di mana dia bisa mengetahui dzikir yang dilakukan oleh seluruh ciptaan allah dia akan mendengar seluruh makhluk mengucapkan kalimat dzikir dengan cara yang telah ditetapkan oleh allah kepadanya dia mendengar setiap makhluk berdzikir dengan nada masing masing dan irama yang berbeda satu sama lain pendengarannya terhadap yang satu tidak mempengaruhi pendengarannya terhadap yang lain dia mampu mendengar semua secara simultan dan dia bisa membedakan masing masing jenis dzikir
751304 ketika para pencari melewati tingkat itu dia akan mengalami peningkatan lebih jauh dalam dzikirnya dia akan melihat bahwa setiap orang yang diciptakan oleh allah melakukan dzikir yang sama dengan dirinya pada saat itu dia akan menyadari bahwa dia telah mencapai kesatuan yang unik dan sempurna semua melakukan dzikir yang sama dan menggunakan kata kata yang sama segala macam perbedaan akan terhapus dari pandangannya dan dia akan melihat semua orang yang bersamanya mempunyai tingkatan yang sama dengan dzikir yang sama pula ini adalah tingkat penyatuan setiap orang dalam satu kesatuan di sini dia akan menarik semua bentuk syirik yang tersembunyi sampai ke akar akarnya dan semua makhluk akan tampak sebagai satu kesatuan ini adalah langkah pertama dari tujuh langkah dalam perjalanannya
751305 dari tingkat kesatuan dia akan menuju ke tingkat inti dari kesatuan di mana setiap orang yang ada menjadi tidak ada dan hanya kesatuan allah saja yang tampak
751306 kemudian dia akan menuju tingkat primordial dari kesederhanaan yang sempurna di mana dia bisa tampil dalam wujud apa saja dari sana dia akan menuju tingkat kunci dari rahasia yang dikenal dengan tingkat nama nama di mana tipe asli dari setiap makhluk ditunjukkan kepadanya dari alam ghaib menuju dunia yang nyata ini akan membuatnya berenang dalam orbit nama nama dan segala atribut dan dia akan mengetahui semua pengetahuan yang tersembunyi
751307 selanjutnya dia akan menuju tingkat yang tersembunyi dari yang tersembunyi inti dari semua yang tersembunyi dia akan mengatahui semua yang tersembunyi melalui kesatuan yang unik dari inti dia akan melihat semua kekuatan dan bentuknya
751308 dari sana dia menuju tingkat realitas sempurna dari inti nama nama dan semua aksi dia akan muncul di dalamnya dalam atom mereka dan dalam totalitas mereka dia akan disandangkan dengan nama yang paling agung dan dia akan diagungkan dan dimahkotai dengan tingkat kebesaran
751309 kemudian dia akan menuju ke tingkat turunnya allah munazala dari tingkatan nya yang agung ke tingkat surga dunia dia sampai pada tingkat itu yang terdekat dengan tingkat keduniaan di luar itu para pembaca dzikir tidak mempunyai tingkat lain untuk dicapai melalui bacaannya
751310 fajar datang ke dalam dirinya dan mentari kesempurnaan tampak dalam diri dan tubuhnya karena hal itu telah tampak melalui dzikir yang dilakukan dalam hati dan jiwanya
751311 allah swt akan menjadi telinga yang dipakainya untuk mendengar mata yang dipakainya untuk melihat lidah untuk berbicara tangan untuk menggenggam dan kaki untuk melangkah
751312 setiap beliau dimintai nasihat jika beliau berkata lakukan apa yang kamu suka maka orang itu tidak akan pernah berhasil tetapi bila beliau berkata lakukan ini dan lakukan itu maka orang tersebut akan berhasil
751313 beliau berkata peristiwa yang paling membahagiakan bagi ummat manusia adalah ketika dia meninggal karena ketika dia meninggal dosanya juga ikut mati bersamanya
751314 bagaimana mungkin aku memotong pohon yang masih hijau ketika dia sedang berdzikir mengucapkan la ilaha illallah aku lebih suka mengumpulkan dahan dahan mati dan tidak membakar cabang cabang pohon yang sedang berdzikir
751315 beliau berkata setiap pencari yang tidak membiasakan diri dan melatih dirinya untuk berpuasa di siang hari dan bangun di malam hari untuk beribadah dan melayani saudaranya dia tidak akan memperoleh kebaikan dalam thariqat ini
751316 ketika kamu pertama kali datang kepadaku aku melihatmu dan menemukan karakter buruk dalam dirimu setiap orang mempunyai karakter baik yang bercampur dengan karakter buruk ketika kamu melakukan bayat seluruh perbuatan buruk yang telah kamu lakukan sebelumnya aku ganti dengan perbuatan baik kecuali dua hal yaitu keinginan seksual dan kemarahan minggu lalu kami hilangkan kedua karakter buruk itu dari dirimu ketika beliau mengucapkan hal itu aku sadar bahwa beliau telah duduk bersamaku dan melihat keinginan seksual dan kemarahanku aku mulai menangis menangis dan menangis setelah dua jam aku menangis beliau berkata cukup allah swt telah mengampunimu rasulullah saw juga telah mengampunimu aku berkata wahai syaikhku apakah engkau benar benar mengampuniku apakah rasulullah telah mengampuniku apakah allah telah mengampuniku apakah para masyaikh yang matanya selalu mengawasiku telah mengampuniku dulu aku berpikir bahwa aku melakukan perbuatan itu sendirian tetapi sekarang aku tahu bahwa engkau semua melihatku
751317 beliau berkata wahai anakku kita adalah hamba hamba yang berada di depan pintu rasulullah saw dan di depan pintu allah swt apapun yang kita minta dari mereka mereka akan menerima permintaan kita karena kita berada dalam kehadiratnya dan kita adalah satu aku berkata sebagai suatu itikad baik karena aku telah diampuni bagaimana aku bisa bersyukur kepada allah dan memberi kehormatan kepadamu dan kepada rasulullah saw apakah dengan jalan merayakan mawlid kelahiran rasulullah saw atau berkurban atau mengeluarkan sedekah lainnya beliau berkata apa yang kami inginkan darimu adalah agar kamu senantiasa melakukan dzikir thariqat naqsybandi
751318 aku diutus ke sini untuk membawa rahasia orang banyak orang orang yang dipenjarakan tanpa sebab aku memberi dukungan kepada orang orang ini allah swt mengutusku ke sini karena kamu semua berkumpul di sini dan sangat sulit mencapai kalian saya berada di sini untuk mengucapkan salam perpisahan kepadamu karena kami segera akan meninggalkan dunia ini kami akan mengantarkan kepadamu rahasia rahasia kamu bagi kami tidak ada istilah penjara kami selalu berada dalam kehadirat nya dan kami tidak pernah terpengaruh dengan penjara kalian semua akan meninggal beberapa saat lagi tetapi kalian akan bertemu lagi ketika seorang tokoh penting meninggal barulah kalian semua akan bertemu kembali
751319 selama tiga bulan aku telah menyelami samudera surat untuk mengeluarkan seluruh nama dari thariqat naqsyabandi yang berjumlah 7007 dari salah satu ayatnya alhamdulillah aku berhasil mendapatkan nama nama mereka beserta seluruh gelarnya dan aku telah mencatatnya pada catatan harianku yang aku berikan kepada penerusku syaikh abdullah faiz ad daghestani dia berisikan nama nama seluruh wali dari beragam kelompok yang akan ada pada masanya imam mahdi as
751320 suatu saat aku sedang mengalami ekstase dan tanpa akal pikiran tidak sadar berpindah dari sini ke sana tak menyadari apa yang tengah kulakukan kakiku robek dan berdarah karena duri pada saat gelap aku merasa diriku ditarik ke rumah syaikhku sayyid amir kulal saat itu malam sungguh gelap tanpa bulan dan bintang udara amat dingin dan aku tak memiliki apapun kecuali sebuat jubah kulit yang sudah usang ketika aku tiba di rumahnya aku menemukan beliau sedang duduk bersama para sahabatnya ketika beliau melihatku beliau berkata kepada para pengikutnya bawa dia keluar aku tak menginginkan dia berada di rumahku mereka lalu mengeluarkan aku dan aku merasakan ego berusaha menguasaiku mencoba meracuni kepercayaanku kepada syaikhku pada saat itu hanya perlindungan allah dan rahmat nya lah satu satunya pendukungku dalam menerima penghinaan ini demi allah dan demi syaikhku lalu aku berkata pada egoku aku tak memperkenankanmu untuk meracuni kepercayaanku terhadap syaikhku
751321 aku begitu lelah dan tertekan sehingga aku merendahkan hati di depan pintu kesombongan meletakkan kepalaku di bawah pintu rumah guruku dan bersumpah dengan nama allah bahwa aku tak akan pindah sampai beliau menerimaku kembali salju mulai turun dan udara yang begitu dingin menembus tulangku membuatku gemetar dalam gelapnya malam bahkan cahaya rembulan pun tak ada untuk sedikit membuatku merasa nyaman aku ingat keadaan tersebut hingga aku membeku namun cinta akan pintu ilahi syaikhku yang ada dalam hatiku membuatku tetap hangat
751322 subuh pun datang dan syaikhku keluar dari pintu tanpa melihatku secara fisik beliau menginjak kepalaku yang masih berada di bawah pintunya merasakan adanya kepalaku dengan segera beliau menarik kakinya membawaku ke dalam rumahnya dan berkata kepadaku wahai anakku kau telah dihiasi dengan pakaian kebahagiaan kau telah dihiasi dengan pakaian cinta ilahi kau telah dihiasi dengan pakaian yang tidak pernah aku dan syaikhku kenakan allah senang denganmu rasulullah senang denganmu semua syaikh dari matarantai emas senang denganmu
751323 kemudian dengan telaten dan sangat hati hati beliau mencabuti duri duri dari kakiku dan membasuh lukaku pada saat yang sama beliau menuangkan ilmu pada hatiku yang tak pernah aku alami sebelumnya hal ini membukakan suatu pandangan di mana aku melihat diriku memasuki rahasia muhammadun rasul allah aku melihat diriku memasuki rahasia ayat yang merupakan haqiqa muhammadiyya realitas muhammad saw hal ini mengantarkan aku untuk memasuki rahasia dari laa ilaha illallah yang merupakan rahasia dari wahdaniyyah keunikan allah swt hal ini lalu mengantar aku untuk memasuki rahasia asma allah dan atribut nya yang dinyatakan dengan rahasia ahadiyya ke esa an allah keadaan keadaan tersebut tak dapat dilukiskan dengan kata kata hanya dapat diketahui lewat rasa di dalam hati
751324 di awal perjalananku di thariqat ini aku biasa berkeliaran di malam hari dari satu tempat ke tempat lainnya di pinggiran kota bukhara sendirian di gelapnya malam khususnya di musim dingin aku mengunjungi pemakaman untuk memetik pelajaran dari yang telah meninggal
751325 aku akan bangun lebih awal tiga jam sebelum shalat fajar berwudhu dan setelah melaksanakan shalat sunnah aku akan bersujud memohon pada tuhan dengan doa berikut wahai tuhanku berilah hamba kekuatan untuk menjalankan kesulitan kesulitan dan rasa sakit dari cinta mu lalu aku akan shalat fajar bersama dengan syaikh ketika syaikhku keluar beliau melihat ke arahku dan berkata seolah olah beliau telah bersamaku ketika aku berdoa tadi wahai anakku kau harus mengubah cara berdoamu daripada berdoa seperti doamu tadi lebih baik engkau berdoa ya allah swt anugerahkanlah ridha mu pada hamba yang lemah ini
751326 tuhan tidak senang hamba nya berada dalam kesulitan walau tuhan dalam kearifan nya mungkin memberikan kesulitan pada hamba nya untuk mengujinya sang hamba tak boleh meminta untuk berada dalam kesulitan hal ini berarti tidak menghormati tuhanmu
751327 ketika syah naqsyband mendapat pakaian baru beliau akan memberikannya kepada orang lain untuk dipakai setelah mereka memakainya beliau akan meminjamnya kembali
751328 wahai syaikhku aku adalah anak dari orang lain dan aku adalah pengikutnya
751329 aku duduk bersama seorang teman dalam pengasingan khalwat tiba tiba langit terbuka dan suatu pemandangan yang agung datang padaku dan aku mendengar sebuah suara yang berkata tidakkah cukup bagimu meninggalkan setiap orang dan datang ke hadirat kami sendirian saja suara ini membuatku gemetar dan lari dari rumah itu aku berlari ke sebuah sungai di mana aku lalu menyeburkan diri aku mencuci pakaianku lalu shalat dua rakaat dengan cara yang belum pernah aku lakukan sebelumnya aku merasa seolah olah sedang shalat dalam hadirat nya segalanya begitu terbuka ke dalam hatiku dalam bentuk tanpa sekat kashf seluruh semesta lenyap dan aku tak menghiraukan apa pun kecuali berdoa ke hadirat nya
751330 bila aku menemukan sesuatu aku bersyukur kepada allah dan bila tidak aku bersabar
751331 jangan abaikan hal sekecil apapun dari kebaikan dan perbuatan perbuatan mulia yang telah ditunjukkan oleh rasulullah saw
751332 untuk menyangkal keberadaanmu dan untuk mengacuhkan dan mengabaikan egomu adalah yang berlaku dalam thariqat ini
751333 aku melihat bahwa setiap orang menyediakan suatu manfaat dan hanya akulah yang tak memberikannya
751334 apakah di balik cerita rasulullah saw sebagian dari iman adalah memindahkan apa apa yang membahayakan dari jalan yang beliau maksud dengan yang membahayakan itu adalah ego dan yang beliau maksud dengan jalan adalah jalan menuju allah swt sebagaimana dia berfirman kepada bayazid al bistami tinggalkan egomu dan datanglah pada kami
751335 suatu ketika beliau ditanya apa yang dimaksud dengan berjalan dalam jalur beliau berkata detailnya dalam pengetahuan spiritual
751336 mereka bertanya apakah detail dalam pengetahuan spiritual itu beliau menjawab orang yang mengetahui dan menerima apa yang dia ketahui akan diangkat dari keadaan bukti nyata kepada keadaan pengelihatan
751337 barang siapa yang meminta untuk berada di jalan allah maka dia telah meminta jalan penderitaan diriwayatkan oleh rasulullah saw barang siapa yang mencintaiku maka aku akan membebaninya seseorang datang kepada rasulullah saw dan berkata wahai nabi saw aku mencintaimu dan nabi saw berkata maka bersiaplah untuk menjadi miskin lain waktu orang lain lagi datang kepada rasulullah dan berkata ya rasulullah aku mencintai allah dan rasulullah berkata maka siapkanlah dirimu untuk penderitaan
751338 beliau membaca sebuah ayat setiap orang mendambakan kebaikan namun tak seorang pun telah meraih kenaikan melainkan dengan mencintai sang pencipta kebaikan
751339 beliau berkata barang siapa yang mencintai dirinya sendiri harus menyangkal dirinya dan barang siapa yang menginginkan yang lain selain dirinya sendiri sesungguhnya yang diinginkannya hanyalah dirinya sendiri
751340 dalam keadaan perenungan si pencari melupakan mahkluk dan hanya mengingat sang khalik saja
751341 si pencari dalam thariqat ini pastilah amat sibuk menolak bisikan setan dan godaan egonya dia mungkin menolaknya bahkan sebelum mereka mencapainya atau dia mungkin menolaknya setelah mereka mencapainya namun sebelum mereka memegang kendali atasnya pencari lain mungkin saja tidak menolaknya hingga mereka mencapainya dan mengendalikannya dia tak akan mendapatkan buahnya karena pada saat seperti itu adalah mustahil untuk mengeluarkan bisikan bisikan itu dari hatinya
751342 bagaimanakah hamba hamba allah melihat perbuatan yang tersembunyi dan bisikan bisikan hati beliau menjawab dengan cahaya pengelihatan yang dianugerahkan allah pada mereka seperti yang tertera dalam hadits suci waspadalah dengan pengelihatan orang orang yang beriman karena dia melihat dengan cahaya allah swt
751343 beliau diminta untuk memperlihatkan kekuatan ajaibnya beliau berkata keajaiban apakah yang lebih dahsyat yang ingin kau lihat daripada kenyataan bahwa kita masih berjalan di muka bumi ini dengan semua dosa di atas dan sekeliling kita
751344 beliau ditanya siapakah para pembaca dan siapakah gerangan sang sufi yang dimaksud oleh junayd dengan kata kata
751345 beliau memperingatkan bila seorang murid seorang syaikh atau siapa pun bicara tentang suatu keadaan yang belum didapatkannya allah swt akan mencegahnya dari mencapai keadaan tersebut beliau berkata cermin dari setiap syaikh memiliki dua arah namun cermin kita memiliki enam arah
751346 apa yang dimaksudkan dengan al hadits aku beserta orang orang yang mengingat ku merupakan bukti nyata yang mendukung orang orang yang di dalam hatinya senantiasa mengingat nya
751347 dan sabda nabi yang lainnya berbicara atas nama allah puasa itu adalah bagi ku merupakan suatu pernyataan bahwa sebenar benarnya puasa adalah puasa dari segala sesuatu selain allah
751348 beliau pernah ditanya siapakah si miskin itu tak seorang pun menjawabnya beliau berkata si miskin adalah orang yang di dalamnya selalu berjuang dan di luarnya selalu berada dalam ketenangan
751349 amatlah penting bagi para pengikut bila dia merasa bingung terhadap apa yang diucapkan atau dilakukan syaikhnya dan tak dapat memahami alasannya untuk bersabar dan menjalankannya dan tak menjadi curiga bila dia seorang pemula dia mungkin bertanya namun bila dia seorang murid dia tak punya alasan untuk bertanya dan harus tetap bersabar dengan apa yang belum dia pahami
751350 adalah tak mungkin untuk meraih cinta dari hamba hamba allah swt hingga engkau keluar dari dirimu sendiri
751351 dalam thariqat kita terdapat tiga kategori adab adab karimah terhadap allah yang maha kuasa dan maha tinggi mengharuskan murid untuk menyempurnakan ibadahnya baik secara eksternal maupun internal menjauhi semua larangan nya dan menjalankan segala apa yang telah diperintahkan nya dan meninggalkan segala sesuatu selain allah
751352 adab karimah terhadap nabi muhammad saw mengharuskan murid untuk membumbung tinggi pada keadaan yang disebutkan dalam ayat in kuntum tuhibbun allah fattabiunii bila kamu ingin mencintai allah maka ikutilah aku 3 31 dia harus mengikuti semua keadaan rasulullah dia harus tahu bahwa rasulullah adalah jembatan antara allah dengan mahkluk nya dan bahwa segala sesuatu di bumi ini berada di bawah perintahnya yang mulia
751353 adab karimah terhadap para syaikh merupakan suatu keharusan bagi setiap pencari para syaikh merupakan penyebab dan alat untuk mengikuti jejak rasulullah saw adalah suatu kewajiban bagi para pencari baik dalam kehadiran mereka maupun dalam ketidakhadirannya untuk menjalankan perintah perintah dari syaikh tersebut
751354 sangatlah penting untuk meluruskan niat karena niat itu dari dunia ghaib bukan dari dunia materi untuk alasan tersebut ibnu sirin penulis buku tabir mimpi tidak berdoa pada shalat jenazah hasan al basri beliau berkata bagaimana aku dapat berdoa ketika niatku belum mencapaiku dan menghubungkanku dengan yang ghaib
751355 niat niyyah sangat penting karena dia terdiri atas 3 huruf yaitu nun yang melambangkan nur allah cahaya allah ya yang melambangkan yad allah tangan allah dan ha yang melambangkan hidayat allah bimbingan allah niat adalah hembusan jiwa
751356 allah swt menciptakan aku untuk menghancurkan kehidupan materialistik tetapi orang orang menginginkan aku untuk membangun kehidupan materialistik mereka
751357 hamba hamba allah menanggung beban penciptaan agar semua ciptaan belajar darinya allah swt melihat pada hati awliya nya dengan cahaya cahaya nya dan siapa pun yang berada di sekeliling wali itu dia akan mendapat berkah dari cahaya tersebut
751358 syaikh harus mengetahui tingkatan muridnya dalam tiga kategori yaitu di masa lalu masa kini dan masa depan agar dia dapat menaikkan maqam nya
751359 siapa pun yang melakukan bayat dengan kita dan mengikuti kita dan mencintai kita apakah dia dekat atau jauh di mana pun dia berada bahkan jika dia berada di timur dan kami di barat kami memeliharanya dengan aliran cinta dan memberinya cahaya dalam kehidupan sehari harinya
751360 dari kehadiran al azizan ada dua metode dzikir yaitu dzikir khafi dalam hati dan dzikir zahar keras aku menyukai dzikir dalam hati karena dia lebih kuat dan lebih bijaksana
751361 izin untuk melakukan dzikir harus diberikan oleh orang yang sempurna agar bisa mempengaruhi orang yang menggunakannya sebagaimana halnya panah dari seorang yang ahli memanah lebih baik daripada panah yang dilepaskan dari busur orang biasa
751362 kesadaran akan waktu berarti memperhatikan ketenangan seseorang dan mengecek kecenderungan seseorang kepada kelalaian para pencari harus mengetahui berapa banyak waktu yang dihabiskan untuk bergerak menuju kematangan spiritual dan harus mengenal di tempat apa dia telah sampai dalam perjalannya menuju hadirat ilahi
751363 para pencari harus membuat kemajuan dengan segala usahanya dia harus menghabiskan seluruh waktunya untuk satu tujuan yaitu sampai di maqam cinta ilahi dan hadirat ilahi dia harus menjadi sadar bahwa dalam segala usahanya dan dalam segala tindakannya allah menyaksikan sampai sedetail detailnya para pencari harus membuat catatan mengenai tindakan dan niatnya setiap hari dan setiap malam dan menganalisa tindakannya setiap jam setiap detik dan setiap saat jika semuanya baik dia bersyukur kepada allah atas nikmat tersebut jika tindakannya buruk dia harus bertaubat dan memohon ampun kepada allah swt
751364 penerus beliau grandsyaikh kita syaikh abdullah ad daghestani menceritakan hal berikut dalam ceramahnya suatu ketika dalam salah satu meditasiku syaikh syarafuddin mendatangiku dan berkata mengenai kebesaran dan keistimewaan shah naqsyaband beliau memujinya dan mengatakan bagaimana shah naqsyaband akan memberikan perantaraan di hari pembalasan beliau berkata jika seseorang melihat mata shah naqsyaband dia akan melihat mata beliau berputar bagian yang putih di hitam dan yang hitam di putih beliau bermaksud menyimpan kekuatan spiritualnya untuk hari pembalasan dan tidak menggunakannya di dunia ini
751365 pada hari pembalasan syaikh naqshbandi akan mengeluarkan cahaya dari mata kanannya cahaya itu lalu mengelilingi banyak orang dalam perkumpulannya dan masuk kembali ke mata kirinya siapa pun yang berada dalam lingkaran itu akan masuk surga dan terhindar dari neraka beliau akan mengisi keempat surga dengan perantaraannya itu
751366 ketika beliau sedang melukiskan peristiwa besar itu aku menyaksikan panorama yang kuat di mana aku menyaksikan peristiwa hari pembalasan dan melihat shah naqsyaband mengeluarkan cahaya dan menyelamatkan orang orang ketika aku sedang mengamati hal itu aku merasakan cinta yang sangat dalam kepada shah naqsyaband lalu aku berlari menuju beliau dan mencium tangannya kemudian panorama itu menghilang dan syaikhku pergi
751367 aku melanjutkan meditasiku pada hari itu dengan berdzikir membaca dan melakukan shalat di malam harinya setelah melaksanakan shalat isya aku mengalami keadaan tidak sadarkan diri dan menempatkan aku ke dalam keadaan panorama spiritual aku melihat shah naqsyaband memasuki ruangan beliau berkata kepadaku anakku datanglah kepadaku kemudian rohku meninggalkan jasad dan aku melihat tubuhku berada di bawahku dan tidak bergerak aku lalu menemani shah naqsyaband kami menjelajahi ruang dan waktu bukan dengan kekuatan melihat lalu mencapai tempat yang dilihat itu tetapi dengan kekuatan dimana ketika kami baru memikirkan suatu tempat kami tiba di tempat itu selama tiga malam dan empat hari non stop kami melakukan perjalanan dengan cara ini
751368 sudah menjadi kebiasaan dalam meditasiku ketika aku menginginkan makanan dan minuman sehari hari aku tinggal mengetuk pintu mendengar ketukan dari lantai bawah istriku akan membawakan makanan dan minuman untukku hari pertama dia tidak mendengar ketukan hari kedua juga begitu akhirnya dia merasa sangat khawatir dan membuka pintu dan menemukan aku terbaring di sana tanpa gerakan dia berlari menuju syaikh syarafuddin dan berkata mari dan lihatlah anakmu dia terlihat seperti orang yang sudah meninggal beliau berkata kepadanya dia tidak meninggal kembalilah dan jangan berbicara kepada siapa pun dia akan kembali
751369 setelah tiga hari dan empat malam menempuh perjalanan dengan kekuatan yang luar biasa shah naqsyaband berhenti beliau berkata tahukah kamu siapa yang tampak di cakrawala itu tentu saja aku tahu tetapi untuk menghormati guru aku berkata wahai guruku engkau paling tahu lalu ketika orang itu mendekat beliau berkata sekarang apakah kamu mengenalinya aku berkata lagi engkau lebih tahu wahai guruku walaupun aku melihat itu adalah syaikhku sarafuddin beliau berkata itu adalah syaikhmu syaikh syarafuddin tahukah kamu siapa makhluk yang berada di belakangnya menunjuk kepada suatu makhluk raksasa yang lebih besar daripada gunung yang paling tinggi di bumi ini yang beliau tarik dengan sebuah tali untuk menghormatinya aku berkata lagi engkau paling tahu wahai syaikhku beliau berkata itu adalah setan dan syaikhmu diberi kekuasaan atasnya belum ada orang yang diberi otorisasi semacam itu sebelumnya sebagaimana setiap wali diberi kekuasaan atas sesuatu yang khusus begitu pula syaikhmu bidang khususnya adalah bahwa setiap hari dan setiap malam atas nama seluruh orang yang telah melakukan dosa karena pengaruh setan syaikhmu diberi otorisasi untuk membersihkan orang orang itu atas dosa dosa mereka mengembalikan dosa itu kepada setan dan membawa orang orang itu dalam keadaan bersih kepada rasulullah kemudian dengan kekuatan spiritualnya beliau mengangkat hati mereka mempersiapkan mereka agar bisa masuk ke dalam lingkaran cahaya yang akan aku sebarkan di hari pembalasan nanti aku akan mengisi empat surga dengan cara ini inilah yang menjadi spesialisasi syaikh syarafuddin selain itu orang orang yang tidak termasuk dalam keempat surga tersebut akan memasuki perantaraan syaikh syarafuddin dengan seizin rasulullah yang telah diberi kekuatan ini oleh allah ini adalah kekuasaan yang luar biasa yang telah diberikan kepada syaikh syarafuddin ketika beliau merantai leher setan beliau membatasi pengaruh dosa di bumi ini
751370 kemudian beliau berkata kamu menanam benih cinta yang ada di hatimu seperti halnya kincir air yang mengairi sepetak sawah tetapi tidak bisa mengairi dua petak sawah cinta yang kamu tumbuhkan terhadap syaikhmu seharusnya hanya untuk syaikhmu jika kamu membaginya untuk dua orang syaikh mungkin cinta itu tidak akan mencukupi seperti halnya kincir air yang tidak bisa mengairi dua petak sawah jangan berikan hatimu kebebasan untuk pergi ke sana ke mari cintamu akan mencapaiku melalui mata rantai emas dan akan berlanjut kepada rasulullah jangan membagi dua cintamu untuk kami berdua sebelumnya tak seorang wali pun yang diberi otorisasi seperti yang diberikan kepada syaikhmu untuk ummat muhammad saw untuk seluruh ummat manusia
751371 engkau harus menjadi awas akan dirimu jika engkau mengikuti syariah maka engkau harus bersyukur kepada allah swt bila tidak maka engkau harus memohon ampun
751372 yang penting bagi seorang pencari dalam keadaan ini adalah menjaga periode waktu terkecil agar tetap aman dia harus menjaga dirinya dan menilai apakah dia dalam hadirat allah atau dalam hadirat egonya setiap saat dalam hidupnya syah naqsyband berkata engkau harus mengevaluasi bagaimana engkau menghabiskan waktumu dalam kehadiran atau dalam kelalaian
751373 kesadaran akan jumlah hitungan dzikir berarti para pencari yang sedang berdzikir harus memperhatikan bilangan dzikir yang tepat yang diperlukan dalam dzikir khafi menjaga hitungan dzikir ini bukan untuk perhitungan itu sendiri tetapi demi menjaga hati agar tetap aman dari pikiran buruk dan untuk meningkatkan konsentrasi dalam usaha mencapai jumlah pengulangan yang telah ditetapkan oleh syaikh secepat mungkin
751374 pilar dzikir melalui perhitungan adalah untuk membawa hati kepada hadirat ilahi yang disebutkan dalam dzikir tersebut dan tetap menghitung satu demi satu untuk membawa perhatian seseorang kepada realitas bahwa setiap orang membutuhkan dia yang maha esa yang tanda tanda kebesarannya tampak pada setiap makhluk
751375 syah naqsyband berkata memperhatikan jumlah dzikir adalah langkah pertama dalam tahap mendapatkan pengetahuan surgawi ilm ul ladunni
751376 kesadaran akan hati berarti mengarahkan hati para pencari menuju hadirat ilahi di mana dia tidak akan melihat yang lain kecuali yang paling dicintainya
751377 tingkat kesadaran hati adalah tingkatan untuk hadir dalam hadirat ilahi sedemikian rupa sehingga engkau tidak bisa melihat yang lain selain dia dalam situasi demikian seseorang memusatkan tempat dzikirnya dalam hati sebab inilah pusat kekuatan semua pikiran dan inspirasi baik maupun buruk jatuh dan muncul satu demi satu berputar dan mengalir bergerak di antara terang dan gelap dalam perputaran yang konstan di dalam hati dzikir diperlukan untuk mengontrol dan mengurangi gejolak dalam hati
751378 syah naqsyband berkata ketika rasulullah bersabda porsi ummatku yang ditakdirkan untuk api neraka adalah seperti porsi ibrahim as yang ditakdirkan untuk api namrud beliau memberi kabar gembira tentang penyelamatan bagi ummatnya sebagaimana allah swt telah menggariskan penyelamatan untuk ibrahim as ya naru kunii bardan wa salaman ala ibrahiim wahai api jadilah dingin dan jadilah keselamatan bagi ibrahim 21 69
751379 ini dikarenakan rasulullah saw bersabda ummatku tidak akan setuju dengan suatu kesalahan menegaskan bahwa ummat tidak akan menerima perbuatan yang salah dan dengan demikian allah swt akan menyelamatkan ummat muhammad saw dari api neraka
751380 syaikh ahmad faruqi mengatakan bahwa syah naqsyband berkata ummat muhammad saw meliputi semua orang yang muncul setelah rasulullah dia terdiri atas 3 macam ummat yaitu 1 yaitu setiap orang yang benar benar muncul setelah rasulullah dan mendengar pesannya dari berbagai ayat dalam al quran sudah jelas bahwa rasulullah datang kepada semua manusia tanpa kecuali lebih jauh lagi ummatnya cukup menjadi saksi bagi ummat ummat yang lain dan rasulullah adalah orang yang menjadi saksi bagi setiap orang termasuk ummat ummat yang lain dan saksi saksi yang mewakili mereka masing masing 2 ummatu l ijaba yaitu orang orang yang menerima pesannya 3 yaitu orang orang yang menerima pesan dan mengikuti jejak rasulullah saw
751381 semua golongan ummat rasulullah saw tersebut akan selamat jika mereka tidak diselamatkan melalui amalnya mereka akan diselamatkan melalui perantaraan rasulullah saw menurut sabdanya perantaraanku adalah untuk para pendosa besar di antara ummatku
751382 beliau berkata apa yang dimaksud dengan hadits rasulullah as shalatu miraj shalat adalah miraj bagi orang yang beriman adalah indikasi yang jelas mengenai tingkatan shalat yang sejati di mana orang orang yang shalat naik ke hadirat ilahi dan padanya terdapat manifestasi rasa hormat yang mendalam kepatuhan dan kerendahan hati di mana hatinya mencapai keadaan kontemplasi melalui shalatnya
751383 ini akan mengantarkannya kepada suatu panorama dari rahasia ilahi hal ini adalah deskripsi mengenai shalatnya rasulullah saw dalam sirah sejarah hidupnya dikatakan bahwa ketika rasulullah mencapai keadaan tersebut orang orang di luar kota pun dapat mendengar suara yang berasal dari dadanya yang menyerupai dengungan lebah
751384 syaikh salah seorang pelayannya melaporkan suatu ketika syah naqsyband berkata kepada para pengikutnya suatu hubungan antara hatimu dengan sesuatu selain allah adalah hijab terbesar bagi seorang pencari setelah itu beliau membaca bait puisi berikut hubungan dengan selain allah adalah hijab sekat terkuat dan meninggalkannya adalah jalan pembuka bagi suatu pencapaian
751385 segera setelah beliau membacakan bait tersebut terlintas dalam benakku bahwa beliau merujuk pada hubungan antara iman dan penyerahan diri pada kehendak ilahi
751386 aku menolak agama allah dan penolakan itu adalah wajib bagiku meskipun tampak menyeramkan bagi kebanyakan muslim
751387 wahai syaikh salah apa yang terlintas dalam benakmu bahwa hubungan itu adalah dengan iman dan islam bukanlah hal yang penting
751388 aku menyangkal agama mu dan penyangkalan itu adalah wajib bagiku meskipun tampak menyeramkan bagi muslim
751389 hatinya hallaj tidak menginginkan yang lain kecuali allah tentu saja hallaj tidak menyangkal imannya dalam islam tetapi beliau menekankan bahwa hatinya hanya terkait kepada allah saja jika hallaj tidak menerima segala sesuatu selain allah bagaimana mungkin orang mengatakan bahwa sebenarnya beliau menyangkal agama allah pernyataannya tentang realitas kesaksiannya mencakup segalanya dan membuat kesaksian muslim yang awam menjadi mainan anak anak
751390 syaikh salah melanjutkan syah naqsyband berkata hamba hamba allah tidak bangga dengan apa yang mereka lakukan mereka melakukannya karena cinta kepada allah semata
751391 syaikh arslan ad dimasyqi berkata sebagaimana yang diceritakan oleh syah naqsyband ya allah agama mu bukanlah apa apa melainkan syirik yang tersembunyi dan untuk tidak beriman kepadanya adalah wajib bagi seluruh hamba yang benar
751392 barangsiapa yang ingkar terhadap taghut berhala dan beriman kepada allah maka sesungguhnya ia telah berpegang kepada pegangan tali yang kokoh
751393 syaikh abul hasan asy syadzili salah seorang syaikh sufi agung pernah ditanya oleh syaikhnya
751394 aku datang kepada nya dengan kemiskinanku syaikhnya menjawab wahai anakku jangan kau ulangi lagi hal ini ini adalah berhala terbesar karena engkau masih mendatangi nya dengan sesuatu bebaskan dirimu terhadap segala sesuatu baru kemudian engkau datang kepada nya
751395 para fuqaha ahli hukum dan pemegang ilmu eksternal memegang teguh pada perbuatan mereka dan dengan dasar tersebut mereka mengembangkan konsep pahala dan azab jika mereka baik mereka akan mendapat kebaikan dan bila mereka buruk mereka menemukan keburukan apa yang bermanfaat bagi seorang hamba adalah perbuatannya dan apa yang menyakitinya adalah perbuatannya juga bagi penganut thariqat hal ini adalah syirik tersembunyi karena seseorang menyekutukan sesuatu dengan allah meskipun untuk melakukan perbuatan baik adalah suatu kewajiban tetap saja hati tidak boleh terikat dengan perbuatan tersebut perbuatan itu hanya dilakukan karena allah dan untuk cinta nya tanpa pamrih apa pun
751396 syah naqsyband berkata thariqat kita sangat langka dan sangat berharga ini adalah urwati l wutsqa memegang teguh jalan untuk memegang jejak rasulullah saw dan para sahabatnya dengan teguh dan kokoh mereka membawaku ke jalan ini dari pintu nikmat karena pada awal dan akhirnya aku tidak melihat apapun kecuali nikmat allah di jalan ini pintu pintu besar dari pengetahuan surgawi akan dibukakan bagi para pencari yang mengikuti jejak rasulullah saw
751397 untuk mengikuti sunnah rasulullah saw adalah jalan terpenting yang akan membukakan pintu kepadamu barangsiapa yang tidak datang ke jalan kita maka agamanya berada dalam bahaya
751398 beliau pernah ditanya bagaimana seseorang datang ke jalanmu beliau menjawab dengan mengikuti sunnah rasulullah saw
751399 kami telah membawa penghinaan dalam jalan ini dan sebagai balasannya allah swt memberkati kita dengan kemuliaan nya
751400 beberapa orang berkata tentang beliau bahwa kadang kadang beliau terlihat arogan beliau berkata kami bangga karena dia karena dia adalah tuhan kami yang memberi kami dukungan nya
751401 beliau berkata untuk mencapai rahasia ke esaan kadang kadang mungkin tetapi untuk meraih rahasia pengetahuan spiritual marifat adalah sangat sulit sekali
751402 pengetahuan spiritual bagaikan air dia mengambil warna dan bentuk cangkirnya pengetahuan allah swt begitu luar biasa sehingga berapa pun yang kita ambil itu hanya seperti sebuah tetes dalam samudra yang mahaluas dia bagaikan taman yang sangat luas berapa pun yang kita pangkas seolah olah kita hanya memangkas sekuntum bunga saja
751403 syah naqsyband berada dalam tingkatan tertinggi dalam menolak keinginan terhadap dunia ini beliau mengikuti jalan yang shaleh terutama dalam hal tata cara makannya beliau mengambil segala jenis pencegahan sehubungan dengan makanannya beliau hanya mau makan dari barley yang ditanamnya sendiri beliau akan memanennya menggilingnya membuat adonan menanak dan memanggangnya sendiri semua ulama dan para pencari di masanya membuat jalan mereka menuju rumahnya agar bisa makan di mejanya dan mendapatkan berkah dari makanannya
751404 beliau mencapai suatu kesempurnaan dalam hal penghematan di musim dingin beliau hanya meletakkan selembar karpet tua di lantai rumahnya dan ini tidak memberi perlindungan dari udara dingin yang menusuk di musim panas beliau meletakkan tikar yang sangat tipis di lantai
751405 beliau mencintai orang yang miskin dan membutuhkan beliau mendorong para pengikutnya untuk mencari nafkah dengan cara yang halal yaitu dengan membanting tulang beliau mendorong mereka untuk membagikan uangnya kepada fakir miskin beliau memasak untuk fakir miskin dan mengundang mereka untuk makan bersama beliau melayani mereka dengan tangannya sendiri yang suci dan mendorong mereka agar tetap berada di hadirat allah
751406 jika salah seorang di antara mereka memasukkan makanan ke dalam mulutnya dengan cara yang tidak baik beliau akan menegurnya melalui pandangan spiritualnya terhadap apa yang telah mereka lakukan dan mendorong mereka untuk tetap ingat kepada allah ketika sedang makan
751407 beliau mengajarkan bahwa salah satu pintu yang paling penting menuju ke hadirat allah adalah makan dengan kesadaran makanan memberikan kekuatan bagi tubuh dan makan dengan kesadaran memberikan kesucian bagi tubuh
751408 suatu saat beliau diundang ke sebuah kota bernama ghaziat di mana salah seorang muridnya telah menyiapkan makanan baginya
751409 wahai anakku aku ingin tahu bagaimana engkau menyiapkan makanan ini sejak engkau membuat adonan dan memasaknya sampai engkau menyajikannya engkau berada dalam keadaan marah makanan in bercampur dengan kemarahan itu jika kita memakan makanan itu setan akan menemukan jalan untuk masuk melaluinya dan menyebarkan seluruh sifat buruknya ke seluruh tubuh kita
751410 ketika diundang makan oleh raja semua orang makan kecuali syah naqsyband hal ini mendorong syaikh ul islam pada saat itu qutb ad din untuk bertanya
751411 jika ada keraguan mengenai kesucian makanan ini lebih baik berikan kepada fakir miskin kebutuhan mereka akan makanan akan membuatnya halal bagi mereka
751412 sebagian besar hari harinya dijalani dengan berpuasa jika seorang tamu mendatanginya dan beliau mempunyai sesuatu yang bisa ditawarkan kepadanya maka beliau akan duduk menemaninya membatalkan puasanya dan makan bersamanya beliau berkata kepada para pengikutnya bahwa para sahabat rasulullah saw biasa melakukan hal yang sama
751413 syaikh abul hasan al kharqani berkata dalam bukunya prinsip prinsip thariqat dan prinsip prinsip dalam meraih makrifat jagalah keharmonisan dengan para sahabat tetapi tidak dalam berbuat dosa ini berarti bahwa jika engkau sedang berpuasa lalu ada seseorang yang berkunjung sebagai teman maka engkau harus duduk bersamanya dan makan bersamanya demi menjaga adab dalam berteman dengannya salah satu prinsip dalam puasa atau ibadah lainnya adalah menyembunyikan apa yang dilakukan oleh seseorang jika seseorang membukanya misalnya dengan berkata kepada tamunya bahwa dia sedang berpuasa maka kebanggaan bisa masuk ke dalam dirinya sehingga menghancurkan puasanya inilah alasan di balik prinsip tersebut
751414 suatu hari beliau diberikan seekor ikan yang telah dimasak sebagai hadiah
751415 bagaimana jika aku memberimu salah satu di antara hari hariku di bulan ramadhan maukah engkau duduk dan makan
751416 insiden yang dirujuk oleh syah naqsyband terjadi ketika syaikh abu turab an naqsybandi mengunjungi bayazid al bistami
751417 makanlah dan allah akan memberimu pahala puasa selama satu tahun
751418 ayo makan aku akan berdoa kepada allah agar dia memberimu pahala dua tahun puasa
751419 keadaan syah naqsyband berada di luar jangkauan untuk dilukiskan dan tingkat pengetahuannya pun tidak dapat dilukiskan salah satu keajaiban terbesarnya adalah eksistensinya itu sendiri beliau sering menyembunyikan tindakannya dengan tidak memperlihatkan kekuatan ajaibnya namun demikian banyak keajaibannya yang tercatat
751420 syah naqsyband berkata suatu hari aku pergi bersama muhammad zahid ke gurun
751421 dia bertanya kepadaku wahai syaikhku sampai batas mana yang bisa dicapai oleh ibadah aku berkata ibadah mencapai tingkat kesempurnaan di mana orang yang beribadah dapat berkata kepada seseorang meninggal dan orang itu akan meninggal tanpa sadar aku menunjuk pada muhammad zahid dengan segera dia meninggal dia berada dalam keadaan meninggal sejak matahari terbit hingga tengah hari hari itu sangat panas aku merasa cemas karena tubuhnya menjadi rusak akibat panas yang berlebihan aku menariknya ke bawah bayangan pohon dan aku duduk di sana merenungkan persoalan ini ketika aku merenung sebuah inspirasi dari hadirat ilahi masuk ke dalam hatiku dan mengatakan kepadaku agar berkata kepadanya wahai muhammad hiduplah aku mengucapkannya 3 kali hasilnya jiwanya mulai memasuki tubuhnya dan kehidupan mulai kembali lagi padanya secara perlahan dia kembali ke keadaan semula aku pergi ke syaikhku dan menceritakan apa yang terjadi beliau berkata wahai anakku allah memberimu suatu rahasia yang belum pernah diberikan kepada orang lain
751422 syaikh alauddin al attar berkata suatu ketika raja transoxiana sultan abdullah kazgan datang ke bukhara beliau memutuskan untuk berburu di sekitar bukhara dan banyak orang yang menemaninya syah bahauddan naqsyband berada di desa sekitar ketika orang pergi berburu syah naqsyband pergi ke puncak bukit dan duduk di sana ketika beliau sedang duduk di sana dalam benaknya terlintas pikiran bahwa allah memberikan kemuliaan yang berlimpah kepada para awliya karena kemuliaan itu semua raja di dunia ini akan membungkuk kepada mereka belum lagi pikiran itu hilang dari hatinya seorang penunggang kuda dengan mahkota di kepalanya seperti seorang raja datang ke hadiratnya dan turun dari kudanya dengan rendah hati dia menyalami syah naqsyband dan berdiri di hadiratnya dengan sangat sopan dia membungkuk di hadapan syaikh tetapi syaikh tidak menoleh kepadanya beliau membiarkannya berdiri selama satu jam akhirnya syah naqsyband melihatnya dan berkata apa yang engkau lakukan di sini dia berkata aku seorang raja sultan kazgan aku sedang pergi berburu dan aku mencium aroma yang sangat indah aku mengikutinya ke sini dan aku menemukan engkau duduk di tengah cahaya yang sangat kuat pikirannya yang tadi semua raja di dunia ini akan membungkuk kepada para awliya langsung menjadi kenyataan itulah bagaimana allah memuliakan pikiran para awliya nya
751423 syaikh alauddin attar berkata syaikh syah naqsyband suatu kali duduk di sebuah asosiasi yang besar di bukhara dan berbicara mengenai pembukaan tabir pandangan spiritual beliau berkata sahabat terbaikku mawla arif yang berada di khwarazm 400 mil dari bukhara telah meninggalkan khwarazm untuk gedung pemerintah dan beliau sampai di stasiun kereta berkuda ketika beliau sampai di stasiun tersebut beliau tinggal di sana untuk beberapa saat dan sekarang kembali lagi ke rumahnya di khwarazm beliau tidak melanjutkan perjalanannya ke saray inilah bagaimana seorang wali dapat melihat dalam maqam pengetahuannya spiritualnya setiap orang kaget mendengar cerita ini tetapi kami semua tahu bahwa beliau adalah seorang wali besar maka kami mencatat waktu dan harinya suatu hari mawla arif datang dari khwarazm ke bukhara dan kami memberitahu dia mengenai kejadian itu dia sangat kaget dan berkata sebenarnya itulah kejadian yang sesungguhnya
751424 syaikh muhammad zahid berkata di awal perjalananku dalam thariqat ini aku duduk di sampingnya suatu hari di musim semi sebuah keinginan akan semangka masuk ke dalam hatiku beliau melihatku dan berkata muhammad zahid pergilah ke sungai di dekat kita itu dan bawakan kepada kita apa yang engkau lihat dan kita akan memakannya dengan segera aku pergi ke sungai itu airnya sangat dingin aku menyelam ke dalamnya dan menemukan sebuah semangka di bawah air sangat segar seolah olah baru saja dipotong dari dahannya aku sangat bergembira dan aku mengambilnya dan berkata wahai syaikhku terimalah aku
751425 beliau berkata kepadaku wahai saudaraku bila engkau pergi mengunjungi syaikh atau ketika engkau duduk di tengah kehadiran syaikh berhati hatilah agar jangan meletakkan kakimu sedemikian rupa sehingga kakimu menghadap ke arahnya
751426 apa pun rahasia yang kumiliki telah kuberikan kepada deputiku isma il ash shirwani siapa saja yang tidak menerimanya berarti bukan golonganku jangan berargumen tetapi satukanlah pikiranmu dan ikuti pendapat syaikh isma il aku menjamin siapa pun yang mengikutinya akan bersamaku dan bersama rasulullah
751427 beliau memerintahkan mereka untuk tidak menangisinya dan meminta mereka untuk mengorbankan hewan dan memberi makan orang miskin demi kecintaan allah dan kemuliaan syaikh
751428 beliau juga meminta mereka untuk mengirimkan hadiah berupa pembacaan dan bacaan dalam shalat
751429 setelah shalat isya syaikh khalid memasuki rumahnya memanggil seluruh anggota keluarganya dan berkata kepada mereka
751430 tidak ada yang boleh memasuki kamarku kecuali orang yang telah kuperintahkan
751431 aku telah terkena wabah penyakit aku membawa semua wabah yang menyerang damaskus
751432 siapa pun yang terkena wabah itu biarkan wabah itu mengenaiku dan bebaskan orang orang di syam
751433 allah telah menjawab doaku aku akan membawa semua wabah yang melanda orang orang di syam dan aku sendiri akan meninggal dunia pada hari jumat
751434 aku meninggalkan dunia ini untuk bertemu allah aku telah bersedia menanggung wabah dan membebaskan orang orang di syam yang telah terkena wabah itu aku akan meninggal dunia pada hari jumat
751435 jika seseorang mengabdikan dirinya kepada allah swt kebaikan pertama yang ia dapatkan adalah bahwa ia tidak lagi membutuhkan manusia
751436 siapa pun yang mendengar kata kata bijak namun tidak mengamalkannya ia termasuk munafik
751437 allah memberikan hamba nya kenikmatan dalam berdzikir jika seseorang bersyukur kepada nya dan merasa sengan dengan hal itu allah akan membuatnya dekat dengan nya jika orang itu tidak bersyukur kepada nya dan senang dengan hal itu dia akan menerima kenikmatan dari berdzikir itu tetapi hanya meninggalkannya di lidahnya
751438 sufisme adalah kemurnian dia bukan suatu deskripsi dia adalah kebenaran tanpa akhir bagaikan sungai mawar merah
751439 siapa pun yang memilih berteman dengan orang kaya dan meninggalkan orang miskin allah akan membuat hatinya mati
751440 suatu hari syaikh isma il yang sedang berada di masjid mengamati seorang miskin yang belum makan minum dan tidur
751441 yaa allah ini adalah hamba mu yang belum makan selama 3 hari aku mohon berilah ia makanan yang engkau perkenankan untuknya
751442 istri saya sakit dan saya bersumpah untuk memberi makan orang miskin agar istri saya diberkati saya telah membawa roti hangat dan beberapa makanan untuk diberikan kepada yang lapar
751443 wahai egoku aku marah terhadapmu aku akan melemparkanmu ke dalam kesulitan beliau lalu pergi ke pegunungan di daghestan dan berbaring di mulut gua di mana terdapat 2 ekor singa keduanya tidak bergerak dan kita yang mengikutnya sangat heran lalu singa jantan mendekati beliau dengan sekerat daging yang besar di mulutnya dan duduk jauh darinya tidak mendekat namun hanya mengamatinya lalu singa betina mendekatinya dengan sedikit daging di mulutnya dia mulai menangis dan mengaum singa jantan mendekati si betina dan menghentikan tangisannya mereka berdua duduk memperhatikan syaikh lalu singa jantan mengambil dua ekor anaknya dan menyerahkannya kepada ibunya sementara itu dia mendekati syaikh ismail
751444 wahai abu said allah mempunyai dua jalan pengajaran jalan yang biasa dan yang istimewa
751445 tidak pernah matahari menyinari seseorang lebih terang daripada abu bakar kecuali dia seorang nabi
751446 tak satu pun yang diturunkan kepadaku yang tidak kuberikan ke dalam hati abu bakar
751447 tidak ada seseorang pun di mana aku mempunyai kewajiban tetapi tidak perlu membayar utangku kembali kecuali abu bakar karena aku berhutang banyak kepadanya dan allah akan menggantinya di hari pembalasan nanti
751448 jika aku akan mengangkat seorang sahabat karib khalil selain tuhanku aku akan memilih abu bakar
751449 abu bakar tidak mendahuluimu karena banyak melakukan shalat atau puasa tetapi karena rahasia yang ada dalam hatinya
751450 jika seseorang melakukan perjalanan untuk mencari ilmu allah akan membuatnya berjalan di salah satu dari jalan jalan surga dan para malaikat akan merendahkan sayap mereka karena bahagia dan gembira pada ia yang mencari ilmu dan para penduduk langit dan bumi serta ikan ikan di kedalaman lautan akan memohonkan ampunan bagi seorang pencari ilmu keutamaan dari seorang yang berilmu atas orang beriman kebanyakan adalah bagaikan terangnya bulan purnama di kegelapan malam atas segenap bintang gemintang ulama adalah pewaris pewaris para nabi dan para nabi tidaklah memiliki dinar maupun dirham mereka hanya meninggalkan ilmu dan pengetahuan dan ia yang mengambilnya sungguh telah mengambil bagian yang banyak

751464 when will microsoft take security seriously and clean up their act
751465 incidentally i find it disturbing that theres often little discipline in how managed locks like monitors are used these locks are so convenient particularly when exposed with language constructs like c lock and vb net synclock which handle backing out of the lock during exceptions that many developers ignore good hygiene when using them for example if code uses multiple locks then these locks should typically be ranked so that they are always acquired in a predictable order this is one common technique for avoiding deadlocks

751475 how dare you exclude transfolk that is just like excluding people of color from places because whites were uncomfortable
751476 people of color prefer to be subdivided from the largest catagory of humanity into a smaller catagory based on skin pigment and since they themselves approve of subdivision from some particular group for their own private reasons based on skin pigment then they cant really complain when some other people of color want to be subdivided from them for their own private reasons also based on skin pigment
751477 so if i understand you the hypocrisy comes from transgendered folk saying that they are a third gender or something like that but when they are exluded from from mich fest for not being women they complain that they are indeed women do i have that correct
751478 common sense says the only workable definition of a woman is a person who so defines herself
751479 are you sure that transfold already have full humanity status i thought the only people who had unquestionable full human status were white manly ablebodied wealthy heterosexual males
751480 1 no oppressed group has ever demanded anything other than full human rights but transfolk are not seeking full humanity for they already have that entitlement instead they want the right to be treated as a special class of human

751504 i dont know if i continue even today always liking myself but what i learned to do many years ago was to forgive myself it is very important for every human being to forgive herself or himself because if you live you will make mistakes it is inevitable but once you do and you see the mistake then you forgive yourself and say well if id known better id have done better thats all so you say to people who you think you may have injured im sorry and then you say to yourself im sorry if we all hold on to the mistake we cant see our own glory in the mirror because we have the mistake between our faces and the mirror we cant see what were capable of being you can ask forgiveness of others but in the end the real forgiveness is in ones own self i think that young men and women are so caught by the way they see themselves now mind you when a larger society sees them as unattractive as threats as too black or too white or too poor or too fat or too thin or too sexual or too asexual thats rough but you can overcome that the real difficulty is to overcome how you think about yourself if we dont have that we never grow we never learn and sure as hell we should never teach
751505 drawn the line at animals being raised in cruel conditions
751506 the tide of history is moving toward the protection of animal rights and the brutal conditions in which they are sometimes now raised will eventually be banned someday vegetarianism may even be the norm
751507 i think this is just one example of why john weaver hasnt been involved in this campaign for over a year
751508 whether the whole tone of this campaign on both sides has now deteriorated degenerated to a level that the american people could say a pox on both their houses
751509 well i think thats a lot of hyperactivity on the part of the media
751510 god is currently in her abstract period where she is contrasting with her more heavy handed work of a few thousand years ago audiences are smarter and more sophisticated today and god knows that she is creating mystery art that keeps that audience guessing is it a message from god or a stain on an underpass is it really the virgin mary this is more fun for everyone involved this is one of gods most brilliant works
751511 this is even more spectacular than her chiseling of mary on the tortilla chip a world renown piece that redefined art as we know it
751512 god seems to really have a thing for genitals i mean she put them on half the things she created

751562 it was building up in the first quarter and i had to go in the second quarter i had to go really bad
751563 kicker sandro deangelis suggested that i put on one of those capes to cover up
751564 i tried that and it didnt work performance anxiety there were 40 000 people there then i went to offensive lineman jay mcneil and he said take a knee behind a box if i hide myself with my back to the crowd i can do it but it didnt work either and one other guy just said to pee in my pants and i couldnt do that either
751565 the bathroom was full of people and i kind of expected the security guard to escort me to the front
751566 but he waited for me at the door and left me to go through the crowd some fan pushed me and i pushed him back i finally got in a stall and now theyre all chanting ri i i ders so then i really couldnt go so i said screw this i couldnt go there was a lot of pressure guys were looking over the stall it was nuts
751567 and i had the austin powers pee the longest pee ever and i thought i was good we had the coachs speech and i had another little pee to make sure everything was out and i thought i was fine well lo and behold come the fourth quarter my bladder is full again
751568 i had to do it when the defence is on the field
751569 i cant go when the offence is on because i might miss the snap for a punt and ive had many a nightmare about that too where i wake up hoping that i didnt miss a snap because im in the bathroom
751570 its hard to snap when youre thinking about the pressure in your bladder i just want to be comfortable
751571 well i just say kneel down on the sideline have a bunch of people cover you up and make it happen
751572 when you gotta go you gotta go right i mean theres one guy on our team and i wont mention any names who goes in his pants and thats just disgusting
751573 you cant be going out on the field saying oh man i gotta pee when you have a job to worry about i say hey were all adults do what you gotta do and just cover up as best you can you have to go on the field with a clear mind and an empty bladder

751595 theyre so right i mean if you try to do that try to play like the no 2 pick its just well its too much this is my first training camp and i dont know anything about anything
751596 but at training camp theres so little time and he understands that

751604 i played in these conditions all week so maybe i was more used to it
751605 there were lots of long long rallies which took a toll and we were both tired at the end
751606 in that situation most of the pitchers dont throw me inside but sliders away if he would have hit me with the first pitch i would have went to first base but three times were inside it seemed so obvious to me i just do what i needed to do
751607 at the end of the match there were some long long volleys that took a toll on both of us
751608 at the end of the match there were some long long volleys that took a toll on both of us
751609 i was kind of sweating it but im glad it went in
751610 i had a putt for what i thought would get me into a playoff
751611 i hit the best putt i could have hit without it going in
751612 salisbury universitys president removed her facebook profile after being questioned about unprofessional captions posted alongside photos on the web page
751613 i also looked at the dodgers schedule theyve got some tough games coming up this month but i think their september is pretty soft
751614 oftentimes there are teams down the stretch that seemingly dont have anything to play for that end up being every bit as dangerous or more dangerous because they are coming to the ballpark with nothing to lose you have to take every game as important regardless of who youre playing and what their record may be at that time
751615 in that situation most of the pitchers dont throw me inside but sliders away if he would have hit me with the first pitch i would have went to first base but three times were inside it seemed so obvious to me i just do what i needed to do
751616 when you punch the clock on him its like jeez its a great asset to have a catcher who can throw like that
751617 anything between 1 9 and 2 0 youll take if the pitcher is doing what hes supposed to be doing 1 87 thats getting down there in a hurry that will stop the running game i dont care who is on the mound
751618 it tells me our pitchers have sped up to home plate
751619 jake peavy josh banks and even c y have sped up
751620 this is nothing more than hes been throwing and he basically tells pitching coach rick honeycutt its a little tired but i can still pitch
751621 but once the little tired that resonates more for us than that i can still pitch we shut him down last night and im just glad we were able to have the other guys available to us
751622 weve got a great bullpen and they picked me up yesterday
751623 it could be if you think about it but youve just got to go out there and think about what youve got to do out there first pitch strikes and once you get ahead you try to get quick outs so you can be available a lot of days in the row
751624 i try to help out the team all year consistently
751625 now were not risking hurting myself and missing two weeks by taking the day off basically its a no win situation i missed one day come back and help the team again
751626 reggie jackson told me dont look behind you itll be too intimidating but now i have to look forward and this is more intimidating
751627 it has been a privilege for me to sit alongside dave
751628 when you listen to dave call a baseball game it brings you along on a wonderful nine inning ride
751629 you are the best fans in baseball make no mistake about it
751630 what comes to mind is get out the rye bread and the mustard grandma its grand salami time
751631 he loves the fans as much as the fans love him
751632 i was just interviewed on television and they said if you could say anything to the fans what would it be
751633 and i said six words and ill say them to you right now thank you thank you thank you
751634 i thought he threw the ball pretty well early down in the zone
751635 the fourth and fifth kind of took a lot out of him he got the ball up in the strike zone and still made some good pitches to get out of that fourth and fifth inning they got the pitch count up pretty high so we decided to go to the pen
751636 those are some big situations and obviously that team can hit so you dont want to make a mistake i might have been too fine thats why i made so many pitches but youve got to be tough with those guys
751637 the bullpen has actually stepped up and done their part
751638 im just glad i can contribute any way i can im a ground ball pitcher i can come in situations where we need a ground ball double play and ive done that ive played a lot of roles the guys that we have the veteran guys are helping out the younger guys and picking each other up
751639 my plan today was actually to play mark loretta if he had been physically able but i do like the matchup with ty
751640 he usually jumps on a guy that has a pretty good fastball and today he put a good swing on a pretty good slider for a home run the next time i think he hit a fastball for a base hit tys been swinging the bat real well for us
751641 as erstad rounded second he actually ran into the infielder but the umpires all missed it
751642 those things happen sometimes its better that they happen when youre up rather than trying to chase a club we had some big base hits there in the fourth and they all came on two outs thats what we needed
751643 the key to this series was our pitching our bullpen was absolutely fantastic and the starters were just as good they matched theirs
751644 we have to make sure hes not going to have a recurrence of the elbow thing
751645 i didnt picture the home run in there but its all right
751646 it wasnt that weird because ive never done it before
751647 if it was something i had done before and i was waiting on the opportunity to do it again waiting that long might have been a little different but i just took it like i was another reliever
751648 i told him in spring training that i expected him to be a closer in two years
751649 thats what my expectations were and it just happened faster
751650 id love to be a closer five years down the road
751651 when i made the switch to the bullpen i thought this year id probably be a long relief guy and that might end up being my role forever you never know whats gonna happen
751652 they know that its coming and still miss thats how good you know it is
751653 weve just got to come out and continue playing good baseball
751654 we definitely had some opportunities we really didnt take advantage of them
751655 but i feel real confident that well turn this around and swing the bats the way were capable of
751656 we dont want to be scoreboard watching later on we dont want to wait til september to make our move we have to push ourselves and get it going again
751657 we should be ok some of the guys i wont say they were pressing but in situations we werent getting hits
751658 weve got to find a way to get better at that
751659 their bullpen came in and it seemed like this whole series they shut us down
751660 hes improved so much his arm strength you know its not what it was before he first got hurt but it was pretty close
751661 we made him work a little bit there in the middle innings but we didnt take advantage of it that was really the difference for us
751662 thats a good start to having him back in the rotation
751663 in the fifth inning and sixth inning i got the ball up a little bit
751664 they made me pay they put some good swings on the ball
751665 i will also need for you to configure the asp back end for me as well

751667 were counseled to choose vegetarian sources of fat and protein
751668 most people associate an atkins diet with bacon butter and brie not a plant based diet
751669 this was not the traditional atkins diet dr agatston said
751670 a vegetarian avoids meat either for health or moral reasons but believes it is acceptable to eat animal by products such as eggs butter and cheese i m on atkins and i m vegetarian and it s working
751671 low fat diets dont work is ridiculous at best purposely misleading and biased more likely
751672 low fat plans are notoriously difficult to follow which is a major reason why these diets fail
751673 between 1994 and 2000 two observational studies of forty seven thousand male health professionals and the eighty nine thousand women of the nurses health study both run out of the harvard school of public health and a half dozen randomized control trials concluded that fiber consumption is unrelated to the risk of colon cancer as is apparently the consumption of fruits and vegetables
751674 a high fiber high color right fat vegan diet that supports healthy weight management
751675 a recent study funded by the atkins foundation attempts to compare the atkins low carbohydrate eating plan against two other diets
751676 cholesterol and saturated fat wont kill you but too many carbs may
751677 the men in the study reported consuming an average of 1800 calories a day yet only lost about 10 pounds each if that was the truth there d be an energy deficit of about 30 pounds over 2 years a pretty good number for weight loss actually that that did not happen likely means the the dieters were lying
751678 adding 3500 extra calories to the diet produces 1 extra pound of fat
751679 atkins diet is generally used for a carbohydrate restricted diet
751680 participants were counseled to choose vegetarian sources of fat and protein
751681 i am surprised that none of the bloggers to date has referenced the seminal book good calories vs bad calories by taubes
751682 among the 36 subjects with diabetes changes in fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels were more favorable among those assigned to the mediterranean diet than among those assigned to the low fat diet p
751683 eat less food mostly plants choose food from the outer edges of the supermarket meaning usually fresh whole foods
751684 was it really the atkins diet where was the bacon
751685 34 when farmers want to creat a fatty duck or goose liver they force feed grain not fat well dr you really know nothing about fowl it seems guess what they eat naturally not fat for sure they eat grains the fatty livers come from overfeeding
751686 vegetarian fed cage free chickens the cage free is quite nice but chickens are being forced to eat a diet based on humans own stupid eating and moral codes not because they would choose to be vegetarian
751687 i don t the suppose the fact that our bodies require carbohydrates means anything to anyone we run primarily on carbohydrates so a low carb diet is silly
751688 mediterranean and low carbohydrate diets may be effective alternatives to low fat diets the more favorable effects on lipids with the low carb diet and on glycemic control with the med diet suggest that personal preferences and metabolic considerations might inform individualized tailoring of dietary interventions
751689 conclusions high protein intake was not associated with renal function decline in women with normal renal function
751690 research has shown that different genetics determine which diet is best other than the benefit of healthy fats esp omega 3s and monounsaturates and of course sensible carbs little can be said about which diet will be best for an individual w out genetic testing or trial and error
751691 dont presume you know the arguments of the opposition until you know for a fact what youre talking about
751692 if data exists showing that a ketogenic diet may be efficacious in the treatment of so many disorders is it unreasonable to speculate that excess carbohydrate consumption should be avoided is it unreasonable to wonder whether the advocates of a low fat diet have done more harm than good
751693 in my view this is highly revisionist i don t care if the participants read atkins they were counseled to eat vegetarian sources of protein and remember the counseling was a big part of this diet regular phone calls and meetings with dietitians why did the researchers say this in a peer reviewed paper if it wasn t true i think the disclosure in the original nejm paper is far more credible

751726 the market demand will be there but there are a lot of mortgage initiation issues that have to be dealt with lenders are not going to offer this unless its a profitable product
751727 with the previous automatic rate cut mortgages the problem was that they never figured out how to finance the mortgages
751728 ours is built upon the rate reducing future of the mortgage and the instrument that funds the mortgage as the interest rate clicks down on the mortgage the interest will also click down on the funding instrument
751729 the amount of refinance activity goes up when rates fall and goes down when rates rise
751730 what the ratchet mortgage does is mimic that in a more efficient fashion when rates start going down it would go down and when rates start going up it would stay the same which is the same as people saying i dont think ill refinance now because rates are high

751812 damon made attempts to refer to some interesting theory esque threads in digital media studies but ultimately he came across as someone who has perhaps read some fancy terms before but is clueless when it comes to how to use them he may actually have known what he was saying and it could have been a problem with nerves in front of a crowd but to me it seemed like he needs to do a lot more research as for petra i really do like her work and think what she s doing is significant in the trajectory sorry tim of net art sorry again after hearing her speak however it seems like she should leave the analysis of her work to others
751813 the multitude is united by the risk which derives from not feeling at home from being exposed omnilaterally to the world
751814 if it is certain that postfordist labor has at its center communication culture in the most full sense of the term then it is necessary to commence analysis starting from certain emotions but not emotions in the psychological sense but rather emotions understood as forms of being forms of being in the world and we began to discuss the negative feelings before all others opportunism later cynicism and finally fear we believed that opportunism understood as mass emotion signified that each individual worked in contact with many distinct opportunities opportunites understood in a technical sense

751822 we all live in hiding in one way or another each of us conceals pieces of ourselves from the rest of the world some people hide because their lives depend on it others because they dont like being seen and then there are other special cases the ones who hide because because because they just want somebody to care enough to look for them
751823 then the man and his wife heard the sound of the lord god as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day and they hid from the lord god among the trees of the garden

751835 subjectivities used to be the inner sanctum where social sciences had to stop and dismount in order to shift to other less reliable vehicles it is now possible to follow how the characters of a reality show or the finalists of star academy have so modified the ways and means with which their viewers speak and think about the world that the social has become so to speak continuous with the psychological

751869 last night my father was moved to a neurosurgical unit in a far away hospital far away makes it sound like some fairy tale and yesterday began with such hope even thoughts of happy endings wed rang the ward to be told that my father had enjoyed a comfortable night my mother and my sister went to visit him yesterday afternoon to take him his medication his slippers his newspaper the nurse told them that he was fine but we havent been able to wake him doctors spoke of a severe infection so my mother and sister sat with him for an hour talking to him as my father squeezed their hands though he seemed to be in the deepest sleep like a fairy tale too i suppose last night they were called back to the hospital when my mother rang to tell me that my dad had suffered serious bleeding to the brain i broke down in my girlfriends arms ive never known such pain my sister who has found such strength such calm said to me last night or early this morning let your writing get you through this i didnt know then as i dont know now it felt like something i would never do have an overly sentimental reaction to an event of such profound emotional significance yet i woke up this morning at dawn crying again writing this is the only way i can make it stop for however short a time waking up there was no sudden moment of recollection i had feared that i would emerge from sleep having forgotten the last 48 hours i didnt want to be subjected to the renewed sense of desolation instead there was just the profoundest sadness and this voice this voice that so often writes inside my head and makes me happy by phrasing phrases parsing sentences writing jokes constructing stories its like another version of me but more self assured in control of his emotions i wanted him to step in and help me for a time i wanted him to help me overcome the pain im suffering this morning i havent stopped crying for 24 hours i dont know whats becoming of me my father is the kindest man ive ever known the gentlest too the perfect neighbour hes the man that everybody would turn to for help and he would gladly give it he had a tool for every job his shed a shrine to the post war make do mentality with pieces of bent metal to get through every blocked drain or wall cavity imaginable he has tools with handles hes fashioned out of other tools cable he has hoarded for the next electrical emergency hes the man who at the height of summer would spend hours in the front garden and talk to anybody who walked past he loves to talk he loves people he believes that people are good and that the world is good yet for the last fifteen years hes been in such pain that it changed his character it made it so much harder that we are too much alike my mother says thats why wed so often clash our relationship is complex i share his love of laughter his interest in books and science his fascination with how things work i hope i also share his decency yet i only ever wanted to make him proud he was probably the only man who willingly chose to read my ph d thesis though i think most of it was lost to him as it was probably lost on me he loved poetry but not i suppose reading about poetry and a deep hurt this morning among so many deep hurts is knowing that he never got to read my first novel i thought having my book cancelled weeks before publication was the worst thing that could happen to me this year i hadnt shown him the book because i wanted to wait until it was really a book published his family name on the cover yet now it means nothing except i can still hear my fathers laughter and i live in the hope that i might hear it again so im writing this and i dont know if ill really post something so personal i dont know if i want these horrible unstructured words to represent all that im feeling because they dont but when i write i do have a sense of something greater than my pain i dont mean to make people pity me or perhaps i do and that also troubles me why share this why talk about this perhaps i want reassurance i need to know that on the other side of this is a life ill be happy to live that ill still have a chance to write to be the man my father made me yet it sickens me to think that im even thinking of myself that i cannot be strong that i simply cannot stop crying

751883 he said you always have to stop and fill those things out i remember saying to him when i win this trip to china maybe i ll take you and then when we got that letter it blew my mind
751884 but we re not allowed to use another internet company on base it s a monopoly
751885 they re not in very good condition and they re not cost effective
751886 you re looking at roughly 5 or 6 million dollars a year to keep kamiseya open

751888 you just let a natural course of events dictate how the installation is going to be emptied
751889 being a bodybuilder you re visible it attracts a lot of positive attention from motivated individuals who would be great for the navy
751890 there aren t too many in the military who compete at this level
751891 if there are obstacles i ask myself what positives i can take from this it s a mind game turning negatives into positives maybe it s a message that i need to take a few days break from training
751892 maybe your work comes first your social life may be on hold you have to prioritize things in life

751903 when you join the military they promise they ll always take care of you but when you retire you feel like a hot potato
751904 we don t expect them to help us for everything
751905 but when it is something major and you really need something they should at least see the ex soldiers
751906 u s army doctors and dentists have told us that their staffing is based only on people in uniform
751907 retired servicemembers over here should not expect to be able to get into the military health system
751908 i ve had several retirees tell me they can t make it here anymore

751922 theyre so right i mean if you try to do that try to play like the no 2 pick its just well its too much this is my first training camp and i dont know anything about anything
751923 but at training camp theres so little time and he understands that
751924 basically unless i initiate it he tries to pretty much leave me alone but hes there whenever i need him for advice or whatever
751925 will welcome favre back and turn this situation to our advantage
751926 will talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
751927 i dont know how this will be resolved yet i do know if i am going to play this year i need to get in camp i would love to play again
751928 my intentions have always been to play for green bay why wouldnt i want to play in green bay they have as good a chance to win the super bowl as anyone
751929 hes ready to go in there and be a part of that team
751930 they cannot sell anything with my name on it thats a big deal to them its just like an endorsement with nike we have been working on that deal for some time
751931 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
751932 when art and darrell see all the burgundy and gold in the crowd how can they not get choked up
751933 we came for art we said that if he ever got in wed be here
751934 as great as this honor is its not what defines who i am or what ive been able to accomplish in my life
751935 but more than anything art and darrell epitomized what being a washington redskin is all about
751936 im already late for work i better just keep on going
751937 should i ever run again was this a sign of aging and loss of balance what will david say when i tell him why did that fall happen anyway i am going to go back and look at the spot what have i done to my recent finger repair that hand plant surely stretched the tendon way further than it might have been ready for roz told me to wear a splint and keep my arm inactive because its those unforeseen accidents that could undo the whole surgery i need to ice my face and knees i need to cleanse out the road side mess from my hands this is what i get for not training regularly
751938 do me a favor and always wear a fanny pack and take your cell phone with you
751939 be accepted and that in consideration of his zeal illustrious family and connexions he have the rank and commission of major general of the united states
751940 submit to me as soon as possible a general plan of the administrative material and financial measures necessary for carrying out the desired final solution of the jewish question
751941 i was out trying to stop the traffic saying you cant go we have a bull on the loose but they werent co operative at all
751942 hes not injured at all but his nose is a bit sore from when he trod on his nose lead
751943 its a sluggish economy and its difficulties are felt all over
751944 that does suggest those folks are important for the spending outlook and the overall economic outlook
751945 a lot of our clients stop by a deli on the way to the airport rather than have a catered meal on the plane
751946 were down to a total of two crews for three airplanes
751947 we face a very different environment for luxury indulgence in 2008 as compared to 2007
751948 a very difficult marketplace for luxury goods over the next five years
751949 people are examining do you keep the yacht do you go to the classic car auction do you take the private jet
751950 those sound like nice problems to have but at the same time they are issues
751951 the high end buyers out there are maybe more selective now but im willing to wait out the storm
751952 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
751953 and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next
751954 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it
751955 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
751956 the truth is that most of us most of the time have vastly more processing power than we need
751957 a written notification from the uspto that a specific mark has survived the opposition period following publication in the official gazette and has consequently been allowed for registration it does not mean that the mark has registered yet receiving a notice of allowance is another step on the way to registration

751962 for those of us who believe in protecting the integrity of our religious institutions this is a fundamental right
751963 i had sweaty hands and feet as a child then it started affecting my whole body at puberty because my father has it mildly and my sister has it on her hands and feet we never talked about it we all just got on with it
751964 the weird thing is my hands and feet are pouring with sweat but they are icy cold its clammy around my face and the back of my neck and my hands and feet drip talking and thinking about it brings it on if i know i have to stand in a queue i will start sweating
751965 i told him straight away about the sweating because i always have to say oh sorry i have really sweaty hands whenever i shake hands with a new person it doesnt bother him in the slightest we have seven year old twins and they comment about mummys sweaty hands but they are quite happy to hold them
751966 i have to accept that i am just going to feel like a sponge the whole time im there
751967 but back here in the local markets im fine my stall is my space where i feel confident and i dont have to do very much that involves interacting with people i once ruined a job interview because i was wearing clothes that showed up my sweat and i started worrying so much about it that i got really flustered there are so many hang ups about sweating people associate it with being dirty or smelly
751968 you grow up with it and you think there are just so many things that are so much worse that people need proper medical treatment for
751969 were the sort of family that doesnt make a fuss my father would always say there are much worse things we could have he would never have dreamt of getting treatment for it i think i felt a bit guilty or self indulgent for worrying about it
751970 i can sweat all day and in the evening there is no smell its almost like water
751971 i dont want them to have to go through all this and thats made me realise that i dont want to go through it any more either
751972 one of the best moments of my police career was getting to tell sandra boss that we recovered her daughter and she actually collapsed in my arms i actually caught her before she hit the ground
751973 she was happy playing in the back what she was actually saying i cant quote exactly but kinda like i love you too much daddy and hed say i love you even more
751974 i went to the police station i was there for 2 hours i basically told them what he told me he was going to do but nobody knew for sure because he could have been feeding me lies
751975 her first words were she was very happy to see very nice people she was ecstatic
751976 all of a sudden i could hear my wife screaming her head off
751977 i thought there must be a snake or something i went to be confronted by this guy running round like sheet lightning with a gun then it was simply horrific
751978 he made me lie down and made my wife tie me up with ribbon from the curtains this bloke was not on drugs he was quite calm and articulate he took my wife into the kitchen i could hear her saying not that not that at that point he had only touched her
751979 i am not a religious person but my mother died a few years ago and i said mum please help me
751980 i then heard this enormous crack and my husband was sniffling and snorting
751981 the chap said to me would you like me to kill him for you i was terribly british and i said no i would rather you didnt no thank you
751982 he raped me all the time i was concerned that my husband wouldnt see what was going on i was just saying to him stay down stay down the robber then finished what he was doing i didnt dare make eye contact

751987 the past few days havent exactly been the labour partys best we have not exactly covered ourselves in glory with some unedifying behaviour by senior members of the party
751988 even if these werent to be fights to the death it is still risky to have a child of 30kg 4 5st coming face to face with an animal of 200kg
751989 its like asking a child whos good at football not to play
751990 the aca which is behind this ban has declared war on the bullfighting world were going to have to fight back
751991 this is because he is more media friendly than the others
751992 beyond the risk that such a young child is taking
751993 it is unacceptable for him to be so used to the trivialisation of cruelty
751994 in order to be a well rounded individual one must know a little of everything
751995 the measure of a minds evolution is its acceptance of the unacceptable

751998 im in a good mood tonight just a little paranoid thinking that there was alcohol in my lemonade and my mom is trying to ge me to drink alcohol or something today there was a columbian woman who came over with her daughter and my moms cousin she reminded me a lot of my tenants mom and i think it was i dunno maybe columbians look a lot like maybe they were twins separated at birth but she looked just like her

752013 in response to the new premiums some beneficiaries would not apply for medicaid would leave the program or would become ineligible due to nonpayment
752014 c b o estimates that about 45 000 enrollees would lose coverage in fiscal year 2010 and that 65 000 would lose coverage in fiscal year 2015 because of the imposition of premiums about 60 percent of those losing coverage would be children
752015 about one third of those affected would be children and almost half would be individuals with income below the poverty level

752017 an environmental policy that transforms the economy by shifting billions of dollars from the consumption of fossil fuels to alternative energy sources
752018 if we have more nato troops in afghanistan then thats potentially fewer american troops over the long term
752019 which means were spending fewer billions of dollars which means we can invest those billions of dollars in making sure were providing tax cuts to middle class families who are struggling with higher gas prices
752020 i submit that the lords of capital and their servants today as in 2003 understand perfectly well that the system they oversee cannot long exist under the current paths of world development that their only hope to perpetuate themselves into future decades is to violently upset the planetary game board as often as necessary from the financial oligarchys perspective the death of the world as they know and possess it their world is imminent and can only be avoided through acts of horrific aggression terror and barbaric reversion to primitive modes of accumulation i e brute theft and pillage

752023 barack obama is ultimately articulating a position of sustained troop levels in iraq based on the conditions on the ground and the security of the country that is the very same position that john mccain has long held
752024 be realistic comrade we can remove our combat troops when conditions and security of the country make it possible
752025 i think were literally running the risk of unintentionally doing what the russians did
752026 well if mccain is president and if his secretary of state is joe lieberman and his secretary of defense is rudolph giuliani we will be moving towards world war iv if its richard armitage or if it were to be brent scowcroft i think it would be very different
752027 republicans move toward neocon ish formulas and democrats follow idealistically escapist formulas in either case you dont end up with the necessary mix of idealism and realism
752028 however brzezinski noted that just as the soviets were able to delude themselves that they had a loyal army of communist sympathizers who would transform the country

752041 an attack on iran will most likely lead to great carnage in the middle east and beyond as supporters of iran resort to suicide bombings in retaliation
752042 yet the plain fact is that nuclear bombs in the hands of a regime which openly declares its desire to destroy israel are not something israel will peacefully tolerate they will act to stop it while it can still be stopped without the risk of a nuclear strike against israel
752043 the harsh truth is that there is good reason for israel to make a precipitate strike at iranian nuclear capacity
752044 we do not advocate an israeli attack on iran nor will we endorse it or take political responsibility for it but if the israeli air force attempts to stop iran developing the capacity to wipe it out with a nuclear bomb in the name of what alternative would we condemn israel
752045 our point of view is not that of israeli or any other nationalism we want israeli palestinian iranian and other workers to unite and fight for a socialist middle east

752071 should texas execute mr medellin before congress has a reasonable opportunity to convert the icj judgment into a justifiable federal right the state of texas will forever deprive mr medellin of his constitutionally protected right not to be deprived of his life without a due process of law

752073 executing world court would be a major step backward for the rule of law
752074 its too big the food isnt good the people arent right
752075 yeah of course i was very happy like you mentioned there have been various incidents this year and we have been in the position after saturday quite a few times to fight for the victory but always something has gone wrong and it hasnt functioned perfectly today obviously i knew massa and lewis were both very fast at the beginning of the race but half way through the race i felt it was starting to work for me a little bit better and then at the end i just tried to put pressure on massa and hoped something would happen and obviously it looked like he had a mechanical failure so it all worked fine for me today and i am very very happy about it all the hard work that the whole team has put in the last few months through difficult times we just kept pushing and it is very respectable and i am very very glad to score my first victory
752076 it is difficult to say what he was doing i was catching him quite a big chunk every lap and the target was to try and put pressure on him and take all the power from his engine and everything i could do to put pressure on him like you said my car felt particularly good on the last stint the first two stints i was a little bit cautious earlier this year i have had some troubles with the tyre degradation and i was worried if i crossed that edge again i might start to struggle i just kept my own pace and then in the last stint it all worked fine for me
752077 it is fantastic it is a great moment of course it is a moment i have been targeting for many many years now since i started to get an idea about the possibility of becoming an f1 driver i started to work hard and improve my fitness i have spent a lot of time to achieve this goal so to finally achieve it is very pleasing hopefully this is the first of many at the moment we just need to keep the concentration have a little break and try to maximise this break and then go to the next round and try to repeat it
752078 it is just unbelievable i couldnt believe it when i saw felipes engine going and i knew that i was p2 i got the pressure from kimi and with the soft tyres at the end i was struggling quite a lot but we knew that on friday that the soft tyres would be difficult but in the end it is just unbelievable after the race in hockenheim where we had a good race pace and the big crash now we have come to budapest and just kept the speed there and just had a really good car from friday onwards we never really made a big change on the car and it was just perfect until the last stint with soft tyres which was a bit tricky but its unbelievable i am in my first year with just half of the season over and i am on the podium it is just a perfect weekend
752079 i mean i had to improve myself a little bit in terms of the start as my reaction time was not perfect in the first couple of races i just improved myself on it i think the start time was really really good and i could out accelerate robert and i had a good first corner the last stint when i saw i was nine seconds in front of kimi i had a reasonable pace but they told me he was five tenths quicker per lap i just tried to push more and more and i just destroyed the tyre every time so i had to really focus on the tyres and just keep it easy keep it cool and not be under too much pressure from kimi
752080 i knew from last year in gp2 when i was stuck in the middle of the field here i had a really fast car but i couldnt get past anybody and in f1 it is just more difficult when he was close to me i could see in the mirror that for two laps he couldnt catch up more so i thought okay no mistakes and keep it on the track and thats it
752081 yeah i think we could have managed to do the race a little bit better but we were stuck behind alonso all the way to the second stop then on the in lap i was eight tenths faster on my own but it was a bit late at that point but at least we had a good car and we got in front of him and i was able to catch timo but we needed to back off in the end we were a bit lucky with all of the other people going all over the place and ended up with most points of the first three guys in the championship i mean we have the speed in the race but if i cant get the qualifying right we are going to end up every race in the same situation like here and in the last race so we need to sort it out if we can be in the front then we can fight for wins but in this position when we are just following people then we cannot use the speed the guys did a good job but we just need to fix a few problems and for sure we can be back in the hunt for wins
752082 i was ready to try anything i dont really care if i had lost a win but unfortunately we needed to back off we were much faster like we were with alonso but it is so difficult if the guy in front does not make a mistake it is really really difficult to get past you need to get something very special in one corner to get close enough but at least we got him behind but unfortunately i could not try to pass him but third place in the end after what was a very difficult week for me was a good result
752083 i think it is still very very close and it is very difficult to draw any conclusions who is ahead it just depends whoever nails it on the day it is so sensitive at the moment that if you dont get the set up perfect and if you dont get the tyres feeling perfect and if you dont get your driving perfect there are going to be three or four guys ahead of you straight away i think it is quite interesting i think it is really spectacular for all the fans for us it puts a lot of pressure on everybody to maximise everything but it should be a very interesting end of the season with all the teams pushing very hard to see who comes out on top at the end
752084 it feels pretty good i could do it again it is not so bad of course i feel a little bit sorry for felipe and for lewis they both drove a great race but i know how it feels what happened to them today i had similar moments this year quite a few times but i tried to put pressure especially in the last stint on felipe trying to push him and maybe something would happen you never know when i saw the car on fire in the main straight with big smoke i thought it must be felipe but it is hard to believe after that of course there was no big rush anymore with three laps to go it was just a case of bringing it home in the end it is a great moment for myself and i am very happy it is a very happy moment for our team and i am looking forward to the rest of the season we are heading in the right direction and it is just a case now of keep pushing even through this brake a little bit and then try again next time
752085 yeah but obviously for myself it wasnt quite like that i just tried to keep it tidy and not make any mistakes and also the first two stints especially with the hard tyre i just tried to look after those tyres earlier this year there were quite a few times when i thought the tyres were dropping off as i was a little bit too hard on them so i tried not to go too much i just tried to go with the pace that i felt was available at that moment and just tried to increase it when i could then with the soft tyre at the end it felt particularly good and i felt confident to push and the tyre wasnt dropping off then when i tried to put pressure on felipe i was catching him and in the end it was over
752086 yeah i felt that it was a little bit slippery on my side and straight away i saw that lewis got a little jump on me and was a bit more ahead and then i saw felipe coming and there was nothing i could do i just sat back and saw that the guys behind me had also not got such a good start so i was on my own already after just 200 metres i was just trying to follow them into the first corner as it was quite possible something was going to happen as they were quite close to each other and they were locking wheels and everything but they drove fine and after that it was quite a long lonely race for myself i had a little problem with traffic in the middle of the race there were quite a few lapped cars and it is very difficult to get close enough here to indicate to them that we are behind and i had a little chat on the radio to get the blue flags out and those guys had to back off from quite a long distance but it is a problem with this circuit to get close enough and i lost quite a few seconds there but in the end it didnt matter too much
752087 no definitely not in this part of my first formula one season it is just unbelievable and i still cant believe it that we finished p2 after the crash in hockenheim it is just a perfect answer we had a good race pace in hockenheim and we knew that the car would be good here from the beginning the car was just like i needed it and the result shows whats possible when the car is right for me in the race itself i had a really good start i improved my reaction time quite a lot in the last couple of races and that was the key for the start today i had a mega start and i could go a good race pace especially on prime tyres we knew at the end with the soft tyres we would be struggling especially for myself the soft tyre was just really difficult to get a feeling for it when i saw nine seconds to kimi i thought okay i can keep a little bit better pace like 21 8 and 21 9 and maybe i could hold him off but i couldnt do 21 i was doing 22 2 or 22 middle and it was just too slow for kimi and he caught me up big time but i knew it would be really difficult to overtake here so i just tried to make no mistakes and stay in front of him and in the end p2 is just perfect for the team and really important for the constructors championship and it is really good
752088 the middle stint was pretty good i mean with the prime tyres the whole weekend we had a really good pace when heikki caught up the traffic i think a couple of laps later i had the same problem and like heikki said it is just really difficult to come close enough that they see the blue flags and move over that is a characteristic of the track and that made it a bit more difficult
752089 in hockenheim we had a pretty good car in terms of race pace i dont like an understeering car and that was the problem sometimes this season with the car a bit too much on the understeer side in hockenheim and here it just went more and more in my way my direction i can just put the car in the corner where i want and i think it just suits my driving style more thats what i showed here in qualifying and in the race as well
752090 we had a pretty fast car all the time felipe was very unlucky today for myself its been quite a disappointing weekend but in the end we got a pretty good result we have the speed in the race but if we cannot qualify we cannot use it and we saw that again today most of the race i was stuck behind alonso and once i got on my own i could go almost a second faster on my in lap we need to get something sorted and get in the front and then we can fight for wins for sure the car seems to be working well we just need to find a good set up again its been a bit difficult for me in the last few races but we are still in the championship so its not too bad
752091 yeah i think we could have managed to do it slightly better at the beginning of the race but in the end we thought its going to be close and we were probably going to stop on the same lap and i went off a little bit just before the pit stop luckily he alonso came in one lap earlier and i could go very fast on the in lap but the problem was that when i made a mistake i dropped off a little bit but i was fast enough to get in front of him we had a very good pit stop that was the big key point and then i was fast enough to catch up with timo but then i needed to slow down
752092 it was good all the time but its difficult to say with the harder tyres only the in lap was very good but i was like a second all the time behind alonso so you get the wrong idea from the car and you cannot use the speed when i was on my own the car was fast so we just need to get in the front in the first place to use the speed
752093 i saw him stop unfortunately on the main straight i didnt know what had happened but they told me that probably it was something do with the engine so they just said to take it a little bit easier
752094 it certainly wont make me any weaker it certainly doesnt do any harm of course this is something that weve been trying to do earlier this year it could have happened in many other races there was always an opportunity but it didnt happen we havent lost concentration weve kept the full motivation all the time and trying to improve and little by little get closer and today we had a little bit of luck on our side but certainly it wont do any harm for anyone in our team and not for myself either
752095 i asked what the problem was i felt that the fuel rig was not on perfectly but i didnt get an answer i was told we will discuss it after the race maybe i stopped a bit too far and they couldnt plug in the fuel rig we have to discuss it and analyse it but it cost us three or four seconds
752096 for myself it didnt disturb but its a challenge all the time its a tough race for sure but i dont feel it was limiting or slowing me down at all i felt i was well prepared for this one no problem
752097 the heat for me was no problem either i felt again a bit the problem i had in jerez with my stomach where i think i had some wrong food at the test and when i had drunk quite a lot throughout the race i had problems again with my stomach i was not feeling perfect after the race but the heat wasnt the biggest problem
752098 it was ok its harder for the cars for everybody but it was no problem
752099 as i mentioned the car was very good in the first practice on friday and when we keep it in that window through the weekend we should be well in the points i didnt expect a podium and i think the circumstances with felipe helped out a bit but then with lewis as well but you have to be there at that moment and you have to have the speed as well qualifying in q2 showed that we had a really really good car with the prime tyres and where i struggled a bit in q3 was to get the tyres up to temperature all the other cars had to go around really slowly on the out lap and i had to push quite a lot with the prime tyre to bring the tyres up to temperature in q3 unfortunately i did my quickest time with used tyres and with the new set i just couldnt get them up to temperature because robert kubica took an easy out lap and i had to back off but i think in qualifying we could have been one or two places further up the grid but in the end we finished on the podium and its just a perfect weekend completely unexpected from my side i didnt expect that in the first half of my first formula one season
752100 well of course in the last three laps there are not too many emotions just to bring it home obviously at that point i had no need any more that was the lap that i saw felipe blow up that was the last time i pushed and then after that i just started to save the engine and save everything and just bring it home of course im very very happy i know how hard weve worked and how hard the team has worked to bring forward upgrades for our car and we made some significant improvements in the last few months the last few races have been very strong not necessarily the results on my side but lewis has been strong and the car has been performing strongly talking to the team was a happy moment mainly because everyone has worked really hard i feel satisfied of course for myself to have achieved this result and regardless of circumstances in formula one you dont have any style points its ten points end of story its just a very happy moment and now im going to go for a little break and try to become better through this little break
752101 no no the crash from the press side of it was maybe too dramatic weve had other crashes like heikkis crash in barcelona or roberts last year there was a reason to discuss some things but my crash looked more spectacular than it was because on sunday night i was already happy to go back home again but they wouldnt let me go so i had to stay in hospital for one night i did my test at jerez for 78 laps without any problems and just caught the food poisoning or whatever it was at the test which i think cost me more energy than the crash in hockenheim
752102 for sure it was not the weekend that i was looking for we had good speed in the race but i made a mistake in qualifying and without it we should have been in a different position in the first place but the issue seems to be the qualifying the speed is there once we get in the front but if we are not there we cannot use it straightaway when i was on my own it was good but of course looking at all the problems staying behind the other cars all race long finishing in third so scoring more points than the guys in front of me in the championship is not too bad a result i take it any way i can get it we will see how we can sort things out for the next race and see if we can be stronger and fight for victory there are still many races to go were there in the championship so im not too worried about things it will be nice to go on holiday
752103 i havent seen my family i havent actually been in my real home in north finland for a long time i will go there at the end of next week i think i will celebrate the day with my people in suomussalmi village where im from i have a little karting race organised on saturday its a tradition it has already taken place for the last five or six years and i think now it will be a very special event having won this race its nice to go and see my people there perhaps we celebrate there a little bit with the suomussalmi people and with my family but then its back to business and even trying to get something out of the break i think we are going to do some fitness programme to push the fitness level up to get strong to get better and also spend a bit of time in woking talking to the engineers and preparing for the next race it doesnt change my world completely upside down even if there was a two month break now im happy about it but this is just part of the goal now the next goal is to repeat this and then after that to do it again so just need to keep up the concentration all the time
752104 it didnt really affect me too much today for sure we could have been fighting for victory but at least we got some good points today its mainly to get the car as we want you can easily see that in the race its not the problem but with new tyres its a bit the same issue as last year that it seems to be difficult to get one lap out of them and stay on the circuit so its probably more up to getting things right i think there will be races that will suit me better and some not we will see what happens in the next race
752105 i think the biggest improvement is that i have more grip in my car now compared to last year and the whole package is just more competitive i think as a driver im certainly a better driver compared to last year i have improved my driving technique i have improved the whole package the engineers are giving me feedback and im fitter compared to last year as well i think there is a lot more to come i think there is still a lot of work to be done and the next target has to be to do all these results consistently and without anyone blowing away we just go step by step theres no particular area that i want to improve we just try to work on every area little by little not to overshoot any area not to get any backfires
752106 yeah the first initial part was good but i decided to go on the inside and he pushed me a bit on the inside and i lost a place so it wasnt a very good start in the end unfortunately i was stuck behind alonso but thats life
752107 why are you reading that you are already worth more than any gem

752127 what really impressed me with this property and the rme team was the amount of information that was available to me before i actually clicked on a property i had all my due diligence done for me right there on the website

752234 it seems like another lifetime ago but remember all the fuss about michigan and florida
752235 in a letter today to committee officials mr obama asked that a resolution be passed to entitle each delegate from florida and michigan to cast a full vote
752236 the party must be united in the fall he said adding
752237 no nominee could afford to alienate the delegates and voters from two such important states
752238 by granting mr obamas request the party will essentially be giving a green light to other states to ignore the calendar next time because there will be no consequences
752239 back then during the primary season the obama camp was on the other side arguing that the two states broke the rules by moving up their primaries and should be punished
752240 the whole subject remains a sore point with some clinton supporters
752241 but mr obamas letter today seems timed to try to minimize any damage
752242 coming almost two months after mrs clinton threw her support to him and after it appears unlikely that she will be his choice for vice president

752363 and thats where the bedrooms are but we can see that later
752364 the kitchens back there but the cook clara can be a little witchy about trespassers
752365 besides my grandmother does not want her girls to spend much time in the kitchen anyway
752366 i dont imagine anyone is going to be exactly pigging out around here i mean arent we all supposed to become famous models or something
752367 well my grandmother did edit one of the biggest fashion magazines in the world but i dont think that means were all going to become famous models i know im not
752368 why not youve got the height the build and youre not half bad looking well other than the fact that you obviously have absolutely no style
752369 but then youve got your grandmother to straighten that out for you
752370 i think my grandmother will give up on me pretty soon especially when the others get here shell have girls with more promise to set her sights on
752371 and thats the sunroom or observatory as grandmother calls it
752372 hearing her talk about this house sometimes reminds me of playing clue
752373 you know the murder game like where colonel mustard kills mrs peacock with a wrench in the observatory
752374 yeah i told grandmother it was a necessity for school
752375 this house has been in our family for a long time
752376 but no one has lived here for the past twenty years my grandmother had it restored after she retired a couple of years ago
752377 the bedrooms are on this floor and the third floor has a ballroom that would be perfect for volleyball although grandmother has made it clear that its not that kind of ballroom
752378 and is it true that i have to share this room with a perfect stranger
752379 do i get any say in who becomes my roommate
752380 i guess you can take that up with my grandmother
752381 these shoes might be marc jacobs but theyre killing me
752382 dont the servants around here know how to put things away properly

752388 her parents are presently residing in france where her father just purchased a vineyard but elizas grandmother and i are old friends we went to college together when she heard about what i was doing up here in connecticut she encouraged her daughter to send dear eliza our way
752389 yeah i kinda thought that too after i got used to it to be honest it seemed pretty big to me at first but then youre probably used to big houses
752390 in fact they almost refused to let me come here
752391 oh i think they felt i was safer in boarding school if our grandmothers hadnt been such good friends im sure they never wouldve agreed
752392 i think itll be fun to go to a real high school to just live like a normal girl with other normal girls
752393 i guess i dont really know what normal is but its more normal that what im used to
752394 i mean you must know about my grandmothers plans to turn us all into little debutantes are you into all that
752395 thats nothing new remember im from the south my family is obsessed with turning me into a lady that was one of the other reasons my parents agreed to this i think they see the carter house as some sort of finishing school
752396 im pretty sure that the undergraduate engineering group did some as well
752397 for the race everything for those outside the race nothing
752398 well if its a systemic problem why are you for recalling davis it wasnt his fault
752399 revenues dont meet expenses which means we have a fundamental fiscal discipline problem we need to raise taxes or lower expenditures
752400 we keep trimming back on taxes because it buys votes and we keep hiring new state employees because thats what bureaucracies do
752401 a democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government it can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largesse from the public treasury from that moment on the majority always votes for the candidate promising the most from the public treasury with the results that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy
752402 sales taxes are anathema to progressives but s imply put we ought to bump the state sales tax by a fairly significant amount and rebate it back to lower and middle income taxpayers possibly by covering some portion of their payroll taxes with it
752403 ill reach under the header and unscrew the old oil filter here aaaaaiiiiiieeeeeahhhhh shit shit shit

752406 its quite possible that if we didnt send our troops there the french people would all be speaking german
752407 do you know how many frenchmen it takes to defend paris
752408 go yourself you bunch of meathead rednecks etc bush and his entire administration should die drowned in the iraqi oil
752409 going to war without the french is like going deerhunting without an accordion
752410 what is it with these people they always want to take a perfectly good thing and try to ruin it by making it their own what the hell is a christian taxidermist

752414 finally us steel reemerged in 2002 with plants in three american locations plus one in slovakia that employed fewer than one tenth the 168 000 workers of 1902
752415 i wonder if dave actually knows any steel workers or farmers
752416 lets also rember that this passion also animated martin luther king and ghandi
752417 we have to find a way to stop growing the people who do it
752418 now after the seminar i am convinced that this leader is sharp witty and very very bright i doubt if all these professors collected together can match his ability and caliber

752420 the two systems for disrespecting insulting the oromo as lemama

752441 you can fool some of the people all the time and all of the people some of the time but you cannot fool all of the people all the time

752453 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
752454 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
752455 i have never felt self congratulatory in any way about my involvement because it did precipitate a conflict which eventually claimed 3 500 lives and that is inescapable
752456 it would be very cruel to say that what we have ended up with is a twilight home in east belfast for retired gunmen but are relations today between the communities really that different
752457 im just not convinced that the outcome we do have is any better than what we wouldve had had the march not went ahead
752458 the thought that this would lead to a re emergence of militant irish nationalism which would in turn bring about the resurgence of militant loyalism would simply never even have occurred to us
752459 what this was about and what it has returned to was equality of citizenship history will record the provisional iras campaign as a continuation of the civil rights movement by inappropriate means
752460 between the pomposity of bew and the extravagance of mccann i might look like the sane one
752461 there can be no viler act apart from homosexuality and sodomy than sexually abusing children
752462 a new duty will be placed on local authorities to promote democracy local leaders will be expected to do more to help residents understand how the democratic process works and how they can get involved residents can expect to see information campaigns and town halls being opened up to councillors to hold surgeries new civic champions council staff or former councillors who will go out into the community and work with residents and community groups to increase understanding about how they can raise awareness about civic roles they can take up whether thats volunteering standing as a governor a councillor or becoming a magistrate
752463 in our own informal way weve acted more as a critical friend than fawning acolyte or jaded oppositionalist
752464 wed like to highlight the good things that are happening right now in northern ireland and the awards will aim to reward effort and interactivity with a pat on the back from the blogosphere
752465 i have left the party and the press office as i feel that the current programme for government of the stormont administration will put working class communities under increased pressure at a time when the current global credit crunch is already hurting this vulnerable group in society i also feel that the partys left wing credentials have been damaged by the above and by a continued courtship with the american administration
752466 one of the bad things about the internet is that you pay attention to your commenters
752467 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
752468 yes its a rap about particle physics yes it mentions antimatter and the bbc report an
752469 criminal and anti social elements who are using this bonfire as a cover for other activities
752470 while the provincial man looks to the opinion of the metropolis the parochial is never in any doubt about the social and artistic validity of his parish
752471 these cases are due to come before the tribunals and will be strenuously defended by ofmdfm in the circumstances it would be inappropriate to comment further
752472 this dude has been out there pulling these shenanigans for a long time now months at least maybe even a year or more
752473 this guy also has signs that say al gore is a communist robot
752474 we understand that the pressure brought to bear on those seeking the highest office are intense
752475 the millions who visit your website are a powerful testament to this new movements energy and passion
752476 obama draws an adoring crowd of 200 000 in berlin he pulls ahead in national polls meanwhile mccain who has run a near disastrous campaign inches up in key swing states go figure i say give obama the guitar he so richly deserves and make him a rock star give mccain a war to run somewhere and let voters redo the primaries so they can nominate two more mainstream candidates anyone who says the election is over and obama is the victor reminds me of the obama partisans drumming sen hillary clinton out of the race and turning off millions of potential democratic supporters in the process they do their candidate a much greater service if they duct tape their mouths
752477 the barack obama john mccain race is too close to call
752478 i still believe that liquid is a brilliant bar and the city needs a bar like it but i could not keep it open with the 20 000 i owe the council and other overheads
752479 im not going to bash the council because staff have been really good to me and offered me opportunities to carry on in the past i know they wanted liquid here
752480 but more needs to be done to support independent businesses in coventry i know a lot of traders are in the same trouble as me the council is focusing too much on attracting the big names
752481 the news is a great shame as an organisation we hold monthly open mic nights there and its going to be difficult for us to find other venues because there arent many around which cater for our needs
752482 if you chose the behaviour you also chose the consequences
752483 why we blame eprdf policy on chew and berbere fiasco
752484 those who are well off in ethiopia simply create a burden on those millions of people who are hard pressed
752485 ethiopia our main purpose in coming to africa was to assess our global 2000 agricultural project in ethiopia and 11 other nations our first two days were spent in field trips mostly southward along the rough and winding road through the rift valley from addis ababa to awassa about 150 miles as the crow flies ethiopia is a special case for us in 1994 rosalynn and i took prime minister meles zenawi out to see some of our test plots he became extremely excited and launched a massive government program based precisely on our crop production techniques total yields jumped from 5 5 million tons in 1993 to 11 7 million tons last year and ethiopia is now exporting surplus corn and will be self sufficient in wheat this year usually we would have 15 20 000 farmers in our production program by this time but since meles now has 600 000 we have limited ours to only 2 500 this lets us concentrate on post harvest projects farm storage marketing and processing

752508 like everybody else i dont know whats going to happen today but this election has already illuminated one critical truth the modern gop or more specifically the axis of 70s campus republicans running it really is just a criminal enterprise disguised as a political party theres probably not much that can be done on that score even if the dems take both houses of congress today oversight hearings and subpoenas to appear are all well and good but what we really need to see is a heap of good old fashioned law enforcement i want to see the rovians testifying in courtrooms not hearing rooms if by some fluke the democrats were to recapture the white house they would be well advised to go after the rovian machine in roughly the same manner that the russian government went after the old communist party after the failed 91 coup personally if it were up to me i would declare the gop an illegal organization as the cpussr was and let honest republicans go regroup under a new hopefully non criminalized brand name like say the detox party that of course will never happen but if the dems dont turn the full weight of the fbi the doj and the irs loose on the rovians the very first chance they get theyll just be asking for it the octopus will have it tentacles wrapped around throats again so fast it will make their tiny little brains pop

752652 is this treatment really more to make me look prettier and answer to bigotry bias improving the bottom line courtesy of kickbacks from your friends the drug reps the reputation for making skinnies out of fatties of your practice than to actually do something that will result in a lasting improvement to my health

752656 after mayor greg ballards upset victory at the polls last november local arts leaders were in a panic
752657 we obviously all recognize there are going to be cuts he needs to make said glen kwok executive director of the international violin competition of indianapolis
752658 we the arts community of indianapolis realize that the city is facing a serious financial crisis resulting from the current economy and a long term history of not dealing with structural problems in the city budget
752659 we do hope that youll reconsider taking the arts budget to zero
752660 but beyond money whats really valuable is your public support for the arts as a key component of our citys future we know that you understand that fixing todays problems only gets us so far and that making the city competitive for generations to come requires a broader vision we believe the arts are an essential part of that vision and are eager to engage with you to help define that vision for our community and make it a reality we hope you share our belief that arts are an essential component of our communitys future and will lend us your personal support in building that future together

752670 theres not that much foul ground over there so its one of those plays where you just try to get over there and not let the ball get past you
752671 it came up and bounced out of my glove then went on top of the wall and i picked it up thats how far it went and nobody touched it
752672 i mean the balls still in play we told the umpire that but it was his discretion he said it was just on top and that it was out of play but its still in play in my eyes i didnt understand the rule it was very disappointing it makes you want replay in baseball more and more
752673 when the ball jumped into the stands i thought the ball was going to be dead
752674 we could sense the market need since some time theres too much pressure on the call centers and marketing service providers to reduce their operational costs as the profit margins have squeezed down we found a huge scope in automated marketing solutions that deliver customized and cost effective campaigns without affecting the quality output its also interesting to see that there are only handful competitors while the demand in the coming time is going to be huge
752675 i run campaigns for collections and financial service marketing on behalf of my clients initially when these guys offered me their alpha version for testing purposes i was a bit reluctant of how would this work for me but right now i am more than satisfied as i have been able to slash my hiring and space leasing requirements by 30 70 this has really relieved me in the current market conditions where sustaining my business in spite of depleting profit margins is a prime concern

752683 im pretty good in geography and edmonton is closer to russia than it is florida it just wasnt conducive to raising a family ive seen a lot of my friends that are big league coaches and are big league managers that ive managed against me in the minor leagues and stuff like that thats fine but maybe ive got something they dont have it all starts with family i think the emphasis in society is so wrong family is first
752684 obviously i took notice of it because i play first base
752685 but i cant do anything about that im going to keep playing hard and hopefully put up some good numbers and eventually something good will probably happen but as far as that goes ive got to play my game i cant worry about teixeira or anybody like that

752693 in many crinminals especially youthful ones it is possible to detect a very powerful sense of guilt which exist before the crime and is therefore not its result but its motive it is as if it was a relief to be able to fasten this unconscious sense if guilt on to something real and immediate

752716 absolutely convinced that iran is going to get the bomb
752717 what no democrat or republican if elected in the future would have the courage to do
752718 a sustained bombing campaign in iran will humiliate the religious leadership and lead the public to rise up and overthrow the government
752719 i was shocked when i heard it and asked myself what are they smoking
752720 an attack on iran would effectively launch world war three
752721 when youre targeting your technology to your current business its like a chess game you know the pieces you know what they can and cannot do you know what your competition is going to do you can think out many moves in advance and in fact you have to if youre going to win

752725 we understand it might be beneath a worldwide celebrity of barack obamas magnitude to appear at town hall meetings alongside john mccain and directly answer questions from the american people but we hope hell reconsider
752726 theres no doubt that when it comes to our treatment of native americans as well as other persons of color in this country weve got some very sad and difficult things to account for
752727 i personally would want to see our tragic history or the tragic elements of our history acknowledged
752728 i consistently believe that when it comes to whether its native americans or african american issues or reparations the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words but offer deeds
752729 i guess that stuff can be toxic if it goes into the various ducts systems
752730 the beauty about this if there is any beauty about this is that it happened during our downtime
752731 whitelaw received immediate medical attention at the scene by rcmp and then by fire department and ehs
752732 a plastic bag containing an unknown substance was recovered from the airway of the individual by ehs the male died a short time later at surrey memorial hospital
752733 the inclusion of a cpc independent observer in respect of this incident will assist in mitigating any concerns expressed in respect of the impartiality of the rcmp investigation and in doing so promote institutional accountability and credibility as it relates to the investigative process
752734 see how a young man who was just a farmer boy and never dreamed that he would be one day speaking around the world and meeting kings and queens and presidents made some very important decisions and they were decisions of faith

752766 pedro mart nez was laughing so robustly about manny ramirez forgetting how many outs there were in the fourth inning last night that he placed his glove in front of his face to camouflage his smile nice try everyone realized mart nez was giggling howling right there on the mound in the middle of yankee stadium when was the last time a boston player did that
752767 a lot of people expected me to come back mad this and that
752768 which then melted magically sweetly into a smile of relief
752769 places i wish id been 32429 at a window seat table in the restaurant at skydome as manny ramirez rocket of a home run came screaming off the field to smash against the glass what a glorious piece of serendipity it must have been to be that person regardless of whether they appreciated it
752770 i did badmouth carl yazstremski all the time though when he played for the sox
752771 millar millars killin me out there in the field we shouldve kept mientkiewicz
752772 okay so how come millars just not good with the leather and mannys an asshole
752773 millars a dirt dog he doesnt take himself out of the game we needed manny up the other night and he took himself out of the game
752774 dad how do you know if manny is or isnt hurt
752775 because you dont pull a quad and then go out there and be in the field and runnin around hes not hurt hes just an asshole
752776 i guess what i dont like dad is how you vilify him personally when you dont even know him
752777 playing the outfield like a drunk man running from the police
752778 manny isnt in the lineup mom just heard will keep u posted
752779 post batting practice moments taking more batting practice in the tunnel behind the boston dugout
752780 i think hes been looking at his hands where they are pre pitch
752781 he did the same thing last year sometimes coming out of the gate you just lose your comfort zone for whatever reason hell get it
752782 why cant we get someone to hit behind ortiz what happened to manny and blah blah blah
752783 i think hes doing pretty well he hasnt created any divets or fallen on his ass or cut off throws from center field at all lately
752784 i really forgot how much watching pap strike a bitch out does for my health and well being
752785 manny can really make you laugh but he doesnt always know hes doing it
752786 it is the face of a great silent comic one that mack sennett would have cast on the spot
752787 jerry remy laid in to manny in the sixth inning tonight after coco was thrown out at the plate with what couldve been the tying run against fausto carmona whod had a no hitter going until coco singled to open the frame first remy noticed that coco had slowed up as he rounded third and that split seconds hesitation had probably cost him the run then reviewing the footage remy determined that the on deck batter was nowhere to be seen in the shot of coco headed toward the plate now engaging in some detailed analysis remy determined that the on deck hitter manny ramirez was just visible on the top step of the dugout in the very corner of the frame as coco headed for home thus remy declared manny was a contributing factor in the loss of the run coco was expecting to see him signaling if he should slide or stand and when he didnt he pulled up a little hence the hesitation and the out call at the plate in which manny manages to lose a game from the on deck circle its clear from his half hour of gesticulating and bitching loudly to whoever was within earshot that he felt the pitch was up and in but im personally surprised the home plate umpire didnt throw him out after all the time he spent on first base chirping and making a gesture like he was leaning out of the way of a pitch which was not at all the case with that one anyway and honestly i wanted to smack him maybe in a somewhat parental way that would separate me from the true manny haters but still bang zoom to the moon
752788 get rid of manny fire jd drew and let this kid play he is freakin un believable
752789 okay dad if you get rid of manny and drew you only have two outfielders
752790 oh hell all right keep manny i guess but w ait
752791 that was a serious serious home run that second one that manny hit are you kidding me he crushed that ball right off the bat hope you saw it see ya

752934 the idea of such a cool rdf namespace having only 6 months left on the dns registration gives me the worries
752935 if you could add another 5 10 years to the dns registration id sleep easier at night

752976 for we know that if our earthly house this tent is destroyed we have a building from god a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens for in this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed with our habitation which is from heaven if indeed having been clothed we shall not be found naked for we who are in this tent groan being burdened not because we want to be unclothed but further clothed that mortality may be swallowed up by life now he who has prepared us for this very thing is god who also has given us the spirit as a guarantee so we are always confident knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the lord for we walk by faith not by sight we are confident yes well pleased rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the lord

752990 in the past seven months he has turned this company into a corporate laughingstock
752991 every single person in windows shell team should be fired publicly too for creating buggiest and most painful product of the decade and not be able to fix it even after entire whole year when these fuckers will fix the file view bug

752999 impressive stuff do we have any nobel prize winners at microsoft
753000 i always laugh when run of the mill managers get lumped in with extremely accomplished engineers
753001 my advice pull your dollars out of msft and put them into goog balmer is going to hand your money over to icahn as a favor for helping him fulfill a now emotional move
753002 the page indicates that the page lists bios of senior leaders and ceos also you should actually read their bios before you call them run of the mill managers the non engineers on that page have probably accomplished more than you will in your career
753003 the position im interviewing for is probably level 65 but could be 1 can anyone clue me in as to what sort of compensation i can expect at each level im clueless as to what the salary stock signing bonus and relocation expenses i can hope for
753004 we can only assume your ill timed and poorly conceived pursuit of republic is designed to disrupt what you perceive as a competitive threat to your position in the market
753005 an acquisition of republic will most certainly burden the company with excessive debt distract your management result in significant regulatory burdens and thereby reduce shareholder value
753006 we encourage you to act with the best interests of your shareholders in mind in a responsible and prudent manner and to abandon this acquisition
753007 the position im interviewing for is probably level 65 but could be 1 can anyone clue me in as to what sort of compensation i can expect at each level
753008 but the very hairs of your head are all numbered do not fear therefore you are of more value than many sparrows
753009 does not the ear test words and the mouth taste its food wisdom is with aged men and with length of days understanding with him are wisdom and strength he has counsel and understanding
753010 we are the parents were all theyve got to show them gods love tangibly and the fruits of the spirit we have to grow up get over ourselves and our petty emotions and be what these kids need right now were responsible for them solely were trying to give them what we wish we had
753011 shaheen was a great governor its time to get her in the senate

753014 as all of us know this volunteer neighborhood based person to person contact starting now will be the most important way we can properly introduce barack obama to voters
753015 the last thing we need is yet another half a billion dollar lawsuit
753016 yeah we had a horse in this race and we really did pick a bad one
753017 seriously that site was an eye opener for me after 7 years at msft the only reasonable choice for me to leave for is my own company im afraid
753018 i dontt know toto i dont think were in kansas any more oh dear lions and tigers and bears oh my

753021 intel the giant chip maker and longtime partner of microsoft has decided against upgrading the computers of its own 80 000 employees to microsofts vista operating system a person with direct knowledge of the companys plans said
753022 less risk than a start up in terms of stability but more risk in terms of security
753023 so microsoft heres a prescriptive thought forget about buying yahoo forget about competing with google over online advertising focus on software the stuff that made you great tighten up the time between releases focus on applications that people actually want improve quality and develop a new product strategy that encompasses the latest internet developments sound familiar its how microsoft was run in the 1990s the c e o was none other than bill gates
753024 he went to msn money and pulled up 10 year charts comparing microsoft with ge
753025 i dont care what our stock is im focused on much more important things
753026 microsoft has its fingers in so many pies google cant pick a pie to stick a finger in except search and then only because we didnt care for it in 2001 otherwise the picture would be very different
753027 a computer in every home and microsoft on every computer
753028 we could have been the leader in all things saas if wed wanted to be
753029 the is hitting the fan but ive been here for 8 hours so im outta here
753030 now instead of ignoring the issue this is the spin hes come up with
753031 pathetic especially for a guy with a background in sales and marketing
753032 the is hitting gt gt the fan but ive been here for 8 hours gt gt so im outta here
753033 the is hitting the fan but ive been here for 8 hours so im outta here
753034 ive been here for eight hours so im out of here
753035 once there is even a perception of an exodus the dynamic becomes insidious and takes on a life of its own
753036 mr ballmer well i think in general were not that inconsistent with most large cap stocks
753037 so i think we have grown into what people expected of us in the late 90s
753038 you know our share price was sort of on a different trajectory then we announced our bid for yahoo and that kind of changed the trajectory a little bit
753039 mac users prefer their machines because theyre in a different mood
753040 any idea what that 100 million investment is worth today in theory dont high ipod and iphone sales pay us some dividend

753044 microsoft executives are discussing a reorganization of mr johnsons group that likely would consolidate marketing under vice president bill veghte and online services under vice president satya nadella said people familiar with the situation as part of those changes several vice presidents are expected to either leave the company or be given new responsibilities these people said a microsoft spokesman declined to comment on the changes
753045 by david drummond senior vice president corporate development and chief legal officer
753046 so microsofts hostile bid for yahoo raises troubling questions this is about more than simply a financial transaction one company taking over another its about preserving the underlying principles of the internet openness and innovation could microsoft now attempt to exert the same sort of inappropriate and illegal influence over the internet that it did with the pc while the internet rewards competitive innovation microsoft has frequently sought to establish proprietary monopolies and then leverage its dominance into new adjacent markets could the acquisition of yahoo allow microsoft despite its legacy of serious legal and regulatory offenses to extend unfair practices from browsers and operating systems to the internet in addition microsoft plus yahoo equals an overwhelming share of instant messaging and web email accounts and between them the two companies operate the two most heavily trafficked portals on the internet could a combination of the two take advantage of a pc software monopoly to unfairly limit the ability of consumers to freely access competitors email im and web based services policymakers around the world need to ask these questions and consumers deserve satisfying answers this hostile bid was announced on friday so there is plenty of time for these questions to be thoroughly addressed we take internet openness choice and innovation seriously they are the core of our culture we believe that the interests of internet users come first and should come first as the merits of this proposed acquisition are examined and alternatives explored
753047 chief executive steve ballmer built his image as a bulldog of a businessman who bested aggressive rivals and grappled publicly with governments while helping spread personal computers to millions of people around the world
753048 the deal comes as mr ballmer is likely to announce an executive shake up the latest in a series of high level staff changes that demonstrate the 51 year old former salesmans frustrations
753049 on the consumer side microsoft is struggling mobile phones music players and online services have sucked up tens of billions of microsofts profits in the past 10 years it has failed to make a significant dent in the market share of leaders
753050 nowhere is the consumer challenge more stark than in online services where microsoft has bled money as google has churned out profits
753051 this guy has a ton of potential but still basically a campus hire 59
753052 this guys experience and skill is easily competitive with l60
753053 yes your ads are cheaper and they should be because goog gets 2 3x more hits
753054 well as much as we would like to have acquired google we cant afford it this gets us very quickly to a 2 position in the internet portal and search market
753055 any plans to replace their bsd unix servers with windows technology
753056 well were offering this price for them because we believe what they have already built is highly valuable a hostile takeover followed by a mandated technology replacement could be disruptive to the operation of yahoo and potentially devalue them as an asset which would be a bad use of shareholder money we would prefer to see them accelerate and enhance the existing technology which as our bid indicates is highly valuable if on the other hand yahoos top technical talent were to reveal to us that they have actually been eagerly awaiting an opportunity to re do their entire technology stack using microsoft based technology we would consider allowing that
753057 i know you want to make your mark on microsoft but you should stop trying to be all things to all people take a tip on focus from that other steve dear steve lets talk over this yahoo yhoo thing before you move ahead its a profoundly bad idea
753058 something just occured to me most commentators think a microsoft yahoo merger would be a failure but there is a small group who think it would be a great success
753059 tying the second and third place finishers in the 100 yard dash wont make them fast enough to beat the winner
753060 microsofts shares have fallen 12 since it made its offer which may reflect concerns that it has already offered too much or that such a large deal would distract its management away from its core software business as a result of the falling share price microsofts cash and share offer is now only worth 41 8bn

753080 of all five videogame systems on the market now only the xbox 360 has had such major hardware failure problems
753081 in the end i think it was fear of failure ambition to beat sony and the arrogance that they could figure anything out that led to the decision to keep shipping that management team had made some pretty bad decisions in the past and had never had to pay a proportional consequence

753094 one of the oldest barriers to innovation is not invented here a persistent bias of even the most creative people toward their own creations and against those of people who work for other companies to help counteract n i h large corporations have promoted technology alliances with rivals as well as the concept of open innovation to draw on a wider circle of big brains not on their payroll to work on core technical problems these efforts arise from the recognition that no single innovator or team no matter how loyal to an employer or successful in the market has a monopoly on wisdom
753095 with the increase in the hairballs mass comes a corresponding increase in the hairballs gravity there is such a thing as corporate gravity as in the world of physics so too in the corporate world the gravitational pull a body exerts increases as the mass of that body increases and like physical gravity it is the nature of corporate gravity to suck everything into the mass in this case into the mass of corporate normalcy the trouble with this is that corporate normalcy derives from and is dedicated to past realities and past successes there is no room in the hairball of corporate normalcy for original thinking or primary creativity resynthesizing past successes is the habit of the hairball

753123 nope ibm lost their business by making the mother of all fumbles by allowing microsoft to sell the os that ibm paid for to other vendors
753124 ms made their fortune by catching ibms fumble microsofts fumble is happening right now and the beneficiaries will be apple and the linux vendors including ibm

753133 we designed it to try to help students in monroe county to realize their dream of going to a four year college or university
753134 they tell us the real facts how it really is and that helps a lot we know what to expect
753135 what were really trying to do is help them in their endeavors and help them fulfill the dream to go to college no matter where they go
753136 it doesnt have to be st john fisher as long as they go somewhere they want to go and its a fit for them
753137 we could choose to do another audit at a later date but of course we would give them time to implement the core actions
753138 so at this time theres no further audits planned but it doesnt mean that down the road we wouldnt do them
753139 intentionally split change orders processed in the same day for the same contractor
753140 and im hard pressed to say that what they have done wont be sufficient because i believe what did transpire was they were dependant on the players that were there at the time and how do you protect against a very similar situation recurring i dont know
753141 these people that were on the board were elected and the minute you change the players then i would say all of the effectiveness of the rules changes too
753142 my life has been golden in this country ive had every possible opportunity as far as education and worked in an enjoyable career
753143 in september the mbaka oromo school will be 100 percent rebuilt
753144 with the proposal passing it will be implemented in the upcoming school year
753145 in may the board asked superintendent tim mcelheran if darren everhart could look into changing the bus situation and this is what darren proposed
753146 this is my first child that will be going to school so i want to make sure i understand the whole process and why they decided to change bus routes instead of something else
753147 i am grateful for the opportunity to have served in such a wonderfully progressive school system where student achievement and individual attention is so much the focus of the schools efforts
753148 and now its time for me to pursue some other interests
753149 i want to thank dr manaseri for his service to the brighton central school district he has done a fine job in moving our district forward and we wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors
753150 the board is grateful that valenti has agreed to postpone his retirement until june 2009 valenti has been employed by the district for 20 years and has been responsible for the districts fiscal integrity and stability
753151 it has a lot of things the school board needs to do differently different than what was done under previous boards
753152 i think its important that we have the list and that we bring it up periodically so we dont lose sight of whats contained in this report
753153 i think we learned in the past we need to have a little more eyes
753154 can we say 100 percent mistakes wont happen we cant
753155 our goal is to take action and this board is going to walk the walk
753156 theres certain people in your life you realise arent exactly the people that you thought they were
753157 you are all seriously the best support team of all time i love you all so much you support means so much to me so thank you for that
753158 the lead classroom will be a place where differentiated instruction will thrive it is designed to specialize in individualized instruction since it will contain students from two grade levels those who demonstrate aptitude and ability in particular areas will have the unique opportunity to gain exposure to content otherwise not possible
753159 it is neither a remedial class nor an accelerated class it is a heterogeneous blend of our student population in a unique and supportive setting
753160 i was the only seventh eighth grade social studies teacher i absolutely loved it it was an opportunity to stretch student minds and social development than is possible in a typical classroom setting
753161 seek out and bring back to the naples central school district information about programs schools techniques and literature representing best practice or emerging trends in education
753162 thats what weve decided and i cant comment on the subject
753163 we are currently in the process of sorting through the documents that are potentially responsive to this request and will provide you further information
753164 christina is following the recommended treatment of her doctors and will have a full recovery
753165 imagina un mundo donde la tecnologia nos ayude a resolver los problemas mas complejos
753166 its a problem for the club for sporting director pedja mijatovic and the coach
753167 but now wesley sneijder is injured and hes an important player for us
753168 maybe tomorrow there will be a meeting with the people in the club and maybe then theres going to be news about this
753169 we know cristiano ronaldo is an incredible player and we dont have any problem with him joining us
753170 real madrid making an offer is normal manchester united and coach sir alex ferguson dont want this because he is a very important player at united and that is normal too
753171 i think theyre going to have to talk about this and if cristiano ronaldo is coming to real madrid the dressing room is waiting for him
753172 if he came of course the players and the fans would be excited the supporters are used to watching the best players in the world at the bernabeu and cristiano ronaldo is one of the best players in the world
753173 i feel the best of real madrid is the squad and the dressing room and if cristiano is coming here we dont have room for him in the team
753174 but as i said before maybe with the injury to wesley sneijder maybe we need someone else
753175 but if i move from real madrid id love to go to the premier league or dubai

753187 it was clear that whatever relationship they have its stronger now than ever before
753188 because kylie and alex are such good friends she spoke to him loads about the tour during the planning stages

753194 it was a lot windier and hillier than i expected and i was hoping for a better time
753195 until two and a half weeks ago i wasnt even planning on running so i am certainly not complaining
753196 my mom recently had a heart attack and they were keeping her current with constant text messages
753197 dont get me wrong it has become a serious race
753198 once you break the 15 000 mark of participants it becomes a destination race
753199 hes run in new york and chicago marathons and our little vacation to san francisco for his 50th was a perfect opportunity for him to get out there
753200 the first ever all electric 4wd with reverse is the bad boy buggy built by bad boy enterprises natchez mississippi not only is it quiet its clean and environmentally friendly as well no more tune ups oil changes or smelly fumes from that gas can to give you away the bad boy has all of the power you need to go places youve never gone before
753201 mini anymore they offer excellent space utilization but have lost ground in popularity to suvs
753202 there are some folks you just cant help but like first time you meet them for me one of those people is dr andy franks professor of engineering at the university of california at davis his uc davis futurecar and futuretruck teams have consistently placed in the top rankings of these competitions so he does more than theorize about evs he and his students make it happen
753203 without the familiar sounds of conventional combustion engine pedestrians cyclists animals and others lack the acoustic cues that warn them of approaching vehicles traveling at 15 25 mph or less much like the triangular or third brake light instituted in the 1970s we think that the development of an external sound emitting system will mark an advance in safety because engineered and psychoacoustically evaluated sounds will provide better information about the direction and intention of vehicles thus reducing harm and preventing accidents eva has developed a subtle sound emitting device that can intelligently alert people and animals to the presence of quietly operating vehicles by intelligently adding sounds where and when you need it our solution makes our environments safer while minimizing noise pollution in fact our solution will provide better acoustic cues than current combustion engines at a fraction of the sound output yet another way electric and hybrid vehicles will change our lives
753204 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived

753206 i want to do my best to faithfully render what is beautiful to me and hopefully others will find that beauty reflected in my work
753207 i played in these conditions all week so maybe i was more used to it
753208 there were lots of long long rallies which took a toll and we were both tired at the end
753209 a million books more than a hundred thousand manuscripts and rare books and centuries of historical records
753210 i was then chief of cabinet to the yugoslav interior minister milana milutinovic and i saw that document the signatories were richard holbrooke and radovan karadzic
753211 its the first time in my life i have won tournaments back to back
753212 usually i would win a tournament and the next week i would lose in the first round
753213 so i was happy when i won the first match and then i was just taking it one match at a time
753214 i just had to be comfortable over it towards the end it got kind of shaky
753215 after i regale a group with this talk the despairing cry goes up but youve eliminated everyone life is unfair
753216 i wish to exhort all people of good will to increase their efforts to halt the spread of the hiv virus to combat the disdain which is often directed towards people who are affected by it and to care for the sick especially those who are still children
753217 nothing can fully prepare you for discipline problemsuntil they are experienced first hand
753218 on suggestion i do have to offer is to give some kind of training to new teachers and substitutes as well on what kind of real life situations one can expect and practical ways to deal with them i know this would have been extremely helpful for me especially that first week
753219 nothing can fully prepare you for discipline problemsuntil they are experienced first hand
753220 on suggestion i do have to offer is to give some kind of training to new teachers and substitutes as well on what kind of real life situations one can expect and practical ways to deal with them i know this would have been extremely helpful for me especially that first week
753221 now you know what i expect of you in class and i expect the very same thing from you on this trip
753222 anyone can make a baby but not everyone can be a parent
753223 if president bush had pursued the right energy policies and made the investments in clean coal technology that he promised eight years ago he might not be talking about the high gasoline prices today
753224 big hurdle is fund raising even among a business community that is desperate to throw out mr mcgraw
753225 10 thinks you didnt know about west virginia gov joe manchin
753226 in my 31 years of social work i dont think ive seen a crime this heinous perpetrated against a social worker in the line of duty
753227 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
753228 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
753229 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
753230 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
753231 thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
753232 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
753233 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
753234 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
753235 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
753236 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
753237 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
753238 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
753239 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
753240 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
753241 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
753242 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
753243 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
753244 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
753245 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
753246 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
753247 i choose to reach across the aisle with john kerry to protect homeowners against foreclosure
753248 kerry advocates all kinds of additional socialism at home appeasement abroad and what that means is weakness for the future
753249 lori you are supposed to be staying close to your date otherwise he is going to be disappointed
753250 intermediate i wasnt quite sure where to place the boundary between the last two maybe once students are able to engage in a short original conversation maybe we need finer levels talk 00 46 2 july 2008 utc
753251 the armory the online resource for the competitive marketer is the exclusive host for the art of attack how to attack and dislodge the larger competitor
753252 a story that everyone customers programmers and managers can tell about how the system works
753253 what happens when the problem gets to the end of the line does it just fall off
753254 this program works like a hive of bees going out for pollen and bringing it back to the hive
753255 a vacuum cleaner sucking up all knowledge no theres lots of them and anyway the information is structured not just a big dustball well perhaps a library no that is big and static what we want is something that selectively collects information like a fleet of recycling trucks
753256 the system interprets text as commands and executes them against builders that produce resultant objects and attach assorted decorators sorting them via pipes and filters to the correct bins the user can than browse and eat them as needed

753262 can you please tell me what the lottery numbers will be in the next drawing
753263 i came up with one more energy related prediction the greatest self propelled vehicle ever invented the bicycle will experience a major renaissance
753264 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
753265 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
753266 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
753267 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
753268 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
753269 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
753270 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
753271 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
753272 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
753273 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
753274 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
753275 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
753276 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
753277 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
753278 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
753279 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
753280 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
753281 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
753282 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
753283 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
753284 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
753285 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
753286 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
753287 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
753288 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
753289 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
753290 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
753291 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
753292 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
753293 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
753294 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
753295 i had other priorities in the 60s than military service
753296 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
753297 the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
753298 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
753299 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
753300 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
753301 should we ignore gore or put him in charge hes an absurd extremist says mark davis the planet does not need saving the climate is not in crisis
753302 options fade for failing schools outside managers lack of interest in texas has forced campus closures
753303 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
753304 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
753305 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
753306 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
753307 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
753308 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
753309 work with the dncc to estimate the conventions carbon footprint
753310 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years

753348 one of the things i like about this generation is we are still very early and theres still a lot of room for growth as we move down those price curves those engines have a lot of steam left in them we think it could be seven or eight years before new machines start to roll out
753349 we are always preparing for the next hardware we are under development but the hardware is a kind of box that consumers reluctantly buy in order to play our games every hardware needs some revolutionary features this time around it happened to be we had a revolutionary user interface will it be the same for the next generation i really cant tell

753363 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
753364 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
753365 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
753366 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
753367 living like ed a guide to the eco friendly life
753368 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
753369 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
753370 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
753371 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
753372 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
753373 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
753374 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
753375 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
753376 but i resent when you throw out stupid allegations that have no merit and really no purpose other than to inflame
753377 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father rom 8 23 and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body rom 9 4 who are israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of god and the promises gal 4 5 to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons eph 1 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will

753380 you have a talent for leadership bob the country needs young men like you in the leadership of the nation
753381 after about a year i became disinterested quit paying my dues and dropped my membership in the organization during the nine years that have followed i have never been interested in the klan

753390 i would never fight in the armed forces with a negro by my side rather i should die a thousand times and see old glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels
753391 it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment
753392 you know i have been very clear in my denunciation of minister farrakhans anti semitic comments i think they are unacceptable and reprehensible i did not solicit this support he expressed pride in an african american who seems to be bringing the country together i obviously cant censor him but it is not support that i sought and were not doing anything i assure you formally or informally with minister farrakhan
753393 but if the word reject sen clinton feels is stronger than the word denounce then im happy to concede the point and i would reject and denounce
753394 if you lie with dogs you are going to get fleas
753395 he was a man take him for all in all i shall not look upon his like again
753396 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
753397 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
753398 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
753399 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
753400 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
753401 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
753402 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
753403 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
753404 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
753405 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
753406 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living
753407 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
753408 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
753409 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
753410 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
753411 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
753412 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
753413 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
753414 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
753415 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
753416 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
753417 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
753418 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
753419 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
753420 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil
753421 americans hate being dependent for our mobility and therefore for our livelihoods on countries often hostile to our way of life
753422 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
753423 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
753424 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
753425 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
753426 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
753427 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
753428 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
753429 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
753430 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
753431 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
753432 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
753433 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
753434 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
753435 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
753436 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
753437 when we brought the organization to philadelphia and we did research with then television partner nbc polling people of the philadelphia area the awareness factor of arena football was about 1 5 percent
753438 today i dont think theres a sports fan in philadelphia that hasnt at least heard of the philadelphia soul
753439 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy
753440 if this victory can clear the way and get rid of the curse that theyve had here for a number of years i hope it does
753441 i hope the eagles now can win it the sixers mo cheeks and those guys can win it
753442 its amazing how many people have texted or e mailed or called
753443 coach tom coughlin from the giants andy reid bill belichick bob kraft doug flutie john elway al gore youd be surprised at the people who were glued to their tv sunday charlie weis
753444 so many people that weve run into over the years that just had the best of wishes for what we just accomplished it was pretty cool
753445 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
753446 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
753447 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
753448 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
753449 if hed been president we wouldnt have hadthese bush administration messes the past eight years
753450 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presencethat draws you in
753451 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
753452 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
753453 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate
753454 if the vice president says its do able i believe
753455 its a strategy that willcreate millions of new jobs and one that will leave ourchildren a world that is cleaner and safer
753456 it cannot be the basis of a soundenergy policy by any responsible official in america it seemsto me maybe i am wrong but i dont think so
753457 you win some you lose some and then theres that little known third category
753458 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
753459 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
753460 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses
753461 enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
753462 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
753463 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
753464 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
753465 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
753466 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done

753476 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
753477 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
753478 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
753479 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
753480 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
753481 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate

753484 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
753485 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
753486 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
753487 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
753488 the way to bring gas prices down is to end our dependence on oil and use the renewable sources that can give us the equivalent of 1 a gallon gasoline
753489 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
753490 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
753491 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
753492 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
753493 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
753494 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
753495 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
753496 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
753497 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
753498 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
753499 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
753500 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
753501 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
753502 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
753503 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
753504 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
753505 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
753506 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
753507 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
753508 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
753509 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
753510 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
753511 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
753512 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
753513 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
753514 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
753515 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
753516 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
753517 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
753518 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
753519 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
753520 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
753521 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
753522 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
753523 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
753524 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
753525 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
753526 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
753527 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
753528 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
753529 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
753530 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
753531 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
753532 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
753533 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
753534 give me the damn food old man or i will throw up all over you and shit double for you tonight

753606 the air yeezy is inspired by kanyes love for high top designer shoes drafting from the collar molding seen in the air jordan v and featuring a thin midfoot strap hardly meant for support while originally conceptualized atop a dunk midsole the final version of the yeezy features the familiar shared tooling from the jordan iii and air revolution which most recently was also featured on jordan brands spizike and a lesser known model that deservedly flew under the radar the flight 48 its also the bulkiness of the shoes tongue that stands out most with west always opting to pop the tongue and leave the waxed laces loosely tied an ode to his tour the models outsole also actually glows in the dark as similar to a common glow stick if the shoe is held near light the familiar green glowing hue will radiate afterwards out from under the shoe this black glow colorway features a ridiculously high quality full grain leather along the heel quarter with rich suede making up the toe and midfoot overlays and patent leather highlighting the dominant midfoot strap

753624 the teachings of islam can fail under no circumstances with all our systems of culture and civilization we cannot go beyond islam and as a matter of fact no human mind can go beyond the koran
753625 allah the almighty has said o son of adam so long as you call upon me and hope in me i shall forgive you for what you have done and i shall not mind
753626 pray in the same way that you have seen me pray
753627 you have indeed the messenger of allah a good example for anyone whose hope is allah and the final day and who engages much in the praise of allah

753630 when the horses are released for a race and are close to the finish line they give all the strength they have what is left of my life is less than that
753631 i did not find an example for the believer in this life better than a man on a plank in the sea imploring o lord o lord hoping that allah will save him
753632 whenever you see sufyan ath thawri it is as if you see someone in a ship fearing to drown one would often hear him say o lord save me save me
753633 i have never seen a person offering salah or fasting more than he did or a person fearing the lord more than him after offering salat ul isha he would sit down and cry until he becomes sleepy then he would wake up again and continue crying until sleep overtakes him
753634 how can you tolerate being awake all night and thirsty in the intense heat of the day
753635 is it anything more that postponing the food of the day to night time and the sleep of the night to daytime this is not a big matter
753636 remembrance of the heat of hellfire has taken sleepiness from me
753637 i wonder how the one who knows that above him paradise is being embellished and below him hell fire is being kindled and yet sleeps between them
753638 al amash was almost seventy years old and he never missed the first takbirah for salah in the masjid i used to visit him frequently for more than two years and never saw him make up for even one rakah
753639 hayee alas salah the call to salah so if you can come to it even by crawling do so
753640 i have never seen the like of him and none had encompassed as many good characteristics as he did concerning his adherence to one way for forty years making salah in the first row unless he had an excuse itikaf during ramadhan and the ten days of thul hijjah and the lack of desire to accumulate properties and build houses as he forbade himself these he turned away any position of imam or speaker though they were offered to him and he devoted himself to enjoin good and forbid evil and he would not fear anyone in that

753654 eemaan belief in all what allaah has described himself with by in his book and in what his messenger muhammad sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam has described him by without doing tahreef ta teel takyeef or tamtheel
753655 there is nothing like unto him and he is the all hearer all seer
753656 upon allaah is the bayaan explaining upon the messenge is balaagh conveying and upon us is tasleem willingly accepting
753657 all that allaah has described himself with in his book then its tafseer explanation is its reciting and keeping silent about it
753658 were it not for maalik and sufyaan the knowledge would have disappeared from the hijaaz
753659 i believe in allaah and that which has come from allaah upon the intended meaning of allaah
753660 adhere to my sunnah way and to the sunnah of the rightly guided khulafaa bite on it with your molar teeth and beware of newly invented matters for verily every bid ah innovation is a going astray
753661 follow and do not innovate for verily you have been sufficed
753662 do not go beyond where they stopped for verily they stopped upon knowledge and with a perceiving view sufficed
753663 stick to the footsteps of the predecessors even if people abandon you beware of the views of men even if they beautify it for you with words
753664 then whosoever wills let him believe and whosoever wills let him disbelieve
753665 o you who believe do your duty to allaah and fear him seek the means of approach to him
753666 let none of you abuse slander my companions for by him in whose hand is my life if one of you spent in the way of allaah the equivalent of mount uhud in gold it would not reach a handful nor half a handful of what they spent
753667 indeed allaah will never unite this ummah upon misguidance and the hand of allaah is upon the jamaa ah
753668 ask the people of knowledge if you do not know
753669 the khilaafah in my ummah is for thirty years then after it is a kingship
753670 the messenger of allaah sallaallahu alaihi wa sallam and the leaders of the muslims after him set examples sunnah the taking of which is holding on to the book of allaah the most high and strength upon the deen of allaah it is not for any one to change or alter it nor to look at a matter in opposition to it whoever is guided by it then he is truly guided and whoever seeks help by it then he is truly helped whoever leaves it and follows a way other than the way of the believers allaah will turn him to what he has chosen and burn him in hell what en evil abode
753671 and beware of newly invented matters for verily every bid ah is a going astray
753672 and know that the selected correct way is that which the pious predecessors were upon and that is the truth do not be fooled by the large number that oppose it
753673 the latter part of the ummah will never be reformed except by that which reformed the former part
753674 never will good disappear from the ummah because the messenger of allaah sallaallaahu alaihi wa sallam said in a hadeeth
753675 there will not cease to be a group from my ummah manifestly upon the haqq truth the ones that abandon them will not harm them until the order of allaah comes and they are like that upon the truth
753676 the example of my ummah is like that of rain it is not known whether the initial part of the rain is good or the latter part this is an authentic hadeeth
753677 our saying which we state the deen which we profess belief in is adherence to the book of allaah the sunnah of our prophet sallaallaahu alaihi wa sallam and that which is related from the companions radiyallahu anhum the taabioon and imaams of hadeeth we cling on to this and we say that which aboo abdullaah ahmad ibn hanbal used to say and distance ourselves from ones that opposed his sayings

753682 yes we are not equal to the white hence the right to enslave us
753683 a just leader a youth who grows up worshipping allah subhanahu wa ta ala a man who is deeply attached to the mosque two men who love one another for the sake of allah subhanahu wa ta ala meeting for his sake and parting for his sake a man who is called by a beautiful woman and says i fear allah subhanahu wa ta ala a man who gives charity in secret such that his left hand does not know what his right hand is doing and a man who remembers allah subhanahu wa ta ala when he is alone and his eyes fill with tears
753684 where are those who loved one another for my glory today i will shade them in my shade on the day when there is no shade but mine
753685 allah subhanahu wa ta ala said those who love one another for my glory will have minbars of light and the prophets and martyrs will wish that they had the same
753686 a man went to visit a brother of his in another village
753687 no two men love one another but the better of them is the one whose love for his brother is greater
753688 if a man loves his brother let him tell him that he loves him
753689 o messenger of allah indeed i truly love this man
753690 truly i love you for the sake of allah subhanahu wa ta ala
753691 may allah subhanahu wa ta ala love you who loves me for his sake
753692 i entered the mosque of damascus where i saw a young man who had a bright smile and i saw the people gathered around him when they disagreed on some matter they referred it to him and accepted his opinion i asked who he was and they told me this is muadh ibn jabal radhiallahu anhu
753693 allah almighty says my love is granted to those who love one another for my sake who visit one another for my sake and who spend on one another for my sake
753694 how then can they call on the one they have not believed in and how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard and how can they hear without someone preaching to them

753698 the only thing she wanted to do as he left is to remember his registration she kept saying it over and over and over again to herself until the neighbour arrived and she said quick write it down
753699 i think shes amazing she is so strong if i put myself in that position i dont think i could have done what she did
753700 but in light of this i suppose well have to give it some consideration
753701 ask something of me and i will give it to you
753702 you have shown great favor to your servant my father david because he behaved faithfully toward you with justice and an upright heart and you have continued this great favor toward him even today seating a son of his on his throne o lord my god you have made me your servant king to succeed my father david but i am a mere youth not knowing at all how to act i serve you in the midst of the people whom you have chosen a people so vast that it cannot be numbered or counted give your servant therefore an understanding heart to judge your people and to distinguish right from wrong for who is able to govern this vast people of yours
753703 because you have asked for this not for a long life for yourself nor for riches nor for the life of your enemies but for understanding so that you may know what is right

753708 thats like wanting to convert to become chinese or indian or aboriginal or eskimo
753709 you cant convert to an ethnic group the writers who suggested he apply some introspection to why he wants to convert rather than just hang out with jews were probably onto something
753710 go to http device xyz xyz can be found on a sticker on the back of the device
753711 cannot continue to rely on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives weve set
753712 we cannot continue to rely on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives weve set weve got to have a civilian national security force thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
753713 if were going to create some kind of national police force as big powerful and well funded as our combined u s military forces isnt this rather a big deal
753714 i thought democrats generally believed the u s spent too much on the military how is it possible their candidate is seeking to create some kind of massive but secret national police force that will be even bigger than the army navy marines and
753715 is obama serious about creating some kind of domestic security force bigger and more expensive than that if not why did he say it what did he mean
753716 every other journalist who still thinks the american people have a right to know the specifics about a presidential candidates biggest and boldest initiatives before the election
753717 most of the time when obama flubs a line and attempts to recover you can easily spot it
753718 delivered clearly concisely and succinctly without any hint that they emanate from a flub
753719 in the moment of the speech he decided theyre back in
753720 pay closer attention to obamas speeches for what is off the cuff for what his trainers and handlers might not want him to say but which he will continue to say anyway we know hes really good on a fixed script and we know that hes really bad on his own
753721 in 2007 the u s defense budget was 439 billion is obama serious about creating some kind of domestic security force bigger and more expensive than that the questions are legion and the implications of such an organization are staggering what would it do according to the title its a civilian force so how would it go about discharging national security issues what are the constitutional implications for such a group how is this to be paid the statement was made in the context of youth service is this an organization for just the youth or are adults going to participate how does one get away from the specter of other such youth organizations from nazi germany and the former soviet union when talking about it
753722 i thought we already had the fbi dea batfe u s marshals tsa postal inspectors park rangers secret service state bureaus of investigation state police local police sheriffs and constables among others that already did that
753723 the other more likely possibility here is that obama has absolutely no clue what hes talking about that would explain why he hasnt elaborated on the idea
753724 i am running for president right now because of what dr king called the fierce urgency of now this moment is too important to sit on the sidelines
753725 we will ask americans to serve we will create new opportunities for americans to serve and we will direct that service to our most pressing national challenges as president i will expand americorps to 250 000 slots and make that increased service a vehicle to meet national goals like providing health care and education saving our planet and restoring our standing in the world so that citizens see their efforts connected to a common purpose people of all ages stations and skills will be asked to serve because when it comes to the challenges we face the american people are not the problem they are the answer

753728 tired of being led by the nose by this population that is destroying us destroying our country by imposing its acts
753729 my country france my homeland my land is again invaded by an overpopulation of foreigners especially muslims
753730 over the last twenty years we have given in to a subterranean dangerous and uncontrolled infiltration which not only resists adjusting to our laws and customs but which will as the years pass attempt to impose its own
753731 men have authority over women because allah has made the one superior to the others and because they spend their wealth to maintain them good women are obedient they guard their unseen parts because allah has guarded them as for those from whom you fear disobedience admonish them and send them to beds apart and beat them then if they obey you take no further action against them allah is high supreme
753732 i shall terrorize the infidels so wound their bodies and incapacitate them because they oppose allah and his apostle
753733 allah made the jews leave their homes by terrorizing them so that you killed some and made many captive and he made you inherit their lands their homes and their wealth he gave you a country you had not traversed before
753734 what is happening to merrill and others is death by a thousand cuts its painful to see it happen over and over again
753735 are things that much worse than we were led to believe
753736 if people were going to believe thain when he said merrill raised more capital than it needed to and had taken conservative marks on its securities book im not sure theyre going to believe him tomorrow morning
753737 right now we believe we are in a very comfortable spot in terms of our capital
753738 the problem here is with thain you can throw him into the credibility problem camp now
753739 its tough to call the bottom on these things because it seems like its never ending but this could be viewed as the watershed
753740 i would support anything that is going to be better for the children of illinois
753741 if there was any argument for vouchers it was lets see if the experiment works and if it does whatever my preconception you do whats best for kids
753742 obama now joins a long list of african american elites who wouldnt dare send their kids to an urban public school but who works hard at every turn to deny poor black parents the same options he and his wife are so lucky to have we hope that catholics as well as african americans get the message
753743 a proud catholic proud of my faith a proud catholic not so proud of my church
753744 we now have this added pressure given whats happened in california that we really think that it is a good thing that we be prepared to receive the economic benefit
753745 for me it wasnt the most important basis of the argument but it certainly is a perk
753746 the administration believes repealing this discriminatory and antiquated law is simply the right thing to do the study does show though that this action could also bring some added economic benefits to the commonwealth which would be welcomed
753747 obviously it would help us from a business standpoint i kind of feel like there will be people coming in
753748 we were collectively thinking about planning to wait until after the november elections because we were concerned that the far right the karl rove types of people would once again try to use this issue as a wedge issue in the campaign
753749 once the california decision happened and out of state couples could go to california there was no reason not to move forthwith
753750 and everyone recognizes that this will be an economic boon for massachusetts because every gay person who comes here to marry most wont come alone

753757 when congress lifts the legislative ban i will lift the executive prohibition
753758 house and senate democratic leaders plan to bring energy legislation to the floor this week using procedural tactics designed to block republicans from offering amendments that would lift the drilling ban
753759 in the senate democrats hope to take up as early as wednesday a still un drafted bill that would tighten regulation of speculation in energy futures
753760 majority leader harry reid d nev said he would block any effort to propose amendments to the bill that did not deal directly with the speculation issue
753761 shes so eloquent and you can tell she speaks from the heart
753762 she has that gift of making you feel like an old friend like she is truly interested in what you have to say and of course what she has to say is so important for the whole country
753763 honor his service and commitment to protect this community our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends
753764 but then i thought about the world i want to leave for our children this race isnt about us its about them
753765 where any american whos willing to work hard can earn a decent living for their family where folks wont go bankrupt just because someone gets sick where all of our children have access to world class public education thats the world barack obama is fighting for
753766 youre going to see obama in a lot of places where you may not have seen many democratic candidates in the past
753767 his message is one of inclusion and his policies resonate with people so were taking that message to some nontraditional
753768 the speed with which they can communicate their warning to the public will largely depend upon how effective we have been at controlling the media subverting education and keeping the public distracted with matters of no real importance
753769 there does exist and has existed for a generation an international network which operates to some extent in the way the radical right believes the communists act in fact this network which we may identify as the round table groups has no aversion to cooperating with the communists or any other groups and frequently does so i know of the operations of this network because i have studied it for twenty years and was permitted for two years in the early 1960s to examine its papers and secret records i have no aversion to it or to most of its aims and have for much of my life been close to it and to many of its instruments i have objected both in the past and recently to a few of its policies but in general my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain unknown and i believe its role in history is significant enough to be known

753780 avril lavignes girlfriend music video is less than one million views away from becoming the most watched video of all time on youtube
753781 so what were attempting wont be easy but bahh who am i kidding of course it will be easy because we have a secret weapon
753782 one thing i find as disturbing as his vagueness on issues is the mission statement of his church
753783 we hope our brother will take pride in his muslim faith
753784 why dont americans have a say in what happens to our country
753785 at the end of the day for a myriad of reasons the people have spoken
753786 justice oconnor showed her liberal colors today by declaring the word jesus as illegal religious speech which can be banned by any council who wishes to ignore the first amendment as she did councilman rev hashmel turner should run for mayor fire the other council members and rewrite the prayer policy and if he appeals to the supreme court i pray he will win in jesus name
753787 turner was not forced to offer a prayer that violated his deeply held religious beliefs instead he was given a chance to pray on behalf of the government
753788 actually he was directly forced to conform or face the punishment of exclusion
753789 actually he was denied the change to pray on behalf of that government
753790 the restriction that prayers be nonsectarian in nature is designed to make the prayers accessible to people who come from a variety of backgrounds not to exclude or disparage a particular faith
753791 ironically she admitted turner was excluded from participating solely because of the christian content of his prayer
753792 the fredericksburg government violated everybodys rights by establishing a nonsectarian religion and requiring all prayers conform or face punishment of exclusion
753793 it is government speech and the rule seems perfectly reasonable
753794 because he wants to pray to a particular god hes not being treated equally
753795 hasnt held executive responsibility and has no ex perience making tough military decisions
753796 he really didnt just say what we all heard him just say did he
753797 sir do not associate yourself with retired general wes clark if you desire respect from military voters you had the intuitiveness and correct sense to distance yourself from reverend wright do the same with general clark

753879 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
753880 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
753881 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
753882 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
753883 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
753884 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
753885 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans

753915 the raf search and rescue teams are the most dedicated and professional in the world they provide at least one committed standby helicopter at six bases throughout the uk able to respond within 15 minutes
753916 changes have been made to crew structures at these bases in order to provide additional support to our top priority operations in iraq and afghanistan this will not affect normal search and rescue capability and our support to civil authorities during recent flooding shows our ability to respond flexibly to extraordinary requirements
753917 operations are always our priority we have to focus our resources on the frontline
753918 the fact that such an important public duty is being cut is the most graphic example of how incredibly overstretched our armed forces now are labour have consistently failed to match their commitments with resources and it now seems that public safety could be the latest casualty

753928 if you look at everybody here people got along very well youll see that whatever it is the final document here on the platform is one that we are all going to fight for in full force as we get to the convention and i think we are all pleased with the result and we are one big happy family and now we just want to grow we want to reach out to the independents we want to bring some republicans that have been left out so they can also join our effort to elect senator obama as the next president

753951 our whole existence here on this physical plane is based on our experience of separation of having an individual consciousness tied to a particular body a particular brain and a particular history but if or when we go back to god we no longer have that separation its not as if an individual is traveling back home it is as if we are melting as if the walls of separation are dissolving and we expand into a bigger and bigger space so its not as if we lose our sense of self its as if our sense of self expands infinitely yours joins with mine until there is only one consciousness until we realize that all these separate beings that we have encountered during our existence are actually all aspects of the same being

753953 you can learn in one day here what takes years to learn on earth forget reincarnation because it is a sandbag around your neck you will have it so centered on your mind that you will think of nothing else and you will stay just where you are you cannot progress because your mind will always revert to the earth again you cannot live on the earth more than once life is progression not retrogression
753954 i studied reincarnation in india and thought there was truth and justice in the theory that we come back to learn and grow i taught the theory and wanted to bring it to the world i felt that i remembered far back into my past but i was mistaken when you become sensitive and can feel the spirits around you they speak to you by impressions and their past will be like a panorama a person feels it and will relive the past of spirits but the mistake is made of taking this for the memory of past incarnations i did not know this when i lived on earth but when i came to the spirit side of life i learned differently once you reach the spirit world where all is congenial where all is life where all is bliss where there is no jealousy no envy where all is one grand harmony do you think for one moment that you would want to leave that beautiful condition to come back to earth and be a little baby restricted in mind and knowing nothing whatever
753955 i had not known of a spirit to reincarnate and in this my disappointment has been grievous karma exists in the spirit world and many spirits of my association have become pure and perfected spirits through renunciation yet they have remained spirits and have progressed to the highest realms without taking another body

753962 on one occasion the communicator told me that the mediums larynx was being used and that his voice was being carried by a psychic tube to the trumpet which magnified it so that we could hear it in other words he was making use of the mediums lungs and larynx and mouth to save the necessity of materialising these organs but even then i did not hear the medium speaking
753963 when on earth matter vibrating within certain fixed limits impinged on the mind through the physical body but in the etheric world vibrations of a higher range impinge on the etheric body and through it to the mind the mind is then aware of only these higher vibrations it appreciates the finer structure of the etheric body and realises the form the body takes because the etheric body vibrates just as did the physical body everything therefore appears to be just as real and solid as it was on earth because the mind and the etheric body are now functioning in a new range of vibrations with which they are in tune what to us on earth seems ethereal and to which we give the name spirit is not so to the etherians
753964 to test their assumption they used fouriers equations to convert plaid and checkerboard patterns into simple wave forms then they tested to see how the brain cells in the visual cortex responded to these new wave form images what they found was that the brain cells responded not to the original patterns but to the fourier translations of the patterns only one conclusion could be drawn the brain was using fourier mathematics the same mathematics holography employed to convert visual images into the fourier language of wave forms 2 the devaloises discovery was subsequently confirmed by numerous other laboratories around the world and although it did not provide absolute proof the brain was a hologram it supplied enough evidence to convince pribram his theory was correct spurred on by the idea that the visual cortex was responding not to patterns but to the frequencies of various wave forms he began to reassess the role frequency played in the other senses it didnt take long for him to realize that the importance of this role had perhaps been overlooked by twentieth century scientists over a century before the devaloises discovery the german physiologist and physicist hermann von helmholtz had shown that the ear was a frequency analyzer more recent research revealed that our sense of smell seems to be based on what are called osmic frequencies bekesys work had clearly demonstrated that our skin is sensitive to frequencies of vibration and he even produced some evidence that taste may involve frequency analysis interestingly bekesy also discovered that the mathematical equations that enabled him to predict how his subjects would respond to various frequencies of vibration were also of the fourier genre
753965 it absolutely confounds me that the simplest thing is the hardest to explain
753966 did you ever a moment after you woke up have the sudden feeling that you are exactly the same as you were when you were a small child then all the adult thoughts and concerns of the day rush in and the experience is quickly forgotten well that you that consciousness that exists prior to all the particular thoughts concerns and desires of the moment not what you are looking at but the looker thats the real you that is pure consciousness
753967 from the identical set of genes depending on which parts are being expressed comes both the caterpillar and the butterfly
753968 look again at this amazing discrepancy between what has been actually observed or detected regarding genes and what supernatural powers and intelligence have been attributed to them all genes actually do that can be observed is allow themselves to be copied and this is done not at their own initiative but at the behest of enzymes to which they passively respond thats it and yet the genes are now considered to be by modern biologists the source of creativity that engendered all of life according to dawkins et al genes discovered how to build bodies how to digest food and how to manufacture antibodies to protect themselves they discovered photosynthesis oxygen metabolism intra cellular communication and locomotion and ultimately they discovered love consciousness the human heart the human eye and the human brain for submicroscopic pieces of protein of matter that sit passively in the nucleus of a cell until they occasionally and only in automatic response to an enzyme allow themselves to be copied that is a whole lot of attribution isnt it
753969 there has been no rush to look behind the scenes and discover just how much irrationality is needed to keep defending the bastion of rationality
753970 for hundreds of years western medicine has looked at mind and body as totally separate entities to the point where saying something is all in your head implied that it was imaginary
753971 now weve found how changing the activity of the mind can alter the way basic genetic instructions are implemented
753972 this is the first comprehensive study of how the mind can affect gene expression linking what has been looked on as a soft science with the hard science of genomics it is also important because of its focus on gene expression in healthy individuals rather than in disease states
753973 people have been using these culturally determined mind body techniques for millenia we found that no matter which particular technique is used different forms of meditation and yoga breath focus or repetitive prayer the mechanism involved is the same now we need to see if similar changes occur in patients who use the relaxation response to help treat stress related disorders and those studies are underway now
753974 in what sense is experiencing the self without thoughts and feelings worthwhile
753975 i would add that dawkins is selective to the point of dishonesty when he cites the views of scientists on the philosophical implications of the scientific data
753976 two noted philosophers one an agnostic anthony kenny and the other an atheist nagel recently pointed out that dawkins has failed to address three major issues that ground the rational case for god as it happens these are the very same issues that had driven me to accept the existence of a god the laws of nature life with its teleological organization and the existence of the universe
753977 after many centuries of theological imperialism we have now had three centuries of

753980 then a human editor should periodically check the rest and unceremoniously delete all nonsense
753981 nonsense is often if not always in the eyes of the beholder a simple validation is to visit a political or religious blog and see how that goes for ya if your comments are radically different than the blogs beliefs
753982 could be the syllabus for a civics class in a dark matter universe
753983 i would assume you wouldnt have a problem with this statement
753984 indeed i was fairly sure that lysergic acid experience an aid to self knowledge though it might incidentally be in some way precluded the attainment of the kind of altered consciousness of which as record spoke and that it precluded it precisely because it involved no personal effort to move up the scale of consciousness
753985 even as i thought this the pain disappeared and the sensation of rising up within began
753986 if its hallucinogen than does that mean everything we experience is an hallucination
753987 it would be easier for me to call it all a dream a grand hallucination then i could have my old world back in which i thought i knew what was real and unreal true and untrue now the problem is i dont know anything
753988 at this point i merged with the light and everything including myself became one unified whole there was no separation between myself and the rest of the universe in fact to say that there was a universe a self or any thing would be misleading it would be an equally correct description to say that there was nothing as to say that there was everything to say that subject merged with object might be almost adequate as a description of the entrance into cc but during cc there was neither subject nor object all words or discursive thinking had stopped and there was no sense of an observer to comment or to categorize what was happening in fact there were no discrete events to happen just a timeless unitary state of being
753989 what a wonderful thing the internet is i get exposed to ideas and resources i never would have had any other way

753991 unlike normal photographs every part of a hologram contains all the information possessed by the whole
753992 i think it is the experiencing in each moment that counts rather than trying to pull our entire existence to pieces and put it in to neatly labelled boxes youve just got to ground yourself in the reality of your present experience and get on with it or trust me youll do your head in

754002 if we asked what would it take for me to believe in esp would it take a single experiment how about 10 statistically significant experiments in which the guy picked the right playing card that still wouldnt quite do it because theres no way to understand how this could possibly happen in the brain we understand how neurons and brain centers work but we dont know how something would transmit through space out of your skull into somebody elses skull so those guys need to come up with some mechanism to explain it
754003 actually bailer i wonder if anyone here has a list of ready made rebuttals to typical skeptical argumuents now that would be useful i know that skeptics often use the same arguments and i suspect they copy and paste them from somewhere i dont think just copying links to helpful sites is any good people wont open a mass of links and they dont have a ready impact a list might save time in the long run
754004 by the way speaking of consciousness did we hear that ray kurzweil thinks we might eventually be able to download our consciousness into a computer in order to achieve immortality
754005 david thompson is not a materialisation medium and has admitted that he is not it is victor zammit who keeps making this claim
754006 i think its necessary to bring that assumption into play and to point out that in matters of anomalous phenomena relating to consciousness itself objective science has failed to a spectacular degree and that anyone who looks at the data with any sort of genuinely open mind must assume that the metaphysics of materialism has already been falsified

754013 at a s ance in 1880 sir george sitwell noticed that maries spirit robes covered corset stays so he reached out and grabbed hold of her he held on tightly to her and when he pulled aside florries curtain he found that the mediums chair was empty he was not surprised to discover that he was holding onto florence clad only in her underwear
754014 before this seance florence dressed in the garments provided was not left a moment alone she was most securely bound to her chair which was fastened to an iron ring in the floor and each hand was tied to an arm of the chair everything was found intact afterwards cit medhurst and goldney 1964 pp 84 85 6 gambier bolton in his documented ghosts in solid form bolton 1919 provides primary evidence that he himself repeatedly tested florence cook then mrs corner when she was in her forties he states that her materialisations were genuine proved and repeatedly witnessed by highly critical sitters in the light not in darkness 7 bolton applied the same stringent controls on to florence cook as crookes did himself the s ances took place in the homes of himself or a friend which was searched prior to the sitting by an architect the medium herself was searched in her clothes and body by a doctor before the sitting the medium was dressed totally in black even underwear the medium was bound with all knots sealed the medium was seated on a self registering weighing machine to which an electrical alarm was secretly hidden

754038 you cannot trust your physical senses to give you a true picture of reality they are lovely liars with such a fantastic tale to tell that you believe it without question
754039 for empedocles exactly as for parmenides one of the most extraordinary facts about human existence is that people appear to be such creatures of the senses and yet never use their senses at all
754040 they are just used by them bashed around by them buffeted here and there and the worst aspect of this situation is the way we manage to believe like blind people so blind they think they are not blind that we can see the whole
754041 all things that we perceive as physical reality are really thoughts manifested by source within its own energy field

754044 if you believe that our sexuality divides quite nicely into gay straight or any other combination i think it is a sadly ill informed view

754047 sexual orientation is usually classified according to the sex or gender of the persons whom the individual finds sexually attractive the most common forms exists along a continuum that ranges from exclusive heterosexuality being sexually attracted to members of the opposite sex to exclusive homosexuality being sexually attracted to members of the same sex and includes various forms of bisexuality being sexually attracted to members of either sex
754048 homosexuality has been around since the dawn of time and although it has often been persecuted it has tended to be in religious societies in many other socities not controlled by religious books and bishops or derived from hebrew scripture it has been integrated into society and even revered
754049 i am quite surprised to find such attitudes demonstrated in this forum

754054 it provides a fascinating exposition on the nature of scientific skepticism with revealing stories of how some leading scientists changed from doubt to belief and then changed back
754055 however doubt isnt an end in itself it doesnt give us any knowledge its only a methodological tool to find the truth and avoid or reduce bias and prejudices when examining new claims
754056 of course there is searching filip inquiry into the nature of the self is searching so too is the whole of gods manifestation enquiring into who he is
754057 i once mentioned that i still have doubts despite all the evidence supporting the afterlife to my friend whos an atheist but a true skeptic not dogmatic he said that perhaps the reason that i still have so much doubt is because the fact that deep down inside i know that there is no such thing as paranormal nor afterlife nor god but a materialistic world and thats the ultimate truth
754058 100 certainty can not be found in science it is not made for this doubt is a normal part of life i doubt ultimate truth can be found in theories for me it is the absolute it is non dualism
754059 to say that subject merged with object might be almost adequate as a description of the entrance into cosmic consciousness but during cosmic consciousness there was neither subject nor object
754060 science is a tremendous tool for the investigation of material reality because of those successes skeptics assume that science will inevitably solve the riddle of existence itself essentially accepting the doctrine of promissory materialism which is nothing but an act of faith
754061 earth then is the training ground for mind which has become individualized here it is trained in image making through contact with earths grosser surroundings and as it develops it takes more and more control of its surroundings in the etheric world until ultimately we as represented by our minds and our surroundings become as we think
754062 if our investigations lead us to the tentative hypothesis that these phenomena exist they are natural and not supernatural for nothing which exists can be supernatural and therefore it is our duty to examine these occurrences just as we examine any fact in the visible realm
754063 to sum it up yes conservation of energy can be violated but nature makes sure it is always within the limits of uncertainty in other words the energy must be returned and the books set straight pretty quickly but the fact that it can be violated is important and although it can never be observed directly it does have important consequences
754064 it could be but in my opinion the falsehood of materialism is empirically proven by afterlife research and some psi effects
754065 i am the same this is a flesh and blood body though i see it as ethereal to your sight it is physical from cosmic atoms i created an entirely new body exactly like that cosmic dream body which you laid beneath the dream sands at puri in your dream world

754085 the petitioners theatrical movies are too valuable in this early distribution window to risk their exposure to unauthorized copying
754086 distribution over insecure outputs would facilitate the illegal copying and redistribution of this high value content causing untold damage to the dvd and other downstream markets
754087 what the mpaa is clearly trying to do here is start releasing movies on tv before theyre available on dvd
754088 but wants to do so in a way that users wont be able to record on their dvrs though they hardly come out and say that
754089 the use of soc by the studios would not deny consumers a right they presumptively have or a capability they currently enjoy
754090 the issue for the studios is whether unprotected outputs could be used to record the early release content in ways that are not currently permitted and then use that recording as the source for additional unauthorized copies
754091 cannot be left to the unfettered discretion of content owners and mvpds cable companies such unchecked authority places far too much power in the hands of content owners to the potential detriment of all other equally important stakeholders
754092 consumer electronics manufacturers such as tivo have made significant investments and brought innovative devices to market in reliance on the standards created by cablelabs
754093 for the new business model the waiver would make possible petitioners and mvpds should have the flexibility to use the technologies that are best suited to serve the needs of their mutual customers while balancing the need to protect their content
754094 there is no compelling need to establish an arbitrary fixed window for the proposed new services
754095 in fact there are compelling marketplace statistics that demonstrate such a regulatory limitation is unnecessary
754096 evidence which the mpaa has relied on in the past to demonstrate the dangers of the analog hole is unreliable and inapposite
754097 in the complete absence of evidence there is no reason to believe that additional costly restrictive technologies are needed
754098 the fact that almost no movies are made available to mvpds pre dvd release is clear and convincing evidence that the analog hole is an impediment to the early window release of high value content

754437 its a fairly new concept and we have included it from the current academic year
754438 the practice leads to greater class participation and boosts students understanding of the subject for films have a long lasting effect due to the effective use of visual medium
754439 i now have the attention of the class for full 90 minutes as opposed to the average attention span of 20 30 minutes prior to the introduction of these measures
754440 defined as a belief that israel must have all of the promised land including jerusalem to facilitate the second coming of the messiah
754441 its a very tragic situation in which christian fundamentalists certain groups of them that focus on armageddon and the rapture and the role of a war between muslims and jews in bringing about the second coming are involved in a folie deux with extremist jews
754442 the meeting was necessitated by concerns over the deteriorating situation but the jammu agitation was a very important part of the discussions
754443 the prime minister was emphatic that the bjp was not helping the larger cause of national security by fuelling trouble in jammu
754444 it is not as if we are not congressmen but we have to represent the sentiments of the region too if the restoration of forest land to the board is what it will take to end this anarchic situation it should be done
754445 it needs to be probed if mothers who had institutional delivery at government hospitals of santhal pargana had to run from pillar to post to avail of the benefits of the scheme
754446 in majority of the cases cash benefits are being given to mothers but i have received some complaints where some mothers have been denied the benefits i am looking into it
754447 officers staff should not leave their rooms unattended even during lunch hour
754448 the lunch hour the only time we are spared the tension of work will no longer be a time to relax
754449 the loss of any of these equipment including toners and cartridges used in these systems due to any reason will be tantamount to a loss to the department due to negligence on their part
754450 a series of thefts from a particular officials room will not be tolerated and action can be taken this may include deducting a part of his salary
754451 an inventory of expensive items equipment kept in the section room is to be maintained by all sections units etc which may be periodically verified with reference to the availability of such items
754452 there are enough escape clauses in the circular for us if something goes missing but the junior officials may suffer
754453 it is purely an unfortunate accident the deceased and injured are rag pickers who were sifting through their days collection they were trying to break open a shell to extract its metal part
754454 i had seen little shaqib playing just five minutes before the blast
754455 we always discard the shells inside the factory premises shells stashed with explosives are not supposed to go outside
754456 no the real killers sivarasan suba and dhanu are already dead
754457 some of the men clambered up the railings causing the wall below to collapse under their weight and they fell on the women and children below
754458 the stampede took place between 10 15 and 10 30 it was raining heavily and some of the pilgrims were in a rain shelter near the top while many others were still climbing when a single person started the rumour about a landslide
754459 there were a lot of people inside and we were trying to fight for space when everyone started falling over
754460 everything was going smoothly but when the police caned the pilgrims as the rush began the situation turned ugly
754461 even after the stampede police officers and district officials took two hours to arrive injured children were limping around but there was nobody to look after them
754462 it proves you can have a pharmacological equivalent of exercise
754463 thats as much improvement as we get with regular exercise
754464 this finding has potential to be further developed into therapeutics to mimic some of the cardiovascular benefits of exercise
754465 the chemical structures and synthesis process of these drugs are in the public domain
754466 the abuse of these drugs will be an unfortunate consequence of this study
754467 if you dont like exercise you love the idea of getting benefits from a pill

754469 over the last two years reports have surfaced that customs agents have been asking u
754470 these facts will conclusively establish beyond reasonable doubt the veracity of what we had complained
754471 as far as the other non congress entities are concerned these are mere allegations
754472 we are not only the fastest but has also clocked the largest numbers in obc quota
754473 at present we are clueless if this is in trichy or coimbatore
754474 we will be ready for increasing our intake by 6 of the present sanctioned class size of 300 this year itself we are expecting that we would have the additional classrooms and hostel rooms for taking in an additional 90 students during 2009 2010 and thereafter an additional 54 students in 2010 2012
754475 construction is on in full swing we will have 19 new classrooms in different sizes
754476 we will need to take in at least 13 more teachers
754477 we are giving support and advice in a limited manner to iim shillong by providing them with pgp rules and regulations system processes we are following and so forth
754478 they will not have to start from scratch we have helped them with the documents to get them going
754479 nothing has been decided as yet our resources are quite stretched too we will take a call when the time comes
754480 whenever the director of iim shillong needs support we will help out there are several areas in which we could extend support perhaps in setting up different programmes and in hiring faculty we will extend help as is required

754487 its postmodernism as intellectual radicalism if youre on the left politically you have to believe in all of this
754488 there are other traditions of being left wing which respect the facts which dont believe the world is simply what we believe it to be that think if youre going to make political arguments you have to have evidence to support them i want to reinstate that kind of rigorous realistic left liberalism
754489 postmodernism is addling the brain and wasting the time of some our brightest young people

754492 sally i am going for a walk can you ensure this parcel is delivered for me please
754493 no sally ill be out for a few hours so if anyone comes looking for me i wont be in but if matthew or danny asks tell them i have gone to the lodore falls
754494 are you going to tell us where the formula is or do i have to break every bone in your body
754495 who are you what is the meaning of this assault
754496 never mind who i am i want that formula and if you value your life you will tell me where it is or i will break your neck
754497 i dont have any formulas on me and if i did i would certainly not put them in the hands of you and whoever else is threatening me you have no power over me i defy you
754498 you dont mess with the james gang this is your last chance tell me or die
754499 danny whats going on what are the police doing here has there been a break in at the office
754500 brett can we come in id rather we discuss this inside rather than in the middle of the street
754501 sir i am afraid i regret to inform you that your cousin was found dead this morning at lodore falls
754502 well sir we found him at the bottom of the waterfall looks like he slipped and fell everything points to a terrible accident i am very sorry for your loss sir
754503 i want to go to lodore falls and see for myself
754504 brett you cant go up there you dont have the strength for such a strenuous walk
754505 danny i have to go and see this for myself matt was more like a brother to me than my cousin just as you are to me my dear fellow
754506 thank you danny i knew you would and im grateful for your support
754507 im sorry you saw that i had expected the body to be removed by now
754508 no please leave me now thank you for being at my side but i need time to myself
754509 alright ill go but if you need anything anything at all just call for me and ill be here
754510 watson my dear friend what is ailing you you have spent the last few nights pacing your room and now you are up at this early hour looking more tired than ive seen you in a long time pray tell me what is wrong
754511 holmes i know you know ive not slept well lately and i had hoped this would resolve itself by now but the fact of the matter is ive been having these terrible nightmares and i cant seem to make them go away
754512 perhaps it would help if you described what the nightmares are about john
754513 holmes i keep dreaming about the reichenbach falls and of losing you in that awful abyss and i
754514 i am so very sorry for the pain i have caused you i am here now and the danger from professor moriarty is pass
754515 he is still breathing holmes there is a pulse but it is weak
754516 he appears to have sustained a cracked rib and he has injured his shoulder ill need to examine him further can you help me carry him upstairs where i can lie him down on the couch
754517 hes badly hurt holmes he is severely concussed and has definitely cracked a rib there is severe bruising to his left shoulder which would be consistent with a heavy fall and there is renewed aggravation to earlier injuries which will cause him some considerable discomfort ive given him some morphine and he will sleep now for a few hours
754518 well watson it seems we have a case on our hands but we wont know more until he comes round you look tired why dont you get some rest and ill watch your patient
754519 thank you holmes i could do with some rest ill join you again in an hour
754520 steady man dr watson will never forgive me if i did not prevent you from undoing his ministrations
754521 who are you where am i and where is danny asked brett who was anxious for some answers
754522 ahh watson you came just in time your patient has woken
754523 my name is dr watson and this is sherlock holmes
754524 we found you unconscious in the hallway how do you feel
754525 then again i was ridden over by horses driven by a cabman racing his carriage so quickly i barely had time to clear out of the way
754526 mr sullivan sir brett sullivan not someone but people mr holmes
754527 i think you had better start from the beginning mr sullivan i should like to hear more of this
754528 mr holmes is a consulting detective he investigates criminal matters and may be able to help you
754529 i mean no offence but the keswick police couldnt help me and no one can protect me from the violent gang who wants me dead
754530 mr sullivan let me be the judge of that i enjoy a challenge i have already observed much about you i know you are a man with a military background having observed the service ring on your left middle finger and that you were an officer you have recently cut your hair shorter the contrast in skin colour from the back of your neck to the rest of your skin colour is testament to that i also deduce you are in mourning as you still wear black cufflinks which suggest it is a relative or close friend who has died finally i dont need dr watsons astute medical knowledge to tell me that you are carrying a heavy burden of some considerable distress by the shortness of your nails which you have bitten whilst stress and by the dark rings under your eyes indicating a lack of sleep pray tell me the facts and i will evaluate what you have told me
754531 mr holmes dr watson before i begin i must let danny know where i am he travelled down to london with me and we were staying at the richmond hotel would it be possible for me to get word to him
754532 would you be so kind to send a wire to the richmond hotel on behalf former sullivan here addressed to mr danny
754533 and inform mr sullivan that his friend is safe here in baker street
754534 mr holmes it was only when i received the watch that i realised my cousin had been murdered not fallen accidentally i knew matthew would never have parted with his pocket watch unless it was for a reason i checked the watch out thinking maybe it was broken but when i opened the back to examine it i found a small piece of paper hidden inside
754535 well mr holmes said brett i opened the piece of paper and on the paper was the formula for a new type of explosive there was also a message written to me by my cousin which simply said forgive me for the pain i will cause that for me was further indication that something was terribly amiss with his death at the falls
754536 if you mean the original piece of paper yes i do but i have it secured away in a personal vault at barnetts hoares hanbury and lloyd in lombard street it was the safest place i could think of given that it has cost blood already but i have memorised the formula if you want to know what it is
754537 if you would be so kind mr sullivan i have some knowledge of chemistry and this would be of interest
754538 this formula is for gelata lignis which translated from latin would be known as gelignite explosive which is a very revolutionary development in the field of explosives are you aware of what this formula was for mr sullivan
754539 mr holmes has a very formidable knowledge in the field of chemistry
754540 i did know what the formula was for but i dont understand the chemistry or how it is made all i knew was that matthew had been given it by a friend to experiment with to see if it really would make blasting rock easier as part of the civil engineering activities for the business he had already tried it in a limited capacity and the results were promising thats why he wanted financial backing to expand the experiment and produce larger amounts of the stuff to make it commercially viable to use
754541 and i am willing to wager it was not long after this that your cousin started to get the threats
754542 thats right after matthews funeral danny and i went back to the office to sort out the paperwork and we discovered the evidence of intimidation and threatening letters
754543 did you report this to the police to that inspector roche who was present when conducting the investigation into your cousins death
754544 i believe you mr sullivan from the evidence you have told me so far i am sorry you had to experience such a poor example of what british justice can do i will endeavour to correct that but you have more to tell us otherwise you would not be sitting here in baker street recovering from your injuries please continue your narration of events and give me the facts as they occurred
754545 im sorry mr holmes this is just so difficult for me but you are right there is much i have to tell you
754546 after the corners inquest danny and i decided to conduct investigations of our own we went through the threatening letters with a fine toothcomb and examined the company records for details of the creditors matthew had approached and began to make enquiries we learnt that most of the creditors matthew had correspondence with were of good faith and had in fact declined to get involved with the funding of an unproven product but there was one firm who expressed an interest and matthew had accepted their financial assistance the name of the firm was sykes holdings ltd as both danny and i were to discover that was a front for a more sinister organisation which we came to know as the james gang
754547 that is indeed of considerable interest as i have heard of this gang being active in several recent cases i have been involved in please continue mr sullivan
754548 before danny came to serve in my regiment in afghanistan he had served a few months in the military police on the north west frontier boarder so he was able to utilise his experience and knew the types of questions to ask of course the more questions we asked and the deeper we got into our private investigations the more attention we attracted and the james gang did not take kindly to our activities
754549 it was three months ago that things started to take a turn for a worse when danny was attacked on his way home from the company office which had become a base of our investigation he was beaten and his leg was broken in the attack it was then that we decided to it was no longer safe and we decided to go on the run like a pair of common criminals we were constantly looking our shoulders and realised this james gang had people following us every step of the way eventually we arrived in london a fortnight ago we had hoped we would be safe here and for a while nothing happened and we began to breathe more easily that is until last night when we received a direct threat to both of our lives we found our hotel room ransacked and during the night an intruder broke into our room and tried to smother me fortunately danny sleeps lightly and was awoken by my struggle to free myself from the attacker he managed to fend him off and received a stab wound to his arm for his efforts it is the second time my sergeant has saved me from certain death
754550 it was then that we decided we had to come to see you so this morning i made enquires as to where you were and told danny to stay at the hotel i was walking back to the hotel when i was attacked yet again it was down a little side street a shortcut back to the hotel i had come to known and use the horse and carriage were being driven wildly and i was caught in its path there was very little i could do to escape it and i tried to throw myself clear and barely did so in time but not before landing heavily on my shoulder before i had time to recover from this incident i was hauled off the ground by a thoroughly unpleasant man who said he had a message for me and proceeded to attack me punching me in the chest and stomach and i was thrown to the ground once more hitting my head against something i dont know what he said mr james had run out of patience and the time for words was over
754551 no danny and i have never met him but it is our understanding that he is the leader of this gang after all it is known as the james gang
754552 can you remember anything more after your assault this morning
754553 no doctor i dont remember much just flashes i must have been disorientated after the attack and i was left alone and i really dont remember much i suppose in my confusion i was drawn here guided by what danny and i had decided earlier on to consult you mr holmes
754554 thank you mr sullivan for telling me what you have told me it is most intriding but you must rest now and i have much to consider
754555 mr holmes i have told you the facts as i know them but what i want to know is why why is this gang so desperate to obtain the formula
754556 that is the heart of the matter mr sullivan why indeed
754557 holmes mr sullivan is asleep now what do you make of this case
754558 my dear watson i fear that mr sullivan and his friend are in grave danger and that this case is far more dangerous and goes deeper than we have encountered for some time i would advise you to remain armed at all times until this is over
754559 follow me and i will tell you what you want to know
754560 hey i thought you had information for me not an invitation to a bar brawl
754561 wrong mister your friend is dead and you are next
754562 are you going to tell us what we want to know
754563 i dont know where the formula is and even if i did i will not betray the confidence of my friend my brother
754564 you can kill me but you will never seek what you are looking for ill see you in hell first
754565 god wants you to die so he can see you

754572 the silverlight client periodically polls the service on the network layer and checks for any new messages that the service wants to send on the callback channel the service queues all messages sent on the client callback channel and delivers them to the client when the client polls the service
754573 the polltimeout property determines the length of time in milliseconds that the service holds a poll from the client before returning the inactivitytimeout property determines the length of time in milliseconds that can elapse without any message exchange with the client before the service closes its session
754574 the duplex support does use polling in the background to implement notifications although the way it does it is different than manual polling

754577 the struggle in the country is now turning from a sectarian to an ethnic one due to the kurdish behavior which poses a danger on the country
754578 there are efforts and wishes to end this crisis but they always fail due to the obstinacy of the kurdish parties that want to annex kirkuk at any price
754579 i hope they can reach a solution that fits all parties and prevents the situation from deteriorating further
754580 the mistakes of politicians brought us to this stage our social fabric was torn up in kirkuk and this is very dangerous for all of iraq

754594 i am originally from northern italy from a town called treviso but i have been working in rome at the vatican they have recently received the archives back there and i was granted papal permission to do some research for the scaligeri family but that is not the point of this i found there the information we have already spoken of and so i set forth to come and find out for myself whether the rumors were true my journey called for me to stop over in istanbul and through speaking with some fellow countrymen i was eventually directed to signor gallo it was after speaking with him and i do hope you are not offended when i say he is a most disreputable fellow that he spoke of his good friend talamaur upon further enquiry it was he that suggested that i come here and seek you out as in his words talamaur is the only one that can show you what you need to see as for anton craiovescu i admit i have made copious notes about him from what i found in the archives and i will have to refer to them in order to give you the most accurate information but for a basic introduction to him i am sure i can remember some he was in the employ of the church as a liaison of sorts between the roman and russian orthodox churches he was renowned for his abilities to seek out those that would be heretics and make examples of them through torture and terror of course in those days it was considered the best and most efficient was of keeping the masses subjugated and with the inquisition in full swing you could say that he was one of there most beloved instruments after the inquisition however and the new direction that the churches had taken it was decided that he was of no further use to them and he was discarded thrown aside like so much offal to anton this was a betrayal most profound for all that he had given to them and this was how he was to be treated the church that day made one of its worst mistakes and anton the benevolent became anton the blasphemer he returned home and used his influence to abolish the churches reach in his lands of course there is much more to his tale than this but for that i shall have to collect my notes
754595 do please forgive my curiosity but are we not returning to my hotel it is after all quite late
754596 i thought you may want to start your research tonight it is said when it comes to gathering information
754597 come ms mancinelli it is right this way you will find that privacy is my strongest desire this is why i chose such a location for my research
754598 if you look to your right you will find the room with all of my scrolls if you will follow me i shall show you the ones you may find of interest
754599 on this table is everything that you may be looking for dozens of scrolls and books that i am sure you will find of extreme interest
754600 forgive me signor talamaur but my name is mancinelli not mancini although i can see the resemblance and how one might be mistaken to some i may appear to be an explorer of sorts but i am only here to find answers to questions that have risen in my studies it was a signor gallo in istanbul that spoke of you and intimated that it would be you that would be able to aid me
754601 i have spent some time in the recently returned archives of the vatican and whilst searching for some unrelated materials i happened across a reference that indicated and forgive me if this may sound fantastical that the mythological creature known as the vampire may in fact not be a myth at all but a true and tangible being i did some further research which indicates that the vampire is resistant to most things and that they are capable of great feats that are beyond the normal reach of mere man it is my thought that if i could find such a creature or being that i could find some way of extracting some of its blood and with some testing perhaps find a way to transfer some of its natural resistances to people such as myself so that the threat of disease could be eradicated the only line i have to follow is the name of the being mentioned in the essay and that was an anton craiovescu the only other reference i could find to that name was an obscure notation in an old parchment that noted the royal families of eastern europe
754602 i have heard of such a creature it has been a long time myth of romania that these creatures live among us hiding in the shadows opportunistically preying upon the flesh of humans i have also been unfourtunately inclined to be accosted by one of these creatures a few times during my stay here most would have considered me insane for spouting such rubbish but the one thing you should always remember in romania all myth attains some truth and what happens in romania stays here unspoken and unchallenged
754603 i have been a historian in romania for many years the scrolls and information i have attained span centuries and much of them have to do with the myth of the vampire and the attributes and truisms in which have been discovered i would be willing to share them with you in your humanitarian quest i only ask that you tell me all you have read and know about anton craiovescu i have heard the name before but i have not been able to dig up much of him
754604 please ms mancinelli tell me how it was you found me there are so few who look for historians these days what is it you know about anton craiovescu
754605 good evening signor talamaur my name is isabella mancinelli we have an appointment
754606 good evening ms mancini i am talamaur please come in
754607 i have heard many things about you ms mancini you have been an interesting focus since you have come into the city
754608 from what i hear youre an explorer and have been for some time which is why you have so eagerly sought my attention
754609 tell me what makes you think i can or will help you
754610 setting the minimum marriage age at 18 has been a proposal since 2000 but the yemeni parliaments islamic sharia codification committee has not yet presented the amendments to parliament for discussion
754611 but amendments to the law in 1999 made it unclear and the law now fails to mention an exact minimum age for marriage it only authorises the girls guardian to decide whether she is physically and psychologically prepared for marriage
754612 but there are extreme groups in society and in parliament which are against amending the law

754628 they saw him mr cowdrey three times bobbing up and down in the river
754629 they did have contact with him yelling out screaming to him to get to the other side of the river
754630 all of a sudden he just went down and he never came back up
754631 we all look after each other thats a big thing in our team
754632 six of the boys were walking into town when three of them decided to get a run on three others including mr cowdrey were left behind and walking at their own pace
754633 he was looking down at the river saying something to the boys and they told him to get down in a split second he fell
754634 whether he was feeling the effects of that who knows bit exhausted bit of concussion there was some heavy knocks
754635 with the limited resources they police have we dont expect every man and his dog to be down here but if it was anyone elses friend im sure theyd sympathise with us wed like to see people walking along the banks and a boat on the river if possible just searching the site
754636 we never give up hope but he hasnt been found well look every day

754689 most of our brothers showed unbounded love never sparing themselves and thinking only of one another heedless of danger they took charge of the sick attending to their every need and ministering to them in christ drawing on themselves the sickness of their neighbors and cheerfully accepting their pains
754690 the heathen behaved in the very opposite way at the first onset of the disease they pushed the sufferers away and fled from their dearest throwing them into the roads before they were dead and treated unburied corpses as dirt hoping thereby to avert the spread and contagion of the disease but do what they might they found it difficult to escape
754691 he has started recall campaigns against nearly every one of harlems elected officials and criticized neighborhood acolytes like former president bill clinton the rev
754692 pastor manning was commissioned by the lord god almighty to go into harlem and preach righteousness and the lord god would clean that community from river to river

754720 by dr hector avalos please note the following response from dr hector avalos is about 10 500 words its pretty long but since copans essay was very long there were a lot of items to respond to unless noted otherewise all biblical translations are those of the rsv in an blog essay titled is yahweh a moral monster the new atheists and old testament ethics
754721 unlike biblical laws no cuneiform law is ever motivated by reference to an historic event a promise of well being or a divine will
754722 that your days may be long in the land which the lord your god gives you
754723 the importance of the motive clause in old testament law
754724 say to aaron and his sons and to all the people of israel this is the thing which the lord has commanded
754725 this is nothing more than mere assertion no biblical text is offered to support this allegation in fact jesus seems to take this law very literally in matthew 5 38 39
754726 an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
754727 the overriding goal in deuteronomy 15 is that there be no slavery in the land at all vv 4 11
754728 for the poor will never cease out of the land
754729 am i not allowed to do what i choose with what belongs to me
754730 later in amos 2 6 8 6 slavery is again repudiated
754731 for three transgressions of israel and for four i will not revoke the punishment because they sell the righteous for silver and the needy for a pair of shoes amos 8 6 that we may buy the poor for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals and sell the refuse of the wheat
754732 abolishing in his flesh the law of commandments and ordinances
754733 but i preferred to do nothing without your consent in order that your goodness might not be by compulsion but of your own free will
754734 the ancient near eastern background of the love of god in deuteronomy
754735 i have set my king on zion my holy hill
754736 genocide is ok when my religion does it but genocide is not ok if your religion does it
754737 these narratives also inform us that israels kings no matter how powerful are not above gods law nathan confronts david about his murder and adultery 2 sam 12
754738 furthermore in babylonian or hittite law status or social rank determined the kind of sanctions for a particular crime whereas biblical law holds kings and priests and those of social rank to the same standards as the common person the informed inhabitant of the ane would have thought quick get me to israel
754739 there are many servants nowadays who are breaking away from their masters
754740 even later on when the jews returned from babylon nehemiah was properly appalled by jews opening themselves up to idolatry by marrying foreign wives for example neh 13 esp v 25
754741 you have trespassed and married foreign women and so increased the guilt of israel
754742 laws made by kings not gods versus laws from god mediated through moses
754743 because they did not go with us we will not give them any of the spoil which we have recovered except that each man may lead away his wife and children and depart
754744 you shall not do so my brothers with what the lord has given us he has preserved us and given into our hand the band that came against us 24 who would listen to you in this matter for as his share is who goes down into the battle so shall his share be who stays by the baggage they shall share alike
754745 laws to glorify kings versus laws to glorify god and to instruct torah instruction people and shape a national character
754746 i have made a covenant with my chosen one i have sworn to david my servant
754747 laws reflecting kings unlimited authority versus laws limiting the kings authority for example deut 17 14 20
754748 offenses against slaves as on the same level as property crimes for example oxen versus offenses against slaves as persons of value
754749 religious sins not typically capital offenses versus a number of religious sins as capital offenses idolatry deut 13 6 9 false prophecy deut 18 20 sorcery lev 20 27 blasphemy lev 24 10 23 sabbath violations num 15 32 6
754750 these dreadful laws are notable for the ferocity of their physical punishments in contrast to the restraint of the mosaic code and the enactments of deuteronomy and leviticus
754751 babylon and assyria as well as sumer practiced the river ordeal when criminal evidence was inconclusive the accused would be thrown into the river if he drowned he was guilty the river gods judgment but if he survived he was innocent and the accuser was guilty of false accusation
754752 god says idolatry is bad and so idolatry is bad because god says it is bad
754753 whatever god says is good because whatever god says is good
754754 ty youre deluding yourself if you think you ever had the abillity to form intelligent thoughts
754755 i was a christian but then i became an atheist and decided to no longer do evil
754756 i find it odd that atheists say atheism has no moral content yet that atheists are still good
754757 i was a christian but then i became an atheist and decided to no longer do evil
754758 heres what i believe right now and it may change tomorrow a higher power greater than myself who is loving
754759 oooh look at me i understand that cash values in the modern economy can be treated as abstractions rather than amounts of actual physical currency i know how to look up things on ians enormoushop com wish list im the greatest wife and greatest human being in history

754767 i do not believe in a personal god and i have never denied this but have expressed it clearly if something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it
754768 i believe in spinozas god who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists not in a god who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings
754769 god who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists
754770 the further the spiritual evolution of mankind advances the more certain it seems to me that the path to genuine religiosity does not lie through the fear of life and the fear of death and blind faith but through striving after rational knowledge
754771 i cannot believe that god plays dice with the cosmos
754772 the word god is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weakness the bible a collection of honourable but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish
754773 no interpretation no matter how subtle can for me change this
754774 for me the jewish religion like all others is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions and the jewish people to whom i gladly belong and with whose mentality i have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people
754775 as for the god debate newton einstein euler and other great minds believed in god and their own personal reflection on metaphysical issues was interwoven with their ongoing scientific and mathematical work
754776 because einstein did or did not believe in god you should or shouldnt as well
754777 the point here is that that einstein did not artificially divide his world into that which is scientific and that which is religious nor should we
754778 the problem emerges when people who believe in things without physical evidence state them as fact
754779 what i am really interested in is knowing whether god could have created the world in a different way in other words whether the requirement of logical simplicity admits a margin of freedom
754780 the point here is that that einstein did not artificially divide his world into that which is scientific and that which is religious
754781 the religious feeling engendered by experiencing the logical comprehensibility of profound inter relations is of a somewhat different sort from the feeling that one usually calls religious it is more a feeling of awe at the scheme that is manifested in the material universe it does not lead us to take the step of fashioning a god like being in our own image a personage who makes demands of us and who takes an interest in us as individuals there is in this neither a will nor a goal nor a must but only sheer being
754782 feeling engendered by experiencing the logical comprehensibility of profound inter relations
754783 i know what i like thats the joy of art its your own expression of taste
754784 if you add two ounces of vinegar to the washing machine you will get rid of lint
754785 when i look in the mirror i see only imperfections
754786 i hadnt gone through life thinking i was gods gift but i always hoped id look great or have brilliant bone structure now i am happy being me because no one else can do it

754867 no s si voy a ser tomado en cuenta para la selecci n claro que quiero estar para eso trabajo en mi equipo chicago fire de la mls
754868 no me importa un tope de naturalizados en la selecci n s me importa que se reduzca el n mero de extranjeros por equipo los naturalizados que sean mejor que un jugador nacido en el pa s son bienvenido al equipo
754869 se me hace un buen jugador creo que puede aportar para el equipo
754870 es dif cil para l despu s de tanto tiempo de estar de titular en am rica l es como un hermano crecimos juntos nos bamos juntos en el metro en el pesero para llegar al entrenamiento entonces me duele la situaci n por la que est pasando
754871 seguir trabajando no desesperarse y demostrale al t cnico que tiene capacidad que despu s de tanto tiempo no puede estar en la banca tiene que estar de titular y tiene que mentalizarse de que puede estar de titular otra vez
754872 con mucho gusto lo llevar a a mi equipo chicago fire
754873 ustedes saben del car cter que tengo ca en una provocaci n y estoy triste por lo que pas y ahora a estar m s tranquilo en la cancha
754874 cuando sufre una expulsi n llega a su habitaci n se recrimina y se dice que es un tontito por caer en la provocaci n pero tambi n me digo que es una y otra patada y es dif cil aguantar
754875 les prometo que a partir de ahora me voy a portar bien
754876 son rivales con los que hay que hacer un esfuerzo a adido
754877 son rivales con los que hay que hacer un esfuerzo a adido porque no son de tanto nombre como otros m s conocidos es un arma de doble filo pero la concentraci n ser como si fuera un rival de nombre con la intenci n de dejar sentenciada la eliminatoria cuanto antes
754878 tenemos que tomarla la eliminatoria muy en serio porque a n no estamos en la champions de verdad el equipo trabaja intensamente y se es el camino para conseguir grandes cosas
754879 las ganas son superiores a las de otro partido cualquiera
754880 la adaptaci n es muy f cil con personas como las que hay aqu
754881 sneijder no est bien y estamos todos asustados por la lesi n es un momento muy dif cil tiene mucho dolor hay que hacer la ltima prueba creo le vamos a perder alg n tiempo hay posibilidad de que sea el ligamento cruzado es una lesi n dura esperemos que sea menos al final
754882 si vemos que en la falta de la jugada de la lesi n de wesley ni ha pitado falta qu vamos a hacer es lo ltimo que quer amos se puede perder por un penalti pero no con esa dureza
754883 no salimos con la concentraci n necesaria en los primeros minutos
754884 me parece que fue solamente el inicio del partido despu s de los errores que tuvimos el equipo reaccion muy bien tuvo una actitud de querer recuperar generamos much simas situaciones por supuesto hay que mejorar con respecto a lo que nos pas al inicio del partido tener otro tipo de actitud otro tipo de efectividad pero eso lo va a ir mejorando
754885 lo que intentamos es que el equipo juegue como en el segundo tiempo me parece que esa es la actitud que queremos la agresividad por ah no salimos con la concentraci n necesaria en los primeros minutos tuvimos un par de errores que se corrigen lo que no se corrige es no tener situaciones pero el equipo cre much simas por eso me quedo muy conforme
754886 s me estoy preocupando pero lo importante es que el equipo gane
754887 en lo personal llevo dos partidos donde no me he encontrado ni un bal n ni un remate ni nada la verdad s me estoy preocupando pero lo importante es que el equipo gane creo que cuando no tienes llegada de gol ni un remate el delantero no existe s estoy molesto y preocupado y ahora espero salir de esta rachita
754888 presi n no tengo simplemente tengo muchas ganas aunque sea de fallar muchas de gol desafortunadamente no las he tenido y no queda m s que trabajar y trabajar para salir de esta racha
754889 la verdad es que muy bien pues a diferencia de la anterior pretemporada me encuentro en el aspecto f sico estupendamente claro atento para lo que viene esta temporada que ser muy importante por el aliciente de poder jugar la champions league
754890 las perspectivas son excelentes ya que se ha mantenido pr cticamente el bloque de la pasada campa a y han llegado buenos refuerzos la meta es poder superar lo que se hizo hace un a o
754891 primero conf o que las lesiones me respeten que si dios me ayuda en eso pueda tener una mayor continuidad es decir poder disputar el mayor n mero de partidos posibles ojal que sea titular en muchos de ellos y anotar muchos goles superar los ocho que logr la pasada campa a
754892 conf o que podamos hacer un buen papel en la liga al menos igualar el segundo puesto alcanzado la temporada pasada despu s hacerlo bien en la champions y tambi n en la copa del rey ser a bonito poder conseguir alg n t tulo
754893 ser otra piedra de toque importante para nosotros como lo fue con anterioridad el liverpool o el pasado s bado el zaragoza son juegos que nos sirven mucho para ir cogiendo la forma y el ritmo necesario de cara al comienzo de la liga que arranca a finales de este mes
754894 de momento no me ha llegado ning n llamado pero ante todo lo que debo hacer es seguir prepar ndome lo mejor posible con mi equipo es decir trabajando duro en la pretemporada la selecci n es una consecuencia de que lo est haciendo muy bien en el villarreal
754895 lo cierto es que no he podido hablar todav a con eriksson ni con paco ram rez su ayudante aunque l gicamente me har a una ilusi n enorme jugar ante honduras en el inicio de el premundial
754896 s como no a leandro augusto lo conozco bien de haber jugado contra l cuando yo estaba en el monterrey es un gran futbolista y todos los jugadores que puedan dar algo importante son evidentemente bienvenidos a la selecci n como cuando a m se me dio la oportunidad de jugar con m xico lo mismo digo si se se da la convocatoria de mat as vuoso que asimismo lo tengo visto de la liga mexicana y se trata de otro gran jugador
754897 eso ser a lo l gico porque en casa no se puede perder si nos queremos calificar para el mundial en teor a no habr a que tener problemas para ganar en el azteca a honduras pero nunca hay que subestimar al rival juegue o no juegue yo hay que dar una buena imagen para sumar los tres primeros puntos del premundial
754898 hace unas semanas estuve en monterrey pero en ese momento el equipo estaba en vacaciones el torneo pasado el equipo se meti a la liguilla creo que con la experiencia de otro a o y con un buen t cnico como la volpe se puede aspirar esta vez a lograr el t tulo que es algo que le deseo de todo coraz n a esta instituci n
754899 la idea que yo tengo es retirarme en el monterrey pero ya sabes que el futbol da muchas vueltas y a lo mejor no es posible el 30 de junio del 2009 finaliza mi contrato con el villarreal y ya veremos qu es lo que pasa luego de esa fecha es decir si sigo en europa o me regreso a m xico
754900 yo quiero arrancar de titular pero esa es decisi n del entrenador
754901 por suerte se pudo conseguir esta victoria que nos viene muy bien an micamente
754902 estamos muy bien cada equipo va ganando confianza y responsabilidad sabemos la importancia que tiene este torneo para nosotros m s all que sea la segunda fecha y bueno por ah nos quedan detalles que mejoraremos en cada partido y entrenamiento
754903 it will be a sea of humanity there will be thousands of community leaders from all of the towns in the province they will participate in the rally willingly because they dont want any part of the province becoming a component area of the ancestral domain without prior consultations
754904 he garcia said it was a mistake i said it was a fatal mistake
754905 our intention is to show our unity in purpose of opposing the inclusion of zamboanga city in the bangsamoro juridical entity we both christians and muslims alike have spoken and resoundingly voted against this
754906 tension is brewing in mindanao and old wounds are being reopened unnecessarily because of this controversial grp milf ancestral domain accord
754907 the president was very happy that we are getting very close to having lasting peace in mindanao with the signing of the moa
754908 the signing will proceed the petition before the supreme court and the protests will not affect it
754909 it is just a moa and not a final peace agreement yet
754910 it is still subject to further negotiation along with the other aspects of the entire peace process
754911 when it comes to the final peace agreement that would be the time that it could be legally questioned already but we are far from it yet
754912 democracy is alive and it shows that we prefer to talk
754913 to forget all those who died and the victims of violence
754914 do they want more killing more bloodshed and more violence in mindanao are they asking the people to choose war over peace this peace process is better than open warfare
754915 so we have to go through the legal and constitutional process thats clear in the moa
754916 what could be better than plebiscites and going through the scrutiny of congress in consultations
754917 now were again being ignored despite our being elected officials on the issue of postponing the elections just because a rebel group has asked for it
754918 there will be no more chance for the 2010 elections to be fully automated if the august 11 armm polls are postponed
754919 there is no way we can stop the elections anymore
754920 this is the best way my move is not for me its for all of us
754921 if only we had these materials in the philippines we would have the best schools we wouldnt be in the third world anymore
754922 in the early 1900s shiploads of american teachers arrived in the philippines to set up free primary schools and teacher training institutes today the tide has turned the other way
754923 we were given advice by the flour millers that prices of flour would go up within the week from p920 or p930 per bag up to p970 to p975 per bag of flour this is the type of flour being used to make pan de sal and loaf bread this is a 5 5 percent increase in prices
754924 we are questioning the increase of flour why is it that prices of flour in the country would increase if the price in the market is going down since april 2008 up to now this is expected to go down by september up to december this year
754925 if there is also an increase in the supply of wheat the tendency is lowering of prices of wheat we are wondering why the local market prices are going up when the global prices are going down
754926 the dti should also investigate local flour millers and ask them to lower their prices based on prices of wheat in the world market freight charges also went down by 20 percent
754927 the leadership demonstrated by secretary lapus in the digital literacy development of filipino teachers will enrich student learning and global competitiveness of the philippines
754928 our students are the direct beneficiaries of our efforts to harness the power of technology to improve classroom instruction and icts are valuable tools to accomplish our goals
754929 there are web services software as a service service oriented architecture how many times has someone confused saas with soa the two can be and often are mutually exclusive
754930 many on demand and web 2 0 apps are in truth classic information silos with nary a soa as far as the eye can see yet the two service oriented approaches are often associated conceptually in conversation but rarely in implementation much to the detriment of web 2 0 likewise web services which contrary to popular sentiment are not a prerequisite for a soa donning asbestos suit powering up shields writing last will and testament
754931 other new technologies are also laying businesses open to danger service oriented architecture soa is one such technology it lets companies use gadgets widgets and mashups on their sites to create new applications and to use web applications to conduct their business
754932 vendor feeding frenzy the likes of which we havent seen since sun was the dot in dot com thats one big honkin slab of red meat dangling over a pool of hungry piranhas
754933 vendors are settling into different camps with different agendas different technological approaches and most important differing views of what constitutes a soa and why soas fail
754934 is soa doomed to suffer the same fragmented fate as other like minded approaches of the past

755027 oh yeah i popped out of the womb knowing i was going to be a writer
755028 hes improved so much his arm strength you know its not what it was before he first got hurt but it was pretty close
755029 we made him work a little bit there in the middle innings but we didnt take advantage of it that was really the difference for us
755030 thats a good start to having him back in the rotation
755031 in the fifth inning and sixth inning i got the ball up a little bit
755032 they made me pay they put some good swings on the ball
755033 we wanted to set a tone coming into the new month and i think we did that
755034 the teams been revived i dont think it was a matter of anyone coming or anyone going
755035 hes done a great job playing great defense and getting on base
755036 thats why they brought him here they thought he could come out and help this team win and thats what hes doing
755037 one of the things we talked about was not looking back or looking forward just attacking whats at hand
755038 i think where were at right now we can be pretty darn good
755039 but we did get a few home runs here which weve been lacking
755040 he threw a 100 pitches in the first few innings
755041 we had a lot of guys on base but just didnt capitalize on it
755042 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
755043 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
755044 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
755045 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
755046 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
755047 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
755048 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
755049 its a play ive made so many times i just didnt come up with it i know bright sky and all that stuff but i didnt make it

755088 la red freecycle naci en mayo de 2003 en la ciudad de tucson estados unidos para ayudar a reducir la basura provee a cualquier persona la posibilidad de reciclar cosas que no necesita es que lo que es inservible para alguien puede ser un tesoro para otro
755089 esto reci n est empezando somos 200 miembros y hay muy pocos activos pero es cuesti n de que freecycle se vaya haciendo conocido
755090 m s all de la diferencia en el n mero de miembros hay otras diferencias de base con los pa ses del norte uno ac tiene m s familiares o conocidos con necesidades y por eso es m s dif cil que alguien ofrezca objetos electr nicos all es muy com n regalar por ejemplo un microondas ac siempre vas a encontrar a un familiar que lo necesite y no vas a d rselo a un desconocido
755091 es cierto que las condiciones son diferentes all y ac en alg n momento tambi n nos preguntamos por qu en miami hay mensajes cada diez minutos y ac hay tan poco movimiento pero hace tres meses ramos 100 miembros y hoy somos 200 conf o en que vamos a ir creciendo
755092 no somos tan consumistas como en estados unidos por eso si bien el mecanismo de intercambio es el mismo nuestro c rculo tiene otro perfil hay entre nosotros mucha donaci n de libros de material para estudiar sin embargo aunque creamos que tenemos menos para dar hay nichos que tienen cosas que no quieren m s y otra gente las necesita por qu no pensar en freecycle para unir a todas aquellas personas

755109 crouched in a rat infested trench we were sandwiched between prometheus the renegade sky spider machine and a couple of hundred former humans their heads encased in sun bright tangles of alien machinery
755110 were running away from that thing a pretty sensible direction if you ask me
755111 but one hundred and eighty degrees from the direction id recommend
755112 there are more mind locked soldiers heading towards fortress city than i can count
755113 we know we can kill a human body that thing is unstoppable all we can rely upon are its good graces and it has precious few of those come back damn you
755114 well at least youre still sane if not quite sensible
755115 we must move past it quickly hopefully we will remain unnoticed
755116 and somewhere in there is the sky spider installation that eon 5 was despatched to
755117 if we head in there wed damn well better find what were looking for i passed right through the forests from one end to the other with a company of one hundred soldiers machineguns and the lot seven of us made it to this side five of those died within a week of stepping beyond the trees and the only other survivor besides me is assuming his condition is unchanged stark raving mad
755118 exactly what the sky spiders get up to when they decide to start changing the nature of earthly life we may perhaps learn something about ourselves about humanity i mean as much as that includes me
755119 yes perhaps we will just as long as it isnt our earthly lives that wind up changing
755120 i saw this rose in a friends garden and asked her the same thing and she laughed and replied this is a friendship rose and with that she broke a piece off gave it to me and told me to put it a good six inches into the ground if the rose grows from the cutting it is said that your friendship will last forever
755121 plant that cutting and our friendship will last forever too

755131 the rapid growth of the solar pv industry estimated at 40 50 year on year has put pressure on the raw material supply polysilicon globally the situation has led to skyrocketing polysilicon prices long term contract prices for polysilicon have escalated to almost three to four times the prices in 2004 whereas spot prices in a few cases have touched 380 400 a kg which is nearly 10 times the 40 a kg spot prices in early 2004
755132 india does not have any major domestic source of polysilicon except metkem solar sanmar group which supplies it in small quantities to bhel and bel for their solar cell production
755133 the rural telecom market is up for growth in the years to come there has been significant evidence that the problems associated with both the supply and demand side in the past that stunted the growth no longer exist
755134 there has been significant reduction in the tariff the lower tariff rate has made the mobile affordable to a large section of the rural population
755135 our internal estimate is that we are going to see a minimum subscriber growth of about 50 million or more every year in the rural areas till 2010 so that is the positive side of the story that we will have a much better teledensity than what we have today
755136 collaboration with local organisations is an essential part of the operators plans in the rural expansion project
755137 collaboration with people and organisations that share similar aspirations become essential as bhartis network goes deeper into the countryside to connect millions of people on the telecom bandwagon
755138 we were conscious of the fact that there was a huge potential in the interiors and a deep penetration with our network was the best strategy
755139 today our network covers over 94 of the population in bengal and have over 3 2 million subscribers
755140 it is not necessary for the operators to have their own network many newcomers will ride on third party network and will start offering vanilla services to the rural masses
755141 why i ask this question is because on an average 5 7 of the monthly expenditure of an urban family is on phone now the question is if that is the expenditure and if there is a major initial expenditure for getting the connection can we with a degree of confidence think that the rural population is capable of getting the connection
755142 why would he spend unless he is assured of getting relevant content if we do not have the kind of content which is going to be of use to the rural population then the growth will be let us say tardy and slow and that will be a cause of concern for most of us
755143 although other products were competitive and cost effective we chose cisco because of its reliability reference and brand name since we are located in a remote corner of the country we did not want to take any chances once the vendors were finalised the technical committee solution vendors hcl comet and other experts got together and devised a roadmap or a consulting bill for sourcing material
755144 our vision for assam university is to enable them to create value for their academic community and offer high quality education in the region an always available stable and secure network allow teachers and students to enhance their knowledge and share information that creates knowledge societies
755145 the cisco switch was installed in the computer centre as a core switch this switch had a redundant supervisor engine which would be active when the primary supervisor engine fails
755146 the cisco ws c3560g 48ts s switches were installed at the computer center library boys and girls hostels and in the departments of mba life sciences physics chemistry ecology and administration department among others
755147 the campus network has supported us well with the features that were implemented in both hardware and software we have been able to maximise network availability helping to ensure workforce productivity profitability and ultimately our success as a university
755148 with this the university can have distance learning programme where the teachers can deliver a lecture from the main campus similarly they can record these lectures and put them on a video portal where the students who have missed a lecture can view the same on their desktop or laptop

755154 after the lh s riots all the papers adopted one single voice against china without bothering about the truth this is what put the french people against us on the 7th of april when the flame passed through paris
755155 we were so proud that these games would take place in china
755156 on april 7th we wanted to please the french but the party didnt happen after the incidents around the passage of the flame we were all sickened and deeply hurt the idea for this gathering was born a few days later
755157 the president knows that because the troops are in harms way that we wont cut off the resources thats why hes moving so quickly to put them in harms way
755158 he could have told us about it sooner we found out about it as the troops were going in
755159 i think questioning the presidents motivations and suggesting that he for some political reason is rushing troops into harms way is not appropriate it is not correct and it is unfortunate because we do have troops in harms way
755160 we have never seen in our lifetime such a pityful display of opportunistic politics that reeks of cowardice and impotance
755161 its present and the issue is how do you deal with it
755162 thats the question of the day those networks are something youve got to deal with youve got to figure out bottom line who plans them who finances them who brings stuff across the borders
755163 when the efps start popping up we know oh thats iran thats shia
755164 they were initially used just down south where iran has a lot of influence
755165 that is a change if you follow the track of them it also follows the track of iranian influence
755166 we can look at it and say this comes from iran

755223 i taught american history at unlv for three semesters and i really really did not want my students simply to spew facts at me
755224 instead i wanted them to learn the relevance and meaning of some key facts and then to show me they could convey that relevance and meaning in a clear and convincing way sure it would be cool for young people today to know the facts of the great depression even cooler would be for them to be able to speak and write about it well employers i think place value on that ability not on knowledge of important battles in our past
755225 i was in gap a few weeks ago and there was some sort of generic indie music playing i was with a friend whos a promoter and a bit younger than me after about three or four tracks i asked him whose lp is this and he said no its a compilation every track sounded identical the guitars the production all these bands sound like theyre made in the same studio with the same producer its such a ball less soulless generic whitewashed indie sound you could probably take a member from each band and throw them together in a new group and no one would be able to tell the difference theyre completely interchangeable scouting for girls are like the sound of satans scrotum emptying theyre abysmal

755250 you got it backwards look at all we have now look at all the opportunity for those with the audacity and the drive look at all that we do so right the change we need most is to allow the individual to live free of government interference dictating how one must live
755251 barack obama will require you to work he is going to demand that you shed your cynicism that you push yourselves to be better and that you engage barack will never allow you to go back to your lives as usual uninvolved uninformed
755252 believe in a national purpose that is greater than our individual interests each and every one of us has a duty to serve a cause greater than our own self interest
755253 in which every voice can be heard and in which we build christian relationship
755254 is not that after two weeks we will find a solution to all our problems but we shall as i have written more than once in some sense find the trust in god and one another that will give us the energy to change in the way god wants us to change that is the most important thing we can pray for the energy to change as god wants us to change individually and as a communion
755255 i think its important i should say that its a great grief that many of our brothers and sisters in the communion have not felt able to be with us for these weeks a grief because we need their voice and they need ours in learning christ together
755256 i respect and accept the decisions that have been made but together we need in prayer to acknowledge the wound that that makes in our fellowship
755257 that we still have to mend relations that have been hurt i hope that in these weeks we shall daily be remembering those who are not with us upholding them in our prayers in our respect and love
755258 i dont imagine that simply building relationships solves our problems but the nature of our calling as christians is such that we dare not and i say very strongly dare not pretend that we can meet and discuss without attention to this quality of relation with each other even if we disagree or find ourselves going in different directions the lord of the church commands that we must love one another in the process and there is no alternative to that i trust that you are here in that confidence in that willingness to love one another
755259 because we know as we meet that we are also a wounded body
755260 but as we seek to meet jesus christ in each other we hope that the wounds that are still open will in some sense also be open to receive the work of god the holy spirit in our work
755261 needs a definite timeline to ensure confidence that the process has credibility
755262 there is a very strong feeling that we need another level of structure to have a clearing house for some of these issues
755263 i dont want to say anything about the detail because its a flag raised to see who salutes it
755264 controversies on grave questions which may arise among catholic scholars to ensure their proper interpretation
755265 the response to this film has been so overwhelmingly positive and weve received so many requests for a second showing that were thrilled to extend this preview to a wider audience
755266 this project reveals that there are homosexual anglicans in africa and it highlights the violence and inhumanity waged against them i urge as many people as possible to come and experience this preview
755267 the words and the message of christ are what offer the real contribution to lambeth and only in being faithful to the message and gods words can we find a mature way to find a road together
755268 i think its really very dangerous when someone stands up and says i have the way and i have the truth and i know how to interpret holy scripture and you are following what is the right way
755269 its really very very dangerous and i think its demonic
755270 the episcopal church has been demonised it has been a punching bag and im sick of being a punching bag as a bishop and im sick of my church my province being a punching bag
755271 gafcon is a rescue mission it is our duty to rescue whatever is left of the church from error
755272 from all those whoever they are who have chosen to mutilate to distort and to even deny the gospel and to preach something different from what we know
755273 respect is earned when it is thrown away gathering it can be difficult
755274 from the mother church of england there is the assumption that therefore we can do anything and africans will automatically come with us or respect us
755275 i think that is an insult the wider anglican world if you ask my opinion doesnt want to listen to us
755276 even though african archbishops have issued this blanket ban there is nothing to stop individuals from coming here
755277 we are not anywhere intending to imply that bishop gene robinson should resign we are aware that he was elected bishop according to the processes of the episcopal church whatever we may think of that
755278 an old world institutional response to a new world reality in which people are being set free from hatred and violence
755279 punitive in tone setting out penalties and the like instead of inviting us into deeper communion with one another through mutual understanding in the body of christ
755280 as an agreed benchmark from which it is assumed we can move forward it is not so
755281 address outstanding questions arising from the windsor report and the various formal responses from provinces and instruments of the anglican communion
755282 the breadth of the life of the communion as a whole
755283 the forum would be responsible for addressing those anomalies of pastoral care arising in the anglican communion against the recommendations of the windsor report
755284 it could also offer guidance on what response and any diminishment of standing within the communion might be appropriate where any of the three moratoria are broken
755285 and perhaps the escrow concept could even be extended to have some applicability here
755286 the patterns of action currently embraced with the continued blessing of same sex unions and of interventions could lead to irreparable damage
755287 to act in the anglican communion in a rapid manner to emerging threats to its life especially through the ministry of its chair who should work alongside the archbishop of canterbury in the exercise of his ministry
755288 my concern is how is it going to be applied its called a pastoral forum but will it be pastoral will it ultimately be juridical
755289 will it be used as an instrument to force people to conform and will it be another one of the situations where there is a right and wrong black and white and people will be divided from people even more will it be an instrument that will lead to a reconciliation or will it simply exacerbate the divisions we are in now
755290 and you have to go back and reverse actions i think that having made a decision some point in the past its changed the way we live and you cant go back and just say well just go back where we were
755291 my understanding of the gospel is jesus just meets us where we are he doesnt say well meet me somewhere else lets go into the past and well start again from that point
755292 seeks to impose a singular uniformity upon the complex diversity of our communion
755293 enjoy the same rights and responsibilities under the law as every other citizen
755294 it will put the anglican church of canada in the position of having to support and defend irrational prejudice and bigotry in the eyes of our nation
755295 isnt there something else productive that i should be working on
755296 what personal sacrifices might it involve for each of us
755297 you must not lie with a man as with a woman
755298 the bible clearly states that god doesnt like such behaviour hence the sodom and gomorrah scenario
755299 hollywood is full of self indulgent ego maniacal less than intelligent taint lickers who would sell their grandmother into white slavery and ship her off to an s amp m brothel in kurdistan just for the chance to get a speaking part on law amp order seriously we just stopped giving a fuck
755300 i really would like twins first so i can knock it right out have them two and then have one more
755301 dear sodomite supporter you are nothing but a dirty sodomite loving ugly stain of a man who is a disgrace to humanity

755340 first i would like to know if you already played in africa and with african musicians
755341 djibouti had a wonderful stamp with a train on it
755342 or was it a particular time in your life but maybe its not my business
755343 which was a lot of fun because i could basically take his music and destroy it
755344 so for that i will always be grateful to him
755345 that i did mostly in new york city with friends of mine in new york
755346 its my fault because that one is all mine so
755347 will be sold later if you wish if you already own them buy another because they make nice um coasters to put the drink on and if you dont like to drink you can play freesbee
755348 and he played the song and all of a sudden i thought
755349 and if he doesnt like it he doesnt have to pay me this time i just wanna do this
755350 because i know he did also and he was influenced by the same influences and um
755351 we havent adequately listened to the stories of gay people or adequately lived up to our obligations to pastoral care
755352 given the present state of the anglican communion it is the special collegial responsibility of the bishop to be at prayer for and with fellow colleagues
755353 this is particularly relevant for those bishops who are in conflict with one another their failure to attend fervently to this ordinal vow weakens the body of christ for which they have responsibility this in turn weakens the bonds that all the baptised share with one another
755354 but i am not interested in being a martyr i just want to be a bishop
755355 there is no place in the christian church for someone to say satan has entered the church with my consecration or that gay people are lower than dogs
755356 you cannot say those kind of things about gays and lesbians people and then be shocked when there is violence against them
755357 i would agree with many africans that there are so many more important things to be dealing with
755358 i would like to think i have raised the issue of how destructive dont ask dont tell can be
755359 i am pleased that our stockholders have followed the recommendation of the eds board of directors and supported the combination of eds and hp
755360 not only does the combination of these two great companies create immediate value for our stockholders it also enhances our ability to achieve our customers needs with our unwavering commitment to quality and innovation
755361 cloud computing is fundamentally about re engineering the worlds computing infrastructure to enable life changing applications
755362 to ibm cloud computing is much more than the normal evolution of a data center
755363 if you dont make the problems public the companies dont fix them and the consumers buy shoddy stuff
755364 the concept of responsible disclosure is well and good for new locks that havent hit the market yet but that doesnt help you when the lock is already embedded in millions of facilities theyre not going to fix them
755365 how does it help the consumer not to tell them that there is a vulnerability
755366 medeco customers have a right to know whether their locks can be compromised
755367 we believe that lock picking obviously is an illicit activity even if its a sport we frown on all of that even if its for fun
755368 as new technologies have become available that is what spurred product innovation and that spurs development of new standards
755369 our responsibility is to make changes when we see a change in the state of the art
755370 everybody has some responsibility to not disclose things that can hurt people and that people dont have power over changing
755371 is it a known vulnerability if people dont know about it
755372 im not sure you need to worry about it unless people are out there demonstrating it and showing how to do it
755373 the assumption is that the criminals dont know about it
755374 criminals know how to pick locks the secrecy just hides the truth from the consumer
755375 the goal is to make security better as soon as its not responsible to do research the bad guys win
755376 the lock picking industry doesnt get this because theyre basically still a guild a secret knowledge kind of field whereas computer security is always built on open knowledge
755377 there have been insecurities discovered by computer people turned locksmiths that have existed for hundreds of years
755378 let them make their security assessments based on how secure they are told the locks are
755379 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
755380 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
755381 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
755382 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
755383 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
755384 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa

755392 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
755393 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
755394 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
755395 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
755396 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
755397 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
755398 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
755399 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
755400 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
755401 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
755402 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
755403 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
755404 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
755405 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
755406 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
755407 lets go play in the yard for a little bit davy
755408 what were seeing is re recruiting and ongoing attempts by different armed groups to continue with the military option
755409 when you have armed groups in close proximity to each other and where we are not making progress on the political process the risk of an accident is always there and of course things can spiral out of control

755433 make a defense to anyone who asks me for a reason for the hope that is in me
755434 extremely disappointing in its brevity and lack of providing any kind of clarification on the specifics on the rationale of the ruling
755435 our next move is continue our efforts to ensure accountability for the school board
755436 we need to sit down as a group and see if we want to appeal this decision i think that it is very clear that if a circuit court could make such a decision that the school board did not act in excess of its authority we need to do something at the state level to fix the statute governing the boards authority
755437 the mccain campaign wasnt being racist they were being cynical
755438 you would think she had gotten accepted into harvard or yale we were so excited
755439 it makes me mad that people keep comparing me to amy winehouse and dusty springfield its just labelling me as something else without any respect for the struggle the determination focus or artistic vision i have
755440 its like whoa whats that about why would i want to be someone else because i really dont i just want to be me
755441 i got compared to diana ross the other day which was a real compliment and someone also wrote that i was the female otis redding which made me feel good because hes a hero of mine
755442 lois likes reese witherspoon because she played a similar part in walk the line
755443 my experiences post flight were ones of not being very productive for quite a while depression and alcoholism things like that i was trying to recover from that and ran into lois afterwards
755444 it was a few christmasses ago we went to our local bar we had a few shots of jack daniels whiskey and went to the tattoo parlour across the street i got this cute little celtic symbol on my hip and my dad got a gigantic philadelphia eagles logo tattooed on his arm he walks around so proud

755452 three orphanages have been visited already and photographs have been sent to her
755453 it is thought we are already down to a shortlist of ten girls aged between six and 18 months
755454 it was in front of cameron himself so the only option was to get drunk i probably did slur my words i cant remember
755455 it terrifies me to think that little kids are growing up in a country that is getting more and more violent kids carrying knives is just too awful to think about
755456 but we cant sit around being shocked we all have to do what we can to try to stop it
755457 all i think about is what sort of low self esteem and sense of self worth these kids have if they accept that being killed in this culture of violence is just a fact of their lives

755484 this is remarkable since namibia has now been independent for 18 years

755487 my contention is that were being forced to be on this system
755488 they dont seem to be willing to do anything other than follow the governing documents and have a referendum and leave it up to the residents to get enough votes
755489 people say reston is dark which is a good thing in some respects and not in others
755490 most lights are currently in the northern end of reston
755491 the southern community has very few lights glade drive for example is very dark
755492 reston has the worst of all possible policies and they are not working
755493 we appreciate the trees and the woods and the spirit of reston
755494 but there is lots of movement at night by people who do not live in our cluster we are concerned for our safety
755495 therefore no one will be declared righteous in his sight by observing the law
755496 therefore no one will be declared righteous in his sight by observing the law rather through the law we become conscious of sin
755497 he did this to demonstarte his justice because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished he did it to demonstrate his justice at the present time so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in jesus
755498 in the past god overlooked such ignorance but now he commands all people everywhere to repent
755499 do we then nullify the law by this faith not at all rather we uphold the law
755500 because he dared to trust god abraham believed anyway deciding to live not on the basis of what he saw he couldnt do
755501 you who brag about the law do you dishonour god by breaking the law
755502 not only so but we also rejoice in our sufferings because we know suffering produces perseverence perseverance character and character hope and hope does not disappoint us because god has poured out his love into our hearts by the holy spirit whom he has given us
755503 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
755504 you have value on the ground more than you spent
755505 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
755506 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
755507 on the design specific aspects of the application who our vendor is can make a lot of difference as to what technology we use for the design
755508 so when we didnt have the final vendor we werent able to answer the questions to either ours or the nrcs level that we wanted to answer those questions so we asked them to hold up on the review of the design specific parts of the application
755509 they did about 30 000 man hours of due diligence with toshiba to determine their abilities and as they did this due diligence they determined that not only are they capable of building the units to the standards that we expect but they are exceptionally able to build them to the highest standards
755510 toshiba has been lead contractor on two of the units built in japan and subcontractor on a third one
755511 and this rule means that all homemade electronics are confiscated because anything homemade with wires can look like a bomb to someone who doesnt know better the rule just doesnt work
755512 and in todays passengers fight back world do you think anyone is going to successfully do anything with a fake bomb
755513 thousands of dollars in excessive compensation for airfare hotels mileage and personal cell phone calls
755514 activities that cannot withstand public scrutiny without embarrassment do not safeguard the public trust in the integrity of mndot and undermine public trust in the department
755515 i get recognized for something positive that ive done or am doing but at the same time its not craziness its not like people magazine or something like that
755516 its not like britney spears in rehab like every moment is being photographed its cool that i get recognized but its not over the top
755517 last year i crashed into an obstruction in the road went airborne and broke one of my ribs and my right shoulder
755518 when riders are riding handlebar to handlebar at 35 to 40 miles an hour a crash like that can happen fairly quickly and leave you with a lot of road rash and other injuries in a case like that most racers will be more concerned about their bikes than themselves

755542 with these sort of events we tend to get a lot of late claims
755543 it ended up being 60 million because the storm did a lot of damage when it moved through auckland coromandel and the far north
755544 at the moment with this one our estimates remain the same but you can see even now that there are a lot of properties that are coming under threat
755545 the exception that is thrown when there is an internal error in the execution engine of the common language runtime
755546 when she made it clear she didnt want to have anything to do with him he became enraged
755547 after they made a deal they were following her to another motel room when they were approached by three males from behind and forced into a room at gunpoint
755548 todav a no hemos hecho nada pero este es el camino a seguir
755549 la capacidad de sufrimiento y la posesi n del bal n
755550 estamos teniendo mucha posesi n de bal n y llegadas por bandas el equipo ha sabido tocar hasta llevar la pelota a nuestros hombres m s r pidos

755565 we wanted to set a tone coming into the new month and i think we did that
755566 the teams been revived i dont think it was a matter of anyone coming or anyone going
755567 hes done a great job playing great defense and getting on base
755568 thats why they brought him here they thought he could come out and help this team win and thats what hes doing
755569 one of the things we talked about was not looking back or looking forward just attacking whats at hand
755570 i think where were at right now we can be pretty darn good
755571 but we did get a few home runs here which weve been lacking
755572 he threw a 100 pitches in the first few innings
755573 we had a lot of guys on base but just didnt capitalize on it
755574 i was in cairo a few weeks ago and one of things that was so striking is how impressed egyptians were simply with the prospect that after 9 11 americans might actually elect a man whose middle name was hussein
755575 and what the surge though has ironically done is make iraq safe for barack obamas foreign policy and the prime minister of iraq nouri al malikis domestic policy
755576 so the sad thing from mccains point of view is yes he was right but the story has moved on quickly past were you right or wrong about the surge to the effect of the surge on the whole region and the american presence in iraq
755577 i will withdraw all combat forces from iraq within 16 months
755578 hmm i think that obama guy has got it right
755579 i was in cairo a few weeks ago and one of things that was so striking is how impressed egyptians were simply with the prospect that after 9 11 americans might actually elect a man whose middle name was hussein
755580 but in the greater arab world does his parental history his fathers history mean he can move the arabs more than someone else might be able to
755581 cbs frets obama cant escape hussein middle name in israel
755582 the car is moving at the same speed as the belt
755583 the simple truth is that it is not physically possible for the conveyor to prevent the plane from moving no matter how fast the belt goes
755584 i ship some logs to europe to the japanese market to germany italian market korean market portugal
755585 i cover from missouri to maine and in canada from manitoba to nova scotia for specialty wood you know
755586 china is the biggest one india is up and coming
755587 china was always a cheap market for low grade stuff but they adapted
755588 market is just not there like it was last year
755589 gd petroleum is killing us strong dollar pushed everything else down
755590 i spend like 35 full weeks buying a year in the usa
755591 i think they should get a little bigger i dont like robbing the cradle
755592 i took four years of future farmers of america we planted walnut
755593 we did woodlot improvement on two different woodlots we own today
755594 very very bad thing is people who dont know how to do it a lot of people get hurt doing that
755595 my wife says that i have the life others would die for

755605 tiene una lesi n de ligamentos en la rodilla izquierda seguro que tiene roto el ligamento lateral interno y posiblemente el cruzado vamos a esperar a ma ana a los resultados de las pruebas para confirmar y dar un pron stico y el tiempo de recuperaci n y si debe pasar por el quir fano o no
755606 si fuese solo el ligamento lateral interno podr a esquivar el quir fano pero si adem s tuviese roto el cruzado por supuesto que tendr que ser intervenido

755611 im the first to admit im not familiar with the appeals process and the docking and mooring law
755612 im not here to push an agenda on the town but i need to ensure that alternatives are explored
755613 once this is broken it will open the door to other things
755614 i would hate to see south bristol be the first ones to trip on their shoes
755615 i was always taught that two wrongs dont make a right
755616 its very important that we continue to look for options that dont destabilize the cliff or gut the docking and mooring law
755617 the walkway over the water will have a positive impact by preserving the cliff
755618 the decision will be at the expense of the cliff or of the docking and mooring law
755619 which option is more permanent the docking and mooring law is a wonderful document but it has some holes you could drive a truck through its entirely dependent on upland zoning law both documents can be repaired the bluff cannot
755620 by approving projects like this it will expand the tax base
755621 we did not request a variance for any gain of our own it does not have an economic benefit for ketmar
755622 eu falei que nossa rela o era boa estava com um pouco de medo de n o ser escalado mas o treinador confiou em mim e me escalou estou muito feliz fiz o que pude e deu tudo certo

755626 i dont know what he heard but he went running out of there quick it kind of spooked him

755675 the sunday landing on the red planets arctic plains which ended a 296 day journey was right on target a feat nasas ed weiler compared to landing a hole in one with a golf ball from 10 000 miles

755705 peters impact on the field of access technology for the blind was major he moderated email lists organized conference sessions i particularly remember dueling scanners and wrote articles for the journals in the field peter believed strongly in the power of technology to help people with disabilities became an expert in the field and then committed himself to sharing that expertise widely his knowledge sense of humor and dedication will be sorely missed
755706 at experts received a terse email from a group we had never heard from before the contents of the email had so few facts and seemed so ambiguous that a bunch of us immediately thought it was some sort of spam fishing scheme then again we wondered who would go through the trouble of finding top at experts with widely read blogs just to hit us with some form of malware sy t greenbacks is a character i invented so he never does anything without me knowing about it in advance so i am aware of his evilocity well before he takes any such action marco zehes accessibility blog marco is another fs refugee now with mozilla and an undisputed expert in the field webvisum firefox extension

755708 you cant pet him now hes working if you see us in the park you can play with him then
755709 the purchase of five new tu 204 is also on the agenda
755710 waffle house has filed suit against dennys over the ingredients in a newly designed and quite novel omelet recipe
755711 well it also says something about improved placemats but as i havent eaten in either joint in about four years i cant really comment on either invention
755712 giraffe claims that the new dennys five egg banana omelet also contains philadelphia cream cheese jalapeno peppers and a secret sauce only previously known to exist in
755713 i havent looked at patent law since the old lpf days but this one looks kind of sticky
755714 the types who know patent law pretty well seem to go with waffle house the more emotional ones go with dennys and the political types are saying things like innovate dont litigate
755715 but this case actually seems to cover a pair of innovations
755716 the original five egg banana omelet on the over sized plate and the special placemat sounds pretty unique to me i cant think of any published prior art
755717 us law is based in first to invent but international patents go to the first to file im certain that waffle house was first to file and i cant think of a diner anywhere that served their special combination of eggs bananas on an oversized plate
755718 they might count for something maybe they have enough novelty to be considered a different invention altogether
755719 hes been preparing for the race i dont think hes paying attention to any of this
755720 enormous egg dishes with bananas fly in the face of sanity and bc has always been a bit on the edges of permanently crossing over into weirdsville
755721 lets get back to work and get our sweaty asses out of this jungle
755722 i have been seing a lot of this previously rare condition lately in patients who dine at waffle house or dennys
755723 incidentally this was some of the friendliest most genuine service in the city and made a big difference in my appreciation of the evening
755724 maybe i dont get any but at least im not a fat chick

755727 how should i know i just answered the phone and called you
755728 i got an email that said that if i sent 30 to a university in i would be granted a phd from any of the top universities in the world
755729 ok with that aside what can we do for you
755730 they are gps coordinates we dont exactly have an address other than those coordinates and the description that were in the 10 000 islands region of the western glades not terribly far from dismal key
755731 i have a rental how do i drive to this place

755733 your weird and annoying friend is wearing a hawaiian print short sleeve shirt silk tommy bahama shorts sperry topsiders and a fucking pith helmet hes carrying shopping bags from a bunch of designer stores and he screamed at me every time water sprayed onto the skiff
755734 im tripling my fee if ive gotta run him home
755735 of all of your weird fucked up twisted bastard friends this one takes the fucking cake if you get annoyed with him i can use him for crab bait
755736 from what sam says you brought with you you spent a whole lot of money on clothing for a different out here you wear crap that can be stained ripped covered with fish guts and more than anything else attire that you wont care if its stained by the coppertone sport and deet we practically bathe in
755737 i tend to catch a lot of fish and chuck brings us a grocery run once or twice a week
755738 so you mean we dont leave this floating chunk of a trailer park

755740 fresh grapefruit juice some orange and a couple cases of freska
755741 we smoke a little chronic a few times per year and sam has a cocktail here and there but otherwise we enjoy thinking clearly

755758 theres a whole new generation of young people that were born with hiv that are reaching adulthood it presents very interesting challenges
755759 they cant talk about their diagnosis in the school because they can be kicked out they cant talk about it in their communities with their neighbors

755790 the raf search and rescue teams are the most dedicated and professional in the world they provide at least one committed standby helicopter at six bases throughout the uk able to respond within 15 minutes
755791 changes have been made to crew structures at these bases in order to provide additional support to our top priority operations in iraq and afghanistan this will not affect normal search and rescue capability and our support to civil authorities during recent flooding shows our ability to respond flexibly to extraordinary requirements
755792 operations are always our priority we have to focus our resources on the frontline
755793 the fact that such an important public duty is being cut is the most graphic example of how incredibly overstretched our armed forces now are labour have consistently failed to match their commitments with resources and it now seems that public safety could be the latest casualty

755797 for people who think that this is going to lead us to disenfranchise any gay or lesbian person they are sadly mistaken

755799 i was stalking another woman i walked with her for a bit and from her perspective maybe it was unwanted attention

755837 that breast and that nipple ended up right in the shots the news bulletins used for coverage of the press conferences
755838 i truly hope the decision to carry out this absurd crazy pathetic comic and useless retouching has been carried out without berlusconis knowledge all the more so if the idea was to do him a favour by not associating in the public mind a boob with someone who is how to say susceptible to female charm

755865 there is for me a special significance in signing this pledge and it will give me a peace of mind and heart that i have not experienced since 1968 in 1968 i was a young franciscan priest studying in the graduate school of religious education at catholic university
755866 since they as well as many other professors and graduate students were signing the protest document i went along and did so also
755867 in 1975 for personal reasons not related to any doubts or questions about the faith or the church or the religious life i requested and obtained a dispensation from pope paul vi returning me to the lay state later i was married in the church and raised my two children in the faith i have had many conversations with my pastor and with his assistant who is my spiritual director about my days as a franciscan priest and have been active in many of our parishs lay apostolate and ministries
755868 but i have always regretted having signed the protest document against pope pauls teaching in 1968 and having learned a few years ago that fr faricy had publicly repudiated signing the protest i had wished that i too could repudiate in some official way having signed the protest and so your pledge document offers me an opportunity to correct my mistake and find healing and telling you about all this helps me to feel that my repudiation of the protest is now known and accepted in a kind of semi official sort of way by an authority in the church
755869 and thank you for reading this thereby humoring an old man who despite everything else knows that he is a priest forever according to the order of melchizedek

755880 i am very happy with the way this weekend has gone
755881 i had a lot of pressure from haga in race two and on many corners it made me make mistakes i am very happy
755882 i am just focusing on getting podiums at this stage
755883 when i started out i never dreamed about making that many hundreds but ill certainly take it now
755884 i feel honoured to join such a high calibre of names who have also achieved the feat its definitely something ill cherish for the rest of my days
755885 i just made it into the corner of the television screen
755886 if id had bigger boobs you would have had no problem seeing me
755887 i have never been injured so much in a season and to make my fourth olympics is an amazing achievement being the oldest is not the greatest achievement but i am there if anyone needs to talk
755888 i will have to show to those watching that i have that performance in me

755891 their confidence from last year will spur them on in the olympics its all about how you run on the day
755892 at the beginning of the year a lot of people were asking me if my new setup was going to work and questioning if it was the right thing for me to do
755893 i think results showed that it took a little bit of time but that its paying off and im enjoying myself much more on court im much calmer and obviously my results have got better and better as the years gone on
755894 the clay court season for me was the best one ive had even though it wasnt great and so far its been a strong season
755895 you wake up and just dont get going and some days you feel great

755902 but the west used the olympic torch relay and the coming games to shame the country and frequently remind the chinese they were not good enough
755903 a safe olympics is the biggest indicator of the success of the games
755904 were teaching them that the olympic spirit is international that it doesnt just belong to one country
755905 they said this was the first time that china was communicating to the outside world rather than waiting for the world to come to us
755906 we hoped that the olympics would help people understand our countrys achievements that this ancient civilization has started a new chapter
755907 but from the torch relay we suddenly realized that we were preparing to open the nations front door to welcome people who do not wish us well
755908 here we build sports venues fix rail lines and construct airports hurrying like a raging fire to prepare there people use darfur one day and tibet the next to fan the flames of protest and boycott whats going on
755909 this is a hot face pressed on a cold rump
755910 there were signs of apprehension about the country and its growing power
755911 it was because of cnn and bbcs attitude so we did not broadcast at that time
755912 it was because the earthquake happened the march 14 beating smashing and looting incident happened the timing was up to us

755916 barcelona were thinking of a loan but the player is keen on a transfer and is waiting to fly to glasgow
755917 if we would like to have a striker with the killer instinct we must have two or three million euros
755918 we can look for luca toni but i dont think its possible to bring luca toni here its possible to work with players and build a scouting system to find a new luca toni maybe we can do something in the transfer window but the important thing is to work with the players we have
755919 hillary clinton said she would strive to do away with dont ask dont tell which was implemented by her husband and former president bill clinton during his first term in office
755920 if hillary planned to use our armed forces for a social experiment which has nothing to do with the defense of our nation barack obama will certainly go even further down this dangerous road
755921 its not a secret when someone is having an affair especially with a member of the same sex on our ship
755922 the prohibition on homosexuals openly serving in the navy is a joke and in reality there needs to be a hard and fast rule regarding this issue gays openly serving in americas armed forces would be a disaster no matter how politically correct it sounds
755923 if obama is elected president dont ask dont tell will become a thing of the past
755924 but obama will make a confusing policy even worse when he leads the effort to totally disregard the counsel of high ranking military officials who see gays in the military as just one more problem that will hinder the defense of our country
755925 roy is not going to sign a new contract because he hasnt been offered one yet
755926 the transfer window closing will probably be the time to get ourselves into that situation and get our way forward to making an announcement later on in the year
755927 roy hasnt got an agent banging down the door or leaking things to the press
755928 i agree with niall 100 it is not important at the moment signing new players is the priority whether it happens next month christmas or january im very relaxed
755929 we dont ring each other up to discuss the weather we dont go for little pat on the back meals but what we do is discuss business together
755930 we have a different kind of partnership to the normal chairman manager thing where the chairman is saying do well or else we are in this together we were in it together from day one and i dare say it will remain in place for a good long time yet
755931 i was asked about this two years ago i said i would be thrilled because it would mean we would be in a better place and its a problem id love to have in a couple of years time and who knows i would not bet against this guy doing anything
755932 its fingers crossed for kenwyne but even last season i thought we needed another top striker
755933 i could easily be us open champion but i didnt do the job when i needed to
755934 im not worried about not winning im just delighted about the consistency i know that winning is very fickle i went three years without winning once and then won twice within four weeks
755935 i was 34 when i started doing it and i probably started 10 years
755936 then i looked at the people at the top of the rankings and they were all pretty strong fellows tiger phil retief ernie vijay all big guys big shoulders i used to be big and i needed to put a bit of bulk on its paying dividends the weights helped tremendously
755937 im hitting the ball a lot further and when i want to make changes in my swing i can implement them a lot faster because my muscles are more responsive to change
755938 if i hadnt won in the states id feel there was something missing in my career
755939 you want to win everywhere dont you that youre capable of winning im proud that ive won on every tour basically european asian and southern african
755940 these are a rung down from the major championships obviously but i havent won a world golf championships so thats obviously missing on my cv it would mean a lot and obviously give me a massive amount of confidence going into next week too
755941 it could have been a better round than that but youve got to take what it gives you a few short putts here and there would have made a big difference but i made a few as well so that kind of evens it out
755942 i thought the crowds were great they were funny made some funny comments and it was really fun they were great to both me and vijay it was a great day we both birdied 15 we both birdied 16 and i thought both of us played okay played pretty good
755943 its going to be a big challenge with four guys being right there and a number of guys right behind us so im not really thinking about what it would mean
755944 i still have to go out and shoot a pretty low round with these guys that are playing some good golf i think that were all in good position but i feel like ive played well the first three rounds and im looking forward to a nice shootout
755945 it got a bit too far maybe it is such an issue at the moment in spain it gets a bit over the top
755946 a couple of our players they made the comment that there was only talk about him and not about the current team and stars and everybodys waiting for the next rumour without anything concrete
755947 i think so if you hear the statements from united it doesnt really sound like theyll let him go
755948 people kept asking me about the appearance record when i was trying to win the premier league and champions league so it is a relief not to have it there any more
755949 of course i am proud to have done it but now i just want to move on hopefully add a few more games to the total and focus on the team
755950 there is a stigma of celebrity and money alongside football these days which is different from when i first came into the team
755951 i am sure paul will do well because he knows his stuff he has done things a different way to my other team mates he started right at the bottom and did brilliantly at macclesfield and mk dons
755952 he has proven himself now he just has to do it in the premier league
755953 its fantastic an incredible feeling winning here in finland means so much to me
755954 i desperately wanted to win this rally getting a win here was more important to me than just getting points its been a very hard battle with mikko all weekend with no chance to relax ive had to fight for every second
755955 i wanted to win here but it was still a fantastic event
755956 im pleased with the speed we had but seb was able to find few more seconds and in the end thats all he needed to win

755961 agents ramos and compean were convicted based on the testimony of a known drug dealer that has since been convicted for running drugs into the u s while serving as the governments star witness the fact that the drug dealers criminal activity persisted even as he took the stand against these agents is reason enough to vacate these two convictions
755962 this morning i was very nervous but i focused on my game and now i won so i am happy
755963 my dreams come true now i was planning to play in japan but maybe i change my plans and play in america
755964 i think it could be better but im not too frustrated
755965 i tried my best and im very impressed by how the low scores have been this week it was a great win for ji yai
755966 but it was still great to be back and i enjoyed it six under was reasonable just not good enough
755967 to finish with a birdie was a little bit extra
755968 i kept it together pretty well today but i was emotional on the first tee and coming up the final few holes i was pleased to play well and score in the 60s i just wish the birdie putt at the last had been for the championship
755969 i saw a sign on the scoreboard saying annika youll be missed and then i was greeted with all the applause its been 15 great years of golf and i just really enjoyed the moment it was also nice to share it with my caddie terry mcnamara weve been together for nine years and we are great friends so i wanted him to enjoy it too

755976 its a fact of modern life that there is disparity and is it fair or unfair is not a valid question its just the way it is and you have to get on with it people say its unfair when they dont do anything to change their circumstances
755977 quite a lot of people have done well who want to achieve and quite a lot of people havent done well because they dont want to achieve
755978 if you aspire to anything beyond that youre not going to live there any more and thats the choice you make
755979 some of these are vocational things like nurses its accepted they go into it knowing that thats part of the deal
755980 many people like teachers dont do things for the pay but you wont find a teacher that works as hard as we do
755981 i do enjoy the fact i can have nice holidays and dont think twice about buying particular items
755982 im sick of this because with 100 000 in manchester you are well off 100 000 is a not a wealthy person down here
755983 we now live in a separate economy we live on a separate level to the vast majority of people in the country we dont send our kids to the same schools we have more choice over schools we have more choice over health we have more choice over where we live we have more choice over where we go on holiday and what we do for our jobs and we live in a completely different world to the people we live next door to
755984 i work hard ive got two boys and i want to provide for them
755985 i really object because what it does is take the whole emphasis and focus away into something thats totally irrelevant and wont help a poor person at all
755986 all kinds of bullshit crap which doesnt help the people
755987 people dont starve in this country its ok compared with other countries here you dont go hungry because you can just go and get money for free
755988 say 3 000 a month in their hands and theyre somewhere miles up north theyre not going to earn that sort of money so wheres the incentive for them to go out to work
755989 single people get pregnant and get a flat and more money you just see everybody pushing prams then theyll get more income and a little flat that they can stay in for life
755990 doesnt get that much less money than another 18 year old working in a shop
755991 this thing of giving pregnant women 200 for dietary supplements like as if theyll really spend it on fruit
755992 we dont think just chucking money at the welfare state is the answer
755993 lack of ability is the main basis on which you get a job
755994 nobody in the public sector is actually trained to do the job that theyre required to do
755995 labour did a bit of that with extra taxes and windfall taxes and the famous raid on pensions the big debate is about how effectively all that money raising has been applied most people would say not all of it was well applied
755996 i have absolutely no idea how my taxes are spent and therefore i do not trust the system at all
755997 the classic is how much you pay in your taxation versus whats invested in the roads and the transport system it goes into a black hole
755998 little accountability and measurability in the way that tax is actually used
755999 say all we need to say about the waste and futility of public spending
756000 i want to talk about what charity can do for us
756001 what do you do now youve got all the toys
756002 youve already got all the houses yachts cars and jets you can use so what comes next is charity
756003 i get invited to places id never have seen otherwise
756004 if we can apply the entrepreneurial principles we have brought to business to charity we have a shot at having a really strong impact to be able to transform the lives of children
756005 the general feeling is a lot of cynicism about whether or not if you do give the cash its going to get where you want it to go
756006 people like us dont put our hands in our pockets so much
756007 better prepared than any british team in the past and competitively sharper they are not going hoping to win they expect wins and know how to get them
756008 this is my passion i suppose you could say it is everything to me at the moment
756009 i boxed at school but i was never any great shakes
756010 i suppose i was ok for a while but then i discovered drink and women i met my wife and that was it so far as my boxing was concerned but i have always loved the sport and years later in about 1970 an old friend asked me to come down to an amateur club the hollington where he was coaching in camberwell i liked the atmosphere and decided to get involved again i got my coaching badges and we had some champions who got into the england team and that spurred me on i got to coach with the london association and the england team and it all went on from there
756011 i love the sport the one to one element the excitement
756012 but it is not as basic or simple as some think it is a physical chess game and i may be biased but i believe amateur boxing is faster and more explosive than the professional sport and a lot more technical
756013 the amateur sport can bring lads out of deprived areas and make them something
756014 but i was put off professional boxing long ago wherever the pound note is concerned people are just treated as a pound of flesh it is not for money that i do my job i am helping young lads fulfil their dream my fighters will get in the ring in beijing with respect for their opponents but no fear the culture of winning is there with them there is nothing like the olympics and if they can come back with medals maybe even a gold that is special absolutely special
756015 i think if a good deals put in place i could stay until 2012 if nothings put in place to stay amateur then theres no chance
756016 i speak to the doctor every day and he gives me a report
756017 didiers getting better and has started to train on the field he has a fitness coach there working with him and next week i hope he will be ready to start training with us but he will not be available for the first game
756018 it is important that he is fully fit and in good shape if he plays too soon and is not really ready it will not be good for him and it will not be good for us he will only play when he is in good condition again if not we risk losing him for longer you never know when you have problems with your knee but he wont be playing in the first game against portsmouth he should be back for the third game of the season
756019 it was important for anelka but more important for me to help generate more confidence for this player
756020 hes one of the players that we will look to this season he played with more quality and freedom and it is fantastic for his confidence to score four times against a team like milan
756021 he believes in himself more and the other players believe in him more that is the best outcome he played more in the penalty area than before id asked him to do that because i want him in the middle not on the left or the right that is more important at the moment because we have only one striker and that is anelka

756029 it is self evident that a woman would regret her choice

756038 we talk about people being at risk of poverty or social exclusion its as if these things obesity alcohol abuse drug addiction are purely external events like a plague or bad weather of course circumstances where you are born your neighbourhood your school and the choices your parents make have a huge impact but social problems are often the consequence of the choices that people make there is a danger of becoming quite literally a de moralised society where nobody will tell the truth anymore about what is good and bad right and wrong we as a society have been far too sensitive in order to avoid injury to peoples feelings in order to avoid appearing judgemental we have failed to say what needs to be said

756040 stop wallowing in poverty old chap and get yourself down the job centre we all know that you will work all the hours god sends for just enough money to keep you fed and watered but at least you can bask in the warm and noble glow of self sufficiency
756041 this is why children are growing up without boundaries thinking they can do as they please and why no adult will intervene to stop them including often their parents if we are going to get any where near solving some of these problems that has to stop

756179 a short circuit occurs when there is a faulty connection in the network faulty of course from the standpoint of the networks smooth functioning is not the shock of short circuiting therefore one of the best metaphors for a critical reading is not one of the most effective critical procedures to cross wires that do not usually touch to take a major classic text author notion and read it in a short circuiting way through the lens of a minor author text or conceptual apparatus if the minor reference is well chosen such a procedure can lead to insights which completely shatter and undermine our common perceptions this is what marx did with philosophy and religion this is what freud and nietzsche did with morality

756246 ces quinze derni res ann es lactivit croissante des pr fectures en mati re de contr le de limmigration et le fort taux de recours des trangers contre leurs d cisions ont donn naissance un contentieux de masse soumis la double pression du pouvoir politique qui se traduit par des objectifs chiffr s particuli rement suivis et de lopinion publique les services pr fectoraux font preuve dun professionnalisme ind niable et ont globalement bien assimil les contraintes de forme et de fond pos es par les textes et la jurisprudence du conseil detat en revanche il faut d plorer labsence dimplication de ces services pour le r glement pr contentieux des diff rends et surtout le d sint r t quils manifestent dans le suivi contentieux des dossiers cette rel gation du contentieux qui se traduit notamment par la production trop rare et souvent al atoire des m moires en d fense par la non repr sentation de la pr fecture laudience voire m me parfois par labsence de prise en consid ration de jurisprudences pass es accentue encore lengorgement des juridictions surtout elle pr judicie aussi bien aux trangers quelle contraint des proc dures lourdes et r p titives qu ladministration elle m me dans la mesure o la pr vention des litiges peut tre source d conomie pour les deniers publics

756475 we take pride in making quick decisions that benefit our patients and families
756476 passages hospice is a relatively small company with a big heart our team is trained to listen well to wishes expressed by patients and their families we then do everything we can to help make that goal a reality hospice is all about cherishing life in whatever remaining time is allotted to each person as an organization we strive to do whatever we can to support patients in achieving those goals they have set for themselves
756477 recently one of our patients recalled to me how much he loved watching cubs games as a kid
756478 growing up he lived close to wrigley field and could walk to games all summer long so hes been a huge baseball fan his entire life whether it was watching his grandchildren play ball or following the major leagues then he expressed his dream to see the cubs play again at wrigley field accompanied by his two grown sons although this patient is on continuous oxygen and would also require a wheelchair i just knew i had to do whatever i could to get him three tickets to a cubs game
756479 i only made one phone call and instantly had three tickets later i found out from co workers just how lucky this was i had no preconceived ideas that obtaining cubs tickets would be difficult
756480 i was really excited at the chance to go to the ballpark with my sons it was a dream come true as a youngster i grew up near diversey amp damen and could walk to wrigley field and watch the games all summer ive always loved the cubs and this was a great surprise
756481 with a life limiting illness the patient and their families are stressed and drained because of so much focus on the persons illness however when a cherished goal is shared and the plans are put into motion for achieving it everyones outlook lifts and good feelings come flooding back in it is great to be a part of that dynamic change for the better
756482 our staff becomes like a surrogate family member because of the amount of time we spend with our patients and their families
756483 during our frequent visits we take the time needed to learn about their individual and personal preferences
756484 when people express their desires such as for a favorite food and share why it shifts them to a happier time a happier moment
756485 suddenly they are focusing on something that brings enjoyment and often we can supply it to them quickly
756486 were taking the spotlight off the life limiting illness and instead encouraging the patients capabilities
756487 id like to spend my 61st birthday dinner at a nearby steakhouse
756488 plus i am so grateful to passages for arranging this for me obviously i dont get out much anymore and this was a wonderful treat
756489 hospice patients have goals too just like the rest of us theres still life in a person who has a life limiting illness and our staff is dedicated to finding that special something that will make a big difference meeting patients needs in body mind and spirit is what hospice is all about and its what passages strives to deliver every day
756490 we feel that this is an opportunity thats time has come

756646 theyve got test ranges in iran which are more than long enough to handle scud launches and even shahab 3 launches
756647 why would they be launching from the surface of the caspian sea they obviously have not explained that to us
756648 detonated the warhead near apogee not over the target area where the thing would eventually land but at altitude
756649 the only plausible explanation we can find is that the iranians are figuring out how to launch a missile from a ship and get it up to altitude and then detonate it
756650 and thats exactly what you would do if you had a nuclear weapon on a scud or a shahab 3 or other missile and you wanted to explode it over the united states
756651 if even a crude nuclear weapon were detonated anywhere between 40 kilometers to 400 kilometers above the earth in a split second it would generate an electro magnetic pulse emp that would cripple military and civilian communications power transportation water food and other infrastructure
756652 the first indication of such an attack would be that the power would go out and some but not all the telecommunications would go out we would not physically feel anything in our bodies
756653 so you would be walking you wouldnt be driving at that point
756654 and it wouldnt do any good to call the maintenance or repair people because they wouldnt be able to get there even if you could get through to them
756655 we wouldnt be able to pump the fuel into the trucks and get the trucks to the warehouses
756656 would quickly revert to an early 19th century type of country
756657 most of the things we depend upon would be gone and we would literally be depending on our own assets and those we could reach by walking to them
756658 people in hospitals would be dying faster than that because they depend on power to stay alive but then it would go to water food civil authority emergency services and we would end up with a country with many many people not surviving the event
756659 you have to go back into the 1800s to look at the size of population
756660 id have to say that 70 to 90 percent of the population would not be sustainable after this kind of attack
756661 explicitly discuss a nuclear emp attack that would gravely harm the united states
756662 one of the nations in the middle east had launched a ballistic missile from a cargo vessel they had taken a short range probably scud missile put it on a transporter erector launcher lowered it in taken the vessel out into the water peeled back the top erected it fired it lowered it and covered it up and the ship that they used was using a radar and electronic equipment that was no different than 50 60 100 other ships operating in the immediate area
756663 well known to the white house but have not been disseminated to the appropriate congressional committees
756664 could be used in a devastating stealth attack against the united states or israel for which the united states has no known or planned defense
756665 the use of an atomic bomb against israel would destroy israel completely while the same against the islamic only would cause damages such a scenario is not inconceivable
756666 an emp attack on america would send us back to the horse and buggy era without the horse and buggy
756667 if youre a terrorist this is your ultimate goal your ultimate asymmetric weapon
756668 they could do it either directly or anonymously by putting some freighter out there on the ocean
756669 its well known that people dont go on a diet until theyve had a heart attack
756670 and we as a nation are having a heart attack
756671 as of today we have no defense against such an attack we need space based missile defenses to protect against an emp attack
756672 nuclear missiles dont discriminate on party lines when they land
756673 senator obama has been quoted as saying i dont agree with a missile defense system and that we can cut 10 billion of the research out never mind as i say that the entire budget is 9 6 billion or 9 3 billion
756674 needs a missile defense that is so strong in all the different phases we need to defend against that countries will decide its not worth coming up against us
756675 we believe we do have standing and i think working with the attorney generals office well ask for some clarification or reconsideration of the decision

756686 the market economy is the social system of the division of labor under private ownership of the means of production everybody acts on his own behalf but everybodys actions aim at the satisfaction of other peoples needs as well as at the satisfaction of his own everybody in acting serves his fellow citizens everybody on the other hand is served by his fellow citizens everybody is both a means and an end in himself an ultimate end for himself and a means to other people in their endeavors to attain their own ends

756689 yeah yeah a veneer of moral legitimacy will be accorded to this system by the election that puts the schemer in office but many people won t have voted for the winner they ll either have voted for someone else or abstained altogether and the ones who will have voted for the winner may not like his particular spending program they may have simply found him marginally preferable to the alternatives
756690 boy what a mess the highest court in the land can create it was less than two months ago that a bare majority of the supreme court ruled that enemy combatants held at guantanamo bay naval base could proceed with lawsuits challenging their detention in our federal courts in those seven weeks not only has the entire legal landscape changed but so has the real possibility that these suspected terrorists will be released back to battlefields abroad or worse into our midst here at home
756691 every day we move closer every time we open the paper surf the internet it is worse left right libertarian green we know in our bones and hearts that we need to take action we have been divided along lines of political opinion where we should have been joined to find solutions we have been cut off from each other manipulated for the profit of corporations and their cronies it is bad and when we look into the future there is little to spark hope the meltdown of the economy and the narrowing of what is permitted us grows daily more frightening

756745 its kind of funny in games like this a lot of times you see some streaks and thats what happened in the first half being down 10 1 at the half we came back and played really well in the second half
756746 it was a great experience it was a priviledge to be involved with it

756782 that theyre not going to be here this month and gone the next
756783 you would not want something shipped to your customer that has a pier one or wal mart tag on it
756784 if youre an rei or an outdoor gear retailer maybe you dont want some biohazard packing material
756785 if youre taking the brunt of your customer service calls you can track an up tick of complaints against a vendor
756786 they are likely not just servicing you theyre servicing a plethora of other vendors who are doing the same thing you are and theyre going to make mistakes theyre only human
756787 the drop ship vendor is letting you know how many of those they have in their warehouse so they have lets say a thousand units sitting in their warehouse and they sent that file to you and to the dozen or so other sellers who are selling them
756788 you get into all these rules and regulations even ftc federal trade commission problems over how long you can hold that customers order
756789 one minute ill hook you that to that department and theyre actually dialing another number and hooking you into that customer service pool

756794 theyre going to leave the package at the end of the driveway and the next step is they leave it right inside the front door
756795 there are all these details that go around something as simple as i ordered a treadmill

756797 they already have a bunch of suppliers hooked up to their plumbing

756799 has a community of vendors and products that you as a merchant can chose from
756800 when you look at how people use technology embedded systems mobile computing mobile internet devices servers super computing in almost every aspect of technology linux is emerging as the dominant platform
756801 we are seeing this incredibly unique cross pollinization of innovation
756802 weve had a lot of hand wringing around fragmentation in the past
756803 how do you create applications for mobile and embedded linux how do you to go to market with linux systems how are they received by the eco system how do isvs actually make money with apps and how do operators roll out new services and deploy apps to support their business models
756804 there is no single platform that has a single code base that covers as many different kinds of applications and niches as linux does
756805 linux is expanding its presence in other workloads as it continues to hold down key success areas in web and infrastructure roles

756821 there have been a number of incidents recently and its important that we go in and double check and make sure that all the standards have been maintained
756822 we want to say to the travelling public that everything is ok
756823 the pilots followed standard procedures which is go back and land safely
756824 the 767 has three hydraulic systems if one fails the other two back it up there was never any safety issue here
756825 this is an additional layer of safety checks over and above the normal day to day checks

756830 you have transmitted all your authority to the pope and now he wields it as to you you had better stay away or at any rate not interfere with us for the time being
756831 strange as it may seem it is still true that those who fail to understand other churches than their own are not the people who care intensely about theology but the theological dilettantes eclectics and historians of all sorts while those very men who have found themselves forced to confront a clear thoroughgoing logical sic et non find themselves allied to each other inspite of all contradictions by an underlying fellowship and understanding even in the cause which they handle so differently and approach from such painfully different angles but the cause it may be is nothing less than jesus christ and the unity of the church
756832 only in christ are all things in communion he is the point of convergence of all hearts and beings and therefore the bridge and the shortest way from each to each
756833 the doctrine of justification by faith is in fact the great ecumenical doctrine
756834 the gospel portrait implies that jesus would be found guilty by the self conscious religious majority of any age and background

756856 thats why i know this is going to work its so easy to implement
756857 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
756858 or if you live in a state where it gets very cold in the winter it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down debt

756871 what is oauth and ws trust and where does it fit into your web services sso initiatives
756872 eliminates the need for multiple usernames across different websites simplifying your online experience
756873 id rather only myself and the third party im engaged with were the only two privy to my details
756874 what good is a unified login when its default form will only be accepted on the least private and secure sites
756875 did not defend all of the second amendment only the so called hunting rights which is not not the purpose of the second amendment
756876 individuals who have undergone intensive background checks and extensive training in order to get their concealed handgun license should be able to protect themselves on campus just as they do everywhere else
756877 some people have fears about concealed weapons but since 1995 there has been no escalation in violence and crime across the state of texas has decreased
756878 there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that allowing concealed carry on college campuses would lead to more problems
756879 to have more than half the country be in favor of a ban like that goes against the notion that the support for gun control hasnt increased since virginia tech
756880 people feel just as strongly as ever and we need to get politicians to pay more attention to this issue
756881 accepting openid on your site you are outsourcing the security of your users to an unknown third party and you cant guarantee that your users picked a good home for their openid
756882 i didnt have the votes and i didnt want to throw people under the bus
756883 i see it as a reason for people to properly and legally defend themselves

756888 wisconsin almost passed it if they did wed be the only state without some sort of concealed carry
756889 i just think that this is whats coming and from a public safety standpoint its the right thing to do

756891 nowadays its a felony and id be locked up for it
756892 protecting the second amendment and hunting rights on federal lands act of 2008
756893 wrong part of the south this is the teetoaling evangelical part not the mint julep scarlett ohara part of the south
756894 now that there is so much adoption of openid by identity providers what needs to happen so that relying parties can also adopt it
756895 bringing the total number of enabled accounts to half a billion
756896 openid will never come to anything as half a billion of available identities means nothing if there arent similarly many places where one can use those identities
756897 unless i can have one single identity that works for the entire web openid has no value proposition and nobody will ever use it
756898 if openid does not break down walled gardens and so far it has not its useless
756899 facebook is going to win the internet identity war with a proprietary approach there is nothing anybody will or can do about it and openid and by implication all other identity technologies are going to be irrelevant
756900 i am excited to see the recent talk of open web foundation is now out there i think that it is poised to become a great new corner of the web giving us a place for the other stuff
756901 during this mornings keynote at oscon david recordon announced the formation of the open web foundation his slides an initiative with which i am involved aimed at becoming something akin to a creative commons for patents with the intention of lowering the costs and barriers to the development and adoption of open and free specifications like openid and oauth
756902 support for email address to url transformation now you can use an email address anywhere you normally use an openid
756903 one inescapable facet of web work is the need to come up with and remember usernames and passwords
756904 the open web foundation launches at oscon with a focus on keeping open source community efforts open and unfettered the effort is backed by individuals and companies such as facebook google and myspace
756905 last friday was podcast day for me and for as nervous as i was i think they turned out pretty well no doubt thanks to the talented people actually managing the whole podcast thing and me just having to spout off every now and again so i thought id share the links in case you were interested in listening

756908 how can you know that when youve yet to see the corpse
756909 the smears right here suggest he was stabbed coming out of his office and crawled or was dragged into the center of the gathering room
756910 a small speck of glass is in that largest of pools
756911 no doubt ejected when the blood first began to exit the wound
756912 we hadnt yet noticed that dearest thrym you always had an eye like no other detective where did you go wrong
756913 we were hoping ben here could speak to the fleeing ghost of mayor barry
756914 i believe his spirit is already lost there is no hope for reunifying it with the body
756915 there were others working here when it happened of course
756916 of course but no witnesses nobody heard or saw a thing as the cut made him inaudible
756917 could it be the same assassin that attacked the royal council
756918 its possible but wheres the motive he lops off the head of britannias leadership and then moves on to a mayor the shadowlords intentionally left in power here
756919 we were contacted about the mayors death someone said our help was wanted in the matter
756920 weve been working here for some time now as you can see our work can get us a little messy
756921 ill be leaving smurf around town here for a while to gather information about what happened good bye thrym
756922 fine have a good life inspector smurf see you around
756923 what do you mean gone she was just with us on that raid
756924 supposedly she went out to handle personal affairs afterward we received the note from her kidnappers
756925 this is it this is what i want to do with my life
756926 my safety is in danger is that what she said
756927 my safety is always in danger these days with the follower numbers growing it will all be fine as long as i dont stumble into
756928 this is what we came for rogues lets get on with it then
756929 best we avoid the road the rest of the shadowlord death knights and their henchmen will be back soon
756930 he lives in freemen camp ill make my way over there to see him
756931 last night heard there were some crazies up in minoc trying to start a movement had a feeling i knew who they were
756932 some group of shadowlord followers hanging around moonglow word spreads fast they were having a good laugh over the thought of minoc trying to resist the might of their faction
756933 i saw you all trying to sneak around with a chest nearly as big as me figured this must be too good to miss that and i have news
756934 ive been assured youre all the people i need to be speaking to
756935 you all understand the risks of meeting here the shadowlords faction of followers do control this region and will consider anyone talking with nonel or myself treasonous and worthy of painful execution that said leave if you dont wish to be here
756936 many towns like this have fallen to the shadowlords faction theyve prospered under their new necromancer general and unfortunately we have failed to protect you from their surge in power while the shadowlords themselves command powerful forces their domination of britannia relies on the success of their followers that make up their faction ordinary beings like you and i not like the monsters ive seen befall many other shores as of late
756937 the true britannians are floundering as a central soldiery we have failed the militias and warriors of the cities have mostly died or gone into hiding
756938 we are reaching out to the towns now the situation as spiraled out of control on a tactical level and soon all of britannia will be dark its time for the people to rise up in resistance to join us on the battlefield and combat this evil
756939 my warriors will have nothing to do with your resistance we submitted ourselves to the command of the true britannians at the start and look where it led us more than three quarters of the new world order is dead
756940 we wouldnt force any lot into this anyway your warriors can choose what theyll do on their own
756941 you have nothing against a woman saving your hide right
756942 right i almost caught her stealing from me realized she was a good thief and that i needed to bring her in was some job tracking her down
756943 its a good enough start the shadowlords faction has placed a finance minister to watch the silver reserves but i have no doubt i can sneak funds to support to the formation of your partisan resistance
756944 ill do what i can to help equip you but know that i wont overtly oppose the shadowlords its bad for my health
756945 that is it gentlemen from here on out its the liberation of minoc or death
756946 its a start this town has bred some impressively resilient thieves
756947 trinsic has been holding its own fairly well the warriors there are a tough breed i think ill go speak to some of them
756948 get some rest yourself you have a lot to do tomorrow
756949 there are a lot of logistics to all this to be worked
756950 always trying to work things out just do what you and your brother grew up doing here steal plunder and loot
756951 those paladins always did spook me with their magic tricks
756952 ill tell you over an ale we have a few things to iron out with this group anyway
756953 hes a great thief you saw the those moves bring him in and im sure hell do us good
756954 what good is acting together when we have nothing left to give our cities not yours our cities are the ones besieged
756955 you know you have been playing uo to long when
756956 how kind of you all to be here waiting for me
756957 please my lord send me to look for the information we need
756958 tell me would it not be better if we just wiped them out
756959 i could destroy them all with a snap of my fingers
756960 dont forget who and what you are myxion theres no need for that simply kill those in your way and focus on our goals
756961 we dont need the unnecessary attention but if theyre distracting you then by all means do it our ally grows impatient

756972 the fox knows many things but the hedgehog knows one big thing
756973 as the market sentiment is gradually turning positive i think this rally should extend for a few more sessions as there are no negative events which may dampen the market spirit though there are no negative indications markets may still remain volatile for a few more days as there is still uncertainty prevailing on crude as well as inflation front
756974 the present situation spells real hard times for the broking industry actual income to the broker is realised on a day to day basis and with the drop in volumes coupled with the slowdown in churning by the institutional investors which was so rampant during the bull run the topline of broking firms has got badly dented alongside huge competition among the brokers is also impacting the bottomline which is reflected by the results posted by the broking firms for the last two quarters we might see a lot of consolidation in the sector going ahead

757130 practically the entire gun violence prevention movement she had access to all the legislative strategy for every major issue for years
757131 how did she manage to fool everyone for so long how much money did she earn for being a mole to whom in the gun lobby did she report did her covert effort extend beyond mere intelligence gathering did she manage to shape the decisions and actions of anti gun groups to the gun lobbys liking and was she the only one
757132 i havent grown this much in a year since i was twelve or thirteen if you know what i mean
757133 in their patriotism and in their fidelity to their civic duties catholics will feel themselves bound to promote the true common good they will make the weight of their convictions so influential that as a result civil authority will be justly exercised and laws will accord with moral precepts and the common good

757137 the packers have agreed to allow favre to compete with aaron rodgers for the starting job
757138 sixteen years after brett favre came to the packers he is returning for a seventeenth season
757139 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
757140 brett will be in camp tomorrow although there has been uncertainty regarding bretts return
757141 no matter what i look forward to another successful season for the packers and our fans this has been a tough situation but the packers will make the most of it

757146 chinese officials have been clamping down on visa applications and implementing bureaucratic impediments to new and renewed visa applications under the guise of pre olympic security
757147 assumptions that china is only focused on continued good economic ties with the world shouldnt be taken as gospel china has a track record of shutting down external connections when internal crises brew
757148 in another two months it will become clearer whether this was a spate of excessive paranoia or a reflection of a much more significant crisis facing the chinese leadership and the evidence increasingly points toward the latter

757164 symington is strongly believed to have worked with the ian smith led white supremacist regime on its biological warfare project
757165 the zimbabwe authorities have since established that smiths security forces particularly the much feared selous scouts stealthily distributed the deadly anthrax spore among the hungry cattle of the rhodesian tribal trust lands where most africans lived and seeded cholera into the rivers
757166 it is true that anthrax was used in an experimental role and the idea came from the army psychological operations
757167 the phd certificate he submitted to nih could have easily been tracked back by authorities and exposed as a forgery
757168 but it was overlooked and hatfills credentials helped him gain access to sensitive government agencies
757169 on october 4 2001 we confirmed the first bio terrorism related anthrax case identified in the united states is a resident of palm beach county florida
757170 identified themselves as pilots when they came to the emergency room of holy cross hospital in fort lauderdale fla last june one had an ugly dark lesion on his leg
757171 in october a pharmacist in delray beach fla said he had told the f b i that two of the hijackers mohamad atta and marwan al shehhi came into the pharmacy looking for something to treat irritations on mr attas hands
757172 after sept 11 when federal investigators found the medicine among the possessions of one of the hijackers ahmed alhaznawi dr tsonas reviewed the case and arrived at a new diagnosis
757173 the fbi contends that it pursued a hijacker connection in the early days and became convinced that they were not involved in these mailings mainly because the anthrax strain used was a military research strain many people in florida however who know about the hijackers movements in that part of the country in the months before 9 11 do not believe the fbi pursued this with enough vigor
757174 in an interview dr otoole said that after consulting with additional medical experts on the alhaznawi case she was more persuaded than ever that the diagnosis of cutaneous anthrax was correct
757175 they would probably have needed an accomplice to mail the tainted letters

757181 zimbabwean authorities have made several reports that indicate that rhodesians were using biological warfare against guerillas during the liberation war but these have not received international coverage
757182 they would relentlessly track down their opponents and kill them even if it meant crossing into neighboring countries in violation of international law their training taught them to live off the barren land during their long pursuit on foot drinking fetid water and eating carrion scraps some articles claim that they were responsible for two out of every three enemy fatalities in the civil war admirers and vets boast that the selous scouts were the most skilled and ruthless guerrilla warfare fighters in history

757184 its hard enough living as a student in auckland these days without having a war criminal coming to town so we thought wed give our students a chance to make a dent in their student loans and work for global justice at the same time
757185 ausa withdrew their reward at around 6 p m on july 25 thomas called me after 9 p m and suggested we should take up where ausa left off
757186 the dominion post was going to print the next days issue within the next few hours and with rice arriving the next day there wasnt enough time to call all the exec and release the press release in time
757187 the reward was following through motions that had been passed at the student representative council
757188 we were encouraging someone to do something stupid where the likelihood of someone being seriously hurt was very high
757189 we are going through a re budget where everyone is being asked to tighten their belts and were offering 10 000
757190 protest is a part of democratic society and student protests are particularly a long honored tradition in democratic society
757191 i just got a text saying that the storm is heading our way
757192 the reward is a frivolous way to spend students money
757193 do you want to give me 10 000 ill go arrest someone
757194 moves like the reward should not be made in everyones name without consultation and now im going to start calling you geoff hayward
757195 waikato have been in contact with me but i think they rather want to retain full ownership of the event we will help promote it and make some suggestions about venues but everything else is over to them
757196 its a copy of the undie 500 but obviously they dont want any bad media coverage given the amount of planning they are doing i think it has the capacity to be a really successful event
757197 effective leadership and a clear direction must be provided as a matter of urgency
757198 our focus is on interactivity dynamic forms that express meaningful data locative media that can broaden future storytelling and new forms of broadcasting and online experimentation
757199 the place to come to develop new zealands new film tv media and performance industries
757200 im wary of change that forces itself to draw links with other schools though aspects of digital media design and film overlap they are often very different and tailoring a course that would operate well i think will prove extremely difficult
757201 in theory some of the ideas seem really promising and could work really well if funded and supported properly
757202 the proposal as an academic idea does seem to have considerable potential

757222 these new figures should bring new focus to our efforts to address aids and hiv here at home
757223 combating hiv aids also demands closing the gaps in opportunity that exist in our society so that we can strengthen our public health we must also overcome the stigma that surrounds hiv aids a stigma that is too often tied to homophobia
757224 we need to encourage folks to get tested and accelerate hiv aids research toward an effective cure because we have a moral obligation to join together to meet this challenge and to do so with the urgency this epidemic demands
757225 work closely with non profit government and private sector stakeholders to continue the fight against hiv aids
757226 by focusing efforts on reducing drug costs through greater market competition promoting prevention efforts encouraging testing targeting communities with high infection rates strengthening research and reducing disparities through effective public outreach we as a nation can make great progress in fighting hiv aids
757227 its the first time in my life i have won tournaments back to back
757228 usually i would win a tournament and the next week i would lose in the first round
757229 i was happy when i won the first match and then i was just taking it one match at a time
757230 i was pretty nervous in my first big final and i wished to play better
757231 it is the worst tragedy on k2 since 1986 when 12 climbers were killed due to exposure

757234 we had a feeling this would not turn out well and decided to turn around the accident could have been prevented these mountains lure out way too inexperienced and naive people
757235 at present it is believed that anyone who is classified as position unknown will not be coming back
757236 a lot of the dead are women and children and elderly people people thought there would be a landslide and the stampede started and that was when people were crushed to death
757237 some of the bodies were taken home straight away by relatives and some were taken to the doctor and could have perished then but there are around 125 to 150 dead people
757238 a lot of people were confined in a small area
757239 should texas execute mr medellin before congress has a reasonable opportunity to convert the icj judgment into a justifiable federal right the state of texas will forever deprive mr medellin of his constitutionally protected right not to be deprived of his life without a due process of law
757240 to ensure that its judgment has its intended effect of guiding the political branches to a constitutionally permissible method of complying with the nations treaty obligations
757241 executing jose medellin in violation of an order by the world court would be a major step backward for the rule of law
757242 pressure build up in a small sealed sample bottle in a storage safe resulted in plutonium contamination of a storage room at about 02 30 00 30 gmt no one was working in the laboratory at the time
757243 all indications are that there was no release of radioactivity to the environment
757244 there is no need to be anxious because there is not long before my debut and that wouldnt be good for me
757245 we have to share the pressure i have come to barcelona to enjoy football and the grandeur of this team i hope we can change the image of the last two years
757246 we have to take the tie seriously because we know we arent in the real champions league yet the team is working hard and thats the way to go if we want to do big things
757247 you can take the girl out of michigan but you cant take the michigan out of the girl

757256 who are you what are your values your interests goals ambitions what amuses and or disgusts you
757257 a niche blog is where you stay within one semantic degree of separation from the core topic and reframe like crazy
757258 reading a personal blog is like being invited into someones house sometimes we stand on the doorstep and peer inside seeing a glimpse of a room perhaps on the first visit we may not get past the loungeroom but as we become more comfortable and visit more often we may start to explore the different rooms each post on a blog is another room and as we read them a little more of the writer is revealed perhaps there are sometimes things we see in the visits that we would rather not know at other times there are things that delight or educate us if you dont mind me mixing my metaphors let me say that each post is like peeling another layer from the onion and if we keep going we will one day get to its heart so when you come into my house do not judge me too harshly if for some reason you do not like what you see then you need not come back when you do though perhaps you should be prepared to learn a little more about me each time one day perhaps you will be comfortable here and rather than feel confronted or affronted by what you read you will look forward to the visits
757259 we want the people of our community to have a great day of fun and relaxation with no strings attached
757260 we will invite everyone but those who wish to can stay or come back for the church outdoors event when we will have a programme that will provide an experience of contemporary christian worship this will incorporate a presentation of the fantastic good news story that we as christians have and want to share
757261 this case exemplifies the difficulties faced by christians in belarus
757262 this placed st barnabas church on the international map of fame
757263 a huge honour for me in recognition of the work i have done in the community and diocese
757264 the service is expected to be lively and people will be coming from different parts of the country from london to glasgow
757265 the service is open to everyone just turn up on the day you will receive a warm welcome in jesus name
757266 i dont mean speaking from the middle point between two extremes that just creates another sort of political alignment i mean that we should try to speak from the heart of our identity as anglicans and ultimately from that deepest centre which is our awareness of living in and as the body of christ
757267 to the innovator can we say dont isolate yourself dont create facts on the ground that make the invitation to debate ring a bit hollow
757268 can we say to the traditionalist dont invest everything in a church of pure and likeminded souls try to understand the pastoral and human and theological issues that are urgent for those you are opposing even if you think them deeply wrong
757269 i think we perhaps can if and only if we are captured by the vision of the true centre the heart of god out of which flows the impulse of an eternal generosity which creates and heals and promises it is this generosity which sustains our mission and service in our lords name and it is this we are called to show to each other
757270 at the moment we seem often to be threatening death to each other not offering life what some see as confused or reckless innovation in some provinces is felt as a body blow to the integrity of mission and a matter of literal physical risk to christians
757271 the reaction to this is in turn felt as an annihilating judgement on a whole local church undermining its legitimacy and pouring scorn on its witness
757272 i find it hard at present to see another way forward that would avoid further disintegration
757273 this is a great accolade to receive a regional award from rosie winterton it is good to see that both the street angels and town centre ambassadors have been recognised for all the hard work that they put in to ensure that halifax town centre is a safe place for everyone
757274 partnership between initiatives such as street angels and town centre ambassadors is key to the success and reduction in violent crime people with a heart to make a difference followed through by action can achieve much and have outstanding results this award celebrates those who are doing just that
757275 young people are being taught nuclear physics in the classroom but gentle jesus meek and mild at sunday school we have got to raise our game
757276 in terms of their apologetics and on integrating their faith and their studies even at a young age it is a real challenge for us
757277 looking at some of the most urgent issues facing us as human beings made in gods image
757278 we have heard some stories of amazing hardship fantastic hope often the two together hardship and hope
757279 i spent a little while talking to the bishops wives from the congo and as you know congo has been through a long period of war and civil unrest and the kind of rebuilding work that all of those women are involved in within their dioceses is just so uplifting to hear what they are doing on hardly any resources and they are doing simply out of love of god and love of the people god has given to them
757280 a lot of church work simply wouldnt survive without the energy and commitment that bishops spouses bring to it
757281 in britain and a lot of the global north a lot of bishops spouses also have jobs of their own but i think they would still see a lot of that as supportive of the christian ministry and mission of the church at large
757282 wonderful opportunity to share with people who know what life is like for a bishops spouse
757283 i want to be an evangelical around the commission for equality and human rights or if i am doing thought for the day or talking to gordon brown or someone in the community but i dont want to be a nutty evangelical who believes that only a moral agenda is important
757284 i do not want to be a placard waving evangelical who believes that you are only being prophetic if you are getting up everybodys nose or the sort that writes to me to ask why i havent condemned somebody
757285 i want to be an evangelical who upholds the uniqueness of christ and if i have to say something negative i say it on my knees and i say it with sorrow and compassion and i dont glory in the idea that prophetic evangelicalism is measured by the extent to which we are seen to be obnoxious in the public square
757286 we dont talk across our tribes as much as perhaps we used to or should even when it is painful i would appeal to all the tribes to keep talking to each other
757287 post christendom britain gives us a difficult landscape in which to present christ but we do not have an option
757288 we have to extricate him from the religious wars and present him to everyone we met that is our privilege responsibility and joy
757289 risk averse jesus jesus would identify more with the make poverty history campaign than quarrels over sexual identity the city would find him more threatening than the prostitute would but most people do not get to know this jesus because we have locked him in the pulpit
757290 as a christian i believe in the bible and the minute i stepped out of the airport i felt this country is blessed and basically all i wanted was to help it in any way i can
757291 sweden is famous for its continuous sympathy towards the palestinians and criticism of israel because its policy over the years was always to favor the weak over the strong and the palestinians were always perceived as the weak side of the conflict
757292 however in my home the atmosphere was different my uncle who lived and worked for the benefit of israel for several years was our source of information about the country this uncle returned to israel after a few years in sweden and now lives with his family in netanya therefore i chose to live in this city as well and his house is my home away from home
757293 i have no doubt that my being here is intended by god
757294 moreover whenever my parents would question my actions and this obsession with israel my answer would be that everything happens for a reason
757295 my parents know me and therefore understand this relentless struggle to achieve my goal to become a soldier in the idf army
757296 i looked for a ways to volunteer for the army and found out about sar el an international organization for volunteers for israel though my work was quite basic at the time i was pleased as it was better than doing nothing and over the years i got promoted
757297 while volunteering in the army base there was one commander who objected to my wearing a cross however when he got to know me he stopped caring about it and even told me to ignore other soldiers who questioned me about it
757298 naturally most people are surprised by the fact i am a christian and still want to volunteer for the army but when i explain that my actions are driven out of my love for israel they accept it
757299 all i could do was to keep on writing hope and wait however i decided that this year would be my last in israel if my goal was not obtained i felt i was putting my life on hold for too long when i finally received my resident id this summer i could hardly believe my dream had finally come true

757306 it wouldnt be right for us to abandon our responsibilities for preaching and teaching the word of god to help with the care of the poor so friends choose seven men from among you whom everyone trusts men full of the holy spirit and good sense and well assign them this task meanwhile well stick to our assigned tasks of prayer and speaking gods word
757307 what group of zenglendos organized the attack on the st raphael credit union
757308 who accused these two militants of being a part of a zenglendo team causing them to be lynched on the spot these are the questions that must be clarified
757309 want to spread mourning to intimidate ppn members and there are other sectors who want to create confusion with rumors and disinformation
757310 mr courter did not desire to see a personal business matter wholly unrelated to the senators presidential bid to detract from the core issues facing the american people
757311 adrian corr a turks amp caicos lawyer who was legal counsel for aristide at miller simons osullivan and who ran mount salem confirmed that aristide owned the shell
757312 i certainly did not tell her that i was aristides lawyer
757313 thats completely false i dont know what drug she was smoking that day and i certainly never told her he owned mont salem
757314 i have never acted for aristide nor have i set up any shell companies to siphon money for him as is alleged in her story
757315 ive had to refer this to libel lawyers in new york new jersey and the united kingdom as well
757316 was serving as the political arm in the united states for the coup against president aristide
757317 these repeatedly false stories of corruption against president aristide are part of a continuing disinformation campaign against the president that began when he first took office in 1991
757318 i hope the trial does start on july 8 because this case is getting old
757319 even though they are just prosecuting toto today for grand larceny we hope that one day this will lead to his being judged for his crimes against humanity in haiti
757320 the canadian government may call it foreign aid but a central aim of the canadian international development agency has always been to help canadian companies expand abroad both directly and indirectly
757321 helping keep the world safe for ever greater exploitation by the worlds corporate oligarchy has been canadian aids biggest success
757322 funding military operations in the drc in exchange for lucrative contracts
757323 this money that we pay today was given to the governments of dictators such as jean claude duvalier in haiti and charles taylor in liberia
757324 our children must not continue to live this way it is really inhumane
757325 we will stand and mobilize all our skilled human resources because this battle is ours we must fight against social injustice in all its forms
757326 from the beginning the state failed its obligation to protect mr neptunes right to be heard by a court competent to hear the charges against him as well as to an effective recourse
757327 after initially boycotting the elections lavalas finally supports prevals candidacy in 2006 with clearly stated objectives in mind first and foremost was to stop the relentless political repression and persecution they suffered after aristide was ousted in february of 2004 secondly they wanted to free all of the lavalas political prisoners lastly but equally important was their call for the return of aristide from exile none of these demands have been fully realized because preval was eventually saddled with what the un and the international community tout as a coalition government this concept of coalition forced preval to abandon the demands of his electorate
757328 igh holdovers in the executive branch may be less important than the ones in the judiciary
757329 i would be surprised if the government does not at least serve the order soon then again i am surprised they didnt do it 15 months ago

757331 the chapare has been dignified at the national and international level because of its struggle in defence of the homeland and the fact that it has been consequent with its fight we have therefore decided to kick out usaid from the chapare by june 26
757332 no agreement can remain in place or one single office or a billboard or absolutely anything that mentions its presence in this region
757333 it can not be that on one hand they say they are cooperating and on the other they are causing so much damage fanning confrontations between bolivians
757334 they are even looking to end his life that is why with that same dignity with which we have begun to the democratic and cultural revolution we have taken this decision
757335 from the beginning the haitian state failed its obligation to protect mr neptunes right to be heard by a court competent to hear the charges against him as well as to an effective recourse
757336 it is regrettable that the inter american courts first case on haiti finds that a democratic government is violating human rights
757337 i hope the pr val administration uses this decision as an opportunity to end mr neptunes persecution free the remaining political prisoners detained since the interim de facto government and improve prison conditions
757338 but officials serve appeals court orders every day the government could easily do that tomorrow the government could make a good faith gesture by apologizing to a prime minister who has suffered four years of political persecution and promising to end the persecution now
757339 this decision shows the interim governments complete disregard of elementary due process by carefully explaining how the government failed to live up to 11 different human rights standards
757340 the inter american court demonstrates that mr neptune never should have been arrested in the first place at every step of the way the justice system was distorted to keep a political opponent quiet
757341 no indication that mr neptune directly perpetuated the crimes alleged against him nor is there a clearly defined connection between mr neptune and those who are alleged to have perpetrated the crimes
757342 the mental and factual elements necessary to establish mr neptunes responsibility remain entirely unclear

757369 w ch nan soley the denial of the right to water in haiti
757370 the international community is able to turn a blind eye to the impact of its policies because it is not forced to confront the human faces of those who die or become ill through its action or inaction
757371 this report shows the devastating human rights impacts of its policies
757372 one of the most egregious examples of malfeasance by the united states in recent years
757373 when an institution takes on the responsibility to improve water and health conditions it cannot turn around and undermine the rights of the people it was established to serve regardless of pressure from one of its most powerful members
757374 to keep history from repeating itself the idb and the u s government must take responsibility for their actions and put in place transparency and oversight mechanisms to guarantee that the human rights of the people of haiti and other idb member states will not be violated by an institution mandated to support their economic and social development
757375 there now are a certain number of loans of the inter american development bank that are not yet disbursed with the objective of trying to request of the protagonists of the current situation in the current political crisis to reach a compromise
757376 easily interpreted as linking the hold up in disbursement of loans at the idb to the u s governments political concerns
757377 lack of access to this crucial resource continues to impact all aspects of life for the vast majority of haitians contributing to poor health food shortages and diminished educational opportunities
757378 the result a vicious cycle of contaminated water consumption ineffective public hygiene persistent health crises and
757379 we must strive to hold our governments and the institutions to which they belong accountable and we must commit to ensuring that the right to water is realized in rich and poor countries alike
757380 it is time for all actors in haiti to put the rights of the haitian people first
757381 cause life is so brief and time is a thief

757383 according to a parliamentarian spoken to before and after robert manuels rejection the members of the commission couldnt believe their eyes when discovering that manuel had registered on the voter rolls just a few days after having been nominated for the post of prime minister
757384 for the parliamentarians this was a flagrant proof of robert manuels irresponsibility and low esteem for haiti and its citizens they could not ratify such a person to head the country
757385 since manuels designation blackmail pressure attempts at corruption and offers of large sums of money submerged the parliamentarians and above all those in the coalition of progressive parliamentarians
757386 nobody let themselves be caught in the trap they resisted all the promises including diverse attempts to divide their bloc certain of them to the detriment of their personal comfort sometimes it is good to render unto caesar what is his and encourage those who distinguish themselves from others
757387 we just want to do things another way and make sure the constitution is respected
757388 i dont think we will have to wait a month to know who the new nominee will be
757389 damming the flood haiti aristide and the politics of containment
757390 this is not a book motivated by any personal association with haiti its government or its people and nor has it emerged from a long familiarity with its history or culture
757391 instead this is purely and simply a political book in what follows i will assume that politics doesnt concern things that make people different but things that they hold in common i will assume that true political action is animated by collective principles that concern everyone by definition principles of freedom equality solidarity justice i will assume that the collective action required to apply such a principle requires the self emancipation of the oppressed i will assume that such self emancipation requires forceful engagement with the dominant forms of institutional and coercive power and that it is this engagement more than its social motivation or economic determination that makes politics a matter of divisive rather than consensual universality i will also assume that the persistence of emancipatory politics demands discipline and unity and that it depends on a capacity to resist the various kinds of fragmentation and betrayal that its very existence is bound to provoke
757392 it is one thing to criticize and protest against a government elected by the great majority of the people it is another to denounce it as an evil to be destroyed at all costs although it is easier to make certain criticisms when you have none of the responsibilities of power leftwing labor groups are clearly entitled to pressure any government to adopt more progressive policies but bo not only attacked lavalas they attacked it in ways that played straight into the hands of their own worst enemies and they did so with a bitterness that can only be understood in terms of a distorted sense of betrayal and resentment
757393 who wants to be proved right by the blood of the people youre kidding yourself if you think that the people can wage an armed struggle we need to look the situation in the eye the people have no weapons and they will never have as many weapons as their enemies its pointless to wage a struggle on your enemies terrain or play by their rules you will lose
757394 over the last couple of years the lavalas organization has also begun to confront some of its own internal limitations by becoming less dependent on aristides personal charisma and influence and by purging itself of many of the opportunists who manipulated this influence in the late 1990s younger grassroots leaders are more prominent now than when their organization was in office they have learned from aristides example as well as from his mistakes the combination of disciplined resilience and strategic flexibility that won the election of 2006 suggests that parts of this organization may have emerged from the crucible of repression stronger than before
757395 yes i get it i went through that period of my career where i looked at every deal with rose colored glasses but im smarter now
757396 dave i have this opportunity in texas that is a pre construction deal that i think i am going to do
757397 you know what at this point ive decided not to do business with you
757398 we wanted a first hand physical experience that would make this more real to us so that we can make it more real for others
757399 to meet the people to visit their communities to see the schools to witness the transformation that is taking place and to be able to say i have been i have seen and i have my own stories to tell
757400 i am sure we will learn a lot about perseverance and team work this is a chance to literally grow closer to god
757401 it was great that we were blessed with sunny dry weather for the sixth year running god must have been smiling on us this years event was i believe the best yet and it was great to see so many youngsters entering the competition for the first time despite all the bad press teenagers sometimes get this event was a real tribute to them with a great atmosphere throughout

757420 the wittiest angriest most exacting and most desolate work of fiction weve yet had about life in new york and london after the world trade center fell on a micro level its about a couple and their young son living in lower manhattan when the planes hit and about the events rippling emotional aftermath in their lives on a macro level its about nearly everything family politics identity i devoured it in three thirsty gulps gulps that satisfied a craving i didnt know i had

757428 often my calls and e mails have resulted in being given conflicting information sometimes minutes apart by people in the same office
757429 reported first amendment violations and denial of access by the press and public as well as inconsistent messages by union station personnel are especially troubling
757430 escorted defendant to the middle of the street and told him to cross to the sidewalk defendant for the fourth time refused the verbal commands and thats why he was arrested
757431 it is unlawful to loiter in the immediate vicinity of any posted property
757432 its becoming more combative where people are saying theyve had enough with these people
757433 escorted defendant to the middle of the street and told him to cross to the sidewalk defendant for the fourth time refused the verbal commands and thats why he was arrested
757434 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
757435 escorted defendant to the middle of the street and told him to cross to the sidewalk defendant for the fourth time refused the verbal commands and thats why he was arrested
757436 weve had problems with this group shouting abuse and throwing stones for months and were asked to identify them
757437 when i went to take photographs of eight of them throwing cans of coke around six of them ran away one threatened to kill me and another one started phoning the police
757438 a couple of hours later a police community support officer told me i had been accused of assault though no such thing occurred and told me i was not allowed to take photographs of teenagers on the street
757439 escorted defendant to the middle of the street and told him to cross to the sidewalk defendant for the fourth time refused the verbal commands and thats why he was arrested
757440 shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself
757441 as a christian i see growing ambitions as the perfect tool for christians to impact their communities in a meaningful and significant way in our congregations we have many trained and professional people across the board who can now support their schools colleges and local university without having to dedicate more than two hours in a whole year to it
757442 were carrying on because hope08 has been fundamental in getting churches here to operate together
757443 in a way they havent done for years and years
757444 we dont want to stop we want to make sure this carries on
757445 i didnt seek to join a terrorist group it just happened
757446 one night in a youth group these men came in and said we are starting a protestant paramilitary group to fight the ira who wants to join
757447 when these men asked me to join the paramilitary group at that stage i wanted to fight the ira when i joined i was young i would steal cars for terrorists to use transport weapons you work your way through the ranks
757448 violence became a big part of my life i carried a weapon even before i left school i carried a hammer in my schoolbag
757449 i was arrested when i was 17 questioned about terrorist activity i spent a year in jail at that time i turned 18 in prison
757450 i was on probation at 18 went straight back out and joined another unit and got involved i was sent back to prison with a five year sentence we had political status in prison i learnt more about weapons training and bomb making in prison than i did outside
757451 when i came out again there was status for me in the organisation i eventually became an area commander i was in charge of a team of men whatever terrorist activity we got up to in that area i had to give permission for
757452 i had an experience of god that turned my life right side up i was locked up one night in my cell as usual and i looked over at my bed and there was a gospel tract my cell mate said whats that
757453 i held it up and read it rolled it up in a ball and threw it out the window fifteen minutes later and suddenly this thought came into my head david its time to change become a christian
757454 i knew something had happened from the very first day i became a christian
757455 he spat in my face i had no feeling of any kind to retaliate or attack him i just smiled at him and wiped the spittle off my face from that day to this ive never had a fight today im a pastor in a church in manchester
757456 we applaud the extraordinary courage of these elected burmese mps many of whom have spent long periods in jail
757457 the commitment and progress of the international community to the mdgs thus far is to be commended
757458 gods message of reconciliation calls us to action indeed our faith calls us to go beyond the conservative targets set by the millennium development goals merely to halve extreme poverty we know that the aspirations of the poor and marginalised are inseparable from our own personal or national fulfilment the goal of our faith is that all may have life and have it in its fullness
757459 one of the greatest public demonstrations of faith that this great city has ever seen
757460 a very powerful message of the bishops of the anglican communion with people like myself and other religious leaders saying this is serious its not just something you ought to do its a moral imperative
757461 its really quite tragic that we are so far from achieving the millennium goals as the prime minister was saying we just cant go on like this promises have been made and promises can be fulfilled so it is a moral conversion thats needed and thats why i think the witness of the bishops today is so significant they are not just saying we need to give unlimited money its a moral conversion on the part of governments and the part of people to say this must be fulfilled
757462 i think this is sending a very powerful message not just across the uk but right around the world about the importance that all the leaders who are here attach to the mdgs and the need to deliver those goals by 2015
757463 the prime minister has very fulsomely and rightly acknowledged the importance of the campaigning by the churches on this issue and i think events like this can play a big part in pushing governments around the world to deliver on their commitments and so to hit the goals on time
757464 we are alarmed that these reforms will perpetuate the harmful stereotypes that portray people living in poverty as work shy scroungers
757465 it is the countries which are the least responsible for causing climate change that are paying the heaviest price the average uk citizen produces nearly 50 times as much carbon dioxide as the average citizen in the developing world this is a serious injustice
757466 do not fly in the face of the poor by allowing the emissions produced by endless and unnecessary business flights to keep growing insist on an 80 cut in your national emissions and hold your governments to account
757467 as an african i urgently call on ordinary people in rich countries to act as global citizens not as isolated consumers we must listen to our consciences and not to governments who speak only about economic markets these markets will cease to exist if climate change is allowed to develop to climate chaos
757468 this is a message to people everywhere who challenge the causes of poverty around the world climate change is for real as i speak famine is increasing flooding is increasing as is disease and insecurity globally because of water scarcity
757469 there is no doubt that the church can do better
757470 there is a need common to all of us around the world and not just in the first world either to get beyond risk management and recognise the care of the vulnerable as being a core element of the gospel we proclaim and live
757471 this conference is a response to the anglican communions desire to lead the way internationally in the safeguarding of vulnerable people it effectively gives birth to a new network for advocacy better professional standards and mutual learning in all areas of safeguarding
757472 historically faith communities were gatekeepers of both the moral imperative and the judicial process
757473 we are committed to the complete safety of children and all vulnerable people so why are we now on the back foot why arent we leading the charge this is a message we will be presenting to the lambeth conference on july 29 and to the wider anglican community
757474 what we are here to talk about should be top of the agenda for the bishops at the lambeth conference
757475 hes always been the one thatll be saying ill be there ill help you hes a legend

757482 i hate newspapermen they come into camp and pick up their camp rumors and print them as facts i regard them as spies which in truth they are if i killed them all there would be news from hell before breakfast
757483 i dont think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president
757484 buckling down and pressing my secret to its fullest potential
757485 this is something that i caught onto just before 2000 when there was so much search engine craze running around and started doing small just to test things at first but which i later expanded on after getting the hang of it
757486 ive actually gotten over 87 million in advertising that using my secret i never had to pay for and the largest share of which was more recently in google pay per clicks as well as other forms of pad advertising at search engines all of which i got for free
757487 wow ha this is really unique and in my expert opinion it would only serve to enhance and bring more business to us at name of search engine withheld for legal amp confidentiality reasons and not cause us to lose business in the slightest amazing
757488 well see just how long i can make it available before it saturates things
757489 hes already so amazingly rich that whether he continues or discontinues its sale will neither make nor break the man but not grabbing it for yourself while its still available could prove disastrous for you as you may only have one chance and a very limited one at that to get this
757490 container especially those of wine may be sold for its value
757491 because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country and that he felt that the democrats had tied his countrys hands in the war on terror and they had ruined every institution in america with the aid of media outlets
757492 he could not get to the leaders of the liberal movement that he would then target those that had voted them in to office
757493 it appears that church had received some publicity regarding its liberal stance
757494 desegregation racial harmony fair wages womens rights and gay rights
757495 his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country and that he felt that the democrats had tied his countrys hands in the war on terror and they had ruined every institution in america with the aid of media outlets

757501 no nos creeremos que han eliminado a italia hasta que el vuelo de regreso este en roma y los jugadores se vaya cada uno para su casa
757502 if you are familiar with the origin story its not that hard to figure out
757503 i think were going to be able to stay pretty close to the origin of these characters
757504 they are from 1 000 years in the future and theyll have flight rings and code names and everything else
757505 ive known the smallville writing team todd slavkin darren swimmer brian wayne peterson and kelly souders for a long time
757506 i had an idea for an episode so we all had lunch and i pitched them the idea of bringing the legion of super heroes to smallville and were off and running
757507 i cant get into any specifics about the story were telling because were still working on it all but theyre from the 31st century and it will be focusing on some obvious characters who first met clark
757508 it will be written to fit with smallville and i think its going to be a really fun challenge to approach the legion in a different way but with me you know youre going to see legion rings and theyre going to be as true to the core as possible its going to be the legion of super heroes
757509 shouldnt clark be getting a visit from three teenagers in a time bubble soon
757510 editor eddie berganza told me hes surprised with three versions of the legion that im trying to give each of them a sense of distinction
757511 i take the challenge of three legions and making all the alternate dimension characters like three cosmic boys different stylized characters i didnt want them to appear as the same character at different ages like a dual role type thing i didnt want it to be like the mirror mirror episode of star trek where there were doppelgangers played by the same actors
757512 when i was working on the different eras of the legion i would evoke the artists who were the most established ones at that point in time these three versions of the legion are very different especially the current one barry kitson and francis manapul are totally different artists so distinctly different that i had to find a middle ground to make this present version of the legion diverse
757513 i have three full loose leaf binders of references right now
757514 i gage my references by the pound i print out all references to look at i think this project will rival jla avengers as far as the amount of individual reference sheets go

757516 an ugly brew of rising unemployment spiking foreclosures and gyrating energy prices is plaguing the country and making life difficult for federal reserve chairman ben bernanke as he tries to right the economy
757517 this is a very subtle difference but it is significant
757518 persons with emerging als may also have similarly subtle symptoms
757519 we can only guess why this pattern is less common in the mutants
757520 such therapies could very well be effective against the non genetic version of the disease as well

757565 how many cosmic boys will we see after legion of three worlds
757566 a different character were okay with him we cant really talk about it though thats more of a dc question
757567 superboy prime is a different character so we can use him but we cant really talk about it
757568 thats the central focus point of legion of three worlds
757569 if you heard news paul levitz and i were returning to the legion how would you respond
757570 okay so in this one legion just how many say cosmic boys might we see

757581 senator obamas action today will help unify the democratic party it also underscores the need for a fairer and more sensible process for selecting presidential nominees as well as the critical role of michigan and florida two representative swing states over the efforts of iowa and new hampshire to perpetuate their privileged position in that process
757582 as always our goal is to ensure a fair process and a unified democratic party so that we can win in november

757590 theres a whole new generation of young people that were born with hiv that are reaching adulthood it presents very interesting challenges
757591 they cant talk about their diagnosis in the school because they can be kicked out they cant talk about it in their communities with their neighbors
757592 we need to start getting young people involved in leadership again in hiv and aids because its easy to get kind of complacent
757593 i want to congratulate all the boys and girls who have graduated and got good grades
757594 sometimes i have so much fun that i forget i have this
757595 i tell them to first explain about the disease how its transmitted how it cant be transmitted what it is
757596 and then they should tell them with confidence that they have it if they want
757597 our commitment to social justice stems from our christian faith motivating us to provide a response to those in need regardless of others personal beliefs or culture
757598 this award recognises the hard work of staff and volunteers and the young people themselves seeing lives turned around and moving on positively into the future
757599 are doing church for churchs sake with little or no impact in their communities
757600 coaching is great for providing the tips tools and strategies or what you might call the how to of leadership
757601 there is a sense in which people are walking into church and coming to the conclusion that it has nothing to offer them in terms of getting through life big issues like money sex relationships family and how to manage your emotions are rarely preached on
757602 christianity is today by and large seen and experienced as a womens and childrens faith where men are rarely seen while the leaders may still predominantly be men the congregations they now speak to are primarily women and children
757603 people either seem to love it or hate it very little in between
757604 i thought the archbishop of york summed it up best you may not agree with everything in it but you cannot ignore its direction of travel
757605 much to ing and fro ing in our conversations frank expression and robust debate
757606 you can all help shape fresh more honest and more constructive ways of being a conference and being a communion the conference seeks to build up a trustful community in this time together one reason we began with a retreat so that our common trust in god could be renewed
757607 its my conviction that the option to which we are being led is one whose keywords are of council and covenant it is the vision of an anglicanism whose diversity is limited not by centralised control but by consent
757608 if our efforts at finding greater coherence for our communion dont result in more transforming love for the needy in greater awareness and compassion for those whose humanity is abused or denied then this coherence is a hollow self serving thing a matter of living religiously rather than biblically
757609 my impression from speaking with the bishops both during the retreat and since is that there is an overwhelming commitment to the life of the communion from those who are here there is a very strong sense that the communion is alive and vital that yes we have difficult issues to address and yes there are deep differences amongst us and we have to engage those
757610 we must go into this conference confident that a way has been found to the father to the heavenly life in the heart of the father through the son via the cross and resurrection we must be confident that the way is there and in this conference together we are seeking to discern where it is and follow it thats very close to the heart of the christian faith
757611 passing this business improvement district is the single most important thing we could do to improve downtown ever says council member lisa goodman whose ward includes the heart of the city
757612 i find that in my various roles i have continued to be drawn to the sort of work traidcraft does in fact i have never stopped telling people about traidcraft since i was first involved
757613 i greatly enjoyed and valued my association with an organisation which helped pioneer fair trade in the uk of course the organisation has continued to grow and develop in a number of new ways so it is no longer the same traidcraft i knew
757614 meanwhile my work and other interests have given me greater experience and understanding so i feel i have new skills and knowledge to contribute i am really looking forward to serving as a trustee once more
757615 last monday the entrance door of our house of prayer at the mission night
757616 they have cast fire into thy sanctuary psalm 73 7
757617 this week is very busy with preparations for the childrens camp
757618 muslim fertility rates are dropping noticeably in europe and dramatically in the middle east and north africa fundamentalism thrives in communities with large extended families and poverty and this pattern is diminishing among europes muslim communities a sub replacement birthrate was one of the causes of the decline of christianity in europe and it looks set to do the same for islam in europe
757619 muslims in the west are finding they can practice islam without pressure from islamic governments so here in the uk both dangerous islamists and freethinking reformers are emerging the west is now the crucible in which islam is being openly debated and modified for the 21st century
757620 i suggest the outcome of the debate in this country that is going on between muslims could well affect the outcome for the future of islam worldwide
757621 the presence of two million british muslims accounting for the illegals cannot be a mistake or god is not sovereign
757622 history has come full circle and christianity is seen once more simply as one among a plethora of competing alternatives all of which are regarded by an increasing number of influential intellectuals as dangerous
757623 we are called upon to defend the gospel it is on trial faith is under fire and it is not only its contents it is the messengers and we will increasingly find we have not only to defend the gospel to the world but we have to defend it to believers as well
757624 what paul had to say about the cross and the death of christ for sin according to hitchens this doctrine is immoral according to richard dawkins it is barking mad the attack is in full sway and the intensity is increasing and we need to understand and remind ourselves that paul the apostles and jesus christ stand or fall together we shall have to count the cost of what it means to defend historical christianity
757625 a danger that i see is all around is a loss of confidence in gods word and its authority we have to decide what side we are on and whether we are going to stand with paul and the apostles and have confidence in the word and maintain the faith for which many of our forefathers stood
757626 there is a place where christians and muslims are at war
757627 i expect to be hated i expect to be persecuted i expect for muslims to kill me someday ive had many death threats
757628 spring of 95 i was confronting one of the muslim speakers down there at speakers corner and i got attacked
757629 i was knocked unconscious surrounded by 60 muslims there was only one other christian with me
757630 that was in the newspaper the police came to me concerned they couldnt see me in the crowd they said if youre going to do this again youve got to get up on a ladder so we can see you
757631 i didnt have a very loud voice back then i was shy and unassuming because of what had happened i said lets try i got up on the ladder and started these confrontations from the ladder
757632 i found immediately i had a lot more authority on a ladder and i could control the crowd better its 2008 its gone 13 years a lot more people are doing it now
757633 george bush a self confessing born again christian all these christians clapping they are born again christians their brother george bush prays to god but george bush has already killed a million iraqis
757634 i am delighted to have received the honour of an obe particularly as a non uk citizen
757635 starting out as a doctor in vellore in india many years ago i had little idea that i would end up being the director of one of the uks largest development agencies but what i did realise was how much needed to be done to help and to change the lives of poor people
757636 what has influenced my life has been a passion for justice and for alleviating poverty in this i have had the opportunity at christian aid to work with fantastic colleagues and with very dedicated partners overseas
757637 i believe this obe acknowledges the contribution of many as we have attempted to have impact on poverty eradication and influencing policies i thank god for the wonderful opportunities i have had not just to put my faith into action but the privilege of leading this outstanding organisation we have a loyal supporter base whose commitment and generous giving make christian aids work possible
757638 i was really humbled by the work of the sailors society port chaplains as their support of seafarers is very significant they are an invisible workforce and i am only too pleased to endorse their work
757639 the sailors society was delighted that the minister had the opportunity to meet with so many of the chaplains especially at a time when crew retention is acutely important
757640 chaplains are at the forefront of the interface with seafarers and are therefore able to give an unembellished account of seafarers concerns
757641 thank you for all that there is all that is not and all that is yet to come
757642 but i cant draw like you my drawings are ugly
757643 when i was your age i cant draw like you do it took me years before i was able to make the drawings that i do today but you youre only 6 and yet you can already make beautiful artwork you have your own style and people love it as it is dont try to copy my drawings because that will mean losing your style always try to be unique because you are special in your own way there is only one you in this world but i cant do it its ugly who says your drawings are ugly only you how will you expect others to see its beauty when you dont believe in it you always have to believe in yourself before others can believe in you what you have is a gift from god when you dont appreciate and use that gift one day he might take it away
757644 what is the one trait or quality you would like your child to possess when he grows up and why i would like my daughter to grow up an optimistic person someone who sees the good in everything her positive outlook will make her resilient in facing lifes difficulties and struggles building strength of character perseverance and the virtue of patience in the process and because she believes that every individual possesses innate goodness what she sees through her profound concept of what is good will help her encourage those who lack self confidence and uplift those who have a poor sense of self by helping them realize their positive qualities she will then develop altruism selflessness and the gift of hope that will always be with her in whatever she does or whatever situation she faces
757645 ill let you kill him if you stay a bit
757646 to be able to read the word of god in my own mother tongue will be very special looking at all odds against our country the first dari bible is a new beginning of hope and a future
757647 is a triumph for the place of conscience in public duties
757648 this is an important landmark judgement because it conclusively confirms that where there are competing rights a balance has to be struck which treats the respective rights equally
757649 the tribunal made it clear that it would be wrong for one set of rights to trump another
757650 the tribunals unanimous decision is a triumph for the place of conscience in public duties
757651 in which every voice can be heard and in which we build christian relationship
757652 is not that after two weeks we will find a solution to all our problems but we shall as i have written more than once in some sense find the trust in god and one another that will give us the energy to change in the way god wants us to change that is the most important thing we can pray for the energy to change as god wants us to change individually and as a communion
757653 i think its important i should say that its a great grief that many of our brothers and sisters in the communion have not felt able to be with us for these weeks a grief because we need their voice and they need ours in learning christ together
757654 i respect and accept the decisions that have been made but together we need in prayer to acknowledge the wound that that makes in our fellowship
757655 that we still have to mend relations that have been hurt i hope that in these weeks we shall daily be remembering those who are not with us upholding them in our prayers in our respect and love
757656 i dont imagine that simply building relationships solves our problems but the nature of our calling as christians is such that we dare not and i say very strongly dare not pretend that we can meet and discuss without attention to this quality of relation with each other even if we disagree or find ourselves going in different directions the lord of the church commands that we must love one another in the process and there is no alternative to that i trust that you are here in that confidence in that willingness to love one another
757657 because we know as we meet that we are also a wounded body
757658 but as we seek to meet jesus christ in each other we hope that the wounds that are still open will in some sense also be open to receive the work of god the holy spirit in our work
757659 this is more evidence that the gap between rich and poor is growing to unacceptable levels across all sectors of uk society
757660 fearing violence the pastor and the police sent away the congregation soon after the mob including the monks entered the church and completely destroyed everything within leaving only the walls standing
757661 the mob then turned on the pastor and five workers beating them with clubs and rods a police officer who attempted to shield the pastor also received blows
757662 but in practice charity work would be held as allurement and talk of a saviour as fraud while any reference to sin judgement or punishment could be construed as force
757663 the basic human right of christians to worship must be upheld along with their freedom to speak about their faith the authorities must act to protect its citizens from militant extremists whose violent brand of intolerance seems to be gaining ground
757664 we have been so impressed with how scripture unions wordlive service has developed in offering christians a fantastic range of creative approaches to engage with the bible
757665 we want to encourage word on the web subscribers to move to what we believe is a very creative way to encounter what god has to say to them through this innovative multi media solution like word on the web it is free service something we believe is important
757666 sometimes you need to jolt people out of their complacency we take access to clean water completely for granted here in the developed world and waste so much yet for a large proportion of the world water is literally a life and death issue
757667 water is essential for life yet 1 in 6 people across the world do not have access to this basic human right
757668 as a gp in the uk i rarely see illnesses caused by dirty water but we must not underestimate the global scale of consumption of unclean water and time is quickly running out to help those in need
757669 living life in a slum is reality for 1 billion people and by going through the slum survivor challenge im hoping that the issue of poverty and those communities who have to live without proper shelter sanitation or clean water is highlighted
757670 being part of the slum survivor challenge has been about experiencing just a tiny part of what life is like for these communities its important that we keep up pressure on governments and make sure that they progress in achieving the millennium development goals one of which focuses on improving the lives of slum dwellers around the world
757671 being part of this initiative is an act of solidarity
757672 the slum survivor initiative is about reminding governments that this kind of life is a reality for so many people and we need to take action
757673 slum survivor will help educate a new generation of young campaigners to raise awareness of the issues the poor around the world face by having just a glimpse of what slum dwellers have to live with we hope it will empower young people to understand how they can be part of making a difference to the lives of so many
757674 they took rehmat by force they held him and tortured him for almost two days rehmat could not bear the severity of the torture and died
757675 the police were biased because it was a matter of religion
757676 there have been many tragic cases of so called honour killing in pakistan
757677 this report reaffirms our belief that the christian church is a sign of gods love for our world it emphasises the unique value of each young persons life and seeks to inspire the churches to reach out to young people in inner cities caught up in social disorder as an act of good neighbourliness
757678 isaiah 58 v 6 12 is a great inspiration to this project and the values and practices that flow from it
757679 the name came to mind when we were fundraising to provide a christmas dinner to those who would normally eat alone
757680 we raised money through having a table where we sold things for very little and at times when the need arose gave away what was needed
757681 it was amazing to witness what was sold each day the money we had made from so very little and then to see the table full again the following day i remember saying this is just like the story of the loaves and fishes where god provided what was needed out of so very little
757682 it didnt stop there though because of my work i witnessed a great need for things like clothes food furniture etc i began to store these things in my garage and then pass them onto whoever needed them
757683 i got married to a man who shared the same heart as me so we continued to do this work together
757684 my job changed i began working at a womens refuge where the need got greater my job was and still is to help these women rebuild their lives and help them set up home again
757685 one night i had a dream i saw myself in a big beautiful building which had been donated to me to help people in need i stood still but glanced around the room every door was for a certain need but one was open and that room was for the disabled
757686 one day we received a phone call from a man i knew
757687 we had prayed for this to happen and here it was in a phone call we soon found a unit an old mechanics garage the rent being 200 a month and the electric being 50 up front
757688 the amazing thing yet again was that a few days before a lady had said that the lord had told her to help us pay for a place where people in need could come and choose what they wanted she offered to pay 200 a month for the foreseeable future
757689 the following day another gentleman kindly placed 50 in my hands and said that someone had given it to him to do with what he thinks best wow

757692 we will have four buses right here in front of greater st john on september 2 and we are going to take our kids to winnetka so our kids can see what a state of the art school looks like
757693 we need children in school on that first day of school
757694 its a broken system and as people of god we must insist that they level the playing field
757695 i do believe we have nothing to lose at all if we keep our children away from the chicago public school system
757696 mother parker you have been and are an inspiration to me and others in the church
757697 ive been here and until my father calls me i will be here

757705 distances between toll booths is known to the inch so with the simple equation of average speed distance time it will be easy to determine who was speeding and issue a summons with absolutely no way to wrangle your way out of it

757725 because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country and that he felt that the democrats had tied his countrys hands in the war on terror and they had ruined every institution in america with the aid of media outlets
757726 he could not get to the leaders of the liberal movement that he would then target those that had voted them in to office
757727 what makes conservatism so unpalatable today is its sic the inability of its adherents to accept responsibility for the results of their own ideas and the consequences of their political theories the conservative mind dreads having the historical tables turned on it since 1968 conservatives have blamed liberals for a failed track record arguing for example that the great society didnt tackle the problem of poverty and sometimes exacerbated it now with the track record of george w bush plain to see conservative intellectuals fear liberals can return the favor

757745 we are going to have to go to alternative energy and the exploitation of existing reserves of oil natural gas even coal and we can develop clean coal technology are all great things but we also have to devote our efforts in my view to alternative energy sources which is the ultimate answer to our long term energy needs and we need it sooner rather than later
757746 be very helpful in the short term resolving our energy crisis
757747 i believe it is time for the federal government to lift these restrictions and to put our own reserves to use
757748 as a matter of fairness to the american people and a matter of duty for our government we must deal with the here and now and assure affordable fuel for america by increasing domestic production
757749 can i just say that this young man just pointed out that that he believes in states rights and so do i and the people of louisiana decided that they wanted to drill off of their coast and they do the people of california and the people of florida those two states decided that they didnt what i would like to do frankly is to maybe give them a greater source of the revenues to help maybe encourage them to allow some kind of exploration far off of their shores but if i told the state of california youve got to have drilling off of your coast that would frankly be a contradiction of what were just talking about about thats their land and thats off of their coast
757750 a windfall profits tax on oil to go along with the new taxes he also plans for coal and natural gas

757760 die bundes rztekammer teilt deshalb die massiven verfassungs rechtlichen bedenken die in dem aktuell ver ffentlichten von der bundeszahn rztekammer in auftrag gegebenen kurz gutachten dargestellt werden

757765 i am delighted at this decision it is a victory for religious liberty not just for myself but for others in a similar position to mine
757766 gay rights should not be used as an excuse to bully and harass people over their religious beliefs
757767 this is an important landmark judgement because it conclusively confirms that where there are competing rights a balance has to be struck which treats the respective rights equally
757768 the tribunal made it clear that it would be wrong for one set of rights to trump another
757769 this year the conference more than ever before is focused on providing practical tools to churches and leaders to more effectively make a positive difference in their local community and the world
757770 there is great strength in the church coming together and it makes a powerful statement to our city and nation that the church of jesus christ is alive and strong

757784 im delighted everyone has had a fantastic day theres been some really good golf played and its great to see friendships grow as people walk together
757785 it was set up a year ago with a five year plan to put on christian golf days that church members could bring along their friends who dont go to church
757786 its people with a passion for golf and people with a passion for god just having a good time on the golf course
757787 this is a major step on the road to creating a more inclusive welcoming and credible church the church as the body of christ is an expression of unity in the great variety of gods creation this report has offered a challenging and exciting opportunity to hear the voices of the marginalised and those working for change in the church

757790 rb is doing a quiet affirming work worldwide in many a priests study
757791 but we felt the time was right for rowena to share in the ministry
757792 our decision was triggered by a request from martin to be released from the band to pursue new projects including his work with compassionart and the desire to be at home more with anna and his children
757793 we will continue to play and be excited about our current tours and bookings but will not be adding many more over the coming 17 months
757794 if we fail to attract and to nourish younger christians in thinking about their calling to ordained ministry indeed any kind of long term ministry we are going to lose a hugely precious resource of enthusiasm and hopefulness in our life together
757795 open doors is joining with others to urge china to let this man go so he can be reunited with his family with the olympic games just a month away it is vital that china demonstrates its respect for human rights and religious liberty
757796 the funding networks been running for years but we wanted to see a forum in which a new generation of philanthropy and christian giving would be encouraged
757797 we also wanted to see money get to small charities some of the kitchen table charities havent got big marketing machines or fundraising mechanisms and they struggle to find a few thousand pounds to operate we wanted to help money get to them
757798 there were some great charities here and a great mix of national and international organisations theres also a lot of passion that passion is what drives a lot of charities and their founders and i think thats what inspired people here to give
757799 im really delighted with the way things have gone today
757800 i think we got the right charities here and through our networks we managed to get about 50 or 60 of the right people here its gone better than we dared dream it would to raise 100 000 plus giftaid for these charities is great but its not just the money i think some of the relationships started here will be more long term
757801 this is one of the countrys most heart warming events and through the years its been a real privilege to meet these children and their families and to be joined in honouring these youngsters by many guests from the worlds of television music and sport were now launching the 2008 awards so if your child or a child you know shows kindness or bravery this is your chance to nominate them so that they can get the recognition they truly deserve
757802 high food and fuel prices are crippling for those who already live a hand to mouth existence
757803 this is not the time to step away from hard fought commitments to help the worlds poorest people
757804 for rich countries 50 billion is pennies for africa this is life and death
757805 there is a moral reason why we cant allow high food and oil prices to undermine our work in africa
757806 africa can become a serious producer of food and can help us in bringing down food prices
757807 no safe haven no place to hide for the criminal cabal that make up the mugabe regime
757808 the g8 summit has been overshadowed by the events in zimbabwe i hope that the whole international community will find it possible to condemn the illegitimate regime in zimbabwe
757809 the unanimity of the whole international community reflecting the outrage people feel about the violence the intimidation and the illegitimate holding of power by the mugabe government
757810 im glad to see that zimbabwe is on the agenda
757811 whats really important is that the g8 countries are still pushing for action
757812 five million people are in serious need of food and this figure will increase even further if something is not done to resolve the crisis and restore peace
757813 consider and adopt the goal of achieving at least 50 per cent reductions in global emissions by 2050
757814 it is essential that developed countries take the lead in achieving ambitious and absolute greenhouse gas emissions reductions
757815 i think people are very ignorant of the scope of non violent protest
757816 non violent protest doesnt leave behind the legacy of hatred caused by military action
757817 i think there are acts of justice within war but one of the facts of war is to demonise the enemy
757818 going to war is the worst thing to do except if not going to war is even worse the only just cause is defence against injustice it must not be proactive for retribution or revenge
757819 when my mother found out i had become a christian she went to the local mosque and told them that i had gone crazy
757820 she went to get some holy water to heal me of my madness a campaign was set up against me people would come and bang on the door every ten minutes during the night
757821 he continually intimidated and harassed me and hired someone to beat me in the street wherever we went there would always be a car following us and watching us
757822 as his dad told him that he had arranged for someone to kill me and was pressing my son for details of the layout of our home where the alarm was and where i slept
757823 everyone in the local muslim community knew i was a christian and didnt want to know me people would cross the street rather than greet me and often spat in my face they tried to pressure me to leave town but i had already been chased out of one town so i was determined not to let them intimidate me
757824 one of the most difficult things about becoming a christian from a muslim background is losing your family there are such tight family networks in our communities if someone becomes a christian then they are considered to bring shame on the whole family and the only response is to cut them out of the family
757825 so do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will care for itself

757839 the aim of pedal for primus is to raise funds to help the charity change lives whilst cyclists have the achievement of completing a genuine physical challenge
757840 the money raised will help to extend faith amp footballs community and educational programmes in the uk including inner city football leagues literacy schemes and a business enterprise challenge and our overseas work which supports orphans aids victims disabled and poverty stricken children in africa india and mexico
757841 even high street pound stores are running 50 off sales
757842 i welcome the plans announced yesterday by the economic secretary to the treasury for helping credit unions the positive benefits that credit union membership brings to communities are manifold especially to those on low incomes these proposals which include allowing groups as well as individuals to become members and which enable credit unions to pay interest on members deposits are very good news indeed as a result the credit union movement will grow and be able to provide its services to a much wider number of people especially local community and religious groups and people on low incomes who may otherwise have to rely on less affordable or reliable loan options
757843 the encouragement of locally based entirely trustworthy user friendly educationally sensitive and confidence building methods of managing debt should be among governments highest priorities in combating the poverty traps that i have described
757844 we are called hope because the vision god has given us is to take his hope to the young people and 37 comes from ezekiel 37 where god breathes life into dead bones and they come alive
757845 we believe god wants to give his hope and life to the young people of this town
757846 we give out hot drinks and biscuits as a way of meeting a need in them and as a tool to engage young people in conversation
757847 we listen to them show interest in their lives respect value and accept them
757848 our work is making a difference in the lives of individual young people by helping them to overcome the difficult issues
757849 some comments written in the office comments book include i think you are really funny and nice
757850 our plan is to convert a double decker bus into a mobile youth centre which can be taken into the local council estates and schools
757851 we believe the bus will be an invaluable tool in tackling such issues as anti social behaviour alcohol and drug abuse youth offending etc we cant solve these problems but we can try and make some sort of difference
757852 its the scientific age why are you believing in jesus its not the age for religious things you have to go with us and carry a gun and fight for the nation
757853 my father in this world left me but my father in heaven will never leave me he will always love me
757854 they made a slogan christians have to move from this village otherwise we will kill it was really hard but praise god god took every care no one backslid no one left christ they became very strong believers and they are the ones who are working the village now
757855 go into the world and preach the gospel what youve received from god share it with other people who do not know christ
757856 whenever persecution comes in your life do not be discouraged just go and ask for strength from god and god will save you god will guide you in every difficulty in every difficult situation keep strong faith in god
757857 gafcons proposals for the way ahead are problematic in all sorts of ways
757858 and i urge those who have outlined these to think very carefully about the risks entailed
757859 a primates council which consists only of a self selected group from among the primates of the communion will not pass the test of legitimacy for all in the communion and any claim to be free to operate across provincial boundaries is fraught with difficulties both theological and practical theological because of our historic commitments to mutual recognition of ministries in the communion practical because of the obvious strain of responsibly exercising episcopal or primatial authority across enormous geographical and cultural divides
757860 two questions arise at once about what has been proposed by what authority are primates deemed acceptable or unacceptable members of any new primatial council and how is effective discipline to be maintained in a situation of overlapping and competing jurisdictions
757861 it is not enough to dismiss the existing structures of the communion if they are not working effectively the challenge is to renew them rather than to improvise solutions that may seem to be effective for some in the short term but will continue to create more problems than they solve
757862 i believe that it is wrong to assume we are now so far apart that all those outside the gafcon network are simply proclaiming another gospel
757863 for many years we have added to our strong policy analysis by placing experienced professional development workers with partners in the 11 countries where we work we have made these changes to respond to the challenges of broadening our supporter base and raising the profile of vital issues facing the developing world and the world at large such as our campaigns on terminator gene technology and the ongoing need for justice and reconciliation in east timor
757864 they promised in 2001 to eradicate the worst forms of exploitative labour from their industry by 2005 they failed
757865 they promised to do it by 1 july 2008 by putting in place certification of each farm that it was slave free
757866 tragically they have redefined certification so it now merely means surveying the situation on top of that they target only 50 of the cocoa producing regions in ivory coast and ghana instead of the required 100
757867 climate change causes the poorest people to suffer and the longer we wait the more suffering there will be
757868 that means a target of 80 cut in emissions by 2050 including the uks share of the international aviation and shipping industries
757869 as christians we need to live in harmony with creation climate change is going to profoundly affect our society and we need to be aware of just how profoundly it will affect us
757870 the meeting in egypt is significant the situation is ripe for the african union leaders to take a stand
757871 this is no longer a zimbabwean issue but an african issue and an international issue
757872 we know we are being watched but when we preach we cant overlook corruption and suffering
757873 the witch hunt is on a government obsessed with phoney egalitarianism and control freakery is aligning itself with the strident secularist lobby to threaten the future of faith schools in britain
757874 our aim should be for all state funded schools to admit and include children regardless of their religious or non religious backgrounds so that they can learn from and with each other in a mixed environment
757875 the report suggests that the critics of faith schools are primarily die hard secularists

757931 hes been out of my life for ten years i wasnt thinking of him

757940 thats enough black this is what i wanted you to see
757941 you have dreams about them right you still think about them right well
757942 im not ben anymore like you said my name is black
757943 benjamin vladamir died five months ago before he saved and avenged his best friends who abandoned him shortly after
757944 im not ben anymore kelly when you understand that itll be too late
757945 watch as her final breaths exit her lungs and her body falls limp
757946 police what are you going to tell them benjamin vladamir returned from the grave as the devils servant and killed your friends ha dont make me laugh sweetheart
757947 theyve just witnessed everyone here die and that leaves quite an impression when a ghost kills your friends
757948 touch her again and ill break your fucking legs got that
757949 im afraid im going to ask for that back now
757950 im here for you you know that but you dont want me trust me
757951 but its over now and everything will be okay okay
757952 quando eu acordo voc nunca est l mas quando eu durmo voc est em todos os lugares
757953 be distinguishable from purely secular and or social work in similar fields
757954 i am not sure whether i am the oldest knitter the charity has but it is feeling so sorry for the little children in the orphanages in africa that helps to keep me going it would be interesting to see whether there is anyone else out there still knitting for feed the children at my age
757955 we have a loyal circle of knitters and it would be interesting to find if any are more senior than phyllis it is not something we generally like to do ask our older supporters how old they are but we feel it is well worth celebrating rather than hiding knitting is often regarded as a relaxing and therapeutic pastime but in our case it also saves lives
757956 without divine intervention and a concerted international effort there seems to be no hope for the country
757957 it is impossible to overstate the importance of this election its fairness its outcome and its aftermath
757958 events in the coming weeks will challenge the people of zimbabwe and the world to find means of overcoming violence in the exercise of democracy and the results will influence the future of the nation and the region
757959 i am delighted to be heading up such an innovative programme at the university of gloucestershire and look forward to seeing the various module pathways develop in future years
757960 i am delighted with this news rejesus co uk was established to enable people who are not connected with church to be able to explore issues around who jesus is and how he impacts on issues of life and spirituality
757961 the partnership with church army will help bring fresh impetus and additional resources to the development of the site and help build on our success in establishing rejesus co uk as the number one place on the web to go to find out about jesus
757962 rejesus is a fantastically creative and entertaining resource for those who want to discover more about jesus and the christian faith
757963 while some of us missed out on the luxuries this was nothing compared to the daily injustices experienced by the worlds poorest the fulfilment of the millennium development goals is vital to change this
757964 the church worldwide is the only network that can hope to bring about the co ordinated joint pressure on world leaders that can prevent what began as firm commitments becoming ultimately broken promises
757965 micah challenge calls on christians around the world to come together in a united cry for an end to this injustice this is an historic opportunity and we must act now
757966 faith groups through their network of followers have the power to mobilise millions across the world and inspire others to do the same for centuries christians have been working to eradicate poverty
757967 in this year of action on the millennium development goals i am heartened to know this will continue and that together in partnership we are pushing to accelerate progress on the mdgs and truly form a global partnership for development
757968 our government along with 188 others around the world made a promise a covenant to the poor we want to hold our government accountable to do what they have said
757969 we are convinced that if we fail the poor the world will be a poorer place we will be the global conscience of our leaders with and on behalf of the poor
757970 micah challenge is harnessing that faith to unite christians globally from across church denominations to deepen that commitment to people living in poverty through prayer service and advocacy you are already making a huge difference
757971 ockay told us of his former school that was virtually derelict and we began to raise money to put roofs on some of the classrooms
757972 there were still many classrooms that were derelict there were no resources and hyperinflation was causing misery
757973 i felt that i couldnt leave it there there was so much more to be done
757974 also my aim had shifted i now felt that education for the children must be the main focus to free them from the cycle of poverty
757975 sometimes i become very despondent when i dont receive replies to my letters this leads me to question why god chose me to help this growing school but only for a moment as it has become so much a part of my life
757976 our hope is to put electricity into the school and convert a classroom into a mill so the parents can grind their food to sell this will enable the school to sustain itself for years to come
757977 some boys were maimed their eyes dug out after that the biafran government disbanded the boys company
757978 i am delighted that dfid is sponsoring this event helping the next generation better understand the world they will inherit and the meaningful contribution that they personally can make to reducing poverty
757979 we are looking to pray for the work of gods people around the world and i am thankful to our partners for helping us find stories of their people doing good in areas of great need prayer and politics are important ways in which christians can have an influence for good in the world
757980 the national prayer breakfast is an established annual opportunity for mps lords and others to meet together to pray for the issues of the nation and the world
757981 for all necessary action to be taken to sustain and develop public service broadcasting for the common good
757982 there is a real risk that the flood of information from a proliferation of digital channels could be confusing and bewildering creating a modern tower of babel rather than being enlightening public service broadcasting can be a comprehensive authoritative and trustworthy guide in this environment therefore the full range of public service content needs to be made available across all platforms internet mobile and digital
757983 many christians and other onlookers are completely baffled by the nasty arguments within anglicanism right now
757984 these rows are missing four key ingredients an understanding that top down models of the church are dying that the world needs examples of reconciliation and peacemaking rather than animosity that many want to affirm gay christians on deeply traditional grounds and that disagreement without courtesy and love is destroying the credibility of the churchs message
757985 even the most cursory glance at the historical engagement of churches in public life shows that the love of enemies forgiveness hospitality repentance social equality and turning the other cheek urged by the founder of the christian faith has often been embarrassingly conspicuous by its absence
757986 in the summer of 2007 i helped with a concert for homeless people in manchester city centre i spent an evening listening to life stories and hearing about the boredom and aimlessness of life on the streets many folk expressed an interest in acting so i came home and wrote a film script for them
757987 we had about 25 participants with a core of 10 people who were cast as the main characters in the film
757988 this has been an amazing journey for all of us i have seen our actors grow in confidence develop their imaginations and begin to work as a team visitors commented on the talent discovered in this group
757989 this has been an incredibly affirming experience for the actors the project goes on ill be entering the film into short film festivals and will be making it available to anyone who works with homeless people to show what is possible if only someone invests in and believes in you
757990 to further the gospel and show christ to the world
757991 i know many bishops in england who do not agree with everything other bishops say or do not agree with some of the things they have done but are committed to being together to pray together and to seek to demonstrate christian love to their flocks i commend them for their leadership and godly example
757992 this is in marked contrast to some bishops at gafcon who refused to condemn violence against gay people in their home countries quite honestly that is disgraceful it sullies their cause and is totally un christian you cannot justify violence in gods name period to the eternal credit of archbishop peter jensen of sydney he condemned the violence those who perpetrate violence against gay people in africa now can use this silence to justify their behaviour christians must speak up and say this is wrong
757993 it is impossible to overstate the importance of this election its fairness its outcome and its aftermath
757994 events in the coming weeks will challenge the people of zimbabwe and the world to find means of overcoming violence in the exercise of democracy and the results will influence the future of the nation and the region
757995 according to government statistics released this month two out of five families in the lowest income bracket wont be able to afford even a weeks holiday this year
757996 without any kind of holiday to look forward to children can be deeply affected emotionally
757997 those living in poverty often suffer from a lack of self confidence and eventually lose hope we have to reach them before that happens
757998 its the worst time of all because i cant afford to take them away
757999 all my children want to do after school clubs camps and school trips but its hard because i dont have the money and that breaks my heart
758000 our family has been very supportive and although this is an unusual situation they have always been interested in and encouraging of our training we are fortunate to both have close and old friends who have known us throughout this journey and their support has been invaluable
758001 weve also made some fabulous friends at college who know all too well what training involves and it has been brilliant to share this experience together
758002 we welcome being part of a church that increasingly celebrates variety and breadth in ministry and are encouraged to have trained alongside men and women and in an environment that encourages balance
758003 after i had stated i was intending to leave i had many dark warnings about the cold hard world outside telling me that there was nobody caring that everybody was selfish and nasty and ready to use me for what they could get and treat me as disposable afterwards
758004 in leaving i felt a great almost overwhelming fear of the unknown and being literally completely on my own in a world i was ignorant of also i carried a huge sadness at distressing my parents particularly the fact that i couldnt make them understand that i still loved them
758005 there is very little known about the effects on children who are raised in cults and choose to leave when an adult
758006 we were delighted to welcome archbishop tutu on his first visit as our president church army is about reaching out to those who have been marginalised or feel voiceless and no one has performed that role better than desmond tutu he is a real inspiration to us as we work to transform lives by helping people to encounter the living god of love and forgiveness
758007 these deportations constitute a major violation of egypts undertakings under international law we are deeply disappointed by this appalling mistreatment of vulnerable people who were merely seeking refuge from repression and our prayers are with those who have been returned
758008 we urge key members of the international community to make strong representations with the egyptian authorities in order to ensure that such violations do not become standard practice and that refugees will henceforth receive the protections that should be afforded to them under international law
758009 usually cases will take months and years to pass such a sentence but this one was dramatically ended so fast and secretly
758010 in the industrialised north we have become wealthy by burning coal oil and gas that is causing climate change by reducing our emissions and sharing this wealth poor communities being hit by climate change can benefit
758011 there is tremendous potential for us to share what we have with those who have so little
758012 through this scheme we will be able to help poor communities cope with the effects of climate change and develop using sustainable energy
758013 my global impact makes a start towards redressing the balance towards those whose lives are being turned upside down by climate change but who have contributed the least to it
758014 our partners in india report murder destruction and intimidation of christians
758015 we have evidence to believe this church sheltered the early christians the 70 disciples of jesus christ the early christians described in the mosaic inscription on st georgeous floor as the 70 beloved by god and divine are said to have fled from jerusalem during the persecution of christians to the northern part of jordan particularly to rihab
758016 we have argued consistently since 2002 that the tax credits system has a design fault which the government must correct if it is to meet its child poverty targets
758017 when the government works out whether a family is in poverty it takes account of the financial needs of all members of the family tax credits however only take account of the needs of one parent which means that children in poverty in two parent families effectively dont receive the same level of assistance as children in single parent families
758018 in reality however most poor children in britain live in two parent families
758019 this design fault also has the effect of creating a fiscal incentive for many couples with children on low to modest incomes to live apart increasing the chances that children will not be brought up in a home with both parents
758020 it is estimated that around half a million people are caring for someone who has a terminal illness ordinary people whose relative or friend has become ill and whose illness is progressive and unlikely to be curable
758021 carers are key partners in ensuing that those approaching the end of life receive the care and support they need and it is important that carers receive the help they need to continue in their caring role
758022 were here to celebrate local projects that make such a difference led by people of faith changing the world transforming communities and having an enormous ripple effect across the country
758023 what these projects are doing in their own communities is sending a message not just in their communities but around the whole of britain that theres nothing wrong with britain that cant be sorted out by whats right about britain i want to thank you for is the tremendous contribution that you make to society were so proud of what you achieve for britain
758024 people of faith are making a vital contribution to the united kingdom it is impossible to talk about community cohesion joined up service delivery or strong and sustainable partnerships without understanding this
758025 by acknowledging the distinctiveness of different faith groups we are also able to harness their commonality as the consultation with people of faith and belief gets under way i am committed to ensuring that the listening process is honest open and accountable as the labour party listens more closely to people of faith and belief my hope is that it will discover again the amazing contribution of people of faith and belief
758026 uncovered huge gaps in government evidence about faith communities in general and the churches in particular
758027 a significant lack of understanding of or interest in the church of englands current or potential contribution in the public sphere indeed we were told that government had consciously decided to focus its evidence gathering almost exclusively on minority religions we were unsurprised to hear that some of these consequently felt victimised
758028 this means that the government cannot include this contribution in its deliberations at most this raises again the view asserted by so many of our respondents this government is positively excluding people of faith
758029 congregations clergy and volunteers running post offices and cafes doctors surgeries and asylum rights centres homeless outreach and bereavement counselling job creation and economic regeneration programmes eco initiatives and youth clubs peace networks and third world solidarity groups
758030 introduce new legislation to create a level playing field for faith based agencies seeking to engage in public service reform contracting and civic action
758031 it is unsurprising that our respondents in the church and parliament from the regions to london in business and academia told us that a fresh dialogue was needed such a fresh conversation supported by new research and a new commitment on the part of both the church and government to mobilise resources could lead to inventive new work alongside the poorest and neediest in the uk and abroad
758032 youre all doing such a remarkable job this is badly needed and we owe you a huge debt of gratitude
758033 one million fingers wagging at people it was two million arms open to them
758034 this is the gospel in action its good news for the people who are doing it because through the gifts of god they discover they have something genuinely valuable to offer and its good news for communities around because they feel theyre loved theyre worthwhile something sparks i think when that happens
758035 people do what they do for the love of the lord
758036 begin to reclaim parts of public space where people were afraid to go
758037 the problem has been that theres been a lot of stuff going on but its not been joined up
758038 people are trying lots of new stuff and we hope this will help them take it into the future and reach those who dont know christ
758039 we can learn from what has made these presences effective and there are real lessons here that churches need to hear lives are being changed and communities transformed by what christians are doing across the region
758040 in these 19 presences we see true examples of christian motivated community work that are demonstrably making a tangible difference to the lives of all kinds of people through this report we hope to highlight these projects as well as drawing attention to the thousands more who are putting their faith into practical action for the benefit of their communities
758041 we are very grateful to princes william and harry and the advisory board of the concert for diana for this support the mission now has the opportunity to make these six centres accessible to many more young people with leprosy related disabilities
758042 this project was chosen because when diana princess of wales was the leprosy missions patron she particularly wanted to restore dignity and hope to people affected by leprosy and our vocational training centres strive to continue this legacy today
758043 be dedicated to prayer for the protection of creation and the promotion of sustainable lifestyles that reverse our contribution to climate change
758044 every sunday in the creed christians confess their faith in god who created the world we inhabit
758045 teach and apply the whole of the bible to contemporary issues
758046 churches and religious organisations provide many intangible benefits that are hard to quantify we are therefore delighted that the committee has agreed that the need for benefits that are not tangible or measurable such as spiritual benefits should be recognised in determining whether or not a charitable purpose is for public benefit
758047 clearly the court could not find sufficient evidence to convict mr yimiti and he should therefore have been acquitted rather than having his case referred back to the prosecution
758048 we are most concerned about the crackdown on christians in xinjiang and the evidence of deliberately increased persecution against christians as a whole in china in the run up to the olympic games
758049 my heart has been greatly troubled by the suicides what the families and people of bridgend are going through says kate austin who lives 30 miles away
758050 this inspired me to pray for the place and the people i wanted desperately to help in some way
758051 it was during prayer that i heard the words not heard exactly but felt were deeply impressed within me do what you can if everyone does what they can it will be enough so i thought what can i do then of course the obvious have an art exhibition
758052 i think we so often dont do anything because we cant do what we consider helpful i was wanting to be able to do some kind of evangelistic crusade because my heart was crying out for the salvation and hope for the people of bridgend
758053 i want to encourage everyone to just do what they
758054 we are going to hold this as a kind of ministry with all the artwork relating to comfort peace and hope
758055 it created a lot of fear and some people are terrified
758056 how can you get serious if you are still chasing down the same type of guy you did in high school
758057 how many social media experts does it take to change a light bulb
758058 309 one to come up with the idea three to turn it into a strategy five to execute it and 300 to influence someone else to do it
758059 thank god that on the saturday before she passed away we held a prayer meeting where we were praying for the younger generation against gun crime and knife crime and she gave her life to christ in that meeting
758060 we had invited her to talk about what she does so mothers could carry that vision and start praying for our younger generation we called her out and prayed for her and she was led to christ on that saturday
758061 she was a great woman she didnt hide her past she told us who she was and where she was coming from why she was doing what she was doing getting involved in mothers against violence because of the death of her son danny
758062 everyone had grown to love her the children called her aunty she was a great person we know she is in heaven
758063 the council of zimbabwean christian leaders in the uk an organisation comprising ministers pastors and other christian leaders and organisations who originate from zimbabwe has been prayerfully reflecting on the plight of our country and its people in these uncertain and very unsettling days
758064 the council of zimbabwean christian leaders uk is particularly disturbed by the rise of xenophobia and its violent manifestations in johannesburg and other cities in the last few weeks
758065 we are compelled to express our sorrow at this exacerbation of their plight and outrage at the criminal assault on their humanity by citizens of a country which only recently sought refuge and solidarity from its neighbours
758066 need we remind them that their current leaders thabo mbeki jacob zuma and their umkhonto wesizwe comrades were themselves refugees in sadc countries where they were welcomed protected trained and resourced often at risk to the host countries
758067 today those who enjoy their freedom on the back of our peoples sacrifices are seen to have failed to support our people in their greatest hour of need
758068 we call for rapid and effective measures from the south african government to curb this violence furthermore we urge the mbeki government to formalise a humane policy to protect refugees with the help of the unhcr and other civil society organisations
758069 we also ask the government to state clearly and unequivocally its condemnation of such attacks and to ensure that the instigators and perpetrators of these acts are brought to justice
758070 it is vital that the egyptian authorities respect the international treaties to which egypt is party by allowing these refugees to have access to the unhcr
758071 the uks 70 000 adult jehovahs witnesses need protecting from their religion and from themselves on this issue
758072 i believe the law should be changed so hospitals automatically have the power to give jehovahs witnesses blood against their wishes
758073 theirs is not a truly free choice but one made under enormous pressure from church elders and the wider witness community
758074 because patients will have had these ideas so drummed into them often since childhood you have to ask whether or not they or their next of kin are actually of sound enough mind to make the decision to refuse a transfusion
758075 the jehovahs witnesses are completely out of touch with every other christian denomination on this matter and simply refuse to accept they might be wrong
758076 worse still they seem to treat as martyrs those who die refusing transfusions the whole policy itself and the thinking and teaching around it is quite simply sick the jehovahs witnesses have changed their policy on other matters in the past and i beg them to change this one to prevent further loss of life
758077 i know through talking to the members of my website that many former jehovahs witness have found themselves in a position where they had to choose whether to have a blood transfusion since leaving the religion
758078 they are all grateful they were no longer bound by these ridiculous rules on blood and astounded to think they could be dead now if they were still in the religion
758079 the inconvenient truth is that for all its new media spin display advertising is
758080 its time to come to terms with how people really use the web hint it might not be to figure out your experimental navigation and how we can harness the true power of digital
758081 i want to throw my hands up in the air and scream what gives we are too busy defining and do not spend enough time practicing and sharing lessons learned
758082 the results seem to support a contextualist pattern of knowledge attribution that the truth conditions for a sentence of the kind
758083 in the harm case what you get is a post hoc attempt to rationalize ones spontaneous blame attribution
758084 obama is an over hyped celebrity thats not presidential material despite the medias presumption of inevitability
758085 the thing is the more he struts around like he is already the president the more states hell lose i am comforted in that because i loathe everything he stands for the way he and his staff has manipulated african americans tarnished bill and hillary clintons good name and just hijacked the democratic party altogether ill be glad when hes sent on back to the senate
758086 if african americans start acting as though they are happy with obamas idea to make affirmative action more class based than race based i will be just about ready to throw up my hands
758087 but this ludacris guy is properly named and not surprisingly misspelled ludicrous is exactly what he is
758088 what so agreeing with him brueggemann grabbed his bible opened it and proceeded to read a few chapters in his biggest most prophetic preachers voice
758089 as it is written god scatters abroad he gives to the poor his righteousness endures forever
758090 i used to take a precious penny of my own and hide it for someone else to find it was a curious compulsion sadly ive never been seized by it since for some reason i always hid the penny along the same stretch of sidewalk up the street i would cradle it at the roots of a sycamore say or in a hole left by a chipped off piece of sidewalk then i would take a piece of chalk and starting at either end of the block draw huge arrows leading up to the penny from both directions after i learned to write i labeled the arrows surprise ahead or money this way i was greatly excited during all this arrow drawing at the thought of the first lucky passer by who would receive in this way regardless of merit a free gift from the universe
758091 as kate and i were talking a man on a bicycle stopped in front of us on the sidewalk
758092 japans currency carry on living dangerously speculators and low interest rates have helped cheapen the yen putting the world economy at risk
758093 what are you planning to do to make your users kick ass
758094 maybe black people dont get married before they have children because their communities are suffering
758095 perhaps its as complex as self esteem or maybe theyre desperate to be loved
758096 just going to point out that the so called nuclear family is a human invention just like any other cultural entity there is no inherent rightness or wrongness to it these too are determined culturally
758097 the issue at hand is this rampant tendency by so many black men to have children and then run off
758098 but i dont know how anybody could argue that it is better for a child to be yearning after their other parent all of their lives always carrying around that feeling of neglect abandonment and worthlessness there is nothing fine with that
758099 also trust that i am in no way shape or form of the mindset that a piece of man is better than no man at all
758100 he doesnt beat you he worships the ground you walk on he gives you and those boys all you need and whatever you want what are you complaining about
758101 is there any substantive or symbolic difference to a child who doesnt know his or her father whether money comes from him or from the state
758102 if this stereotype existed for non blacks would other non black men behave in the same manner to the same degree because they have societal
758103 wed be fooling ourselves if we tried to blame his decision solely or even greatly on slavery we all know that there are white men who do it as well so can we blame their failure as fathers on slavery as well no
758104 i think many black men find the institution of marriage to be just that institutional restrictive and confining and when the so called freedom america is supposed to afford its citizens seems to itself be an illusion rebellion from further bondage is to be expected
758105 then theres the fear of failure that tends to keep some black men from jumping into commitments of any kind
758106 deb we arent the only people who have had a trauma inflicted upon them
758107 if the black family was indeed at its strongest just a few decades after slavery ended what happened to cause the growing gap we see now i believe and this is only what i believe the manipulations and games that were played in bringing about desegregation are what caused a lot of the generational problems we see today not slavery
758108 half a black mans better than no black man at all
758109 philosopher who wants to reserve a space for substantive a priori knowledge through philosophical intuition
758110 as psychology has matured it has become quite evident as indeed it should have been evident all along that questions about our words and concepts are themselves also empirical questions and so subject to psychological and linguistic study
758111 as psychology has matured it has become quite evident as indeed it should have been evident all along that questions about our words and concepts are themselves also empirical questions and so subject to psychological and linguistic study
758112 philosophical intuitions their target their source and their epistemic status
758113 the a priori isnt all that its cracked up to be but it is something
758114 ethical intuitions what they are what they are not and how they justify
758115 any area of philosophy informed by the empirical or mathematical sciences e
758116 is this the first job ad to officially amp explicitly list experimental philosophy as a possible part of the aos
758117 i find it strange that x phi so often seems to count itself among the very inventors of scientific philosophy
758118 i find it strange that x phi so often seems to count itself among the very inventors of scientific philosophy huh i dont see how that claim about x phi is even vaguely true
758119 i dont see why one would interpret the job advertisement as an advertisement for x phi
758120 officially and explicitly lists x phi as a possible part of the aos
758121 the case of the divergent descriptions an experimental investigation of
758122 i would say that i will choose a if i were doing the question because i would think the person actually discover the theorem and the person who found the manuscript both contribute to the work in that sense the name godel could refer to the entity that contains both people which primarily include the person who discover it i do think meaning referent transfer is not uncommon in our language there are cases to refer to a group of poets by the name of the location they frequently met then the location name transfer to the leader of the group and then may refer to someone whose works has similar styles
758123 although our results are consistent with this hypothesis that the difference we found is due to ws tendency to make causation based judgments they fail to support it directly
758124 when john uses the name g del he is talking about the person he thinks discovered the incompleteness of arithmetic
758125 when john uses the name g del he is talking about the person who really discovered the incompleteness of arithmetic
758126 when john uses the name g del is he talking about
758127 when john uses the name g del does john think he is talking about
758128 when john uses the name g del is he actually talking about
758129 certainly nobody would have thought even prior to testing that there was no genuine diversity in intuitions about the g del example
758130 thus we conclude that it is wrong for philosophers to assume a priori the universality of their own semantic intuitions
758131 it has turned out that almost all philosophers share the intuitions elicited by kripkes fictional cases including most of his opponents
758132 whether it is plausible to think that the minority represents genuine systematic non errant diversity or whether it is simply noise
758133 one day john mentioned the name g del was he talking about
758134 we find it wildly implausible that the semantic intuitions of the narrow cross section of humanity who are western academic philosophers are a more reliable indicator of the correct theory of reference than the differing semantic intuitions of other cultural or linguistic groups indeed given the intense training and selection that undergraduate and graduate students in philosophy have to go through there is good reason to suspect that the alleged reflective intuitions may be reinforced intuitions in the absence of a principles argument about why philosophers intuitions are superior this project smacks of narcissism in the extreme
758135 gettier and kripke both argue for their judgments about their cases after all it is not as though they simply point out that their judgment is the intuitive one and leave it there
758136 what is the positive argument for this minority opinion undermining the use of the majority intuition as evidence in this case
758137 this group of people has one concept of reference and this other group has another
758138 the question everyone is raising about ambiguities in the probe is meant to draw attention to the fact that answers to the original probe may not reflect bona fide semantic intuitions
758139 but it seems like you are arguing for a metaphysical claim viz that if we have a statistically small group that reveals semantic diversity viz all their judgments about reference are systematically in line with an alternate theory when all disambiguating factors have been checked for that nonetheless they are wrong about reference
758140 i was just here last saturday and its open until noon
758141 banks do change their hours and if we dont deposit the check before monday well be in very bad shape do you know that the banks open tomorrow
758142 for a couple of reasons it helps that the cases involve third person attributions and denials of knowledge preferably to subjects not involved in the conversation in which the attributions and denials are made rather than first person claims to know and first person admissions that the speaker herself does not know thus contextualists make a mistake when as i have done we focus our attention on cases involving first person claims
758143 i know from within the original story so as try to avoid biasing the results do you think this was doing any work in the prompt back when it was an intuition pump or that it would bias testing results now
758144 we and here i imagine you mean we the readers test subjects thinking about the described scenario judge the person not to have knowledge when stakes are raised and error possibilities become salient
758145 w e appeal to how we as competent speakers intuitively evaluate the truth values of particular claims that are made or are imagined to have been made in particular situations
758146 w e appeal to how we as competent speakers intuitively evaluate the truth values of particular claims that are made or are imagined to have been made in particular situations
758147 do the subjects know the propositions in question that the bank will be open on saturday that john was at work
758148 but what will speakers do when they dont or at least dont clearly take interests of either type in the matter but are just answering questions about whether s knows on some survey hard for me to say
758149 second we have no direct control over some psychological causes namely over the automatic systems suggesting that it might be difficult to bring them in step with the other states and dispositions that are meant to constitute character
758150 we and others around us do have quite a bit of indirect control over the automatic systems
758151 what i wasnt sure about in the paper is what empirical evidence or other there is that we cannot make our selves even little bit more like her
758152 i also worry that much of the literature misses virtue ethics as it is currently presented by for instance hursthouse and others they present it as a theory of rightness
758153 when you take that debunking approach its not clear to me why the consequentialist intuition survives the scrutiny either
758154 the version of virtue ethics of the first three is replete with empirical claims and if they are not being disputed then it isnt clear that the future of the theory is shown to be bleak
758155 i would doubt that they hold everyone has some sort of constant character
758156 it really doesnt matter if the ordinary person cant control their implicit biases very well
758157 what role is precisely played by the empirical information about the systems delivering our moral intuitions in the process you describe in both cases it seems that the empirical information boils down to the claim that we have such and such intuitions for such ultimate reasons evolution and or culture and that it is produced by a system with such and such properties what role does information of this kind play in deciding whether or not to endorse the values corresponding to our intuitions if the answer is none then why bothering taking into account this information
758158 i worry that the values that will survive wre wont survive because they are the most rational viz the ones that would somehow optimize the process of finding a re but rather the ones that are the most cogent that have the larger sway on your psyche thus you would stick with the idea that you should care more for the well being of your daughter than for the well being of a stranger but not with your retributive intuitions because it is such a pregnant idea while the retributive intuitions are not so pregnant the process of weighing intuitions and principles and of bringing various bodies of information to bear on our reflection would in fact not decide which values you end up with
758159 are they claiming that students in honk kong agree with what i denounced it is very difficult for me to take this seriously laughs people used to feel superior to orientals sic now they dont maybe they should again laughs there must be some validity in testing peoples intuitions i think if we find really that some culture believe that i wouldnt know what to say i hope they were not too influenced by philosophers laughs this case seems to me to be intuitively such a clear one that it is hard for me to imagine that it should be experimentally overthrown all right i dont know what to do with this some things seem to be too preposterous there must be some sort of confusion in them
758160 i havent read that work and dont know what to make of it off the top of my head on the one hand there must be some validity in testing peoples intuitions on the other hand i find these results so surprising that my immediate reaction is to suspect the experiment
758161 people used to feel superior to orientals sic now they dont maybe they should again laughs
758162 ideas have been set down archived and disseminated to the entire world and not even in their own words
758163 rest on the idea that somehow accountability will stymie open thinking and spontaneity
758164 people used to feel superior to broads now they dont maybe they should again
758165 people used to feel that yids were money grubbers now they dont maybe they should again
758166 experimental philosophy itis the lazy intellectual habit of issuing broad and totally uninformed criticisms of the field of experimental philosophy without having bothered reading what has been written by experimental philosophers
758167 in fact when doris tells us that we should focus on situations and the complexities they raise he is unawares telling us just what virtue ethicists tell us when he says our duties are surprisingly complex and that we have a responsibility to think about the background and determinative features of situations rather than waiting till the situation confronts us his advice is not all that far from the advice to develop character by intelligent choice when he tells us we should try to avoid near occasions for sin morally dangerous circumstances at the same time we should seek near occasions for happier behaviors situations conducive to ethically desirable conduct
758168 all fairytale writers everywhere have always claimed that furry animals are better cite tortoise and the hare
758169 for the belief in fairy tales to be justified we would need empirical evidence that fairies exist in the way suggested by particular fairy tales but the data suggest that fairies dont exist or if they do exist they are not the kind of creatures we have envisioned to be so it is unclear that our belief in fairies is justified no matter how intuitive our traditional model of fairydom happens to be
758170 failure to read them in way that comports with how you read them
758171 presuming in what i wrote above that humes primary or only
758172 setting aside the question of whether he knew it was wrong did the chairman believe that harming the environment was wrong
758173 nobody ever taught him he never watched captain planet or anything
758174 harming the environment i dont get it why are you mentioning that so subjects judge that hes not like the prototypical person who doesnt know that its wrong to harm the environment
758175 given that p is true does the chairmans behavior indicate that he accepts p
758176 given that the truth of p is in dispute does the chairmans behavior indicate that he accepts p
758177 that belief is generally thought to be required for knowledge
758178 i know that doctors say that vaccines are safe but i dont believe they are safe or trust that they are safe
758179 sam and amy made a bet as to whether peter would dance one night that night sam went to look for peter to try to convince him to dance amy met up with sam later in the evening and sam conceded defeat peter would not dance with them that night
758180 i know that its unhealthy drink too much coffee but i dont really believe it
758181 i know that the evidence points to the unhealthiness of overconsuming coffee but i dont believe that the evidence is correct
758182 maybe its easier to imagine the chairman not believing that its wrong to harm the environment than to imagine him not knowing its wrong
758183 this seems empirically testable does our willingness to attribute acceptance of a proposition to another individual covary with our own credence in that same proposition
758184 was it wrong for the chairman to harm the environment
758185 three days a week still and a weekly best of the three shows

758201 among the other labour party figures paying tribute was tony benn who succeeded lord varley as energy secretary in 1975 and also took over from him as chesterfield mp in 1984 after boundary changes meant mr benn lost his bristol south east constituency
758202 this was one of the craziest decisions taken by labour in the 1970s the government spent 162 million to rescue chrysler uk and undertook to cover more than 70 million in losses over four years
758203 america was moulded along adam smiths lines while scotland imported the disastrous ideas of the french enlightenment which continue to dominate discourse today essentially the scots enlightenment stood for individual liberty and small government while the french one stood for power and big government
758204 that so many people in europe still believe the french principles government virtuous masses selfish shows how this continent never could quite shake off the hierarchies

758208 zinn is an original signatory of the 9 11 truth statement the statement highlights areas of incriminating evidence that were either inadequately explored or ignored by the kean commission ranging from insider trading and hijacker funding to foreign government forewarnings and inactive defenses around the pentagon the statement did not address nor support the theory of an inside job
758209 calls for immediate public attention to unanswered questions that suggest that people within the current administration may indeed have deliberately allowed 9 11 to happen perhaps as a pretext for war
758210 has done admirable and painstaking research in reviewing the mysteries surrounding the 9 11 attacks
758211 the evidence that 9 11 is an inside job is now overwhelming
758212 the 9 11 truth statement that he signed and which oddly you dont quote in its relevant aspect calls for immediate public attention to unanswered questions that suggest that people within the current administration may indeed have deliberately allowed 9 11 to happen perhaps as a pretext for war
758213 griffin maintains that the evidence that 9 11 is an inside job is now overwhelming
758214 suggest ing that people within the current administration may indeed have deliberately allowed 9 11 to happen perhaps as a pretext for war
758215 it would be hard to deny that the critics of the official account have discerned a pattern they have shown that many otherwise puzzling events before during and after 9 11 can be explained by the theory that high level officials in the us government conspired to allow the attacks to occur and then to cover up this fact given that pattern the price for rejecting this conspiracy theory is to accept a coincidence theory and critics of the official account can point out the number of coincidences that would need to be accepted is enormous
758216 i undertake further to explain that the queens speech is not in fact written by the queen and that the lord privy seal isnt in charge of locks on the lavatory
758217 howard zinn clearly subscribes to the lihop view of 9 11
758218 griffins book has already encouraged many thousands to debate the case for possible government complicity and at the very least to demand a full transparent and truly independent public inquiry democracy requires citizen vigilance informed debate and official accountability in that spirit david ray griffins book deserves to be widely read

758222 my appreciation of the numbers was quite hopeless given my age and my level of experience in the city i wouldnt have thought that i would be so out of touch with reality
758223 it sounds an awful thing to say but i know people i went to school with and ive no idea how they survive on the incomes they have
758224 the goose that lays the golden egg is the people who come to london to make wealth
758225 a reflection of the success of policies here making the city one of the pre eminent financial centres of the world
758226 i dont think we should sit here and say london should be guilty for being successful
758227 its a fact of modern life that there is disparity and is it fair or unfair is not a valid question its just the way it is and you have to get on with it people say its unfair when they dont do anything to change their circumstances
758228 quite a lot of people have done well who want to achieve and quite a lot of people havent done well because they dont want to achieve
758229 if you aspire to anything beyond that youre not going to live there any more and thats the choice you make
758230 some of these are vocational things like nurses its accepted they go into it knowing that thats part of the deal
758231 many people like teachers dont do things for the pay but you wont find a teacher that works as hard as we do
758232 i do enjoy the fact i can have nice holidays and dont think twice about buying particular items
758233 im sick of this because with 100 000 in manchester you are well off 100 000 is a not a wealthy person down here
758234 we now live in a separate economy we live on a separate level to the vast majority of people in the country we dont send our kids to the same schools we have more choice over schools we have more choice over health we have more choice over where we live we have more choice over where we go on holiday and what we do for our jobs and we live in a completely different world to the people we live next door to
758235 i work hard ive got two boys and i want to provide for them
758236 i really object because what it does is take the whole emphasis and focus away into something thats totally irrelevant and wont help a poor person at all
758237 all kinds of bullshit crap which doesnt help the people
758238 people dont starve in this country its ok compared with other countries here you dont go hungry because you can just go and get money for free
758239 say 3 000 a month in their hands and theyre somewhere miles up north theyre not going to earn that sort of money so wheres the incentive for them to go out to work
758240 single people get pregnant and get a flat and more money you just see everybody pushing prams then theyll get more income and a little flat that they can stay in for life
758241 doesnt get that much less money than another 18 year old working in a shop
758242 this thing of giving pregnant women 200 for dietary supplements like as if theyll really spend it on fruit
758243 we dont think just chucking money at the welfare state is the answer
758244 lack of ability is the main basis on which you get a job
758245 nobody in the public sector is actually trained to do the job that theyre required to do
758246 labour did a bit of that with extra taxes and windfall taxes and the famous raid on pensions the big debate is about how effectively all that money raising has been applied most people would say not all of it was well applied
758247 i have absolutely no idea how my taxes are spent and therefore i do not trust the system at all
758248 the classic is how much you pay in your taxation versus whats invested in the roads and the transport system it goes into a black hole
758249 little accountability and measurability in the way that tax is actually used
758250 say all we need to say about the waste and futility of public spending
758251 i want to talk about what charity can do for us
758252 what do you do now youve got all the toys
758253 youve already got all the houses yachts cars and jets you can use so what comes next is charity
758254 i get invited to places id never have seen otherwise
758255 if we can apply the entrepreneurial principles we have brought to business to charity we have a shot at having a really strong impact to be able to transform the lives of children
758256 the general feeling is a lot of cynicism about whether or not if you do give the cash its going to get where you want it to go
758257 people like us dont put our hands in our pockets so much
758258 ema has been a real success we will build on this and from next month every young person on ema will get financial support if they go on to university
758259 under labour there is really only one relationship which matters the relationship between the individual and the state

758266 i wont follow women any more i know its wrong
758267 i will be vigilant from now on i am never going to give anyone the chance to send me away again i have changed
758268 if i could go back in time and change that i would
758269 i prayed that something would happen to get me out
758270 they used to call me scum and spit in my tea i kept my head down and never spoke to anyone

758292 the last time i had a really good customer support experience was when i contacted the inland revenue to sort some stuff out tax wise for my housing co op
758293 as someone who uses technology a lot i use our work help desk often and in a company of 35 000 it means a help desk located halfway around the world
758294 i recently had a customer service experience with apple that i loved i had just bought a laptop through them with education discount but it had been stolen after hearing my story the guy was happy to help quickly took me through buying a new one and helped me transfer the applecare on my previous laptop he was very polite knowledgeable and casual and the whole phone call only took a few minutes i wasnt even on hold
758295 in order to try and improve the efficiency of the free gateway2000 support technicians they tried to get them to juggle several people at once i e when one person is rebooting theyd deal with another however instead of several people being put on and off hold all of us were connected into a conference every now and then the tech would go off to ask a superior a question while the rest of us including a child who kept singing to himself chatted about football eastenders and the weather not very efficient in the end quite slow for the users and probably very hard work for the techs but it was a free service so to me it was rather nice
758296 almost every company is familiar with the problem you get questions suggestions and support requests via a variety of channels and you need a solution that lets you efficiently consolidate track and respond to the customer feedback
758297 existing solutions are expensive painfully difficult to set up and hard to use with zendesk finally someone has created an elegant solution that meets the needs of small and medium sized businesses and is catapulting the help desk software industry into the 2 0 era
758298 with a growth rate in excess of 40 per month even a company as lean as zendesk needs outside capital to fund its operations
758299 were delighted that weve been able to win the support of a group of fantastic people working with christoph in the last couple of weeks was tremendously valuable and were thrilled to welcome him as an investor and member of our advisory board

758319 i had a version of it too at the small school glenville state ive always had a group of leaders that i let the players pick we had a lot of fun with it sometimes its as simple as picking pregame music or that kind of thing its not like theyre making major decisions theyre not going to say coach were going to run the wishbone this week theyre making suggestions not decisions
758320 the u m players always have said how much they enjoy heroes for kids and the strength and conditioning coach mike barwis said he wants to work with us on this next year
758321 but this workout is mandatory and all players must attend its coach rods call on that this is his first year at u m and hes doing everything he can to make sure his team is successful
758322 yeah the falcons situation was the most difficult time he endured as a coach
758323 it was a trying situation but everybody there worked as hard as they could to do the best job they could the whole situation the timing was bad no question with the falcons and with arkansas it was really the only way it could play out
758324 they had a quarterback at that time that i thought could be real special so that played a lot into it
758325 but you know it was a difficult season you always try to look back and really try to reflect on what i could have done better here and what we could have done better
758326 i love high school football i was asked earlier what it is i like about high school football and really the answer is everything
758327 during a contest i get in a zone where its just me and the food
758328 its very embarrassing i dont think im a sex symbol
758329 the sauce was sweeter than i expected and that slowed me
758330 i couldnt find my rhythm and kobayashi is a machine
758331 part of a bid to fashion the city state as a more hip and attractive place to live

758334 regarding the congressmans desire to hunt wildebeest and distribute the cured meat to refugees wildebeest are not present in chad
758335 the government of chad does not permit the hunting of large mammals

758337 several times requested more alcohol slapped male flight attendant with open hand put in plastic restraints exposed genitals in an apparent attempt to urinate head butted the assisting passenger captain requested emergency approach to dallas fort worth airport
758338 at no time during that flight did i mean to hurt anybody i harmed mostly myself obviously
758339 i havent been drinkin for seven months here and i just want to move on with my life and try to keep playing hockey
758340 the players have worked hard and it is good to have won these two matches they are friendly games and the team will continue to prepare for the new season giovani has settled well i know him from my time in spain all my players work hard for the team and he can give a lot to us
758341 as of close of business on friday a deal was not done and i have had no confirmation since from barcelona
758342 barcelona were thinking of a loan but the player is keen on a transfer and is waiting to fly to glasgow
758343 if we would like to have a striker with the killer instinct we must have two or three million euros
758344 we can look for luca toni but i dont think its possible to bring luca toni here its possible to work with players and build a scouting system to find a new luca toni maybe we can do something in the transfer window but the important thing is to work with the players we have
758345 he felt that people had questioned his commitment a little bit and the best answer is always to play well on the pitch
758346 you play well and show that you are ready to fight for the shirt and for your team you know how it is if you score goals people forget the frustration quickly
758347 no matter what you are no matter what you have done some of the fans will love you and some of the fans will hate you
758348 but i hope im in a good situation most of the fans love me and thats the most important thing
758349 hes ahead of what he was doing this time last year
758350 his first touch is better he moves the ball quicker and his penetration and final ball is better
758351 were all really shocked about the injury and the truth is right now its very difficult
758352 hes got a lot of pain they have to do tests but it doesnt look good
758353 i dont think it will be easy for him to leave
758354 the value of alonso in the market will be really high we are really pleased with him and we dont want him to go unless we get a very good price
758355 i gave it some thought and realised there is little point in pretending
758356 gareth would want to join liverpool and therefore there would be no deadline i have agreed with gareth now thats it no problem liverpool have all the time in the world to do it if they want to raise the money
758357 roy is not going to sign a new contract because he hasnt been offered one yet
758358 the transfer window closing will probably be the time to get ourselves into that situation and get our way forward to making an announcement later on in the year
758359 roy hasnt got an agent banging down the door or leaking things to the press
758360 i agree with niall 100 it is not important at the moment signing new players is the priority whether it happens next month christmas or january im very relaxed
758361 we dont ring each other up to discuss the weather we dont go for little pat on the back meals but what we do is discuss business together
758362 we have a different kind of partnership to the normal chairman manager thing where the chairman is saying do well or else we are in this together we were in it together from day one and i dare say it will remain in place for a good long time yet
758363 i was asked about this two years ago i said i would be thrilled because it would mean we would be in a better place and its a problem id love to have in a couple of years time and who knows i would not bet against this guy doing anything
758364 its fingers crossed for kenwyne but even last season i thought we needed another top striker
758365 i speak to the doctor every day and he gives me a report
758366 didiers getting better and has started to train on the field he has a fitness coach there working with him and next week i hope he will be ready to start training with us but he will not be available for the first game
758367 it is important that he is fully fit and in good shape if he plays too soon and is not really ready it will not be good for him and it will not be good for us he will only play when he is in good condition again if not we risk losing him for longer you never know when you have problems with your knee but he wont be playing in the first game against portsmouth he should be back for the third game of the season
758368 it was important for anelka but more important for me to help generate more confidence for this player
758369 hes one of the players that we will look to this season he played with more quality and freedom and it is fantastic for his confidence to score four times against a team like milan
758370 he believes in himself more and the other players believe in him more that is the best outcome he played more in the penalty area than before id asked him to do that because i want him in the middle not on the left or the right that is more important at the moment because we have only one striker and that is anelka
758371 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
758372 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
758373 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
758374 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
758375 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

758382 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
758383 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn

758386 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price

758392 i think so ive no reason to believe he wont andy johnson is a player with great quality wherever hes been hes done very very well hell give us balance up front that were looking for
758393 i am here and intend to see the job through we have great expectations and i hope that i am able to fulfil them
758394 i will not bring in players just for the sake of it we need to bring in three or four main players that are going to cost big money and my standards are that high that im not going to bring them down we need to bring in better players now to try and help the squad but we dont have bundles of cash

758436 republican presidential candidate john mccain is not leaving berlin to his democratic rival the republicans are airing anti obama radio ads in berlin on thursday not in berlin germany but in the citys namesakes in the states of pennsylvania wisconsin and new hampshire the audience reach may be tiny but the 60 second ads which accuse obama of voting against allocating money to military troops shows that the republicans can have a bit of fun at obamas expense

758541 we are a scarce commodity i have an obligation to take inquiries seriously
758542 assume day to day responsibilities for all aspects of vanguards operations
758543 we think its a very logical extension we view the etf as an important delivery mechanism for our strategies
758544 in respect to our etf effort were evaluating a variety of strategies both active and passive
758545 we view the etf business as an important additional vehicle for delivering strategies to our clients
758546 pimcos entering the field is great news for the etf marketplace
758547 were still near record lows in terms of interest rates
758548 with stock markets down a proven asset manager like pimco could be entering at a very opportune time
758549 what pimco is probably positioning itself to do is become a major player by getting into bond etfs early in the game
758550 bgis strong commitment to latin america is evident in the rapid growth in assets we are experiencing in the region and our ability to attract top personnel
758551 there has not been one month where we have seen overall price increases as measured by the two composites
758552 its now the second highest etf in terms of average daily trading volume
758553 thats just amazing considering this is a fund thats still down almost 30 year to date
758554 xlf broke below its 200 day moving average which is a key long term technical measure and hasnt come anywhere near it since
758555 it stuck its head above that price several times in the past week
758556 but it keeps meeting resistance and hasnt been able to break through
758557 nobody really knows whats going on inside these financial companies so the fundamental question marks hanging over this sector are huge and our charting work shows the markets skepticism
758558 it doesnt sound very exciting until you compare that to the s amp p 500s 13 drop this year and nearly 12 fall in the past 12 months
758559 singapore is right in the middle of the action in asias economic development
758560 its a safer way to play chinas growth and we really like the countrys highly educated employment force and it has a much more stable banking system than most of the rest of asia
758561 that was an uptrend we drew starting at march 17s bottom this month on the 15 th it set a higher low
758562 so we drew a line between the two low points and if it breaches that line then well probably look at getting out
758563 its an alternative asset strategy thats comprised of currencies from the top developed foreign markets in the world
758564 so its a great diversifier with no correlation to u s stock markets and we consider it a separate asset class to foreign bonds as well
758565 its a system weve created to optimize trading currency etfs in our portfolios
758566 but both have been showing weakness lately and our signals are close to a sell on each
758567 it has technically held support at about 22 10 per share and remained in a tight trading range since march if uup breaks above about 23 25 well probably go long on it

758592 there is enormously strong commitment among the bishops present at lambeth to stay together and that is a very positive outcome

758604 these new figures should bring new focus to our efforts to address aids and hiv here at home
758605 combating hiv aids also demands closing the gaps in opportunity that exist in our society so that we can strengthen our public health we must also overcome the stigma that surrounds hiv aids a stigma that is too often tied to homophobia
758606 we need to encourage folks to get tested and accelerate hiv aids research toward an effective cure because we have a moral obligation to join together to meet this challenge and to do so with the urgency this epidemic demands
758607 work closely with non profit government and private sector stakeholders to continue the fight against hiv aids

758609 sixteen years after brett favre came to the packers he is returning for a seventeenth season he has had a great career with our organization and although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage brett will be in camp tomorrow although there has been uncertainty regarding bretts return ted thompson and coach mccarthy had previously discussed this and have had a plan in place coach mccarthy will talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly no matter what i look forward to another successful season for the packers and our fans this has been a tough situation but the packers will make the most of it

758696 we need to know exactly how mr ivins was involved if he was involved how this relates to the case and information that so far has been withheld from the american people ought to be provided and i think it should be soon
758697 whereas the united states of america was founded on the ideals of individual rights including the individual right to practice ones religion of choice or no religion and that there would be no compulsion of religion nor state sanctioned religion nor a religious test for participation in the body politic includes a complete political and social structure encompassed by its religious law sharia that supercedes any civil law and that islam mandates that no secular or democratic institutions are to be superior to islamic law
758698 i think a better possibility to enact an amendment to the constitution declaring america a nation with a judeo christian heritage without establishing any particular jewish sect orthodox conservative or or christian denomination variations of protestantism catholicism eastern orthodox etc as a state religion this would simultaneously deal with secular humanism war on christianity and radical islam

758700 christianity is not a religion of peace because jesus didnt come to bring peace
758701 do not think that i came to bring peace on the earth i did not come to bring peace but a sword for i came to set a man against his father and a daughter against her mother and a daughter in law against her mother in law and a mans enemies will be the members of his household he who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me and he who does not take his cross and follow after me is not worthy of me he who has found his life will lose it and he who has lost his life for my sake will find it

758703 abraham of the old testament was the founding patriarch of a new monotheistic faith which included jews and later christians and muslims one of his two sons is historically tied to the founding of judaism the other to the founding of islam the children of abraham project which is an effort by individuals and interfaith organizations in the detroit metro area to educate jews christians and muslims as to their common ancestry and encourages them to work together for tolerance peace and civic betterment the process involves watching a play in which teenage actors some who helped write the play act out scenes from the biblical story this is interspersed with contemporary accounts of religious and ethnic prejudice based on personal recollections the play has allowed audiences to speak freely about their fears and prejudices and to walk in anothers shoes the hidden story of jesus what really struck me about this documentary was by taking jesus as an example it was possible to see how much most of the religions have in common i believe looking for what we have in common instead of looking at our differences will in fact help us to become more closely connected as a society and more accepting of our differences this is not a documentary for christians to be afraid of as i do not believe it would diminish your faith in anyway an interfaith view islamophobia racism and obama plus fox smear campaign preaches that it and it alone is the true religion

758754 he had targeted the church because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country
758755 the presence of many people of so many different faith traditions and ideas being here to support our church means so much to us
758756 i made everyone focus on what we ourselves as the church knew and what we could say for ourselves
758757 and had them refuse to speculate or talk about topics that were outside the churchs expertise
758758 were not closing our doors were not putting metal detectors at the doors were not having armed police at the doors

758777 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems within qantas but we think its prudent and wise to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues within qantas
758778 with these sort of events we tend to get a lot of late claims
758779 it ended up being 60 million because the storm did a lot of damage when it moved through auckland coromandel and the far north
758780 at the moment with this one our estimates remain the same but you can see even now that there are a lot of properties that are coming under threat
758781 he will need regular medical supervision until his doctors clear him to return to work
758782 his doctors remain hopeful that he will fully recover but due to extensive surgery and the nature of the injuries there remains a substantial risk of both infection and other complications
758783 his two fingers are pretty smashed but were figuring out a way to shoot around it kind of write it into the story
758784 received information that suggests that the other driver may have been traveling upwards of 50 miles per hour and that said driver may not have been looking forward at the time of the accident
758785 we are very appreciative again of the patience that everyone has shown us and of the many concerned citizens who have stepped forward to provide information regarding this collision
758786 that stuff i told you six months ago the things we agreed all nonsense i dont believe it anymore
758787 one way to impose a function on an object is just to start using the object to perform that function
758788 it is a grave contradiction to advocate for a reduction of global warming gas emissions while simultaneously maintaining or even expanding military expenditure
758789 as long as we choose to take the comfortable moral high ground and issue pronouncements from the promontory we will be welcome to stay there on the sidelines
758790 rather than merely request that world leaders reshape the way they use their own
758791 the most important thing that came out of the summit was the fact that it took place
758792 it was an extraordinary gathering of religious leaders who came together to claim a religious voice in the political realm
758793 i have no doubt we will be offering commentary at that next summit on this being too little too late
758794 there are issues that our congregations can productively engage with in cooperation with our interfaith partners if we wait for national leaders to fix all that needs fixing we will fail we need not be followers but the ones who lead them
758795 a tragedy such as this makes us acutely conscious of the beauty and fragility of our lives and those of our loved ones i am especially saddened by this intrusion of violence into a worship service involving children and youth i know that many people both in knoxville and around the country are struggling with shock and grief right now i pray that those so affected will find strength and comfort
758796 i heard a loud boom i thought it was microphone feedback i turned around and the person behind me was bleeding then i looked to my right and saw a man with the shotgun leveled off
758797 now that this has happened having experienced that with them today we definitely want to be part of this congregation
758798 within seconds people were tackling him the hardest part was there were so many children there and they all had to see this it was just devastating
758799 this is a very courageous congregation not just the three or four people who tackled the gunman but also the religious education director who got the children out of the way and the people afterward who consoled each other
758800 wont forget all the others who havent found us yet and will make sure its all right when they come
758801 everything the uua has tried in the last generation has not been effective
758802 dynamic thoughtful and diverse religious leaders for the new america we are living into
758803 my highest priority and im not being facetious is the nurseries in our congregations
758804 reengages or engages the young people and their parents at a time that they would leave
758805 were a church that was founded at least in america along with the freedom of our government we believe that no pope should tell us what we should believe and no rabbi or minister or priest should stand between us and our relationship with god its unmediated its a free church now the definitions of what makes it free have expanded dramatically since those early years but those founders of the democracy of our country and also of our free faith were able to put in place a structure that could contain much more than they could even imagine
758806 helps people connect with our country and it aligns us with that
758807 i believe that religion is much less about what we think than about what we love and we are a group of people who loves life who believes in compassion for one another who believes in human dignity who believes in peace and compassion and if you believe in that we have the same religion
758808 too often people come to our congregations looking for the bread of life and are given a stone
758809 the fact that we are a religious home we are a people of faith a people who take very seriously our call to ministry in the world as professional ministers and as lay ministers
758810 what are we doing for whom to what end at what cost if we could get clear about those statements there would be no stopping us
758811 i have worked in organizations outside of churches all my life
758812 where there were very clear goals very clear roles and accountability and im very comfortable in that
758813 i really dont believe that there are significant differences among any of us on our goals the issue is about being effective and moving forward and being clear and having real accountability in moving toward those ends
758814 i am absolutely committed to these kinds of things that intervene at very important places to help us where we might be coming with some fear to the table or theres a special transition we need to pay attention to
758815 my entire life has been lived crossing the boundary of one culture to another and i think that inevitably gives me a sensitivity to whats involved
758816 the way a high tech company pays attention to research and development
758817 i think we do perhaps too much highly cognitive abstract training and not enough allowing people to actually experience a different perspective and a different culture and we need to nurture that in our movement
758818 we need to find some vehicle for channeling the enthusiasm of these groups and giving them legitimacy and participation
758819 committed and very much are a part of our family
758820 needs to be implemented in ways that take into account the people that are involved with alternative possibilities for the ways that they can do programming
758821 is where you either left the church of your birth or you reclaimed the free church that you were raised in
758822 its not easy to find an equitable way to use the resources of the uua to help programming in congregations and at the same time provide lateral experiences so that uu youth can come together
758823 ours is a faith that ought to be among the most international and it isnt
758824 we need to get our own act together before we pretend to lead
758825 we have a global economy and well soon have a global faith
758826 this free faith is unstoppable that we think we can manage it is our own misunderstanding
758827 the experience that comes deep in the heart and not up here in the mind where i usually live is always a vital word for me there are many things that ive learned in that silence it feeds me when i need it
758828 ultimately the measure of my spirituality and the measure of yours is our lives
758829 when we truly appreciate the interconnectedness of life we cannot sit by and watch what is happening to the capacity of our earth to sustain it
758830 innovative high performing team you have built or were part of
758831 our job as leaders is to cast a vision and to reflect the collective vision of the people and then particularly in our congregations which are overflowing with bright energetic people equip them empower them and get out of their way
758832 have very high expectations very clear goals measure whether they are getting done select really terrific people and then let them go for it
758833 the presidency of the uua is a very stressful position do you have the courage to be lonely
758834 i have confidence that not that im saying it will be easy but it will be joyous
758835 i havent had a moment to myself for some time loneliness looks better all the time right now
758836 there is something about working with a team of dedicated people and seeing the results of your labor which is just energizing its one of the most wonderful experiences anybody can have as i imagine doing that at the national level it is thrilling i cant wait
758837 we are transformed in our worship together we claim the strength and possibility in our tradition we give and ask others to give joyfully we are tenacious in our pursuit of justice we pay attention we trust our leaders and we trust ourselves to make good decisions we give our children wise teachings
758838 our congregations need to be brilliant moral beacons in their communities
758839 a prescription for disaster this is a time that calls for vision passion boldness but a boldness that is practical and tested i believe i offer such leadership we really can be the religion for our time
758840 i knew there were many places out there with a very small number of uus but not enough for a stand alone congregation
758841 we researched what it would take and decided to reach out to them
758842 it wouldnt work without that this enriches our lives and allows us to enrich our community with our presence
758843 but there just arent enough of us here for a separate congregation
758844 its important that these groups have assertive leadership hartz says
758845 if something needs to be done and the group just sits and looks at each other then its not going to work people need to jump up and do whatever needs to be done
758846 the advantages to being part of first unitarian are pretty obvious
758847 we want more branches because there are more small towns i think the first branch was the hardest and they are easier after that
758848 id be fine staying a satellite for a long time but we have a lot of people who want us to have our own identity
758849 that makes us more than just a new start to people here
758850 i believe this model is one that unitarian universalists who are serious about spreading our faith need to explore
758851 respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which we are a part
758852 it has increased our levels of giving and when visitors come our building helps demonstrate our religious principles
758853 they want to do the right thing even if it costs a little more
758854 and theres a growing awareness that many conventional building materials including fabrics and paints can be toxic to some people
758855 we wanted to encourage people to find alternative ways of coming to church and we are also committed to this area of downtown madison where we have a strong social justice presence if we want to honor our environmental principles then we dont need to build more surface parking
758856 it came out of the blue but it just felt to the congregation like the right thing to do
758857 i know that you are looking for jesus who was crucified he is not here
758858 in offering fruits roses and lilies the believer was celebrating the goodness of god who had given them to him he read the names of god in the fruits of the earth and god read the homage of love in the heart of the offerer
758859 we become christ bearers as his body and blood are spread around our limbs
758860 you are christs body and members it is your own mystery that lies here upon the table of the lord and it is your own mystery you receive it is what you are yourselves
758861 your own blood brothers your companions are flogged and exiled as slaves for sale in their own land christian blood redeemed by the blood of christ has been shed and christian flesh akin to the flesh of christ has been subjected to unspeakable degradation and servitude
758862 whoever goes on the journey to free the church of god in jerusalem can substitute the journey for all penance for sin
758863 m an absolutely cannot give himself more fully to god than when he commits himself to death for gods honor
758864 accomplished through the life giving power of gods love which embraced all people
758865 heretofore i was particularly manifested to the world in the singularity but now henceforward expect me to appear in plurality
758866 no matter how sophisticated you make these automated systems youre not going to make them perfect and all you can really strive for is to tune them as you go along
758867 its pretty clear there was a lapse in terms of the quality control of yahoos keyword list
758868 leverages a combination of algorithmic and editorial processes to identify current relevant and popular terms
758869 we are really only in the infancy of this kind of automated analysis
758870 im sure its going to be expanding greatly not just in volume but in sophistication
758871 the quality of the content and the information is paramount
758872 you want to make sure youre striking the right balance between giving your readers everything the web has to offer with making sure theyre getting the right information and the relevant information
758873 weve just got to come out and continue playing good baseball
758874 we definitely had some opportunities we really didnt take advantage of them
758875 but i feel real confident that well turn this around and swing the bats the way were capable of
758876 we dont want to be scoreboard watching later on we dont want to wait til september to make our move we have to push ourselves and get it going again
758877 we should be ok some of the guys i wont say they were pressing but in situations we werent getting hits
758878 weve got to find a way to get better at that
758879 their bullpen came in and it seemed like this whole series they shut us down
758880 when we need a hit its just not coming right now we have to get that better and thats the bottom line
758881 we had our chances and we didnt do anything with them
758882 to prevent players swapping members in and out of their fellowship to complete various instance quests all of the items needed by the quests below will be despawned 5 minutes after the boss of the instance is defeated
758883 but some of them will stay in the hospital for observation
758884 ive never seen anything like it spectators fell off their seats
758885 it was a raining and suddenly the lightning hit the stand
758886 we all tried to get down from the hill many screamed and cried the situation was dramatic ive never experienced anything similar
758887 i probably will be in the olympics i just have so much confidence in her i see how hard she trains and how well she takes care of her body i just feel like she is ready for this situation
758888 i tried the 400 once and couldnt do it after that
758889 i will never do it again thats why i respect her so much for running the 4 i know what it feels like you feel like your heart is going to bust your hamstrings are going to bust out everything its the hardest full speed all the way around
758890 its a nice speed like 26 seconds so thats running
758891 the 100 i got her the 200 um i dont know the 400 she will kill me
758892 it was good to see her get first place and qualify for the olympics
758893 you can fall slip pull up anything sprinter tyson gay pulled up in the 200 and wont have a chance to run anything can happen you can take nothing for granted
758894 she is way more nervous she was more nervous in college and the super bowl she was a wreck

759141 its not clear how excessive saturated fat harms the brain but there are many theories some blame its effect on glucose a sugar that provides energy to the body and brain while a short term supply of glucose can help the brain excess fat may create a situation where brain cells receive a long term harmful exposure to glucose research on people with diabetes a disease marked by problems with glucose fits with this idea for example one report found that diabetics perform poorly on memory tests other research indicates that excess fat affects certain brain memory molecules one of the studies on rats found that the high fat diet cut levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor and other related molecules in the brain which are thought to aid the formation of memories
759142 although associations of this nature cannot be assumed to be causal these findings nevertheless allow the hypothesis that a diet high in saturated fat low in polyunsaturated fat and high in sugar is detrimental to the outcome of schizophrenia

759144 the society for neuroscience site also said donuts and fries were high in saturated fat which is clearly nonsense as they would be far higher in rancid pufa or tfas than anything else nobody except people like us cooks in tallow or dripping any more thanks to satfat hysteria
759145 i feed my cat raw palaeo i use a chicken and beef mix i remove the skin and all visible chicken fat and add in suet or dripping plus gelatine and bone broth instead so he is also getting low pufa diet i sometimes think id be better off eating his food

759396 o safety car fez com que a prova terminasse com um resultado bizarro e eu acho que esta regra uma piada fiquei feliz por nelson ter chegado em segundo devido ao come o de temporada que ele teve mas a f 1 mais profissional e melhor do que as regras de bandeira amarela que temos no momento

759409 e a algu m espalha ali na frente do vettel e n o normal porque foi o kubica

759414 a verdade que nenhum adulto se importa com a vida sexual dos outros n o nem tema para dicuss o h 50 anos se algu m fosse gay seria um drama e voc poderia at ir preso na inglaterra por isso mas hoje todos podem fazer o que desejarem em sua vida privada pois n o prejudicam ningu m

759421 ele teve um pouco de sorte com o safety car mas depois pilotou maravilhosamente claro que a mclaren era mais r pida e o hamilton mereceu a vit ria s que n s tamb m merecemos o p dio porque o nelson foi o segundo mais r pido na segunda metade da corrida
759422 o safety car ficou na pista por mais tempo do que imaginamos que ficaria porque o toyota estava em local perigoso e n s n o pensamos no tempo gasto para que fosse removido apenas pensamos no tempo gasto para se retirar os detritos por isso quando a corrida foi reiniciada o lewis n o teve tempo de abrir vantagem suficiente embora nosso ritmo fosse tr s quartos de segundo mais r pido que qualquer outro carro
759423 n o foi algo pensado por nossos estrategistas nem uma decis o vinda do pit wall mas sim uma decis o tomada em woking
759424 bem nada est definido h uma possibilidade de caminho mas nada definitivo por enquanto n s estamos tentando uma solu o com os dois pilotos mas nada foi definido ainda
759425 n o ficaria surpreso se tiv ssemos os mesmos pilotos no ano que vem porque eles est o fazendo um bom trabalho al m disso ainda n o fomos capazes de dar a eles os carros que merecem
759426 eu n o acho que seja bom para a equipe contratar algu m por apenas um ano independentemente de quem seja um per odo muito pequeno para integrar um piloto e conseguir bons resultados os dois pilotos que temos este anos est o fazendo um timo trabalho
759427 este julgamento revelou a mentira sobre o nazismo que o

759764 we were really upset after losing to home we played the better football and yet they got the two goals from just a handful of chances the loss has fired us up were more determined to win the title again
759765 i think that any team facing us in the coming weeks not just gombak will have a lot to be worried about
759766 i was also thinking that after friday nights match because i always set very high expectations of myself

759898 she decided to parent the baby rather than choose adoption
759899 one issue that does come to mind is that of the various options that fall under the guise of an open adoption
759900 a second point is that birth parents ought to be aware that they have several sources to use to facilitate an adoption
759901 finally in planning a curriculum about adoption it is important to note that contrary to the common understanding we found that teens were not opposed to adoption as a response to an unplanned pregnancy in fact most viewed it quite positively the reasons they did not use it as an option for resolving the situation were primarily twofold first they had no idea how to go about bringing about an adoption abortion and especially parenting were much more evident second they needed social support for the decision especially from parents and partner without this support they were much more willing to choose one of the other options

759919 wenn sie nur geld erhalten sind viele unternehmer berfordert wie wir festgestellt haben erhaltens sie nur schulung k nnen sie das gelernte nicht umsetzen weil ihnen dazu das geld fehlt
759920 die verh ltnisse m ssen stimmen die unternehmer m ssen beweisen dass sie professionell arbeiten und sie m ssen die kredite verzinsen und zur ckzahlen
759921 die grundlagen der gesch ftsf hrung marketing finanzmanagement das habe ich alles gar nicht gekannt
759922 ich war nur eine einfache n herin und dachte auch so
759923 die gr sste unterst tzung habe ich von personen wie hans wilhelm und weiteren bpn mitarbeitern bekommen sie haben mich ernst genommen haben mich beraten sie haben gesehen was ich kann und haben an mich geglaubt diese moralische unterst tzung hat mir kraft und mut gegeben selbstst ndig zu arbeiten
759924 ein gutes design bekommt man nicht einfach so die mitarbeiterinnen m ssen lernen es zu erarbeiten es ist ein harter weg sie m ssen dabei viele schwierigkeiten berwinden und eigene l sungen f r probleme finden
759925 den grossen traum erreicht man nur durch viele kleine schritte
759926 durch die bpn seminare habe ich eine klare sicht bekommen ber meine berufung
759927 es macht mir grosse freude unternehmern zu helfen professionelle betriebe aufzubauen arbeitspl tze zu schaffen und damit vielen kirgisischen familien eine lebensexistenz zu erm glichen
759928 the plan is to have all sorts of speakers speak about all sorts of stuff
759929 im going to be soo late for the party oh dear oh dear
759930 come on out and have some fun and tea and eat with me well have laughs and stuff our tummies eat all you want just dont tell your mommy
759931 i am truly amazed and purely ejoyed myself at your
759932 when you are poor uneducated and illegal your avenues are cut
759933 give the guy his money and let him go home
759934 start giving jobs to your people at the very least dont give them maps on the easiest place to cross
759935 would you require local law enforcement agencies to enforce federal immigration law and alienate local communities
759936 its also important to state that sanctuary city policies do not violate federal law they just clarify that local law enforcement should not be enforcing federal law
759937 make poor decisions you will be detained with no respect for your human rights
759938 the federal government was storming the factory with one hand while writing checks to it with the other
759939 a pentagon official visited the factory as often as four times a week and even had an office on site
759940 hed come and tell us we shouldnt complain about the work because it was better than being in iraq
759941 when the agents entered people started screaming and i thought there was a fire
759942 the secretary announced over the p a system that nobody was to move but i saw people running toward the back exit and it was like a stampede some fell and people got hurt
759943 children were placed in significant jeopardy as a result of the decision not to allow us access
759944 all we were asking was that the law be enforced in a way that ensured the safety of the children
759945 i believe that ice conducts these raids in a way that people are purposefully unable to exercise their rights
759946 they transfer people across the country before they can speak to anybody and then when they are given a bond hearing in texas asking to be released before trial they must prove they are not a flight risk and that they have ties to the community of course they have no ties to the community in texas
759947 ice says its a law enforcement agency not a social service agency
759948 i strongly reject the argument that we did not make extraordinary efforts on the humanitarian side
759949 we take great care in conducting enforcement operations with dignity and respect for those detained
759950 ultimately u s citizens bear some responsibility for all of these injustices migrants however are paying for it
759951 us citizens are the victims while companies and illegal workers are the ones profiting
759952 stop the raids on people and raid the illegal companies
759953 we have some information but its not coherent enough to provide any detail and wed rather not do that given next of kin issues
759954 he is seeing the search aircraft but were not seeing him
759955 the survivor is located near the top of the mountain and he has been able to see search aircraft below him but we havent been able to see him
759956 ive been doing this a long time and this is the most unusual circumstance in terms of having some information but not enough information to do what you need to do
759957 the couple of days afterwards what if goes through your head that i could have been us open champion
759958 at the same time you cant let yourself dwell on those kind of emotions and youve got to take the positives out of it i played great under pressure and nearly won a major
759959 im not worried about not winning im just delighted about the consistency i know that winning is very fickle i went three years without winning and then won twice within four weeks
759960 i could be easily us open champion but i didnt do the job when i needed to all you can do is give yourself chances and ive given myself a lot of chances
759961 i think consistency is what all professionals want the more consistency the higher you get up in the world rankings if you show the consistency the wins will just come the more often you get yourself into the fray and feel the pressure of the last group and needing to make putts at certain times the more comfortable you get and then the wins come from there
759962 i was 34 when i started doing it and i probably started 10 years too late
759963 social round of polo picnics race meetings and beach houses
759964 though of course he was useless with only one arm all he could do was raise a glass
759965 shes an outrageous flirt she loves all her boys as she calls them but its a love hate thing if they are unfaithful giving an idea to another writer for example then they are whores
759966 her colourful language was peppered with expletives more common among people a quarter her age muck bloody muck vulgar and disgusting were frequent descriptions dished out in almost equal measure as her ultimate accolade bloody delicious
759967 not so much a neglected poet as neglectful of the kind of ways to get published at all it suited me to write without an audience so i could do what i wanted without an editor or a publisher
759968 prostitutes have clients wives have husbands poets you will understand have editors
759969 a kind of weird cross between anne sexton and philip larkin
759970 the listener waiting in doorways for the sound of struggle and torment my own analyst lying dead in his bed
759971 a young woman growing my flowers in season feeding my cats knowing little but feeling everything writing at all times and in all places working out rhythms rhymes
759972 the sad occupants of terminal stations dressed like morris men with newspapers tied round their legs arguing endlessly with themselves
759973 most poets who are men and get to the bar first at poetry readings dont like us fey or even feminist
759974 inhaling the potent anaesthetic of words the lexicography of loss
759975 theres plenty of areas where he can improve but hes on course
759976 when a team just brushes through you its very difficult to take there might have to be major surgery before the next game because id rather play with youngsters who are enthusiastic and give their all
759977 choosing beijing as the host city for the olympics you will bring the first ever games in olympic history to a nation containing one fifth of the worlds population and 1 3 billion chinese people will dedicate their efforts to the olympic movement if you award the olympics to beijing i can assure you that seven years later you will be proud of the decision you make today
759978 it is quite unprecedented how beijing has transformed itself in the last six or seven years
759979 i hope china holds the olympics successfully and our countrys economic situation can be more prosperous people in beijing will become more friendly and warm hearted because we will welcome a lot of people from all over the world
759980 to see how temporary measures will impact on air quality
759981 if you are dissatisfied you can complain directly to liu qi president of bocog
759982 for the chinese sporting events represent something deep and fundamental a validation of their nations long labours towards international acceptance a sign that china has become a full member of the community of nations
759983 and woman i will try to express my inner feelings and thankfulness for showing me the meaning of success
759984 erm i go from a handstand position with my feet on the bar then i circle round take my feet off let go with the hands go backwards over the bar straddle the bar
759985 anyway im always catching blind because of the half turn
759986 and i know that they totally changed gymnastics before them it was more like dance but gymnastics these days is a totally different sport compared with what it was like then if you look at the skills even of eight and nine year olds theyre doing the same things that olga was doing towards the end of her career when she first did a tuck back a single back somersault everyone was like oh my god now you get really young kids doing tuck backs with a full turn
759987 it was cut after athens where by her standards tweddle performed poorly finishing 19th overall but after 2005 when i got to third in the world they put it back up i use my lottery money to help with training and my car and when i go abroad all my trips are paid for but basically if i did gymnastics for money i would have quit ages ago luckily my parents gave me good advice when i started earning prize money they told me to save it which ive been doing since i was 15 thats what i used as the deposit to buy my house and ive got isas and bonds and stuff
759988 id rather not say but its not in the same league as athletics
759989 i did always think that i would go in 2006 but im still at the top and at the moment i dont see much point in giving up something i love the 2012 olympics would be too much of a stretch though hopefully ill be involved with the media or mentoring young athletes i do that already through a scheme sponsored by visa there are eight hopefuls and eight apprentices and im one of the hopefuls mentoring an apprentice gaby whos a badminton player but im mentored myself by tanni grey thompson who has advised me to retire only when im absolutely sure not just because ive had a hard season i love tanni i talk to her a lot and i have a right laugh with her i went with her to see the spice girls in january and one of my best friends came too she couldnt believe how brilliant tanni was shes so down to earth
759990 i was totally shocked but it was great for gymnastics and it showed that the public recognised how much work id put in id already done a routine on the bars that night which is the most nerve racking thing ive ever done even more than my world routine at first my coach said no she didnt want me injuring myself but eventually she agreed to it and i was so nervous if id got it wrong i would have ended up on alan shearers lap
759991 both my parents were dead keen on hockey both of them played every weekend and i grew up with a hockey stick in my hand my brother took to it but i didnt it was too cold so i tried ballet but i didnt like the frilly tutus i tried horse riding but that didnt last long i was quite into swimming for a bit but by then id started gymnastics and i had to choose between them it was always going to be gymnastics from the time i was little i was always upside down on sofas hanging from banisters climbing trees with my brother i was never into dolls
759992 theyve got kids coming out of the woodwork names weve not even heard of but have performed really well in the past few grand prixs and theres also the american nastia liukin whos been my main rival for the past couple of years
759993 he said to me is this true but hes been really good he understands if he doesnt see me for two weeks or whatever he works nine to five and lives in north wales and i train in the evenings so its not ideal
759994 this world record doesnt mean a thing unless i get the olympic gold medal
759995 tomorrow if someone comes and runs faster than me im no longer the fastest man in the world if youre the olympic champion then they have to wait four more years to get you again i think the olympics is the biggest thing and ill be doubling in the 100 and 200 now definitely
759996 i was partying too much but now i am taking the sport seriously
759997 it was time for me to change my ways and everything in my personality to accomplish my full potential
759998 the world junior championships in 2002 opened my eyes to what i could do i wanted to be like some of the guys who are my heroes in the sport herb mckenley don quarrie who is the finest bend runner ive ever seen and michael johnson
759999 i wouldnt say i am really lazy but i dont like the 400m and i have never really wanted to make the necessary efforts for this distance in training
