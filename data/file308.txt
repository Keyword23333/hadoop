3080006 the former university of michigan star looked poised in the pocket and made several good decisions including scrambling up the middle for three yards to set up a 49 yard dan carpenter field goal rather than trying to force the ball into coverage while under pressure
3080007 it was clearly the best performance by any of the three dolphins quarterbacks who played saturday and thats not good for either john beck or josh mccown because now that the team has signed chad pennington one of them will be traded or released before the season
3080008 brian griese has had a great camp and did a heck of a job on the two minute drill that was a great way to end the half
3080009 he just has a feel for the game every time weve asked him to do something hes done it well so thats a good sign
3080010 if he is not even with c j wallace right now it is only because he may have the lead over him for the final spot in the secondary

3080037 with seven weeks left in the regular season whos your pick to win the american league mvp award
3080038 they have settled very well and their quality is obvious they are working hard and committing themselves to learning which for a young player is critical the rest of the team has welcomed them with open arms which also helps them adapt quicker
3080039 this years schedule is a good one we will be tested many different ways before the patriot league starts all we are focused on right now though is rider
3080040 progress we obviously also need to integrate 10 new players and that takes time but the main focus is for the players to do their best every day with what ever we put in front of them that requires not only physical excellence but also mental strength to take it all on board and put it into the game
3080041 justice obviously was a huge record for us we took the ride the lightning and master of puppets concept as far as we could take it
3080042 there was no place else to go with the progressive nutty sideways side of metallica and im so proud of the fact that in some way that album is kind of the epitome of that progressive side of us up through the 80s
3080043 theres a certain kind of specific sound to that record peculiar sound whichever adverb you want to choose thats given it a kind of life of its own and a little bit of a vibe all its own there have been a lot of great musicians we admire whove come up and talked about what a great inspiration that album has been to them and to their sound its obviously awesome to be part of that that album also sent us on this whole other merry way because when we came back from touring on that record in 1989 we were like we have nothing more to offer on this side of metallica and that set us off on some other adventures when i think of the nine records weve put out its impossible for me to think of the music without thinking of the experience and when i think of the experience i have warm and fuzzy feelings but i also have questions obviously justice is well revered especially among a lot of our peers
3080044 that album songwriting wise it was just us really showing off and trying to show what we could do
3080045 weve jammed six riffs into one song lets make it eight lets go crazy with it i listen to some of that stuff and its pretty progressive sonically it has its shortcomings but that is the one where we were able to step forward from
3080046 we mixed that record while we were on the road
3080047 thats not an excuse for the way that it sounds but our ears were beat anywhere i go whenever i ask someone what their favorite record is someones bound to say justice its pretty great that across the line someone can jump into your history and feel comfortable
3080048 id have to go song by song i was just listening to 1997s reload and there are a couple of songs on there that i think are absolutely brilliant but as an album itself and as a time justice just isnt a good memory for me but those songs are good i have to try and erase the memory of that experience somehow and let the songs take me
3080049 its always the next one i think the forthcoming is great but theres always a better something the holy grail of guitar sounds i havent got there yet but i will on the next one ill write the ultimate song on the next one the hunger is always there to do it better
3080050 i dont have an excuse i just need a little help
3080051 due to various reasons it wasnt working out with us and him
3080052 we felt his heart was no longer in it after expressing his want to leave on numerous occasions this year which showed when he played live
3080053 im looking for a hat that might make me run faster
3080054 the increase in product revenue was primarily due to sales of 2 2 million generated by enerland which we acquired in august 2007 this increase was partiallly offset by a decrease in demand from our most signficant customer and its affiliates during the three months ended march 31 2008 compared to the three months ended march 31 2007
3080055 our strategic plan assumes that we will epxand our revenue base through the acquisition of new customers in new and emergin markets however black and decker and its affiliates have represented 70 7 of our total revenue since inception through march 31 2008 and represented 55 1 of our total revenue in the quarter ended march 31 2008 if in the near term we were to lose black amp dcker as a customer or if we were to lose revenue due to its inability or refusal to continue to purchase our batteries or pay our invoices our business results of operations and financial condition could be harmed

3080069 a moment of silence is not a government endorsement of religion just because someone might use the time for prayer
3080070 no student is compelled to pray under the texas law the court should dismiss this lawsuit because the parents who filed it cannot demonstrate that their children have suffered any harm therefore they do not have legal standing to challenge the statute
3080071 reflect pray meditate or engage in any other silent activity that is not likely to interfere with or distract another student
3080072 there is no evidence to support the parents claim that observing a moment of silence causes any injury to their children
3080073 we trust that the 5th circuit will uphold the decision of the district court
3080074 when it happened i kind of had a bad feeling when i didnt hear from her

3080141 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3080142 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3080143 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3080144 its the ability to cast white as black and black as white which is surprising the ability to cast the aggressor as the victim and blame the victims for the consequences
3080145 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection

3080156 we played them in the last olympics and then in the world championships
3080157 the difference between 2004 and 2006 its like they have these tendencies that traditional chinese teams have had which is a lot of movement i mean a lot of movement penetration cutting pass pass pass pass very quick
3080158 and then tom maher got here and he put in a western kind of style now you see their original style mixed with his its hard to guard i know you look at the score and we played well but theyre going to be a tough opponent for anybody they face in this tournament
3080159 but i think now most everybody plays the same way give or take so the old thing about you can play like asia well who does that anymore youve got to play international style basketball and you have to be a defensive team or youre going to get killed
3080160 we were a bit frightened shed get 50 on us

3080214 the manager the chairman whatever it is they have to do they are going to do it for the best of the club
3080215 i was talking with him this morning and he will go with us to belgium
3080216 carlos came to us a year ago straight after the copa america
3080217 his fitness now is light years ahead of where it was then and we are expecting big things from him
3080218 the great thing about tevez is that he has a heart to play the game he is not intimidated at all he fights for every ball and is a real handful
3080219 the decision to make him man of the match was fully justified
3080220 i would be delighted for rio if he was made england captain
3080221 obviously i hope its rio as he is a team mate of mine and it would be great for the club
3080222 he is certainly the best defender in the club at the moment and it would be well deserved
3080223 curbs seems a bit more relaxed and he most definitely has the backing of the players
3080224 i can understand why he is under criticism hes taken a job at a football club who had a huge financial injection
3080225 people expected big things at this place and so far those massive things have not been delivered
3080226 ive always enjoyed challenges and as ive been out for so long im really excited

3080229 last season it was difficult looking on from the sidelines in one sense but there was nothing i could do about it

3080253 it is insulting because it suggests that their devotees effusions are just a visceral reaction the political equivalent of puppy love and it is imprecise because obama is and bobby kennedy was more movie star than rock star which is an analogy with a difference rock stars with some glaring exceptions typically whip up the crowd the thrill tends to be short lived movie stars by contrast tend to create a long standing emotional identification with their audience its a difference that may have a bearing on the outcome of this election as voters weigh the advantages of being a movie star against its disadvantages movie stardom can be confused with mere celebrity which has connotations of insubstantiality

3080373 most importantly business users can obtain enterprise level support from sun but not just sun for either staroffice or openoffice
3080374 the business of supporting openoffice org and for that matter staroffice is in fact growing astonishingly fast around the world the mac element is pivotal too even in areas where you see few macs such as in india though that may be changing too
3080375 but the mac presence grants cios and others tasked with choosing the right software for their organizations the assurance and confidence that they can adopt the opendocument format our native format and the only published iso standard file format for office documents and have an office array that includes macs linux solaris windows and so on
3080376 in short openoffice org and the mac version in particular suture the wounds inflicted by 20 years of divergence the connecting thread is the file format and the understanding that what counts is creating communicating preserving files in a format that resists the fragility of monopoly and the reliance on any one company in fact there is a plugin that gives users the ability to read write odf and with open office 3 0 and staroffice 9 0 well have native support of ooxml which ms office 2007 uses
3080377 staroffice is pitched more to those who want the indemnification against suit by microsoft governments oems and to those who want the ease of having at one go the application plus the most useful extensions
3080378 its also more for those who wish to buy again at the outset the support services training that sun sells
3080379 but support services training are also available for openoffice org and many prefer it over staroffice because it may be in a language that staroffice is so far missing or because an officiating body has insisted that the license of the application be open staroffice is built with open source software same code as openoffice org but the license of the actual application is closed to make modifications one can easily download the corresponding openoffice org code and work with the community

3080609 mongolia like kazakhstan is a country that is rich in mineral assets
3080610 we have agreed to exchange experience in the development of deposits by kazakhstani investors we have specialists who can do this
3080611 the west has withdrawn from the fight for mongolian assets and russia and china are becoming the main rivals
3080612 this means that after the election results are summed up a serious struggle could begin in the mprp between the pro russian and pro chinese groups
3080613 we are not satisfied with the current state of trade between kazakhstan and mongolia
3080614 the development of trade relations is hampered by the absence of a proper road we want to build a road from kazakhstan to mongolia through russian territory
3080615 plays an important role in the development of good neighborly relations and cooperation between countries of the region

3080618 its military transport aircraft to relocate georgias military contingent from iraq virtually into the conflict zone
3080619 im amazed by their skills at seeing black as white of portraying aggressors as victims and of blamimg the real victims for the consequences of the conflict
3080620 as we all know saddam hussein was hanged for burning down several shiite villages but now suddenly the situation is different the georgian leaders who in a matter of hours wiped out ten ossetian villages who ran over children and the elderly with tanks who burned civilians alive those people have to be protected
3080621 i thought that since u s is supporting georgia there would be some control over the situation in south ossetia and that there would be a peaceful solution to the conflict but what is happening there now its not just war but war crimes george bush and georgian president mikhail saakashvili should answer to the crimes that are being committed the killing of innocent people running over by tanks of children and women throwing grenades into cellars where people are hiding
3080622 the war is when military fight against military but the georgian army is killing innocent civilians this is genocide
3080623 es ist schade dass einige unserer partner anstatt zu helfen sich in den weg stellen und behindern

3080630 next up came the real highlight of my time at standon calling the ireallylovemusic mini tribe ventured back to the shogun tent and managed to catch most of the 30 minute set by revere from first appearances the band look to be your usual indie band set up with additional keyboards cello violin and trumpet however nothing would have prepared me for the sheer epic ness of the bands music they were on fire and their drama filled indie rock cast an eye over post rock orchestrations noise beauty and jaw dropping vocals if i were to play the lazy assed comparison game then id throw out suggestions along the line of epic doves like build ups with dashes of arcade fire instrumentation excess into the melee there was definitely something in the air as even the band thanked the soundman for the sonic perfection that they were experiencing for this last gig of the summer for them they are studio bound to finalise their forthcoming album fact fans something tells me that i will be reporting more on revere

3080636 the majority race is not as good at identifying minorities as it is its own race this is hard wired in some way that we dont completely understand
3080637 is it possible for one race to have difficulty identifying someone from another
3080638 sorry about all the kafuffle and shoulder cuffing of earlier let me introduce myself then perhaps you would care to do the same but please dont interrupt me until i direct you to speak im very important it comes naturally my name is darkwood dunce i am heir to the throne of spanx

3080640 excuse me for interrupting but you have a most unusual name your dad does too how come
3080641 i might take you up on your kind offer of course i didnt know i could walk between worlds they must have inadvertently opened a door inside my brain when i visited the institute of hugely important studies for a series of psychic tests im certainly feeling cleverer and cleverer with every passing second perhaps in time i might achieve the level of genius or perhaps its nothing more than the lovely clean air you have here i dont know but thats by the by what do we do next
3080642 youre local answer me this to which location do you suggest we transport ourselves next food shelter and a safe refuge from an inevitable pursuit by the lawmen of weasels pit would be a prerequisite

3080652 a strange hamster came to my fathers castle a few seasons past he too spoke of the modern world 37 we thought that he was a fantasist but it turned up that he wasnt a fantasist at all he was a complete bastard the cur stole a vast fortune in dull grey metal the evil little shit and my poor father was forced to sell his lavatory bowl painting kit in order to replenish the royal coffers so traumatic was it that i was told were i to meet the scoundrel upon my travels that i should administer a mailed fist to the fellows crown jewels
3080653 so lets just carry on to the abbey and forget everything i said shall we

3080656 politics is supposed to be the second oldest profession i have come to realize that it bears a very close resemblance to the first
3080657 the eu grand strategy is to develop georgia as an alternative route for caspian oil and gas by bypassing russia
3080658 but if georgia is no longer a safe passageway then all of these schemes for diminished dependency on russia go up in smoke
3080659 the first significant break in russias previous monopoly control over all oil and natural gas from the caspian sea states
3080660 azerbaijan and georgia for example rely on this pipeline for the political independence they often act out
3080661 an alternative pathway for the flow of caspian oil and gas to the west
3080662 georgia has been one of the leading recipients of u s military aid ever since
3080663 this of course infuriated the russians and they determined to try to curb georgias ties to the west in any way they possibly could
3080664 nagorno karabakh is as difficult to solve as abkhazia and south ossetia
3080665 puede ser que un dia entre la oscuridad de la eternidad aparezca durmiedo en la inmensidad de la luz y recuerde que siempre estuve ahi aflorando recuerdos y deseos que estan lejos de mi puedo asi pensar que por el momento mi deseo se ha vuelto mas una onbsesion he decidido que este viento ya no me puede transmutar he decidido que desde ahora te sepultare esos sollozos temblantes de agonia fortuita clamen dentro de mi pecho un poco de compasion pero ya no es el momento de elegirme es el momento de hacerte fuerte por que la pelea comienza desde ahora me declaro tu rival por que luchare contra este pecho ardiente de placer monotono de sue os rotos y perdidos entre tanta destruccion reclamaras lo que mas anhelas atrevete y pereceras en mi armagura
3080666 for decades hes been washingtons biggest celebrity john mccain and as washington embraced him john mccain hugged right back the lobbyists running his low road campaign the money billions in tax breaks for oil and drug companies but almost nothing for families like yours lurching to the right then the left the old washington dance whatever it takes john mccain a washington celebrity playing the same old washington games
3080667 it is clearly a very upsetting event that has led to indiscriminate market selling and russias perception in the west will suffer as a result
3080668 however it has no significant impact on russias economic fundamentals and corporate earnings and at the end of the day we firmly believe this is what ultimately drives the markets rather then emotions and swings in investor sentiment
3080669 this conflict will have a negligible effect on the russian economy

3080680 some of them criminals are taken to the jails but because they belong to the commanders they pay money and are set free
3080681 families are trusting the security forces and reporting these incidents
3080682 its because of the impunity given to these warlords for such a long period of time
3080683 these days all these young girls are going to school and coming out of their houses these criminals chase after them
3080684 this is like a revolt against the warlords by my family
3080685 it doesnt look like this was premeditated with a massive staging of equipment

3080691 it will become impractical to constrain atmospheric carbon dioxide the greenhouse gas produced in burning fossil fuels to a level that prevents the climate system from passing tipping points that lead to disastrous climate changes that spiral dynamically out of humanitys control
3080692 when they got close she hid her head behind the lifesaver like a little kid who hides behind a curtain and doesnt realize his toes are sticking out

3080702 this event involves friendly competition designed to give teams a chance to demonstrate their skills
3080703 but in actual mine accidents of course the teams are all about working together and support each other to help keep coal miners safe
3080704 as of 3 30 p m 1130 gmt georgian forces renewed intense shelling of towns in south ossetia using various forms of weaponry including heavy weapons
3080705 we have made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on us russian relations
3080706 we need russias co operation over iran and derailing that over a localised conflict in georgia makes no sense we just have to hope that diplomacy prevails the next necessary step is for russia to respond positively to georgias ceasefire declaration
3080707 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are trying to get in the way
3080708 its military transport aircraft to relocate georgias military contingent from iraq virtually into the conflict zone
3080709 im amazed by their skills at seeing black as white of portraying aggressors as victims and of blamimg the real victims for the consequences of the conflict
3080710 as we all know saddam hussein was hanged for burning down several shiite villages but now suddenly the situation is different the georgian leaders who in a matter of hours wiped out ten ossetian villages who ran over children and the elderly with tanks who burned civilians alive those people have to be protected

3080713 prima di tutti vennero a prendere gli zingari e fui contento perch rubacchiavano
3080714 i was tired of going to the office every day
3080715 i had friends that were getting sick or had even died so i started asking myself what in the world i was still working for
3080716 i am now revisiting what we should be invested in
3080717 im trying to decide if there is a better way a more intelligent way to guarantee me a better return over the long haul
3080718 the risk of running out of money within 30 years of retirement climbs dramatically if you choose to retire at the beginning of a bear market
3080719 someone who retired in 2000 is in danger of running out of money
3080720 our recommendation is that when you have a bear market like this one and we dont see the light at the end of the tunnel yet it is not a good time to retire
3080721 your portfolio is already down so now you will start to withdraw from the portfolio you will just make a bad situation worse
3080722 the worst thing is not having the nest egg you want when you do retire that is incredibly disappointing get over this idea that you just cant work another day maybe you can change the kind of work you do so its refreshing and different but brings in some money
3080723 i once said yes to jesus so now i am safe
3080724 my job is to bring business to new jersey not drive it away

3080729 is about to make one of the most important decisions of this campaign choosing a running mate
3080730 you have helped build this movement from the bottom up and barack wants you to be the first to know his choice
3080731 once youve signed up please forward this e mail to your friends family and co workers to let them know about this special opportunity no other campaign has done this before you can be part of this important moment
3080732 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
3080733 obama started negative campaigning on john mccain long before we started punching back and i think a lot of our effort is really to get back into this game try and galvanize some of the public attention back onto this race make sure everybody understands theres two people in this race not just one and i think weve been successful in doing that
3080734 the lobbyists running his low road campaign the money billions in tax breaks for oil and drug companies but almost nothing for families like yours lurching to the right then the left the old washington dance whatever it takes john mccain a washington celebrity playing the same old washington games
3080735 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
3080736 the treadmill was running but he was unresponsive lying on the floor
3080737 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
3080738 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
3080739 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
3080740 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
3080741 but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs of others begins
3080742 to me that was a strong indication of her love she is a fabulous person
3080743 very very very happy to report her condition is upgraded
3080744 theyre not at the point where they want to discuss the specific nature of the injuries
3080745 we are extremely grateful for the outpouring of assistance and generosity that we have received and hope to convey our appreciation to everyone who has supported us and kept us in their thoughts and prayers
3080746 beijing is a safe city but unfortunately we are not immune to violent acts
3080747 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot
3080748 thank you again for your process and for your time i hope that everyone i send your way buys your program and that they receive the same benefits and knowledge that i have received from it
3080749 i found your site on technorati and read a few of your other posts keep up the good work i just added
3080750 i head up fixed income ir at ambac please understand that ambac did not push for the new fas157
3080751 we are in the process of invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country
3080752 the goal of this operation is regime change in georgia
3080753 we have to go to the shelter because there are russian planes flying over the presidential palace here sorry
3080754 it is clear that russias current leadership is bent on restoring a neocolonial form of control over the entire space once governed by moscow
3080755 when this failed the kremlin turned its attention to south ossetia ordering its proxies there to escalate attacks on georgian positions
3080756 my government answered with a unilateral cease fire the separatists began attacking civilians and russian tanks pierced the georgian border we had no choice but to protect our civilians and restore our constitutional order
3080757 yet in reality it is a war about the independence and the future of georgia
3080758 and above all it is a war over the kind of europe our children will live in let us be frank this conflict is about the future of freedom in europe
3080759 no country of the former soviet union has made more progress toward consolidating democracy eradicating corruption and building an independent foreign policy than georgia
3080760 worked hard to peacefully bring abkhazia and south ossetia back into the georgian fold on terms that would fully protect the rights and interests of the residents of these territories
3080761 while we appealed to residents of abkhazia and south ossetia with our vision of a common future moscow increasingly took control of the separatist regimes
3080762 the kremlin even appointed russian security officers to arm and administer the self styled separatist governments
3080763 if georgia falls this will also mean the fall of the west in the entire former soviet union and beyond
3080764 leaders in neighboring states whether in ukraine in other caucasian states or in central asia will have to consider whether the price of freedom and independence is indeed too high
3080765 people have gotten on my lane line and sucked off of me so i figured this is the one opportunity in my whole career to do that
3080766 jason finished that race better than we could even ask for i was fired up going into that last 50 i was like aw this is going to be a close race jasons last 10 or 15 meters were incredible
3080767 i lost my voice and i was definitely pretty emotional out there
3080768 i knew i was going to have to swim out of my mind
3080769 i dont know how i was able to take it back that fast because ive never been able to come anywhere near that for the last 50
3080770 alain is wounded when you are the last swimmer in a relay and that you have the opportunity to bring a title of this importance to your country you dont get out of this unhurt
3080771 but i dont think that alain lost the race its lezak who won it
3080772 i knew i had to accelerate but it got harder
3080773 i saw katie and thought lets just try to catch her
3080774 but i got a bronze yesterday and a silver this morning if i keep climbing at this pace ill be happy
3080775 ive just had a really off year on a really important year
3080776 i just feel like thats not the last youre going to see of me im going to bring it back and i wont be done until i at least have a legitimate shot at those world records again
3080777 i saw a convoy of foreign solders getting attacked i saw some blood on the streets and than the police blocked the road
3080778 the attack also injured a small number of isaf soldiers
3080779 the new format will provide our readers with even more editorial pages and improved paper
3080780 the result will be an elegant and distinctive design which has always been the hallmark of rolling stone
3080781 what the magazine has done for over 40 years is evolve with the times thats the magic behind the brand and i think this is a strong time to make the move to a new format
3080782 i felt he really was so committed to that character the guy that was playing that guy that as an audience you bought his sincerity very few people i think could pull that off
3080783 robert was black the whole time my mom came on the set and she thought it was don cheadle
3080784 to me the most important thing was alpa chino has to give him a beat down and tell him that what hes doing is crazy the whole time
3080785 otherwise its just demeaning to brandons character and if its demeaning to an actual black man in the movie i would have run for the hills
3080786 if were all gonna play ball lets all play ball
3080787 i believe in fairness if we can punch you punch back and funny is funny
3080788 this sort of self important self involved thing seemed funny to me
3080789 i just couldnt figure a way to make that into a movie
3080790 we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
3080791 an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations
3080792 you go out there and put your best foot forward in terms of what you think youre doing of what you think is the right idea
3080793 if people are accepting it the way that you intended and you feel that from a general audience then stand behind it
3080794 i just hope at this point with whatever little weve done to brand ourselves as entertainers that you give us a little slack
3080795 you either die hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villan
3080796 you either die hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villan
3080797 tend to pick up stories from the national enquirer with tongs
3080798 they have been very right about some things but theres been some misses too so its a little scary to follow on those stories
3080799 its also a little scary for big outfits to step up on a story like this sex may sell but it can really hurt your relationship with readers
3080800 we at abc were working on this story and if we had had any proof and any verifiable facts we certainly would have gone with the story
3080801 it was just a matter of were not going to put something on the air until we know that its true
3080802 we were able to prove i think with satisfaction to our bosses that there was money being paid to rielle hunter
3080803 this began to be for us an aspect of something we could report some hard facts
3080804 until he called and its on the record that he called us on friday and said i want to talk you know thats what broke the story he was willing to admit that he had been lying
3080805 but it became a ludicrous situation almost became a conspiracy of silence by the media and edwards meanwhile would not give interviews was not acting like a man who didnt have something to hide
3080806 i think at that point we should have earlier than we did told readers and viewers what we knew and we didnt know
3080807 i was taught when i was a young reporter that its news when we say it is i think thats still true its news when we say it is its just who we is has changed
3080808 members of the public people with modems people with cell phones are now producers editors they can push and push and push on a story until it ends up being acknowledged by everyone
3080809 initially when he was hospitalized we expected him to come back home but as the weeks went on i kind of knew
3080810 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
3080811 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
3080812 i kind of figured he was going to get a lot of backlash
3080813 telling that joke at that time probably wasnt the best idea but thats him
3080814 im sad that my daughter will never know or be able to feel how much he loved her
3080815 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
3080816 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family
3080817 married people are still healthier than unmarried people but the gap between the married and never married is closing especially for men
3080818 politicians and scholars continue to debate the value of marriage for americans with some going so far as to establish social programs and policies to encourage marriage among those social groups less inclined to marry particularly the poor and minorities
3080819 encouraging marriage in order to promote health may be misguided
3080820 we have a speculative bubble in prices thats giving way to what now i think are more moderate levels
3080821 i think we look forward to a resumption of an improvement in equity prices based on still good earnings coming out of many companies
3080822 over 1 300 cancer patients have been left to die in the past 20 months because they were not deemed exceptional enough to receive cancer treatment on the nhs they will have been forced either to go without the life giving treatments or to pay privately for the top up drugs and risk having all their other care withdrawn
3080823 the nhs should be available to all who need it yet 1 300 cancer patients were denied the treatment that could have made all the difference to them thousands of cancer patients have been forced to plead for their lives
3080824 the opening will mark the halfway mark of an ambitious project under the australia indonesia partnership to build or expand 2000 high schools across 20 provinces by the end of 2009
3080825 australia is funding this program to help indonesia fulfil its vision that all young indonesians will have nine years of basic education
3080826 our construction alone will create some 330 000 new places in junior high schools including in some of indonesias poorest and remote areas

3080841 bij de meeste brandweerkorpsen is er zelfs geen minimumbezetting om de basisopdrachten uit te voeren
3080842 brandweerkorpsen zijn nog samengesteld zoals dat dertig jaar geleden het geval was het houdt absoluut geen rekening met de risicos van vandaag we zijn dikwijls serieus onderbemand bij brandweerinterventies wat gevaarlijk is voor de bevolking en voor de brandweermannen zelf
3080843 en in het hele land kan je hetzelfde vaststellen ondanks de beloften na de ramp in gellingen in 2004 kwam er geen verbetering in de nieuwe wet van 2007 over de civiele veiligheid is een herwaardering voorzien van het statuut van de brandweerman ook zou er gezorgd worden voor een minimumbezetting bij alle korpsen de wet op zich is goed maar de middelen ontbreken het oneindig gepalaver over institutionele hervormingen verbetert de veiligheid van de burger niet

3080877 our findings seem to support the hypothesis that older females with knowledge of distant resources become crucial to the survival of herds during periods of extreme climatic events
3080878 its enticing to think that these old females and their memories of previous periods of trauma and survival would have meant all the difference the data seem to support the speculation that the matriarchs with the necessary experience of such events were able to lead their groups to drought refugia
3080879 climate change is expected to lead to a higher occurrence of severe drought in africa and our study suggests that such extreme climatic events may act as a selection force on animal populations

3080892 some amount of auctioning is i think ok we will implement whatever the government does we dont have an official opinion but im guided by the so2 program and how it accomplished its objectives so cheaply that thats the way to do it

3080898 brno has always been a track where our bike has been very much at home over the past two seasons thanks also to the optimum performance of bridgestone tyres we have taken victory in 2006 with loris and last year with casey the track has been resurfaced and that creates something of an unknown for all of us we just hope that grip is as good as it was last year and that the weather is stable over the three days so that we can prepare properly for the race we head to brno with confidence but also aware that the level of the championship is ever higher and it will be another difficult weekend
3080899 brno is a nice track but its demanding too a bit like mugello and phillip island two of my favourites in 250 i was on the podium and last year we won so with the bike performing as it has been lately we should be able to fight for a good result again weve still got quite a few points to make up in the championship which wont be easy but the whole team are working so hard and well give it our best shot after that whatever will be will be after the race at laguna seca i went back to australia and spent a bit of time with my wife and family away from the track i got some rest in but i also trained hard and now i cant wait to get back on the bike
3080900 i like brno and ive won there in 125 and in 250 whilst ive not managed a podium in motogp i have always gone well in testing this year theyve re laid the track so that will be a new factor for everybody well see i hope we can continue to work as well as we did in germany and america but this time finish it off with a result in the race the track is definitely suited to our bike so expectations are high the holiday went well i spent a few days in montecarlo and then went back to romagna because i hadnt seen my family for a long time i spent my birthday with them and it was a nice way to kick back and relax
3080901 there will of course be a universal language which will be either esperanto or pidgin english the literature of the past will for the most part not be translated into this language since its outlook and emotional background will be considered unsettling serious students of history will be able to obtain a permit from the government to study such works as hamlet and othello but the general public will be forbidden access to them on the ground that they glorify private murder boys will not be allowed to read books about pirates or red indians love themes will be discouraged on the ground that love being anarchic is silly if not wicked all this will make life very pleasant for the virtuous
3080902 the nineteenth century suffered from a curious division between its political ideas and its economic practice in politics it carried out the liberal ideas of locke and rousseau which were adapted to a society of small peasant proprietors its watchwords were liberty and equality but meantime it was inventing the technique which is leading the twentieth century to destroy liberty and to replace equality by new forms of oligarchy the prevalence of liberal thought has been in some ways a misfortune since it has prevented men of large vision from thinking out in an impersonal manner the problems raised by industrialism socialism and communism it is true are essentially industrial creeds but their outlook is so much dominated by the class war that they have little leisure to give to anything but the means of achieving political victory traditional morality gives very little help in the modern world a rich man may plunge millions into destitution by some act which not even the severest catholic confessor would consider sinful while he will need absolution for a trivial sexual aberration which at the worst has wasted an hour that might have been more usefully employed there is need of a new doctrine on the subject of my duty to my neighbour it is not only traditional religious teaching that fails to give adequate guidance on this subject but also the teaching of nineteenth century liberalism take for example such a book as mill on liberty mill maintains that while the state has a right to interfere with those of my actions that have serious consequences to others it should leave me free where the effects of my actions are mainly confined to myself such a principle however in the modern world leaves hardly any scope for individual freedom as society becomes more organic the effects of men upon each other become more and more numerous and important so that there remains hardly anything in regard to which mills defence of liberty is applicable take for example freedom of speech and of the press it is clear that a society that permits these is thereby precluded from various achievements which are possible to a society that forbids them in time of war this is obvious to everybody because in war time the national purpose is simple and the causation involved is obvious hitherto it has not been customary for a nation in peace time to have any national purpose except the preservation of its territory and its constitution a government which like that of soviet russia has a purpose in peace time as ardent and definite as that of other nations in war time is compelled to curtail freedom of speech and of the press as much while it is at peace as other nations do when they are at war the diminution of individual liberty which has been taking place during the last twenty years is likely to continue since it has two continuing causes on the one hand modern technique makes society more organic on the other hand modern sociology makes men more and more aware of the causal laws in virtue of which one mans acts are useful or harmful to another man if we are to justify any particular form of individual liberty in the scientific society of the future we shall have to do it on the ground that that form of liberty is for the good of society as a whole but not in most cases on the ground that the acts concerned affect nobody but the agent
3080903 the man who dreams of a scientifically organized world and wishes to translate his dream into practice finds himself faced with many obstacles there is the opposition of inertia and habit people wish to continue behaving as they always have behaved and living as they always have lived there is the opposition of vested interest an economic system inherited from feudal times gives advantages to men who have done nothing to deserve them and these men being rich and powerful are able to place formidable obstacles in the way of fundamental change in addition to these forces there are also hostile idealisms christian ethics is in certain fundamental respects opposed to the scientific ethic which is gradually growing up christianity emphasizes the importance of the individual soul and is not prepared to sanction the sacrifice of an innocent man for the sake of some ulterior good to the majority christianity in a word is unpolitical as is natural since it grew up among men devoid of political power the new ethic which is gradually growing in connexion with scientific technique will have its eye upon society rather than upon the individual it will have little use for the superstition of guilt and punishment but will be prepared to make individuals suffer for the public good without inventing reasons purporting to show that they deserve to suffer in this sense it will be ruthless and according to traditional ideas immoral but the change will have come about naturally through the habit of viewing society as a whole rather than as a collection of individuals we view a human body as a whole and if for example it is necessary to amputate a limb we do not consider it necessary to prove first that the limb is wicked we consider the good of the whole body a quite sufficient argument similarly the man who thinks of society as a whole will sacrifice a member of society for the good of the whole without much consideration for that individuals welfare this has always been the practice in war because war is a collective enterprise soldiers are exposed to the risk of death for the public good although no one suggests that they deserve death but men have not hitherto attached the same importance to social purposes other than war and have therefore shrunk from inflicting sacrifices which were felt to be unjust i think it probable that the scientific idealists of the future will be free from this scruple not only in time of war but in time of peace also in overcoming the difficulties of the opposition that they will encounter they will find themselves organized into an oligarchy of opinion such as is formed by the communist party in the u s s r
3080904 in suggesting any curtailment of liberty there are always two quite distinct questions to be considered the first is whether such a curtailment would be in the public interest if it were wisely carried out and the second is whether it will be in the public interest when it is carried out with a certain measure of ignorance and perversity these two questions are in theory quite distinct but from the point of view of the government the second question does not exist since every government believes itself entirely free from both ignorance and perversity every government consequently in so far as it is not restrained by traditional prejudices will advocate more interference with liberty than is wise when therefore as in this chapter we are considering what interferences with liberty might be theoretically justified we must hesitate to draw the conclusion that they should be advocated in practice i think it probable however that almost all interferences with liberty for which there is a theoretical justification will in time be carried out in practice because scientific technique is gradually making governments so strong that they need not consider outside opinion the result of this will be that governments will be able to interfere with individual liberty wherever in their opinion there is a sound reason for so doing and for the reason just given this will be much more often than it should be for this reason scientific technique is likely to lead to a governmental tyranny which may in time prove disastrous
3080905 let us take some examples of traditional principles which appear no longer defensible to take a more important illustration consider the immense sums of money that are spent on advertising it cannot possibly be maintained that these bring any but the most meagre return to the community the principle of permitting each capitalist to invest his money as he chooses is not therefore socially defensible
3080906 take again the question of work both the kind of work and the method of performing it at present young people choose their own trade or profession usually because at the moment of their choice it seems to afford a good opening a well informed person possessed of foresight might know that the particular line in question was going to be much less profitable a few years hence in such a case some public guidance to the young might prove extremely useful and as regards technical methods it is seldom in the public interest that an antiquated or wasteful technique should be allowed to persist when a more economical technique is known at present owning to the irrational character of the capitalist system the interest of the individual wage earner is very often opposed to the interest of the community since economical methods may cause him to lose his job this is due to the survival of capitalistic principles in a society which has grown so organic that it ought not to tolerate them it is obvious that in a well organized community it should be impossible for a large body of individuals to profit by preserving an inefficient technique it is clear that the use of the most efficient technique should be enforced and no wage earner should be allowed to suffer by its enforcement
3080907 i come now to a matter which touches the individual more intimately i mean the question of propagation it has hitherto been considered that any man and woman not within the prohibited degrees have a right to marry and having married have a right if not a duty to have as many children as nature may decree this is a right which the scientific society of the future is not likely to tolerate in any given state of industrial and agricultural technique there is an optimum density of population which ensures a greater degree of material well being than would result from either an increase or a diminution of numbers as a general rule except in new countries the density of population has been beyond this optimum though perhaps france in recent decades has been an exception except where there is property to be inherited the member of a small family suffers almost as much from over population as the member of a large family those who cause over population are therefore doing an injury not only to their own children but to the community it may therefore be assumed that society will discourage them if necessary as soon as religious prejudices no longer stand in the way of such action the same question will arise in a more dangerous form as between different nations and different races if a nation finds that it is losing military superiority through a lower birth rate than that of a rival it may attempt as has already been done in such cases to stimulate its own birth rate but when this proves ineffective as it probably will there will be a tendency to demand a limitation in the birth rate of the rival nation an international government if it ever comes into being will have to take account of such matters and just as there is at present a quota of national immigrants into the united states so in future there will be a quota of national immigrants into the world children in excess of the licensed figure will presumably be subjected to infanticide this would be less cruel than the present method which is to kill them by war or starvation i am however only prophesying a certain future not advocating it quality as well as quantity of population is likely to become a matter for public regulation already in many states of america it is permissible to sterilized the mentally defective and a similar proposal in england is in the domain of practical politics this is only the first step as time goes on we may expect a greater and greater percentage of the population to be regarded as mentally defective from the point of view of parenthood however that may be it is clear that the parents who have a child when there is every likelihood of its being mentally defective are doing a wrong both to the child and to the community no defensible principle of liberty therefore stands in the way of preventing them from such behaviour
3080908 equality like liberty is difficult to reconcile with scientific technique since this involves a great apparatus of experts and officials inspiring and controlling vast organizations

3080925 for the kingdom of god is not a matter of eating and drinking but of righteousness and peace and joy in the holy spirit

3080963 in the midst of a global change that can modify temperatures by as much as 10 degrees fahrenheit
3080964 global warming has finally been explained the earth is getting hotter because the sun is burning more brightly than at any time during the past 1 000 years according to new research
3080965 suggests that increasing radiation from the sun is responsible for recent global climate changes
3080966 is brighter than it was a few hundred years ago and this brightening started relatively recently in the last 100 to 150 years
3080967 simultaneous warming on earth and mars suggests that our planets recent climate changes have a natural and not a human induced c ause
3080968 habibullo abdussamatov head of space research at st petersburgs pulkovo astronomical observatory in russia says the mars data is evidence that the current global warming on earth is being caused by changes in the sun
3080969 changes in the suns heat output can account for almost all the climate changes we see on both planets
3080970 similar to the warming experienced on earth over approximately the same period
3080971 suggests rapid changes in planetary climates could be natural phenomena
3080972 some planetary climate changes may be due to variations in the solar system environment

3081094 this woman in question has a very interesting history knowing her as this kind of bar fly who had this kind of crazy past from reading everything i read it seemed to me that she targeted edwards
3081095 your impressions of this woman rielle hunter whos being trashed in new york papers today on the cover of this one it says rielle cruel saying that she trashed elizabeth edwards said she was a woman who had bad karma what can you tell us about her
3081096 why do politicians like john edwards risk their careers by having extramarital affairs
3081097 what was the trigger so i wonder if there was something about his wifes illness that somehow got him to cheat or contributed at least
3081098 well you know i think that we get so caught up in good or bad you know is somebody a good person or a bad person cheating is wrong but i think that there are multiple factors
3081099 well that could certainly be and there are many politicians who are targeted theyre powerful sometimes theyre good looking so they are going to be in a situation that other quote unquote normal men may not be in
3081100 whats going on in his brain he has everything at risk hes running for president again theres no question about that as this is going on as his wife is suffering from this horrible disease he decides well its okay
3081101 its possible he couldnt stop himself in the sense you know the career of politics involves all sorts of change variety novelty risk uncertainty they tend to be natural rule breakers these the folks who go in there you know if they followed the strict rules theyd have a 9 00 to 5 00 ordinary job
3081102 elizabeth edwards has been amazing she said im sticking with this guy this is you know part of what life is about
3081103 i mean a lot of these women must know that their men are going to be targeted and maybe they make a decision listen my relationship is more important than some woman im not going to allow some fling to interfere with my relationship and also its a business relationship for a lot of these people in addition to being an emotional relationship
3081104 politicians arent like the rest of us you understand and neither are their spouses and so theyre attracted to certain things in these guys and sometimes there are consequences
3081105 what was the trigger so i wonder if there was something about his wifes illness that somehow got him to cheat or contributed at least

3081108 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3081109 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3081110 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3081111 its the ability to cast white as black and black as white which is surprising the ability to cast the aggressor as the victim and blame the victims for the consequences
3081112 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3081113 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3081114 we have 50 less food 75 less money and 35 more people to feed

3081127 sis juga sangat kecewa dengan parti parti politik yang sering melaungkan hak asasi manusia suara rakyat hak memberi pendapat dan sebagainya yang jelas telah gagal dalam menyambut seruan mereka sendiri dan menyalahi manifesto yang mereka janjikan kepada rakyat

3081137 i did feel for a long period that there wasnt anything new to buy
3081138 but i really like the slim fit its not so roomy not so bulky and its a lot cleaner
3081139 this is a trend that you have to buy otherwise you look outdated
3081140 suddenly a pair of cargo pants and a polo shirt doesnt look good anymore
3081141 womens wear has painted themselves in a corner by offering too many options and with everything a trend it is very easy not to buy anything

3081147 its my right to be a total pain in the ass
3081148 i heard one of the taxi drivers say what on earth is that in the sky
3081149 i looked up to see a number of probably eight orange diamond shaped objects
3081150 one of the objects travelled to a different position whilst the others appeared to be hovering
3081151 they were definitely not aeroplanes my husband is a pilot and he would know he would estimate they could have been 20 or 30 miles away if not further
3081152 we watched for a couple of minutes and as some cloud cleared there appeared to be more coming in from the west
3081153 i felt panicked by the sighting and hurried home thinking something awful might be about to happen it did feel like being in a sci film for a few minutes
3081154 there is no way they were aeroplanes or anything like that
3081155 i was the first to see them and at first i thought they were just stars but they were glowing yellow a really unusual colour
3081156 i then called out everyone and we were all out watching them for ages
3081157 im not a star and i dont want to be a star stars fall im an ordinary guy with an extraordinary job
3081158 the world just got a little less funny he will be dearly missed
3081159 i was approached to be a clothes designer once i said are you crazy why would you even consider that and they said well you have a name there are so many good designers so why would i put my name on clothes when i never wanted to do it
3081160 the company could declare force majeure on its exports from the two ports
3081161 people are trying to get their head around what to do essentially with the u s dollar

3081171 theres no more important voter in this media market than the hispanic swing vote
3081172 i think people like me feel proud of being in a thinking process rather than just going with one party
3081173 never in my life as someone involved in grass roots politics here have i seen a presidential campaign come to those of us who are active with the community to say i know the national issues but please explain to me what do you want to see in your community
3081174 john mccain understands that he cannot take one vote for granted he understands that he cannot take the hispanic vote for granted

3081176 a millage reduction for us wont mean less tax revenue because there is enough new construction to offset it

3081178 we are a funny market a bit of pharma product a bit of consumer product bit of a medical device
3081179 the challenge for a company like empi is to not only convince doctors there is enough science to justify tens but also that its practically useful to doctors
3081180 this is 30 year old technology that has been proven time and time and time again
3081181 the challenge is that it goes against current modern medicine which says you have an ailment and the doctor gives you a pill
3081182 this therapy is a bit of a different therapy and what weve got to do is to get into the physicians mind space and help them understand electronic therapy is good sound science thats why we have the branding campaign
3081183 gosh we could build a pretty good business by grabbing three five and maybe 10 share points
3081184 the technology is evolving to the point where it is commercially viable
3081185 its difficult to determine if tens works the best thing we can say about tens is that some people who are on tens respond to the therapy and some do not
3081186 overpower pain the strength training program that stops pain without drugs or surgery
3081187 i think people just dont understand what goes on in a special education classroom they get influenced by what you call wives tales oh its so hard oh theres so much paperwork and thats just not the case
3081188 i think teachers or people who aspire to be teachers have the wrong conception about special ed they think it is a place for kids that cant learn or dont want to learn
3081189 all we can do is teach do what we love everyday wake up in the morning and feeling positive about what i do and come here and make some kids feel positive about themselves its as rewarding as possible
3081190 finally dutchmen argues that the damage award must be set aside
3081191 this weekends rapidly escalating fighting in the former soviet republic of georgia is absolutely appalling saakashvilis irresponsible and disastrous offensive to retake south ossetia has provoked a predictably heavy handed russian retaliation both sides seem to be indiscriminately shelling and bombing civilian areas for apparently no greater cause than ethnocentric identity w e were already looking at needless antagonism of russia which would set back future energy supply farther than new domestic drilling could ever make up for among other important considerations now russias hand has been forced and the whole thing is just a sorry spectacle for all
3081192 what well think of is the country of georgia and well realize that august 8 was the date when russia began reassembling the former soviet empire in earnest
3081193 its not just that i find the charges of russian imperialism a bit tired coming from people who have insisted for years that invading other countries toppling their governments and setting up puppet states is not imperialism but i find them very boring i mean how unimaginative can one be to say theyre bringing back the soviet union thats the sort of thing an eccentric bond villain would try to do there are no more workers councils and there is no more ussr in every sense of the word the soviets are gone and their empire is dust
3081194 both candidates for president issued a statement about the war going on in south ossetia and their responses to the incident pretty much sums up the difference in the two men obama said
3081195 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis
3081196 pretty reasonable right in line with the realistic approach to foregn policy that obama has embraced we dont have a good hammer here and frankly our interests are best served by this conflict coming to a swift resolution calling on both sides to cease hostilities and talk to each other is really the only thing a sane person could advocate which is why john mccain is not saying it
3081197 today news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory the u s should immediately convene an emergency session of the united nations security council to call on russia to reverse course the us should immediately work with the eu and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course it has chosen finally the international community needs to establish a truly independent and neutral peacekeeping force in south ossetia
3081198 thats great and while were at it maybe we can dispatch iron man to blow up the soviet tanks and have czechoslovakia dispatch their fleet of invisible boat mobiles look im all for taking this to the un i mean thats what the un is for but russia has a veto on the security council so any un backed resolution is going to need russian approval putting diplomatic pressure on russia is unlikely to accomplish much other than angering russia and going to nato to start discussing how we can get engaged in military action on the russian border is to put it very charitably incredibly reckless and absolutely insane and should disqualify mccain for president we may like georgia just fine and hope that they get through this conflict but lets be honest the russians are going to do what the russians are going to do were not going to be able to bully them and we sure as hell arent going to be able to scare them if we are going to get the best outcome for american interests in this conflict the only tool that we have to use is diplomacy its not as fun as playing with tanks but its got the advantage of maybe working and at the very least not making things worse
3081199 john mccain likes to go in for ferociously anti russian rhetoric and has embraced silly anti russian ideas so i wasnt surprised to see that his rhetoric on the russia georgia conflict involves strongly taking tblisis side i am however a bit curious to learn that hes decided to make this a campaign issue with national security adviser and former registered lobbyist for georgia randy scheunemann condemning barack obama for moral equivalence
3081200 mccains men are busying themselves decrying anyone who two days ago held the majority opinion about the complexity level of the russo georgian war as a useless dimwit and pinko commie symp its a nightmarish oversimplification of a situation that rose revolution notwithstanding will never fit cleanly into the us versus them dynamic which would make solidarity with georgia such an easy reflex none of which means i dont have a soft spot for georgia love their flag or support the rule of law and representative government over fiat and autocracy i do even more important for american purposes than determining the precise percentage by which saakashvili is responsible for his own countrys woe is making clear that the mccain campaigns attempt to cast foreign policy prudence as something only an idiot like obama would consider is a serious blunder of epic proportions and an embarrassment to thinking people everywhere
3081201 on friday the obama campaign issued a pathetic statement strongly condemn ing the outbreak of violence in georgia strongly obama found no reason to distinguish between russia and georgia in strongly condemning the outbreak of violence or perhaps he found it too difficult to do so
3081202 instead of scolding russians for attacking georgia he told georgia to exercise restraint as russian bombers attacked their civilians obama clearly has no idea of the issues or the consequences surrounding putins south ossetia adventure hes flailing for a policy while mccain whos actually been to georgia and studied the ongoing political conflict for a decade understood immediately what the outbreak of war means and what its motives are
3081203 the situation in georgia is serious the u s and the west are being tested will we defend an ally and check russian ambitions in the caucasus on the political front georgia may in fact be the 3 a m moment and the candidates reactions are telling as abe pointed out mccains reaction was swift specific and unequivacal the international community wont tolerate the invasion of a sovereign state obamas best effort is to suggest calm and go on vacation no words on the matter from his actual lips it is instructive that obama takes such a ho hum attitude to the invasion of a u s ally you dont have to be a partisan to see how serious the situation is and how inadequate obamas response is
3081204 the russian governments incompetent attack against john mccain has handed him a great weapon against obama
3081205 its this campaigns position that every american has a vested interest in the welfare of the republic of georgia a key regional ally and a member of our coalition in iraq georgia is a small democratic state which has seen its sovereignty violated by a much larger pseudo democracy if the position of this campaign mirrors the position advocated by the georgian government it is because john mccain stands by our allies as senator obama offers only platitudes about condemning violence that mask the deeper moral equivalence of his foreign policy positions shouldnt it be of far greater concern to americans that the obama campaign is pushing an attack that is mirrored by pr firms flaking for putins kremlin
3081206 over the last two days russia has escalated the crisis in georgia through its clear and continued violation of georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity on friday august 8 russian military forces invaded georgia i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate ceasefire russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia
3081207 it has been a rough few weeks for mccain on the foreign policy front paging dr
3081208 russia and georgia stayed at the top of the news today and the mccain campaign is touting its mans prescience hes never trusted putin or the russians and he and randy scheunemann were talking like they knew thursday nights conflict would be a pretext for a wider russian invasion before virtually any other world leader would say that publicly its a good moment for mccain
3081209 so now mccain is trying to claim that he foresaw what russia is currently doing in georgia when the only reason mccain knew what russia would do is that he always assumes that russians have the very worst motives and goals and then declares himself prescient when russia does something objectionable at least smiths use of the word instinct is correct mccain is viscerally opposed to russia and so instinctively lurches to whatever the anti russian position is on any given issue the video smith digs up includes the videos are being circulated by mccain aides shows how fanatically anti russian mccain has been for at least the last decade
3081210 mccain supporters are obviously going to try and run a good distance with the argument that he was somehow prescient on the question of russian power im not quite sure how to put this but mccains apparent inability to view russian foreign policy as anything other than retooled soviet ambition strikes me as unhelpfully alarmist lets recall that if things had gone as mccain preferred the united states would have somehow expelled the russians from the g 8 forced nato to rapidly absorb georgia and the ukraine unleashed the fookin fury on iran and pursued any any number of other needlessly provocative and delusional goals
3081211 the obama campaigns attacks on randy scheunemann are disgraceful mr scheunemann proudly represented a small democracy that is one of our closest allies in a very dangerous region today many are dead and georgia is in crisis yet the obama campaign has offered nothing more than cheap and petty political attacks that are echoed only by the kremlin the reaction of the obama campaign to this crisis so at odds with our democratic allies and yet so bizarrely in sync with moscow doesnt merely raise questions about sen obamas judgment it answers them
3081212 at the same time the kremlin was attacking john mccain for scheunemanns ties to georgia you guessed it barack obamas campaign attacked mccain for scheunemanns connection to the republic of georgia no word on when obama will apologize to randy scheunemann for joining the russians in smearing him it is also worth pointing out that georgia is an american ally with whom we have military relations obama attacked a man who lobbies for an american ally not all lobbyists are bad obama should know given the high number of lobbyists he surrounds himself with
3081213 the mccain campaign misses the issue entirely its not about whether or not their position is right or wrong its about the fact that a top mccain campaign official has a major financial stake in taking that position conflicts of interest like this undermine john mccains moral authority if he truly supports the positions he is taking he ought to fire advisers like scheunemann whose recommendations are influenced by the profit motive would firing scheunemann really be such a hard thing to do
3081214 it also seems like the obama campaign swung and missed when it tried to highlight mccain adviser randy scheunemanns lobbying for georgia yes mccains campaign is basically run by lobbyists and in many cases lobbyists for foreign governments but when russia marches into georgian territory it hardly seems like the right time to raise the issue if mccains initial statement was too aggressively pro georgian then it should be criticized on those grounds not because of scheunemanns ties to tbilisi
3081215 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public when a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story i used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it but being 99 honest is no longer enough
3081216 john edwards picked a pretty good day to admit his caddishness not only is it a friday the preferred day for dropping ugly and or embarrassing stories and the start of the beijing olympics but vladimir putin errr dmitri medvedev sent russian troops into the breakaway georgian province of south ossetia
3081217 i am incredibly annoyed that we have to waste any air print or pixel time on this why do i care about some dudes marriage and marital problems unless he did something that in any way abuses public power i just dont care what politicians do with their zippers so long as their policies and votes are in order but private dalliances seductions and oversize sexual appetites eh not my problem leave the poor family alone
3081218 couldnt disagree more here i do care but it isnt that im all exercised about some dudes marriage and marital problems after all edwards said on nightline that his and elizabeths marriage was stronger after this happened its that edwards did abuse his power as much power as anybody whos not in office has lets review edwardss mistakes im not even including the affair itself here
3081219 given that this is the first and i hope last thing i write on this i dont feel too bad about wasting precious pixels if this story tells us anything about edwards its that he is along with many other probably nice things also a brazen liar and cover up artist who doesnt consider and then incompetently handles the irreversible consequences birthed by his actions thats enough for me to want his hands away from any reins big or not so big to put one last way i dont care whether a politician lets his zipper down either but character is what you do after the zipper comes back up
3081220 our family has been through a lot some caused by nature some caused by human weakness and some most recently caused by the desire for sensationalism and profit without any regard for the human consequences none of these has been easy this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private john has spoken in a long on camera interview i hope you watch admitting ones mistakes is a hard thing for anyone to do and i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame i ask that the public who expressed concern about the harm johns conduct has done to us think also about the real harm that the present voyeurism does and give me and my family the privacy we need at this time
3081221 i find this elizabeth edwards post on daily kos excruciating we are supposed to ride with this couple through her cancer diagnosis and relapse through their sons death their fertility treatments and the rededication of their marriage but then we are supposed to butt the hell out when the story line veers from the tragedy and heroics if you believe in a system you have to live and die by it elizabeth edwards buys into the culture of overconfession she is an obsessive blogger for gods sake you cant just get suddenly pissed off because the confessional culture came back to bite you

3081243 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3081244 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3081245 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3081246 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3081247 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3081248 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3081249 we wanted to let them know what we found and we wanted to tell them some ideas we had on how they could fix that system we felt like the issue was resolved that was verbally affirmed in a monday meeting then friday we find out theres a federal lawsuit against us

3081251 these conferences are populated with people from google cisco wanting to collect information about security vulnerabilities that might exist in their systems if you dont let this information be discussed the attackers are going to research it but no legitimate person is going to talk about it
3081252 courts have found that the first amendment covers these things
3081253 we believe that this is a protected speech activity when you discuss security issues if you are telling the truth that is something that should be protected
3081254 whether its a vulnerability in dns or a flaw in the boston public transportation system the same argument on responsible disclosure arises
3081255 the solution has to be a compromise from both parties while still being able to maintain the integrity of the system and providing fair boasting rights to the researchers
3081256 what would have been an interesting talk by any means even without the side stories of legal action sadly turned into a hyped display of legal wrangling
3081257 the conference cd apparently contains the entire presentation and the student newspaper published a pdf document of the research
3081258 for more than three years the local prosecutor has fought dna and fingerprint testing that could prove michael mortons innocence and finally solve both of these crimes

3081260 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3081280 in order to be more than the great white north or more than just a trading partner like others i think we have to show how interwoven the connections are and how broad that cultural mix really is

3081282 if you look at how much time kids spend watching television and movies versus how much time they spend outdoors or in the classroom concentrating on wildlife and nature nobody should be really surprised by the survey results
3081283 we get our kicks from sitting in front of a screen rather than actually feeling something
3081284 its an illusion that we can replace real experiences with vicarious ones nature shows are great but they certainly cant replace spending time outside

3081290 even though im in quebec this orchestra is part of our national heritage
3081291 ive already talked with business people around the country the idea is at least to provide the orchestra with the funds to keep going for an interim period
3081292 some kind of a joint venture with the cbc or a total spinoff
3081293 they have pretty strong management theyre in a changing environment and they have made their decision but that doesnt mean the orchestra has to stop living
3081294 its a national platform for canadian talent and canadian art
3081295 this may be the time for us to think about how a real 21st century orchestra should develop

3081333 this is a movement that is reaching the men and the adults
3081334 the afcc is in the embryonic stages of coming together
3081335 what is happening in texas is also attempting to happen across america
3081336 we are trying to remove the barriers that have kept lost men from coming to church
3081337 god is moving in this and the people are responding
3081338 was due to philosophical differences the president had with the chancellor and trustee leadership about the future of criswell college
3081339 our plan and expectation is to have someone named and to be in place as close to that date aug 15 as possible so there will be no gap in leadership
3081340 for six months the chancellor has been trying to cannibalize criswell college to fund his building program at the church which will cost 170 to 240 million
3081341 accomplishments that have been achieved at the college and kcbi under dr johnsons leadership which are too numerous to mention
3081342 i firmly believe that due in no small part to dr johnsons contributions the greatest days at criswell college are yet to come
3081343 the congregation determined that the proceeds from their building and property should help sustain our work in theological education and provide for creative accessible delivery
3081344 although they could not continue as a church they wisely chose to sow seeds for the future it is a significant legacy
3081345 closing a church leaves the feeling for some of us anyway that we have failed in the legacy entrusted to us
3081346 but creating a means to train candidates for the pastorate somehow lessens the feelings of failure and provides a hope and promise for the future
3081347 god seems to be drawing both of us cbf and global women to central asia the needs of the women there are great
3081348 we are investigating ways to empower women to find ways to empower and encourage women to live out their call to ministry
3081349 it is a very complementary relationship we want to enlarge the understanding of what christ means for women around the world
3081350 im delighted that cbf is entering into this intentional and strategic agreement with global women at a moment when both groups have an opportunity to transform the lives of women around the world
3081351 my hope and prayer is that this connection will help to keep before our congregations the unique challenges that women face around the world and to provide many opportunities for ministry together
3081352 we have found that global women really strikes a chord
3081353 some churches maybe dont do the womens missions groups like they used to some churches are finding a void and have started global women groups some of which include men
3081354 part of what religious communities do in their best moments is to seek after the truth with a sense of humility and a sense of openness for the sake of the common good
3081355 so i certainly would hope to continue in that marvelous legacy of congregational care internally and bold courageous prophetic action externally for which the riverside church has been known now for so many years

3081381 we want to bring it to the worlds attention that gaza is virtually an outdoor concentration camp
3081382 peace and security we discovered in south africa do not come through the barrel of a gun i support the boat convoy in its effort to bring humanitarian relief to the people of gaza
3081383 we want to break the siege of gaza we want to raise international awareness about the prison like closure of the gaza strip and pressure the international community to review its sanctions policy and end its support for continued israeli occupation we want to uphold palestines right to welcome internationals as visitors human rights observers humanitarian aid workers journalists or otherwise
3081384 we are these human rights observers aid workers and journalists we have years of experience volunteering in gaza and the west bank at the invitation of palestinians
3081385 but now because of the increasing stranglehold of israels illegal occupation of palestine many of us find it almost impossible to enter gaza and an increasing number have been refused entry to israel and the west bank as well despite the great need for our work the israeli government will not allow us in to do it

3081403 yes ive just stopped having nightmares so i feel ok to talk about it
3081404 the palestinian leadership has been working on establishing a palestinian state within the 67 borders
3081405 if israel continues to oppose making this a reality then the palestinian demand for the palestinian people and its leadership would be one state a binational state
3081406 russia has no interest in taking over south ossetia and certainly none in invading georgia proper
3081407 georgia is the one that primed itself for war we did not prepare in advance but had to get involved in this conflict to protect the russian observers who are spread out in the region under the 1999 agreement in order to watch over the local population and prevent genocide
3081408 our observers were the first to come under attack we had to protect them and of course prevent a humanitarian disaster in south ossetia prevent a future genocide you must remember that there are ossetians living in russia as well we have a moral obligation towards them
3081409 we didnt arm them the south ossentians armed themselves its very hard to control the arms smuggling into the region while our observers do have a mandate to act in south ossetia but it is not unlimited power just as the unifil force is unable to thwart the arms smuggling in southern lebanon
3081410 we are only there to push the georgian army out we have no plans to annex south ossetia or abkhazia like the rest of the world we do not recognize these two districts declarations of independence we want to see georgias territorial integrity preserved and we have no intention of overthrowing president mikheil saakashvili
3081411 we are not demanding that he be replaced we simply think he is ineligible but we have no plans to take any action towards this end obviously we will not march into tbilisi and forcibly overthrow him
3081412 i myself am not a military man it is difficult for me to evaluate the extent of our response but it is important to emphasize that we did not initiate this we were dragged into it our airstrikes in georgia have only targeted military bases and military targets to avoid any further attacks on our troops
3081413 our goal was not to harm civilians and to the best of my knowledge we only hit military installations but like they say war is war and it could be that civilians were hurt this also happens in israels military operations in gaza for example unfortunately in ethnic conflicts there are no winners only losers
3081414 first before we can begin negotiations we demand georgias full withdrawal from south ossetia we demand tbilisi commit on paper that it has no future intention to recapture the separatist districts
3081415 the abkhazians understand that if georgia invaded south ossetia they are next and they announced that they would launch a military operation against the georgian enclave of kodori our increased presence there is designed to ensure the situation doesnt deteriorate there
3081416 yep some things ive managed to do pretty well so far

3081478 on the other hand it gave me a chance to say to the chinese people religion wont hurt you you ought to welcome religious people and it gave me a chance to say to the government why dont you register the underground churches and give them a chance to flourish and he listened politely i cant read his mind but i do know that every time i met with him i pressed the point

3081480 i said this violence is unacceptable i not only said it to prime minister vladimir putin ive said it to the president of the country dmitriy medvedev
3081481 and my administration has been engaged with both sides in this trying to get a cease fire and saying that the status quo ante for all troops should be august 6th and look i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
3081482 the opening will mark the halfway mark of an ambitious project under the australia indonesia partnership to build or expand 2000 high schools across 20 provinces by the end of 2009

3081501 nuventix has developed a unique technology that addresses the critical thermal management challenges of high brightness led systems as well as localized cooling for high performance processors dsps fpgas and asics
3081502 synjet technology is remarkable engineers now have a cooling system that unleashes the potential of energy efficient lighting without the noise power and failure modes associated with traditional motor driven fans we are very excited to bring this new technology to all of our customers
3081503 avnet lightspeed as the leading provider of high brightness led solutions to major and emerging companies designing lighting and illumination systems is an excellent partner for synjet led light coolers
3081504 avnet will contribute significantly to the adoption of this technology and growth of synjet products in the marketplace
3081505 the ability of electric utilities to continue providing reliable reasonably priced electricity to fuel our nations economic growth is increasingly challenged by aging insufficient infrastructure continued growth in electrical load rising construction costs and a desire to reduce greenhouse gas emissions these issues can be managed more successfully through strategic expansion of our nations transmission grid including significant investment in extra high voltage transmission
3081506 indiana is home to nearly 27 000 megawatts of generation and the states transmission system delivers electricity across the midwest and beyond to continue reliable delivery of this energy and add the output of new generation that has been proposed in the state indiana needs additional extra high voltage transmission capacity a reliable supply of electricity is fundamental to our quality of life and economic growth and indianas transmission system which was largely completed more than 25 years ago needs to grow as well to continue to meet the needs we have today and in the future
3081507 like most parts of the country indiana will see significant benefits from extra high voltage transmission expansion the need to build additional transmission provides the opportunity to invest in a long term transmission solution that will facilitate development of additional generation including renewables and support the reliable transport of electricity to fuel future economic growth for example more than 3 000 megawatts of wind power has been proposed in central indiana but additional transmission is necessary to bring it online
3081508 building more extra high voltage 765 kv transmission lines in indiana can provide significant economic and environmental benefits a 765 kv transmission line requires less land to carry more power than lower voltage lines and the 765 kv line would cost less than half as much to build a 765 kv transmission line also operates more efficiently than lower voltage lines reducing the amount of electricity that needs to be generated by reducing line loss electricity lost during transport the new 765 kv designs that would be used for this project have line losses of less than one percent compared with losses as high as 10 percent for a lower voltage alternative
3081509 it appears that for people who have a certain genetic makeup the initial physical reaction to smoking can play a significant role in determining what happens next
3081510 if cigarette smoking is sustained nicotine addiction can occur in a few days to a few months
3081511 the finding of a genetic association with pleasurable early smoking experiences may help explain how people get addicted and of course once addicted many will keep smoking for the rest of their lives
3081512 understanding the genetics of complex disorders such as nicotine addiction will require much more research on key traits

3081515 following the ati acquisition amd increased its investment in the professional graphics business and now delivers professional graphics accelerators that perform better than the competition at every price point 1 the new ati firepro brand communicates this focus on performance and features that matter to engineers and designers
3081516 ati has been known for delivering value priced solutions for cad and dcc professionals the product reviews over the past year have validated the fact that ati offers outstanding application performance as well
3081517 historically 3d technologies were expensive and used only by senior designers within a large manufacturer or architectural firm as technologies advanced and prices dropped 3d graphics for entry level cad designers was no longer a pipe dream but a necessity
3081518 todays entry and mid level cad users need to create and render more complex designs and models and graphics accelerators from amd can deliver the performance and reliability professionals need at a price where 3d becomes the rule not the exception
3081519 at dell we strive to provide design professionals with outstanding 3d graphics technology and with support from amd we can meet that need
3081520 the dell precision t7400 t5400 and t3400 desktop workstations are designed to handle the demands of 3d opengl applications for engineering architecture and digital content creation and we will soon offer ati firepro to meet customer needs
3081521 our customers need high performance graphics hardware that is stable reliable and compatible with eyeon fusion and eyeon generation to foster increased collaboration while enabling more complex work
3081522 based on our experiences with amd we are confident that ati firepro 3700 and 5700 can be utilized in unique clustering configurations to meet the specific needs of our visual effects customers and certainly those of the film industry overall the recent enhancements to atis firepro series are consistent with the companys superior customer service
3081523 screening for depression during pregnancy is important for this population group given latinas high rates of fertility and births to single women particularly among more acculturated u s born latinas
3081524 the sample for this study was a low income population
3081525 our conclusions may or may not be different for women in other socioeconomic status ses groups hence more research needs to be conducted among latinas from differing ses groups including research focusing on the role of social support and cultural values beliefs related to childbirth and pregnancy among latinas
3081526 the higher prevalence rate of depression in americanized latina women is of concern in our community as the population demographics clearly indicate a significant rate of growth of this group in their childbearing years
3081527 thus it is important to more clearly understand the circumstances that affect their physical and emotional well being during pregnancy so that preventive measures can be initiated this is critical for the overall health of both the mother and child
3081528 women who were us born were significantly more likely than mexican born women to meet the cutoff score 21 on the ces d scale

3081530 capcom is extremely excited to work with grin to bring the world class franchise of bionic commando into the 21st century
3081531 capcom has also always been strong partners with nvidia and with bionic commando we are taking things to a new level by adding gpu accelerated physx to increase the titles realism
3081532 physics is changing the industry we evaluated all of the commercial physics systems out there for gaming and the choice was easy
3081533 nvidia physx runs faster than other solutions and it works across pcs and consoles which is important to us because bionic commando will ship on all major platforms we believe physx will help make the game seem even more lifelike and immersive
3081534 the gaming industry and gamers themselves are excited to see the return of bionic commando the addition of physics effects using physx technology is going to add a huge amount of extra fun and depth to the game play
3081535 we cant wait to see what the talented team at capcom and grin can create using the nvidia physx technology and hands on support from our developer technology team
3081536 i applaud efforts of the aclu and the national association of criminal defense lawyers to ensure that the principles of our country are not compromised and the guant namo detainees are afforded a fair trial with basic rights of due process

3081538 we will continue to fight for justice and raise awareness of the fundamental flaws of this unlawful system guant namo and its military commissions represent a stain on this countrys reputation it is time to put an end to this debacle and make a fresh start in a system that reflects americas core values
3081539 with the launch of at amp t u verse tv wichita customers are finally getting a better choice to break free from cable

3081542 consumers will benefit from these advanced services and the wichita area will be an even more attractive place to live and work
3081543 entertainment is a significant growth area particularly for visual images of the top stars we bring a unique combination of video photos and text to the market providing coverage with a global reach
3081544 with emarketer recently estimating the online video market to be worth around 700m a year its important that providers and advertisers deliver ads in a manner in which viewers will accept them otherwise the market will not grow in line with predicted expectation
3081545 were delighted that reelkandi tv recognised the strong video ad serving technology we have and its ability to simplify the management and control of video ads were looking forward to working with them and deploying the technology across their partner network
3081546 because all of our online tv programmes are funded through rich media advertising its critical that we please both advertisers and audiences alike
3081547 we had been testing the market for demand through our existing in house ad server but soon realised its shortcomings and our need for a more stable and reliable ad server it had to be independent of our company with a global reach but particularly well supported in the uk and germany our primary markets
3081548 we evaluated video ad serving technologies from several online advertising companies and it was pretty clear from our perspective that adtechs video ad serving technology powered by lightningcast would meet our needs perfectly the viewer experience of watching videos across a partner web site is of a dynamic nature this means they may watch several clips across several players so we need to follow them throughout the session and use advertising tactically the adtech technology enables us to do just that it optimises the ads from a user session perspective and doesnt over or under play them we find it to be highly attentive and easy to manage

3081814 i dont think id be where i am now without having the faith i have
3081815 i dont know that i would have been able to persevere without knowing that the lord was in control and he had his hand on me and was working through everything ive gone through
3081816 the americans havent won a medal in road cycling since 1984 so its been a long time
3081817 i think well come away disappointed if we dont win one
3081818 i think there were a lot of people praying for me at the time
3081819 i remember being an eighth grader and having a really good understanding of his grace and what it meant to be a christian
3081820 i think my faith was pretty far along pretty early
3081821 i knew there was something athletically special about what i could do but i kept getting hurt
3081822 i could never do enough miles to be competitive i walked to the other side of the track where the bleachers were i climbed to the top and sat there and cried for an hour and a half i sat in the cold i cried i prayed i sat in silence
3081823 all of a sudden you have a really clear understanding of what it means when jesus said to paul my grace is sufficient
3081824 at the time i was going through those four years it was such a roller coaster now when i look back im so thankful for it and i wouldnt change any of it because of how it built my faith and developed a foundation for me for who i am now
3081825 the people that knew me and had been around me knew that something had happened that i didnt do anything
3081826 my worry was more with the people who really didnt know me for me that was the hardest thing knowing that my witness was a little bit scarred in that sense but the people who knew me they knew my faith they knew my integrity and how i walked and that it was never something that i would intentionally do
3081827 i consider myself a christian before i consider myself an athlete
3081828 so how i act how i talk how i race i try to do that as a christian first im not going to put someone in the ditch i try to race with integrity and class i try to do things professionally in a way that hopefully accurately represents christ
3081829 the lords been good to me and hes always been there with me
3081830 ive learned to give thanks in all situations just knowing that the lords in control his plans are bigger and better than anything that i could ever imagine
3081831 for me the last four years have been tough after athens it was hard to take the plunge all over again but i decided to take it i worked hard and went for it theres not much to say except that you keep at it and at it one day it falls in your hand thats what happened i have had a lot of support from many people and one of them coach j s dhillon is here
3081832 i wasnt thinking about history i was lying two points behind the leader i just wanted to shoot and i wanted to shoot aggressively and thats what i did
3081833 i am trying to see what the chaos is up there
3081834 when it happened i kind of had a bad feeling when i didnt hear from her
3081835 she would have called to let me know she was all right
3081836 loved her kids she loved god and she loved to teach
3081837 when it happened i kind of had a bad feeling when i didnt hear from her
3081838 she would have called to let me know she was all right
3081839 loved her kids she loved god and she loved to teach
3081840 its the unnecessary delay in the second phase of counselling that has caused all the trouble
3081841 the first phase got over on july 7 why should there be a 36 day gap before they commence the second phase during this period the college has got the deemed status the department should explain the reason for the delay when students were calculating cutoffs and getting ready for admission
3081842 the college had earlier said that it would give only 83 seats to the government quota now even that wont be there this means we would have only 251 seats in the private medical colleges under the open quota
3081843 once the college gets deemed university status we can do nothing in the second phase besides private colleges we would admit students to the dharamapuri medical college which has 100 seats

3081849 the constitutional reform generated doubts criticisms and reservations among those who had previously voted for the president and contributed to decembers defeat seeing as the laws reproduce aspects of the constitutional reform it should generate the same apprehensions about the governments intentions

3081856 we believe that picis continues to be the system of choice for hospitals that want to automate their entire perioperative suite
3081857 todays operating room is expected to be the most efficient and highest revenue producing department of the hospital yet it is also where patient safety is at highest risk the leading health systems cannot afford to compromise with systems that do just the basics the environment today is too demanding and thats why more health providers choose picis than any other system

3081866 it is quite clear that the judge did not apply her mind as bias was exercised from the onset in favour of her colleagues in the law society

3081880 there is no justification for continued russian military action in georgia which threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe

3081882 russia of course will take its peacekeeping mission to a logical conclusion we will strive for working relations with all participants of this conflict
3081883 russian peacekeepers and support units are carrying out an operation aimed at preventing georgian forces from regrouping to carry new attacks on south ossetia senaki is one of the places where such actions were underway

3082105 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3082106 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

3082117 im a huge comic book fan and ive wanted to do some comic book work for a while now and what better way to get my start than with a wrestling comic so when headlocked writer creator mike kingston asked me if i would be interested in doing a cover i jumped at the chance
3082118 the mans been on television in movies and hes a household name to three generations of wrestling fans so were obviously very pleased to be publishing jerry lawlers first comic book work
3082119 ive always been a huge lawler fan i used to trade for tapes of memphis wrestling back before you could find everything on the internet getting to work with him and actually getting to watch him physically paint the cover has easily been my career highlight thus far
3082120 its a story about all the crazy stuff that goes into what you see on television when a guy shows up on a wwe show he most likely already has four to seven years in the wrestling business but you rarely hear anything about that headlocked is the chronicle of that journey for mike hartmann
3082121 he approaches wrestling the same way he did acting he bulks up just like an actor preparing for an action movie and he moves to philadelphia which is essentially hollywood for aspiring wrestlers because of his background were able to put a little more focus on the craft of professional wrestling and examine its place as a true performance art
3082122 there are a lot of coming of age themes in headlocked the story is just as much about hartmann becoming a man as it is about him becoming a wrestler hes a nineteen year old college kid who has given up his relatively safe existence to chase this crazy dream and at the same time hes almost totally reinventing who he is from the ground up and hes doing this while navigating through the darker underbelly of the wrestling business as a total outsider

3082191 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
3082192 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
3082193 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3082194 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3082195 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years

3082197 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3082198 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
3082199 americas three great national challenges our economy national security and climate change can all be addressed by switching to renewable energy
3082200 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together choosing the right path and repowering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3082201 we all know our country faces tough challenges a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
3082202 we can switch to smarter cleaner forms of power and take advantage of free energy sources like the wind and sun the answer is simple power our country with 100 percent clean electricity within ten years
3082203 we are taking this message to a national audience because this goal is both ambitious and attainable
3082204 meeting the challenge to repower america will deliver the affordability stability and confidence our economy needs as well as a healthy environment and it will generate millions of good american jobs that cant be outsourced

3082207 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3082208 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3082209 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3082210 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3082211 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3082212 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3082213 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3082214 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of

3082216 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3082217 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3082218 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3082219 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3082220 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3082221 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3082222 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3082223 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3082224 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3082225 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3082226 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3082227 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
3082228 you dont need any proof you just see it its in here everyday
3082229 you can see the rivers turning color and dead fish
3082230 i see where i live i live in costa rica at the moment and its very beautiful and clean
3082231 i see the difference about how the us is treating all its resources
3082232 i ride a bike i dont drive a car little things but i still us too much
3082233 its the price of gas i think that has made people think a little bit more about improving their lifestyle and giving back to the earth
3082234 my goal is to show people how to cook local produce
3082235 it doesnt have to be transported all the way across the country or across the globe
3082236 educate people that the climate crisis is both urgent and solvable
3082237 we ensure that every product or service they offer through the campaign makes it easier or cheaper for you to do your bit and help tackle climate change
3082238 ive starting using the egg trick and ive been able to lower my commuting fuel costs by more than 10 per cent
3082239 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
3082240 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
3082241 historically presidential nominations were decided at the party conventions and as a result the vice presidential running mates were also selected at the conventions gallups jeff jones notes
3082242 that made it difficult to disentangle the effect of naming a vice presidential running mate on a candidates support from the
3082243 the small window of time after the announcement of a presidential candidates running mate but before the convention has taken place
3082244 similar to the pattern seen with clinton in 1996 support for gore held steady during bushs vice presidential selection phase at 41 percent
3082245 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
3082246 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
3082247 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
3082248 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
3082249 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3082250 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3082251 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3082252 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3082253 russland will krieg schickt panzer und luftlandetruppen es bombardiert das ist eine geradezu freche verh hnung des kleinen und milit risch weit unterlegenen nachbarn die ihre steigerung erf hrt mit der bombardierung georgischer infrastruktur jenseits des s d ossetischen gebietes russland sucht eine frontale konfrontation mit georgien die russische zielstrebigkeit auch zu sehen an den bombardements in der zwillings konfliktzone abchasien deutet darauf hin dass moskau auf die gelegenheit gewartet hat seinen machtanspruch in der region milit risch zu demonstrieren
3082254 jetzt ist der moment gekommen wo der westen die russische antwort auf seine strategischen ziele erh lt
3082255 doch die strategen in washington br ssel und berlin wollten nicht h ren
3082256 wir m ssen zu ende bringen was wir mit der anerkennung sloweniens kroatiens bosniens und mazedoniens begonnen haben auch der kosovo muss unabh ngig werden
3082257 people can relate to other people that they know or people in a similar circumstance they are therefore more inclined to take a chance and do something different
3082258 green marketing is totally an increased buzzword the average person doesnt check to see if the word holds any weight with the business
3082259 people should look at what companies are actually doing to be sustainable
3082260 everyday i would take an industrial sized trash bag and at least fill it to the brim with paper and cardboard despite the fact that there were recycling bins available on campus
3082261 the only real trash that we had was coffee grinds and those are biodegradable
3082262 vladimir putin announced ambitious plans to revive russias military power and restore its role as the worlds leading producer of military aircraft yesterday
3082263 a sudden feeling of fear or anxiety that comes on suddenly is overwhelming appears to be uncontrollable and may seem to be unfounded
3082264 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3082265 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3082266 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3082267 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3082268 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3082269 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3082270 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3082271 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3082272 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3082273 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3082274 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3082275 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3082276 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3082277 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3082278 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3082279 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3082280 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3082281 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3082282 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3082283 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3082284 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3082285 just so you all know we did set a record
3082286 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3082287 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3082288 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3082289 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3082290 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3082291 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3082292 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3082293 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3082294 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3082295 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3082296 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3082297 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3082298 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3082299 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3082300 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3082301 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3082302 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3082303 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3082304 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3082305 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3082306 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3082307 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3082308 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3082309 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3082310 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3082311 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3082312 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3082313 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3082314 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3082315 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3082316 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
3082317 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
3082318 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
3082319 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
3082320 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
3082321 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3082322 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3082323 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3082324 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3082325 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3082326 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3082327 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3082328 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3082329 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
3082330 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
3082331 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
3082332 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
3082333 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
3082334 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
3082335 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
3082336 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
3082337 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
3082338 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
3082339 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
3082340 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
3082341 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3082342 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3082343 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
3082344 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
3082345 empire of debt the rise of an epic financial crisis
3082346 the honest truth is that we have too many people in washington living for today rather than saving for tomorrow
3082347 give americans a good talking to about the countrys sloppy debt habits
3082348 the american people are a lot smarter than people give them credit for
3082349 comment by bruce in miami august 8 2008 at 9 54 am
3082350 if a wall streeter is selling you dont want to be buying end of story
3082351 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3082352 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3082353 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3082354 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3082355 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3082356 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3082357 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3082358 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3082359 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3082360 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
3082361 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
3082362 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3082363 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3082364 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
3082365 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
3082366 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
3082367 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
3082368 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
3082369 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
3082370 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
3082371 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
3082372 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
3082373 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
3082374 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
3082375 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
3082376 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3082377 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
3082378 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
3082379 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
3082380 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
3082381 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
3082382 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
3082383 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
3082384 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3082385 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
3082386 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
3082387 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
3082388 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
3082389 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
3082390 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
3082391 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
3082392 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
3082393 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
3082394 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
3082395 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
3082396 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
3082397 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
3082398 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
3082399 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
3082400 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
3082401 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3082402 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
3082403 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
3082404 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
3082405 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
3082406 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3082407 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3082408 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3082409 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
3082410 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
3082411 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
3082412 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
3082413 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
3082414 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
3082415 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
3082416 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
3082417 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
3082418 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
3082419 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
3082420 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
3082421 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
3082422 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
3082423 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
3082424 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
3082425 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
3082426 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
3082427 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
3082428 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
3082429 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
3082430 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
3082431 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
3082432 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
3082433 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
3082434 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
3082435 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
3082436 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
3082437 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
3082438 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
3082439 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
3082440 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
3082441 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
3082442 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
3082443 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
3082444 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
3082445 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
3082446 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
3082447 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
3082448 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3082449 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3082450 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3082451 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3082452 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3082453 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3082454 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3082455 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3082456 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3082457 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3082458 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
3082459 please use public transit bicycling or other climate friendly means
3082460 have to go back 15 years to find ice expansion so far south
3082461 responsible individuals throughout the industrialized world are trying to come to grips with the harm being done to the global environment
3082462 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
3082463 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
3082464 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
3082465 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
3082466 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
3082467 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
3082468 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
3082469 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
3082470 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
3082471 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
3082472 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3082473 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
3082474 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
3082475 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
3082476 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
3082477 the opening will mark the halfway mark of an ambitious project under the australia indonesia partnership to build or expand 2000 high schools across 20 provinces by the end of 2009
3082478 australia is funding this program to help indonesia fulfil its vision that all young indonesians will have nine years of basic education
3082479 our construction alone will create some 330 000 new places in junior high schools including in some of indonesias poorest and remote areas
3082480 in all challenges indonesia can count on australia to work with it as a friend and partner

3082533 im just a fun guy who likes being friendly with everybody
3082534 it doesnt surprise me much for him to say that
3082535 this year hell have his helmet on his head not under the bench

3082579 it is a rare thing that film people in germany take the risk with a project like this they have a real punk approach full of enthusiasm besides the obvious punk songs with their historic reference i am writing music for all the other scenes the dark sides of the characters and so on this gave us the rare opportunity to blend from my punk roots into the more abstract electronic sounds i am known for
3082580 last year we have tried a new concept for the track on fire with philipp virus and miron zownir with natalia avelon in the lead role music videos are dead it is thrilling to find new ways of bringing music and film together
3082581 it is a really good record we both felt it would just not fit very well what we are doing with eat your heart out right now this doesnt mean we wont do anything together in the future though
3082582 we started writing new songs for this album the first week of january while simultaneously planning a mid west tour of america in february and recording our comin atcha live 2008 dvd while we were on the road coming home in march we hired terry to jump back into writing and recording music with us while we edited the dvd and routed a summer tour of europe were riding a wave of energy that doesnt come easy for a band of rookies much less a band whose been doing this for over 20 years and we wouldnt have it any other way
3082583 we jumped right back into the studio to work on forever more with terry while setting up a tour of american festival shows in july and august playing alongside bands such as matchbox twenty the wallflowers queensr che kiss and judas priest its great that we can play with any band of any music genre because weve never been pigeon holed into a style or label of music throughout our career
3082584 forever more demonstrates this idea of writing songs in a diverse fashion the title track is one of our deeper cuts complete with heavy lyrics de tuned riffs and acoustic interludes while i wanna live is one of our more uplifting songs that bounces musically and delivers a lyrical message that suggests living life to the fullest
3082585 isaac was unique and an inspiration to us all his accomplishments as a musician are unparalleled but more than that he was a very dear friend and great supporter of the soulsville foundation mission particularly the work we do with children we will miss him and his wonderful presence more than we can convey at this time

3082592 any parent who says it is easy to watch their child compete i would question that we are a nervous wreck
3082593 really its texting he always reaches out to us sometimes he calls were lucky if we get a call
3082594 he was a very tall glass of water a string bean
3082595 he was a very tall kid and he was very awkward his ears were a little big people would tease him which was very difficult for michael
3082596 but he has such a charismatic smile and a great personality
3082597 mike was a very energetic little kid who wanted to get answers to questions always in motion
3082598 i just wanted michael to experience everything he could possibly experience
3082599 ive been there not to dictate or guide im there to listen to what he wants to do and try to help him problem solve and make a wise decision
3082600 every time michael gets on the blocks he has a goal for himself and he knows what he wants to do i dont set those goals and im a very strong advocate of the idea that im the parent not the coach or the agent or whatever there is to be
3082601 i dont get caught up in the four six eight whatever the number might be i just know im here to support michael in every swim he takes
3082602 with a heavy heart and no breath in my chest i want to let you know that we and the doctors have done everything possible for jerry even though he did make snail like improvement these past 31 days he is not any better for words and has not had any consistency in the tests that the medical team have done for him at his time the hemorrhage has done massive damage to his body which will leave him severely disabled and in need of acute care for the rest of his life we know jerry wouldnt want to live like this in a vegetative state the family has made the decision to speak jerrys wishes and with draw life support i am truly devastated dont know what else to say thank you all for your support through this terrible time please keep jerry in your prayers mike
3082603 i care not to be remembered when i am dead those by whom i wd have wished to be remembd do not know me others can not
3082604 in some cases drunkenness is the origin of wickedness in others wickedness is the cause of drunkenness along with other vices they of the latter the most depraved incorrigible hopeless
3082605 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3082606 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3082607 it is a shame that some of our partners are not helping us but essentially are hindering us
3082608 i mean the transfer by the united states of a georgian contingent in iraq with military transport planes practically to the conflict zone
3082609 the very scale of this cynicism is astonishing the attempt to turn white into black black into white and to adeptly portray victims of aggression as aggressors and place the responsibility for the consequences of the aggression on the victims
3082610 russia made clear the goal of this operation is the regime change in georgia change of democratically elected government
3082611 pre planned cold blooded meditated murder of a small country
3082612 what else can happen for the world to wake up and see whats at stake
3082613 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3082614 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3082615 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3082616 its the ability to cast white as black and black as white which is surprising the ability to cast the aggressor as the victim and blame the victims for the consequences
3082617 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3082618 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3082619 in our spare time since 2006 we have helped 96 servicemembers obtain civilian career experience or some kind of civilian career counseling
3082620 once active duty members sign up at milcivex org we match them with a local civilian company according to the information that is given in the application
3082621 the best thing about it is that americas votes will determine the winners
3082622 i believe our group will benefit from any networking exposure and credibility that america supports you will bring our way

3082625 is there anything more beautiful than a beautiful beautiful flamingo flying across in front of a beautiful sunset and hes carrying a beautiful rose in his beak and also hes carrying a very beautiful painting with his feet and also youre drunk
3082626 this attack is just another example of militants deliberately targeting and killing iraqi citizens
3082627 we offer our condolences to the victims family and reemphasize our support for iraqi security forces as they pursue justice for all criminal elements and provide security and services to the people of eastern baghdad
3082628 detaining this criminal leader will enhance security and stability for the people of baghdad
3082629 with him behind bars progress and improvements of essential services in the areas where he conducted his crimes can proceed with greater ease
3082630 iraqi security and coalition forces continue to work the streets talking with the local people hunting down hidden weapons caches and making baghdad a safer place
3082631 together they are making the streets of baghdad safer for the iraqi populace

3082633 my kids were complaining about riding their bikes to school
3082634 and we lived a whole half mile from the elementary
3082635 every friday id show up with a big metro courier bag filled with prizes from china import trading co
3082636 the kids would get to pick out their price and theyd get excited
3082637 i sort of dangled the i word in front of the kids
3082638 once you have your own child it has an effect on you
3082639 you start thinking about the world you want your kids to grow up in
3082640 which is the song that is in the commerical that the jonas brothers were in promotional camp rock at target
3082641 i admire the jonas brothers because their songs speak to people theyre not just normal songs they have a meaning each song has a different story behind it and that is true music
3082642 guard your pocketbooks hard working missouri families the change train is leaving the station blazing a trail to the future and leaving the past behind and if were not focused on a new vision washington politicians embracing the failed politics of the past will stand in the way of new jobs and trample on our missouri values
3082643 some of his ideas are going to be revolutionary and completely different than anything thats been proposed before
3082644 if congressman hulshof is elected absolutely nothing will change he just likes using the word
3082645 the fact that the president is also unpopular the national republican party is unpopular you have to make the case for change
3082646 i would hate to have the job of trying to make jay nixon out to be the change agent
3082647 yesterday 150 000 missourians picked up republican ballots and voted against the washington politician
3082648 all to get a flavor of what voters want in their politicians this year
3082649 i think i was more prone to get up every morning and go running when i was single
3082650 shes not quick to say lets have a salad tonight
3082651 you try harder to keep yourself up as a single man to look good for the ladies
3082652 when youre married you can walk around the house in a tank top socks and drawers
3082653 we definitely need further research to explain those kinds of trends
3082654 when im by myself i tend to do a lot better doing the habits i always had before i let other people influence them
3082655 a world wide positive intention experiment will be conducted at 8 pm universal time 08 08 08 to put an end to secret agreements that have prevented the revolutionary technology and knowledge of extraterrestrial life entering mainstream society a galactic freedom day declaration has been issued by cooperating citizen organizations clearly expressing humanitys intent to put an end to secret agreements concerning extraterrestrial life
3082656 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
3082657 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
3082658 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
3082659 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
3082660 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
3082661 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
3082662 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
3082663 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
3082664 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
3082665 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
3082666 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
3082667 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
3082668 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
3082669 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
3082670 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
3082671 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
3082672 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
3082673 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
3082674 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
3082675 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
3082676 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
3082677 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
3082678 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
3082679 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
3082680 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
3082681 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
3082682 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
3082683 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
3082684 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
3082685 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
3082686 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
3082687 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
3082688 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
3082689 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
3082690 various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting i have between two days and two months to live
3082691 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that
3082692 what in gods name does she see in that loser

3082698 to confront donors to conservative groups hoping to create a chilling effect that will dry up contributions the warning letter is intended as a first step alerting donors who might be considering giving to right wing groups to a variety of potential dangers including legal trouble public exposure and watchdog groups digging through their lives the group is also hoping to be able to respond if an outside conservative group broadcasts a television advertisement attacking senator barack obama or another democratic candidate by running commercials exposing the donors behind the advertisements

3082700 threats and intimidation have no place in our democratic elections and are a violation of the law this new front group accountable america seems to have crossed a legal line
3082701 i wonder how accountable america feels about being held accountable
3082702 its hard to put that kind of race behind you
3082703 but it sets me up for something good the 200 free final thats my first priority
3082704 i just went out i dont want to say i cruised it but i just swam it
3082705 i just wanted to get into the finals and thats all i did it doesnt matter until the finals as long as you have a lane it doesnt matter where you are
3082706 i really thought theres no way and then i changed and i said you know what that is ridiculous this is the olympics and im here for the united states of america i dont care how bad it hurts in like five seconds i was thinking all these things i just got a supercharge and took it from there
3082707 i was watching michael phelps after the anchor leg touched
3082708 the whole thing is genuine thats the good thing about the olympics
3082709 but i dont think that alain lost the race its lezak who won it
3082710 jason is the most phenomenal closer ive ever seen in my life
3082711 hes been able to get his hand on the wall from behind from ahead it doesnt matter

3082717 we believe we can achieve in excess of 50 million in ebitda in fiscal 2010

3082724 there is a structural conflict of interest that cannot be avoided when the agency that is promoting and giving or lending dollars in the form of incentives and grants to promote certain energy projects also has to regulate those projects

3082731 the english version of wikipedia contains now more than 850 000 entries and thus the same amount of uris plus a human readable description while this collection is on the lower end of ontology expressiveness it is likely the largest living ontology that is available today in this paper we 1 show that standard wiki technology can be easily used as an ontology development environment for named classes reducing entry barriers for the participation of users in the creation and maintenance of lightweight ontologies 2 prove that the uris of wikipedia entries are surprisingly reliable identifiers for ontology concepts and 3 demonstrate the applicability of our approach in a use case
3082732 we suggest that semantic information can be extracted from wikipedia by analyzing the links between categories the results can be used for building a semantic schema for wikipedia which could improve its search capabilities and provide contributors with meaningful suggestions for editing thewikipedia pages we analyze relevant measures for inferring the semantic relationships between page categories of wikipedia

3082735 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3082736 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3082737 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3082738 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3082739 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3082740 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3082741 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3082742 i didnt have to max out personal or business credit cards and put the company into debt so early on and thats something that has led to a financially healthy company cash in the bank capital improvements made when we need them and travel rewards to boot
3082743 as more and more issuers and banks realize theyre tapped out on consumers small businesses have become more of a target
3082744 weve seen a definite proliferation in the past couple years and it has really escalated
3082745 the basic question is whether the card is needed for paying off charges over time or paying them off every month
3082746 you often have to spend a significant amount to get the full flat percentage back
3082747 very important in terms of capital and financing needs going forward
3082748 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3082749 does anybody else appreciate the subtle genius of the resistance
3082750 if you think its brilliant now wait a few years
3082751 we are very excited about hosting our own tournament this year
3082752 due to our facilities being upgraded last year we were forced to move the event to now that our facilities projects have been completed we are looking forward to showing them off to the good competition we have coming down to
3082753 in addition to our typical home games with our regional opponents we are bringing in very strong teams to visit our campus baylor and
3082754 we think we have set up a very challenging schedule overall which will allow us to meet our expectations of strong conference play hopefully the result will be another trip to the postseason
3082755 normally when an election campaign gets started there are quite a few undecided voters
3082756 as the campaign progresses more of those undecideds begin to rally around the frontrunners who are getting all the media attention what is striking about 2008 is that just the opposite is occurring there are more voters undecided or voting for third party candidates than there were in may
3082757 i think this is going to be a record year of protest voting
3082758 even though there are no major third party political stars running a la ross perot it appears there is a growing disillusionment with the nominees of the two major parties
3082759 this is not a year for supporting the lesser of two evils
3082760 there is simply not enough difference between the two major party nominees to distinguish which evil is lesser
3082761 even die hard mccain supporters have changed their minds about him after reading about the choice we face in
3082762 debka file discloses israels interest in the conflict from its exclusive military sources jerusalem owns a strong interest in caspian oil and gas pipelines reach the turkish terminal port of ceyhan rather than the russian network intense negotiations are afoot between israel turkey georgia turkmenistan and azarbaijan for pipelines to reach turkey and thence to israels oil terminal at ashkelon and on to its red sea port of eilat from there supertankers can carry the gas and oil to the far east through the indian ocean
3082763 as soon as a durable peace takes hold we need to move forward with dialogue and peaceful negotiations
3082764 buy side investors have seen a realignment of investor expectations in recent months as wild fluctuations in the market make for a greater focus on transparency and process
3082765 fund managers love volatility because it creates a major opportunity for profit but investors need additional assurances from the buy side in the form of increased reporting of exposures the linedata reporting module makes it easy for the buy side to provide those assurances so they can focus on taking advantage of investment opportunities
3082766 as far back as i can remember ive been a news junkie
3082767 mary houghtaling who runs a hospice in wilmington ohio choked up as she told mccain of dhls plans to close its domestic air hub in her town a move that could throw 8 600 people out of work
3082768 mccain and his campaign manager rick davis played roles in the fate of dhl express and its ohio air park as far back as 2003
3082769 those jobs are on the chopping block because sen mccain and his campaign were involved in a deal that resulted in control of those positions being shifted to a foreign corporation
3082770 the firm of rick davis john mccains campaign manager earned 185 000 lobbying for foreign ownership and 405 000 after the deal passed congress
3082771 i think that palace fans know that teams that are going to beat us are going to have to earn it
3082772 i think were a hard side lets enjoy it and lets go and put a few spokes in the wheels of other clubs
3082773 the first game youve just got to get it out the way and if youre going to have a clean sheet thats eutopia really
3082774 why the hell did i think i needed to buy the collected b sides of
3082775 youll continue to see a high degree of flux for probably the next several years
3082776 even if i were starting from scratch today i still think id bet on javascript and ajax its going to be hard to stop the massive momentum we have
3082777 flash is seeing a pretty aggressive growth cycle now but i still think javascript is going to be used in 10 times the number of flash apps that launch
3082778 its amazing what people have done with html which was never intended to do rich internet applications and flash was originally created for lightweight animation literally for mickey mouse on the web
3082779 but these technologies were designed for something else and people are really hacking them to do more
3082780 if you put it all together that lends itself to ajax being a very powerful capable rich internet application technology
3082781 if you look at google apps theyre doing great things but how many shops out there have the ajax chops that google does
3082782 we expect gears to be widely adopted in products like gmail
3082783 access the file system make system calls into the computer drag and drop access the webcam
3082784 gears can be ahead of the curve trying out new ideas that eventually become a new standard
3082785 nothing really comes close to the kind of desktop experience we have in picnik
3082786 itll take an incredibly long time to see it implemented across browsers and a long time to see high level of compatibility where you can really rely on it without a huge productivity drain on developers
3082787 with adobes rev of flash player version 10 theyve done a remarkable job of knocking out key things we had a conversation a year and a half ago where we gave them a wish list they have been really responsive
3082788 if they take a similar sized leap in short order say a years time frame they could be in the game
3082789 if they are the first to nail 3d that could give developers a lot of reasons to use their technologies
3082790 were going to be iterating pretty quickly and each version is going to add new features and functionality
3082791 paige has once again outdone herself with this beautiful and thought provoking self portrait
3082792 the work of a young artistic genius i cant wait to see what she does next
3082793 under this strategy the time hori zon for redeployment would be negotiated with the iraqi government and nested within a more assertive approach to regional diplomacy the united states would make clear that iraq and america share a common interest in achieving sustainable stability in iraq and that the united states is willing to help support the iraqi gov ernment and build its security and governance capacity over the long term but only so long as iraqis continue to make meaningful political progress
3082794 preventing them from acquiring heavy weapons tightly restricting their jurisdictions and movement and closely monitoring them for compliance so that they do not rub up against rival militias
3082795 iraqis of all sectarian and ethnic groups believe that the u s military invasion is the primary root of the violent differences among them and see the departure of occupying forces as the key to national reconciliation
3082796 the new president will be handed a slew of bills designed to expand the ways lawyers can sue
3082797 you have to think it was purely cynical politics so he could point to it later
3082798 nothing in his record indicates he cares about tort reform
3082799 coalition troops called in close air support to engage the militants hiding in the structure they did not have knowledge of non combatants in the buildings at that time
3082800 survivors reported that coalition aircraft dropped a bomb on the enemy position which killed eight of the civilians
3082801 an anonymous eyewitness told coalition forces that the civilians tried to escape the compound but the militants beat them and refused to let them leave
3082802 innocent civilians homes taking them by force to attack afghan and coalition forces
3082803 if civilians get killed during these attacks the responsibility falls on the taliban and their terrorist sponsors
3082804 therefore the use of air force in the war against terrorism in the afghan villages will have no result but causing civilian casualties
3082805 now there is an increasingly powerful and vocal national movement to stop mountaintop removal
3082806 im saying were going to have it stopped by the end of next year the end of 2009
3082807 if the american people knew what was happening in appalachia i feel certain that they would demand an end to this practice
3082808 i think if we get a new president itll be stopped and i guess were going to get a new president by next year
3082809 i can tell you we havent had any significant permits issued since march 2007 because the court found that the federal government was illegally issuing permits at that time
3082810 how can they approve the filling of hundreds and a couple thousand miles of mountain streams in this region and say thats not significantly degrading the water
3082811 all i can say is the corps hasnt been doing its job up until now
3082812 i wouldnt be able to comment on what we think the 4th circuits going to rule but that appeal and those four individual permits do not affect the army corps ability to issue further individual permits and they have been doing that
3082813 the plaintiffs again have filed suit over those and that is still in litigation
3082814 have we issued any coal mining permits since the ruling yes we have do we feel it complies with the judges ruling yes we do
3082815 in the regulatory department we follow the rules and regulations as passed on to us by congress and the judges whatever they decide is what we will do we are neither for projects nor against projects
3082816 they would still be able to do traditional surface mining which is what we call contour surface mining where they mine around the mountains and reclaim the land when theyre done
3082817 they put the material back up into the mined area
3082818 it would be devastating and not just to southwest virginia counties it would impact washington county it would impact the tri cities area the coal dollar flows in lots of directions
3082819 when you live in a mountainous region sometimes you appreciate the flat land
3082820 weve got airports weve got housing developments weve got shopping centers because of land flattened by mining
3082821 one of the reasons we pushed so hard for circulating fluidized bed clean coal technology for this power station is its ability to burn a wide variety of fuels
3082822 we will be able to design our fuel plan around a wide range of coal waste coal and biomass and can make adjustments as the market for those fuels changes
3082823 the next administration could clarify the federal regulations and make it clear that mountaintop removal mining was never foreseen when the surface mining laws were passed and is not permitted under those laws
3082824 we can fight with agencies all we want but its going to take some will in washington to get things done
3082825 do you suffer from aids glaucoma insomnia cancer migranes sic eating disorders anxiety depression nausea chronic pain or many other disorders
3082826 but under the parameters we were given for the federal law we didnt have a choice
3082827 it was a tough decision for all of us because the state law and the federal law are at odds
3082828 they were armed to the hilt like we were a terrorist cell they stole all our money id rather have been done in by gangs
3082829 enforcing federal drug law which still holds that marijuana is an illegal drug in any form
3082830 my parents wanted to put me on lots of pharmaceutical drugs
3082831 its ridiculous to have this constant battle between federal and state laws
3082832 america has gone over the top the war on drugs is out of control its become a war on people
3082833 the real leadership needs to come from the federal government
3082834 a phoney war on drugs that is filling up our prisons especially with people of colour
3082835 baby boomers have this perception that marijuana is about fun and freedom
3082836 it isnt its about dependency disease and dysfunction too many of us are in denial and it is time for an intervention
3082837 because if i cant vote my conscience in congress i dont want the job
3082838 but fetzer is changing more than just the closures in order to save the planet

3082852 the life of a single man is no life for a bachelor or a fool for that matter im reassigning you something more benign when you get around women you act so deprived

3082861 in tennessee the number of uninsured dipped for two years then rose to levels higher than ever
3082862 and the plan proved to be unaffordable in the long term
3082863 according to the latest figures on massachusetts from the national health interview survey
3082864 the uninsurance rate has fallen by only 2 percent from 7 7 percent to 5 8 percent since the reform was passed while the plan is already 147 million over budget
3082865 politicians like to claim theyve passed bold health reforms but theyre afraid to rock the private insurance boat
3082866 so they keep pushing gussied up versions of reforms that have failed time after time our health care system is sick to death and our politicians keep prescribing placebos
3082867 its easy to build political consensus for expanded health coverage
3082868 they are so obviously unworkable that its hard to take them seriously
3082869 numerous fish populations in the delta are crashing or in precipitous decline millions of salmon and other species continue to die annually as a result of both the direct and indirect impacts of the state and federal water project pumps despite the numerous efforts over the years to restore habitat for fish this legislation requires the state and federal projects that pump water out of the delta to mitigate for these losses which have huge negative impacts on our states fisheries and the commercial and sport fishing industries that contribute billions of dollars to our economy
3082870 cspa has repeatedly urged our government to correct the impacts caused by the water projects over the past fifty years the direct and indirect impacts caused by the project operations have only been partially mitigated at best and this is one of the principal causes for the declines of our central valley fisheries there is no way to begin to effectively recover and restore our once world class fisheries including some two thirds of all the states salmon unless this fundamental problem is fixed many millions of fish are lost each year add this up over the some sixty years that the projects have been on line and you have a major reason for the fishery disaster we now are forced to resolve these impacts or see our fisheries continue their head long collapse into extinction
3082871 such a transparent public process is critical to ensure appropriate mitigation obligations instead of the past deals behind closed doors between agencies that failed to properly protect the publics fisheries
3082872 cspa and the other fishing and environmental groups working to pass this legislation are urging all anglers and concerned citizens to contact their state senator and request support for passing this bill hundreds of letter from our grassroots have helped persuade the legislature to pass this critical legislation to begin the process of restoring our fisheries if anglers and the public want to see this bill pass it is absolutely critical that they tell the people who represent them in the state senate now

3082875 to have a street level grade train coming through here with the number of people that come through this community is a dangerous situation it should be re thought
3082876 we can reasonably infer from such changes in expos friday night revised testimony that the draft traffic study found adverse impacts that would have to mitigated so expo commissioned another study to reach a conclusion more to its liking
3082877 these studies will provide a window into expos apparent manipulation of technical studies to serve its litigation interests in this case to the extent is shows that expo has suppressed studies with conclusions not to its liking and has commissioned other studies that later the assumptions or methodologies to arrive at different conclusions that practice is highly relevant to the weight this commission should give to expos witnesses testimony to ignore such practices and to accept the project proponents technical assertions at face value would make a mockery of this hearing

3083003 i observe with concern the human rights violations suffered by members of the charco la pava community such as arbitrary displacement from their lands loss of housing and destruction of agricultural crops and other abuses such as the excessive use of force and detaining of members of the community that have opposed the construction of the hydroelectric project including women and children
3083004 there are around a million indigenous people in colombia belonging to more than 80 different indian american groups with over 60 separate languages nearly all of these groups have been victims of forced displacement or are threatened by it as a result of the internal armed conflict
3083005 in many cases losing their territory and moving into the entirely foreign environment of the cities threatens the very survival of the group and its individual members
3083006 indigenous peoples are among the first to suffer from increasingly harsh and erratic weather conditions and a generalized lack of empowerment to claim goods and services to which other population groups have greater access
3083007 indigenous communities are often the custodians of unique knowledge and skills and the genetic and biological diversity in plant and animal production that may be vital in adapting to climate change approximately 80 per cent of the worlds remaining biodiversity is found within indigenous peoples territories

3083100 however it has no significant impact on russias economic fundamentals and corporate earnings and at the end of the day we firmly believe this is what ultimately drives the markets rather then emotions and swings in investor sentiment
3083101 this conflict will have a negligible effect on the russian economy

3083213 this war did not begin because of a miscalculation by georgian president mikheil saakashvili it is a war that moscow has been attempting to provoke for some time armed with wealth from oil and gas holding a near monopoly over the energy supply to europe with a million soldiers thousands of nuclear warheads and the worlds third largest military budget vladimir putin believes that now is the time to make his move
3083214 today many are dead and georgia is in crisis yet the obama campaign has offered nothing more than cheap and petty political attacks that are echoed only by the kremlin
3083215 the reaction of the obama campaign to this crisis so at odds with our democratic allies and yet so bizarrely in sync with moscow doesnt merely raise questions about sen obamas judgment it answers them

3083223 the real challenge is that every day you have to think of something to talk about to continually put it out there to build an audience as readership grows the demand seems to get greater and greater and how do you manage that

3083230 natos north atlantic council should convene in emergency session to demand a ceasefire and begin discussions on both the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to south ossetia and the implications for natos future relationship with russia
3083231 might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia
3083232 weve got to keep taxes low we have to encourage innovation and we obviously need energy independence
3083233 the eu grand strategy is to develop georgia as an alternative route for caspian oil and gas by bypassing russia
3083234 but if georgia is no longer a safe passageway then all of these schemes for diminished dependency on russia go up in smoke
3083235 the first significant break in russias previous monopoly control over all oil and natural gas from the caspian sea states
3083236 azerbaijan and georgia for example rely on this pipeline for the political independence they often act out
3083237 an alternative pathway for the flow of caspian oil and gas to the west
3083238 georgia has been one of the leading recipients of u s military aid ever since
3083239 this of course infuriated the russians and they determined to try to curb georgias ties to the west in any way they possibly could
3083240 has gone from being the finest airline in the world with the best route structure and safety record to a shell of its former self

3083245 the skills that systems librarians have picked up through reference coursework or while working a public service desk are valuable editions to their support toolbox
3083246 using traditional skills to fill new roles systems librarians bridge the two worlds of technology and librarianship they also benefit from the best of both worlds using both sets of skills to confront changing technology as librarians and in terms of the larger goals of their institution
3083247 its not a secret of our success but it has enabled our business to grow we could not have opened our second store in kumeu without the name change its about having thought through the colours how it stands out the whole approach
3083248 we have based it around the power logo we get a lot of comment about the kumeu shop the orange colours stand out
3083249 we generally use mid range to top end components it allows us to get away from the competitors despite the so called recession theres more demand for better quality products that somebody will stand behind it is better to get something that costs more but lasts rather than get something cheap that has to be replaced again and again
3083250 people know they can trust us trust is only something that can be built
3083251 there is competition here in helensville and in kumeu and a number of freelance technicians people that offer a 50 flat fee fix generally go out of business within three months we are service based people come in that we have never seen before usually through word of mouth or our advertising a lot of people will say go to the pc zone it shows they trust and respect us

3083258 i know the score was lopsided and we played great but thats a really good team
3083259 if we can stay focused and keep 12 players on the same page we are going to be in great shape
3083260 and one reason that the crowd stayed so involved is the players never gave up they continue to play hard and that motivated us to keep going strong too its a reminder that you can never give up for a second in this type of setting

3083289 governor doyle senator feingold and so many of our dedicated public servants have worked tirelessly to preserve the great lakes and for that the people of wisconsin owe them our thanks
3083290 but to truly ensure the preservation of the great lakes we also need a steadfast ally in the white house barack obama will be that ally
3083291 its not enough for senator mccain to say he supports the great lakes as a candidate when his public record doesnt match those words
3083292 time and again john mccains record has been harmful to the great lakes rather than voting to prevent pollution and ecological damage his record certainly suggests that he was not looking out for the good of the region until he was a candidate and that the great lakes would not be a priority for him as president
3083293 mr president i would like to express my strong opposition to the conference report on the water resources development act of 2007
3083294 the united states senate today approved the water resources development act wrda
3083295 the asian carp t hreatens both the native fish and natural wildlife of the lake and in turn the economy of the entire great lakes region
3083296 in june 2006 durbin and senator barack obama d il worked to successfully secure 400 000 to operate the barriers that prevent invasive species from entering the great lakes twenty eight other great lakes house members joined congresswoman judy biggert r il in sending a letter to house appropriators in support of this effort the funding was included to pay for the operation of barrier i a temporary barrier that keeps the invasive species out of the illinois river and lake michigan by emitting an ele ctric current that deters the carp from passing through
3083297 the great lakes basin program which gained renewed support in the farm bill is administered by the great lakes commission with funding provided by the u s department of agriculture natural resources conservation service the basin program supports improved erosion and sediment control and sound landuse practices through demonstration grants technical assistance and information education projects grant recipients include conservation districts and other nonfederal units of government nonprofit organizations and academic institutions in all eight states of the great lakes basin over the past 17 years the basin program has supported nearly 400 projects and invested almost 12 million in water quality improvement efforts these projects have prevented an estimated 250 000 tons of sediment and 900 000 pounds of phosphorus from entering the great lakes and tributaries sediment pollution covers spawning beds suffocates aquatic vegetation habitat and increases the cost of treating potable water and maintaining drainage infrastructure phosphorus pollution can lead to excess growth of plants and algae and rob lakes and river s of oxygen

3083300 our soldiers have fought hard in iraq for five years but the politicians in dc have still not established a clear strategy for success
3083301 rep mcnerney is one leader who fights for policies that will make americans safer and not just drain our wallets and send our sons and daughters into harms way
3083302 we make sure americans know how their representatives cast their votes on these life and death issues
3083303 ultimately its an active and vocal public that will determine if the country makes the profound changes in us foreign policy that we need

3083316 no tiene sentido que la sede de una mancomunidad de pueblos del interior de castell n y teruel est en un lugar que no sea estos municipios

3083322 today is my birthday and although i am not really excited about it i thought i should make it special by giving myself some responsibilities as a real adult
3083323 this confirms what many managers in the workforce are already keenly aware of there is an acute and growing need for more it professionals
3083324 with more and more businesses moving critical operational functions over to the network the it department is assuming a much more strategic role in the organization and needs its infrastructure to be designed implemented and maintained by highly skilled highly trained individuals
3083325 t here is a skill gap the difference between the supply of skilled workers and the demand for those skills represents a challenge for networking vendors and their clients and an opportunity for it professionals
3083326 the overall gap between supply and demand for networking professionals is about 8 percent of the total demand the good news is that the overall gap isnt getting any bigger the bad news is that in some specialties such as wireless networking the gap is large and in other segments such as network security the gap is growing very fast
3083327 we found out about it in the later stages of moving here
3083328 if it goes as planned they will be able to discharge the full amount to us without a problem

3083349 there certainly is a level of isi complicity in the militant areas in pakistan and organisations such as the taliban
3083350 i cant say to what level of leadership that goes to but there are indications of complicity on the part of isi to the extent that they are facilitating these militant groups that come out of the tribal areas in pakistan
3083351 unfortunately we see a higher number of non pashtun non afghanistan fighters this year than this time last year
3083352 they are really from a variety of ethnic groupings some are from areas in pakistan some are from places like chechnya some are from europe and some are from other arab countries
3083353 but when you have a problem of porous borders and fighters and weapons and resources and command and control and logistics being brought in from outside of afghanistan that adds a complicating context to the insurgency
3083354 we come with militaries that have advantages in command and control in speed in lethality in logistics in intelligence in all those things
3083355 if nations provide forces with restrictions what it does is it decreases those advantages
3083356 how fast we can get there i dont know but it is important that the international community remain committed to afghanistan
3083357 we are evaluating information collected during an investigation of a potential violation
3083358 since this action is pending i am unable to provide additional information epa will take appropriate action once the this review is completed

3083363 work alone is your proper business never the fruits it may produce
3083364 the move is welcome but it remains to be seen if its just another attempt to use indian symbols to spread christianity in areas like north india where the roots of culture run deep missionaries have often found it difficult to reach out to the masses with their philosophy
3083365 a selective approach is not proper accepting mirabai should mean accepting krishna and quoting from the upanishads should mean backing philosophies like advaita non duality is the church ready
3083366 by making it appear indian with references to hindu scriptures and great poets people will not come to the truth this is a complete turn back from the real bible
3083367 i am sure this bible made in india and for indians will bring the word of god closer to millions of our people not only christians
3083368 we have tried to root the bible in the culture of this country and have the permission of the local cardinals to print this all religions have some meeting ground and indology has been taught at catholic seminaries for decades one of the ncb scholars and rector of st pious seminary fr harold vaz says new editions of the bible have always had their critics there has been criticism of the bible from the time the first translations were made from greek to latin were open to having a dialogue with people who have been objecting so conflicting issues can be sorted out
3083369 no hubo una propuesta concreta y sta va a ser formalizada por las autoridades el d a 25 de agosto

3083371 estamos hartos de ser el piso salarial de la provincia lo hemos dicho hasta el cansancio y les manifestamos a las autoridades que hemos tenido absoluta paciencia
3083372 hemos estado un mes discutiendo y hoy nos vamos con una promesa de que probablemente en agosto haya una propuesta a adi no estamos de acuerdo con esperar hasta el 25 porque entendemos que la propuesta debi ser ya

3083380 a landmark in intellectual history which has attracted attention far beyond its own immediate field it is written with a combination of depth and clarity that make it an almost unbroken series of aphorisms kuhn does not permit truth to be a criterion of scientific theories he would presumably not claim his own theory to be true but if causing a revolution is the hallmark of a superior paradigm this book has been a resounding success
3083381 occasionally there emerges a book which has an influence far beyond its originally intended audience thomas kuhns the structure of scientific revolutions has clearly emerged as just such a work
3083382 the hundred most influential books since the second world war
3083383 structure has had a wider influence than any other book on the history of science
3083384 this is a wonderful place i will come back and visit it often

3083393 its one of those things where personally i like the long drawn out storylines
3083394 the buildups to big matches where triple h and i are the perfect example we had such a buildup for our match cena and i being in such a marquee match i really wish the buildup had been allowed
3083395 i think a match like that deserves the fans emotional investment its way too soon its just an attraction match and i think its more valuable than that i think its been wasted a little bit it will still be a hell of a match i just wish some more emotional investment put into the match right now i feel its more of an attraction something thats new and fresh
3083396 you hate to see anybody lose their jobs shannon moore is a real hard worker so is domino nick patrick left as well i didnt know that as far as i know he left a while ago he had a really bad back its just one of those things where they dont have anything for those guys and they leave a lot of guys sitting on the sidelines so they free them up so they can pursue other things the cool thing about the wwe is that youre always welcome back he was on such a roll before he left and he got really sick i think we have yet to see the best of the big daddy v character come into its own for a man of his size he is incredibly athletic

3083403 i dont see us going back east on back to back weekends any more
3083404 the economy has had an impact on every event in the country
3083405 its harder for teams to travel especially if theyre not organized and dont get flights early
3083406 its going to become more of a socioeconomic game than ever before
3083407 the kids who will get hurt are the kids who cant afford it
3083408 the economic crunch limits where we can go and what we can do
3083409 were fortunate there are a lot of tournaments in southern california but well spend a lot more time in the high school season watching games
3083410 team travel is down and their adjustments are affecting us
3083411 it makes sense for the club teams to go regional
3083412 but were still going to have to go to all the events
3083413 does it make sense to spend 5 000 for a summer
3083414 families can spend a lot of money going to the east and south
3083415 and theres less chance the girls will wind up there
3083416 youre just spending so much money to chase a dream that so few reach
3083417 the talent level in the bay area is good but its spread out
3083418 i didnt think she was going to get better and you have to get out of your comfort zone
3083419 i think its just not that great to jump on a plane for a couple games to play with players who may not run plays for you if the team has any plays for you
3083420 the cal stars were going to bring four teams to the end of the trail
3083421 i saw some of the editorials on the web and the shots were great classy and high fashion
3083422 there are so many reasons i wanted to buy it
3083423 mainly being a black woman its the rarity of something like this happening its significant and important a piece of history i wanted to own
3083424 it was one of our biggest magazine sellers ever we normally get about 20 and we placed five additional orders for 30 each time were ordering more today
3083425 we sold out our first shipment immediately we sold the second within two days we had 38 copies altogether weve been told we cant get any more but people are still asking
3083426 they were really really hard to find here in la because they sold out so fast
3083427 at borders on magnificent mile michigan avenue they said people were lined up outside the door on july 2 to get them
3083428 i thought the concept was great but i didnt want to just say that verbally i wanted to provide financial support as a business owner i know you have to support things you like with your money
3083429 as you know vogue has been criticized in the past for its infrequent use of black models both on the cover and inside maybe this is a declaration of a new day that will see more diversity in the magazine going forward
3083430 i actually contributed an essay to the now famed italian vogue issue in which i expressed ambivalence about what they were doing and i was happy that the editors there had no problem with it on the one hand its a beautiful issue on the other what happens next month but the mag has been quite successful at least in the states so perhaps other publications will take notice
3083431 were overwhelmingly white of thirty seven runway shows there 1 084 opportunities to send out a model and black models walked 14 times
3083432 whats really interesting is how many shows by big name italian designers had absolutely zero diversity
3083433 thats an interesting statistic milan has always had a dearth of black models
3083434 this last season prada infamously all white and very bland and considered the ringleader in the whiteout used the black british model jourdan dunn
3083435 the mix of models changes all the time so im wondering if that stat was based on the most recent shows
3083436 i think its fair to say theres a lack of representation on the runway in general but that statistic while its shocking is also extremely questionable
3083437 when you get into high fashion the assumption is that the majority of their target market cant afford to buy what theyre selling anyway so they can choose whoever they want to model
3083438 please give me a beating right here in the grocery store
3083439 i have called melissa several times to say how much i love her blog
3083440 the only way this blog would be better is if she dedicated 50 of the posts to affordable housing
3083441 not as good as beth spotswoods blog but i like it anyway
3083442 if you accept that the universe is infinite then that means theres an infinite amount of chances for things to happen right
3083443 well if theres an infinite amount of chances for something to happen then eventually it will happen no matter how small the likelihood
3083444 that means somewhere in space theres another planet that by an incredible series of coincidences developed exactly the same way as ours right down to the smallest detail
3083445 definitely and theres another which is exactly the same except that palm tree over there is two feet to the right and theres another where the tree is two feet to the left in fact therere infinite planets with infinite variations on that tree alone
3083446 then in one planet maybe i am a movie star
3083447 theres no maybe about it you live in beverly hills and swept last years oscars
3083448 yeah but dont forget somewhere else your film was a flop
3083449 it bombed the critics turned on you the studio lost a fortune and you got into booze and valium it was pretty ugly

3083466 theres a variety of tactics that employers have been employing over the last three to six years that has had an impact on the market
3083467 pretty much every employer has to do something or is doing something in an effort to bring that number down
3083468 it is encouraging that the growth in healthcare costs is going down but there is still more work to be done
3083469 when costs go up as great as this theres a lot of market pressure brought to bear on all of the parts of the market to bring those costs down and i think thats whats been happening over the last six years or so

3083474 at the centre of this torrent of money lie the pioneers and rangers formed by four family friends in 1998 when bush was still governor of texas they have grown into a nationwide network of influence with its different levels the aim is to make top donors compete for influence when you do that the sky is really the limit they give more and more but in the end it is all just gravy for the bush train said andrew wheat director of texans for public justice a group that monitors the network the industries the network spans are also tightly knit almost 20 per cent of the elite donors come from the world of finance while 18 per cent are lawyers and lobbyists
3083475 john mccains claim that hell put jobs first is laughable in light of his history of putting his lobbyist friends ahead of americas workers at every turn
3083476 after seven years of a republican president who puts his special interest friends ahead of americas working families americans simply cannot afford job killing johns promise of more of the same

3083486 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3083487 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3083488 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3083489 i wasnt saying i was better than jay z as a person or rock was greater than hip hop as a thing or whatever it is
3083490 i said what i said and it was wrong or it was taken wrong and now all this
3083491 im sorry but jay z no chance glastonbury has a tradition of guitar music im not having hip hop at glastonbury its wrong
3083492 that bloke from oasis said i cant play guitar somebody should have told him im a fucking roc star
3083493 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3083494 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3083495 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3083496 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3083497 we think alpina is a really exciting line and were proud to have it in our store

3083509 where were you give back to the lexicon all the words you offered me and let the sleepers sleep without phantoms in their dreams
3083510 why search beyond the horizon for the eternal virgins we loved life on earth between the fig and the pine trees but we couldnt find our way even there we searched until we gave life all we owned the purple blood in our veins

3083513 we can expect further gains today after u s stocks ended higher helped by lower oil prices
3083514 exporters are likely to benefit from a softer yen and the u s economic outlook due to a fall in oil prices the downturn in oil prices is likely to continue and that is positive for the stock market

3083525 we believe it surpasses the number found in the caribbeans silver banks region which is usually listed as one of the worlds main humpback whale nursery grounds
3083526 we are now right in the middle of the whale season in the kimberley

3083528 i have the simplest tastes i am always satisfied with the best
3083529 one of the main reasons we originally moved into the x86 processor business was because we believed that ultimately the third party chipset market would disappear and we would need to have the capability to provide a complete platform intel provides the vast majority of chipsets for its processors and following its purchase of ati amd is also moving very quickly in the same direction

3083531 many many people are at risk due to family history age genetic characteristics but we dont have a good prediction formula for who will actually get the disease

3083537 families are trusting the security forces and reporting these incidents
3083538 its because of the impunity given to these warlords for such a long period of time
3083539 these days all these young girls are going to school and coming out of their houses these criminals chase after them
3083540 this is like a revolt against the warlords by my family

3083542 understanding how elephants and other animal populations react to droughts will be a central component of wildlife management and conservation
3083543 our findings seem to support the hypothesis that older females with knowledge of distant resources become crucial to the survival of herds during periods of extreme climatic events
3083544 its enticing to think that these old females and their memories of previous periods of trauma and survival would have meant all the difference the data seem to support the speculation that the matriarchs with the necessary experience of such events were able to lead their groups to drought refugia
3083545 climate change is expected to lead to a higher occurrence of severe drought in africa and our study suggests that such extreme climatic events may act as a selection force on animal populations
3083546 my opponent in the primary commissioner john stephen when he was commissioner of the health and human services routinely underpaid the required state portion of the cost of nursing homes
3083547 as we all know the 4 400 new hampshire seniors that are in nursing homes today in order to keep the doors open someone else had to pay the bills and that somebody else was has all of these folks will attest to here today are property tax payers
3083548 facts are troubling things and jeb bradley should work on getting his facts straight
3083549 in 2003 the county reimbursement was 69 million and in 2007 when john stephen left hhs the reimbursement was 83 8 million thats a 20 percent increase and thats not a cost shift
3083550 when this news first fluttered across the screen a few months back i thought those bastards
3083551 negotiations with shell to sign a deal to process oil shale in jordan are nearing an end
3083552 if our plans succeed it would be one of the countrys largest projects to help the jordan become energy self sufficient with a possibility to export oil in the future
3083553 i thought a special day just for this type of activity would be the best
3083554 people should call in well rather than call in sick that day

3083572 gives iphone a justifiable claim to being a viable gaming platform
3083573 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
3083574 continued aggression against georgia and especially an escalation of the conflict beyond south ossetia will only serve to damage russias international reputation and its relations with countries across the globe
3083575 however we are far from asking for military assistance our aim is to end the madness not to add to it
3083576 its really important that new students feel happy with where theyre living in the first year at university the roof over a freshers head can have a really big impact on studies and social life
3083577 i decided to live in halls during my first year at uni and i loved it i chose university owned accommodation mainly because of the price and the nearby facilities
3083578 my mum was keen for me to go to university and preferred the idea of me living in halls because it would allow me to lead an independent lifestyle in oxford i think i made the right decision because i really enjoyed my first year
3083579 regardless of who runs or owns your accommodation they should be signed up to codes of practice
3083580 this means the accommodation should meet certain physical and management standards and will give you an avenue to complain should it not meet those standards
3083581 going off to university is a huge deal and i want it to be a memorable and happy experience
3083582 i chose the unite property because i wanted to be in the heart of londons social scene and i think you get a lot for your money security is a key factor especially the cctv concierge and swipe card entry to all buildings i like to know that i am safe
3083583 drottning amp m stare ja hahha det trodde jag ox att jag var p vattenskidor innan
3083584 the sea ice is becoming more vulnerable to further retreat as ice thickness is very uniform over large regions and ice reduction can be very fast once a certain threshold thickness is reached
3083585 the faster ice motion is due to changes in atmospheric circulation patterns the independent thinning is due to increased oceanic and atmospheric heat fluxes and it is likely those atmospheric heat fluxes like higher air temperature and increased infrared radiation are the major causes
3083586 sarah was not self protective she gave no pretense of being the model christian wife and mother and yet in so many ways she was the god given model who showed me that being a christian means that we do not hide we do not hide our faith we do not hide our personality we do not hide our sin we do not hide our fears we do not hide our weaknesses we do not hide our gifts we are an exposed people
3083587 so i figured this was one opportunity in all my career to do that

3083596 is a harassment policy that is so vaguely worded and so broad in its language that really university administrators were able to punish any sort of speech that they deemed offensive and mr dejohn was troubled by that and felt he couldnt really express his opinions in class and with his friends and so he felt it was really important to challenge this policy and get it overturned
3083597 universities are supposed to be the marketplace of ideas but speech codes like the one that was enforced at temple stifle student speech and really are a danger to christian and conservative students on campus and the center for academic freedom is here to represent them and protect their rights to speak and to proclaim the gospel

3083618 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan
3083619 the only result of the use of airstrikes is the killing of civilians this is not the way to wage the fight against terrorism
3083620 the eu grand strategy is to develop georgia as an alternative route for caspian oil and gas by bypassing russia
3083621 but if georgia is no longer a safe passageway then all of these schemes for diminished dependency on russia go up in smoke
3083622 the first significant break in russias previous monopoly control over all oil and natural gas from the caspian sea states
3083623 azerbaijan and georgia for example rely on this pipeline for the political independence they often act out
3083624 an alternative pathway for the flow of caspian oil and gas to the west
3083625 georgia has been one of the leading recipients of u s military aid ever since
3083626 this of course infuriated the russians and they determined to try to curb georgias ties to the west in any way they possibly could
3083627 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3083628 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3083629 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3083630 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3083631 the georgians say it is their land where is our land then

3083636 jason finished the race better than we could have asked for
3083637 but we think about that more than michael does he just takes it one race at a time
3083638 i knew i had to accelerate but it got harder
3083639 at the end you could see i was pretty excited i was very emotional
3083640 i was hoping to be ahead but i never lost hope said lezak
3083641 i dont know how i was able to take it back that fast because ive never been able to come anywhere near that for the last 50 meters
3083642 i feel like i should have gotten my hand on the wall first
3083643 i gave it everything i had possible but she got me in the end
3083644 i would be baffled if you do not say that was perfect
3083645 time is something to be smashed anytime but at the moment that i marked 58 seconds i probably should have been happier
3083646 now i have to go and take care of myself tonight because tomorrow its going to be a tight race
3083647 the goal is so much bigger than just one game
3083648 we have the goal of taking home the gold so were never going to slack off especially not on purpose the score doesnt matter we dont care about the margin
3083649 the disciplinary commission this morning monday has ruled that she will be excluded from the games her accreditation has been cancelled and withdrawn
3083650 the ioc means business in stamping out those who are not playing by the rules
3083651 its the one tournament i base my year around so i hope i can play well here
3083652 it would mean as much as winning a grand slam ive won so many grand slams and the olympics only comes around every four years i love playing for my country so this is a great start
3083653 for sure hes one of the best players in the world
3083654 but he is not playing all the time so for that reason his ranking is not in the top positions
3083655 i felt like i should have today off but it was a good practice i wanted to go to the market today but we have to play so many matches 14 matches singles and doubles in six days so its tough
3083656 they have underlined to us that all athletes compete here in the right spirit against athletes of any nationality we take both the athlete and the national olympic committee at their word on this
3083657 myth the government of iran also denies the validity of the israeli nation
3083658 they have a long and prosperous career ahead of them
3083659 i didnt expect to do this well i wasnt even supposed to get on the olympic team my goal was 2012
3083660 my craving for the gold was much more than last time for quite a long time i felt melancholy and had complex feelings
3083661 my craving for the gold was much more than last time for quite a long time i felt melancholy and had complex feelings
3083662 my hamstring is 100 percent now it took about four weeks for it to get fully recovered
3083663 ive basically been getting rehab on it and doing some light training in the process
3083664 id rather be a 100 percent coming into the olympics than risk being 85 percent going to a meet just to see where im at
3083665 i had a few chances in practice to see where im at and that kind of gave me a confidence booster
3083666 during the competition i heard the voice of the president of the korean archery federation in the crowd
3083667 and it gave me great strength back in korea he nicknamed me butter because im so smooth and relaxed
3083668 for those who are not strong psychologically the cheering from the spectators may make them afraid of letting them down
3083669 but for those psychologically mature athletes it will be the best encouragement
3083670 it wasnt easy its the olympics and nobody mellows out
3083671 it was a push the whole way but thats how i like it
3083672 they have been saying how much china has improved and it showed today
3083673 im not pleased although i had a great second run
3083674 this is my first olympics so i now have a foundation to build on
3083675 for those who are not strong psychologically the cheering from the spectators may make them afraid of letting them down
3083676 but for those psychologically mature athletes it will be the best encouragement
3083677 we didnt play very well in our reception and that stopped our attacking force
3083678 we didnt serve well to put pressure on our opponent

3083680 never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed people can change the world
3083681 even when we were dead in trespasses made us alive together with christ
3083682 though now you do not see him yet believing you rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory receiving the salvation of your souls
3083683 therefore my beloved as you have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence with fear and trembling
3083684 and do this knowing the time that now it is high time to awake out of sleep for now
3083685 if anyones work is burned he will suffer loss but he himself will be saved yet so as through fire
3083686 deliver such a one to satan for the destruction of the flesh that his spirit may be saved in the day of the lord jesus
3083687 salvation is a process which begins when a person first becomes a christian which continues through the rest of his life and which concludes on the last day
3083688 i have been saved i am being saved and i will be saved
3083689 in him we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace
3083690 he has delivered us from the power of darkness and translated us into the kingdom of the son of his love in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins
3083691 now when these things begin to happen look up and lift up your heads because your redemption draws near
3083692 and not only they but we also who have the firstfruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves eagerly waiting for the redemption of our body
3083693 is the guarantee of our inheritance of the purchased possession to the praise of his glory
3083694 and do not grieve the holy spirit of god by whom
3083695 in him we have the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace
3083696 and be kind to one another tenderhearted forgiving one another just as god in christ also forgave you
3083697 bearing with one another and forgiving one another if anyone has a complaint against another even as christ forgave you so you also must do
3083698 and forgive us our debts present tense as we forgive our debtors
3083699 and the prayer of faith will save the sick and the lord will raise him up and if he has committed sins he will be forgiven
3083700 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
3083701 and such were some of you but you were washed but you were sanctified but you were justified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god
3083702 of how much worse punishment do you suppose will he be thought worthy who has trampled the son of god underfoot counted the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing and insulted the spirit of grace
3083703 finally then brethren we urge and exhort in the lord jesus that you should abound more and more just as you received from us how you ought to walk and to please god
3083704 now may the god of peace himself sanctify you completely and may your whole spirit soul and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our lord jesus christ
3083705 for by one offering he has perfected forever those who
3083706 therefore having been justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ through whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand
3083707 much more then having now been justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him
3083708 and such were some of you but you were washed but you were sanctified but you were justified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god
3083709 believed god and it was reckoned to him as righteousness
3083710 by faith abraham obeyed when he was called to set out for a place that he was to receive as an inheritance not knowing where he was going
3083711 when he was called to go out to the place he would afterward receive
3083712 was not our ancestor abraham justified by works when he offered his son isaac on the altar you see that faith was active along with his works and faith was brought to completion by the works thus the scripture was fulfilled that says abraham believed god and it was reckoned to him as righteousness and he was called the friend of god
3083713 w as not our ancestor abraham justified when he offered his son isaac on the altar
3083714 therefore by the deeds of the law no flesh will be justified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin
3083715 the metaphor in the psalm is of a servant being called to account before his master but in the context here in romans the imagery of final judgement is to the fore
3083716 luther uses the terms to justify and justification in more than one sense from the beginning of luthers writings justification most often means the judgement of god with which he declares man to be righteous in other places however the word stands for the entire event though which a man is essentially made righteous a usage which luther also finds in paul romans 5 that is for both the imputation of righteousness to man as well as mans actually becoming righteous justification in this sense remains incomplete on earth and is first completed on the last day complete righteousness is in this sense is an eschatological reality this twofold use of the word cannot be correlated with luthers early and later theology he uses justification in both senses at the same time sometimes shortly after each other in the same text
3083717 for we understand that a man who is justified is not already righteous but moving toward righteousness our justification is not yet complete it is still under construction it shall however be completed in the resurrection of the dead

3083730 because americas relations with a host of countries are intricately tied to fannie and freddie
3083731 americans future ability to gain access to credit if foreign companies and governments abandon united states investments home auto and credit card loans will be much more difficult to come by
3083732 trouble at fannie mae and freddie mac stirs concern abroad
3083733 this is their financial system they had demanded paper money federally insured bank deposits and a heavy governmental hand in the distribution of credit and now they have them the populist party might have lost the elections in the hard times of the 1890s but it won the future they got their government controlled money the federal reserve opened for business in 1914 and their government directed credit fannie mae and freddie mac in 1971 they got their pure paper dollar so today the fed can print all the dollars it deems expedient and the unwell federal mortgage giants fannie mae and freddie mac combine to dominate the business of mortgage origination
3083734 we say in our platform that we believe that the right to coin money and issue money is a function of government those who are opposed to this proposition tell us that the issue of paper money is a function of the bank and that the government ought to go out of the banking business i stand with jefferson and tell them as he did that the issue of money is a function of the government and that the banks should go out of the governing business w hen we have restored the money of the constitution all other necessary reforms will be possible and until that is done there is no reform that can be accomplished
3083735 the right of the government to issue money is not surrendered to the banks the control over the money so issued is not relinquished by the government
3083736 the federal reserve board can cause the pendulum of a rising and falling market to swing gently back and forth by slight changes in the discount rate or cause violent fluctuations by greater rate variation and in either case it will possess inside information as to financial conditions and advance knowledge of the coming change either up or down
3083737 this is the strangest most dangerous advantage ever placed in the hands of a special privilege class by any government that ever existed
3083738 some people think that the federal reserve banks are united states government institutions
3083739 these twelve private credit monopolies were deceitfully and disloyally foisted upon this country by the bankers who came here from europe and repaid us our hospitality by undermining our american institutions
3083740 the number of advances wasnt increasing exponentially i hadnt seen as many as i had expected not in any particular area just generally
3083741 that the average individual innovator is having a smaller and smaller impact
3083742 i am in two minds about this biologists have abandoned the idea of progress we just are where we are but humanity is so far in advance of anything that has gone before that it seems to be a qualitative leap
3083743 and i increasingly am persuaded that it is then we will have the technology to deal with it
3083744 torture is a matter that has always been unacceptable beyond discussion lets not pretend those days are passed we now have ticking bomb terrorists and its an empirical fact that every civilised democracy would use torture in those circumstances
3083745 terrorism is a major step backwards in civilisation hitler was a major step backwards sometimes we have to step backwards too to combat such things but progress happens in other areas a generation now growing up may have to accept more security measures and less privacy but in other areas like sexual conduct we are making progress i dont think overall we are making a step back
3083746 the implications are mind blowing civilisation faces the sharpest and perhaps most violent dislocation in recent history
3083747 market based panic will within a few days drive prices skyward

3083750 the following thought experiment frames the problem before us and the essential needs a planetary system of living economies must address
3083751 one morning all six billion wake up with a new awareness their planet is actually a living space ship with a biologically based life support system so overstressed that it is on the verge of collapse
3083752 a few decide to arm themselves kill off as many of their rivals as possible and attempt to secure what they can for themselves
3083753 there is desperate need for a solution that works for all
3083754 the essentials come quickly to mind there must be an immediate reordering of priorities the use of every resource must be optimized to assure the health and physical security of every person with minimal waste the life support system must be restored to full function as quickly as possible everything must be recycled with no release of toxics into the environment there will be no luxuries for the few until the basic needs of all are adequately met

3083780 the only ones left with any confidence at all are the new dumb it is the beginning of the end of our world as we knew it doom is the operative ethic
3083781 we are committed to tackling knife crime and getting knives off our streets we have introduced tough laws including increasing the minimum age at which someone can be sold a knife from 16 to 18 and penalties for shopkeepers who do break the law
3083782 knife crime is a complex issue which we all need to work together to solve enforcement action is one part of the solution and that is why i am today calling on our partners in the police and trading standards to get tough with anyone illegally selling knives to under 18s i want to see more test purchasing operations like those being undertaken in birmingham to catch any unscrupulous retailers
3083783 for some time police forces have been working closely with trading standards to address the illegal sale of knives to young people
3083784 police forces are determined to make inroads into stamping out knife crime and getting weapons off our streets but this cannot be down to police alone retailers must take responsibility for their actions too
3083785 operations such as this are considered good practice in tackling unscrupulous and irresponsible shop keepers who are willing to sell knives to young people with the full knowledge that these may then go on to be used as weapons
3083786 council trading standards teams are already taking a tough stance on shops selling knives to children and carry out regular checks to make sure retailers arent breaking the law
3083787 the legal age for buying a knife was raised from 16 to 18 last year and its important that retailers understand the implications of breaking the law councils arent trying to hoodwink retailers and will only use volunteers who look under 18 there is simply no excuse for selling knives to children and retailers must accept their share of responsibility if we are to keep our streets and our young people safe and free of knives

3083795 it is clearly a very upsetting event that has led to indiscriminate market selling and russias perception in the west will suffer as a result
3083796 however it has no significant impact on russias economic fundamentals and corporate earnings and at the end of the day we firmly believe this is what ultimately drives the markets rather then emotions and swings in investor sentiment
3083797 this conflict will have a negligible effect on the russian economy

3083849 its because of the impunity given to these warlords for such a long period of time
3083850 these days all these young girls are going to school and coming out of their houses these criminals chase after them
3083851 this is like a revolt against the warlords by my family
3083852 i see a face a figure a picture or a location and something detonates inside me
3083853 an idea sparks and im compelled to go with it i know im on the right track when it becomes impossible to express in words what i hope to convey on paper but ultimately its the light that grabs me my attraction to this subject was her eyes perfect light and intense expressive eyes my hope was to create a charcoal interpretation of the subject that the viewer would find difficult to look away from compelling tangible emotion
3083854 although i enjoy working from life more than from photos there are many instances where working from life is not possible
3083855 personally i believe that you should only work from photos if you understand the limitations of photography
3083856 the look in her eyes was one of those elusive momentary expressions that are very difficult if not impossible to capture from life
3083857 i like to get the eyes and the surrounding area to a nearly completed state because it generally provides me with the range of values i stick with for the remainder of the drawing
3083858 it helps prevent smearing and gives me the ability to view the work in progress from a distance which i find essential
3083859 i am drawn to subjects with whom i feel some type of emotional connection
3083860 i love the textures that are an inherent part of the western lifestyle lined faces worn leather a horses mane or a denim jacket to name a few for whiskey mountain cowboy i was captivated by the tired but thoughtful quality of the cowboys downcast profile
3083861 i knew from experience that the challenges of sitting would probably be too great for such a young subject let alone the dog
3083862 so i took many digital images and adjusted them in photoshop i then drew from the computer screen using photoshop to compensate for the limitations of the photographs
3083863 i have a deep sense of the limitations of my ability to express the vitality and beauty of what i see and i always say a private prayer that my work may come up to my own standards
3083864 i wish to create something that may be appreciated by others both now and in the future
3083865 we went together to pick out clothes and accessories for the drawing
3083866 including the models opinions on accessories contributed to the success of this work
3083867 you can create a very dark tone by applying pencil and charcoal to it numerous times its also appropriate for my drawing style because i like to create many subtle tones and shades in addition to making sure a drawing has the right proportion size perspective space and texture i often seek to present the same richness of color and texture of an oil painting only in black and white
3083868 i pay attention to details but do not necessarily depict every single thing in great detail
3083869 rather i feel the rhythms in details and then translate them to a variety of strokes to bring the work to life
3083870 after i am comfortable with the placement i like to start in a focal area and establish my darkest dark
3083871 this gives me a full value range to work with from my darkest dark to the light value of the paper next i bring the focal spot near to completion which gives me a way to judge the rest of the drawing then its about putting in the hours to get the drawing finished
3083872 you might get a hand that looks great in one photo and a head tilt or something in another
3083873 i pick and chose which elements to include and which to leave out however i think that working from life is crucial to filling in the blanks when using photos photos tend to flatten the subject matter i rely on my experience with life drawing to better describe an area in a photo that may not be clear
3083874 i was thinking about the artists role in bringing life back from the dead sympathy and curiosity made me want to breathe life into a collection of inanimate objects i think i succeeded if just for a little while
3083875 i believe that working from life gives me greater freedom to explore the dynamic between the way i see my subject and its actual appearance
3083876 sometimes i will use a photograph the way i would use a map to point me in the direction i need to go
3083877 i took this drawing a lot farther than i had originally intended
3083878 it was going to be a preliminary study for a painting but i sort of got sucked into the process and kept going with it
3083879 ill hold my pencil way at the back to get a very light touch and very slowly build up my lights and darks almost like glazes on a painting
3083880 also i sharpen my pencil into a very long sharp point so that its almost like working with a brush this way i can work with it at different angles than i could with a shorter blunter point
3083881 the more i work directly from life the more im able to see the limitations of photographs
3083882 that being said anyone whos ever had a pet rat knows that you cant get them to sit still for a second normally i would be tempted to find a taxidermy specimen to work from but since this was meant to be a portrait of my pet rat and not just any rat i drew him from a photo i drew myself just looking in the mirror with no photographic aid which is the way i prefer to work
3083883 carla who was one of my students at the time is strikingly beautiful
3083884 i purposely posed her so that her beautiful neckline and the thrust of her head became part of the composition acting as counterpoint to the soft backward sweep of her hair
3083885 i try to focus on the large planes of the form even as i try to articulate the beautifully subtle passages revealed by the play of light over the form
3083886 if the foundation is strong and you keep reading the drawing as a whole squinting to make sure your values are in the proper place you can add the details without making the drawing look fussy or broken up i need to work with freedom moving things around simplifying and then restating rather than working carefully without much erasing
3083887 i used a stump in the shadow masses to unify the value and to simplify areas that i had overdeveloped going back over areas with the cont pencil to rearticulate them
3083888 i think that mood and quiet feeling are achieved through the quality of light and the subtlety of the edges
3083889 in addition the models pose and gesture are important to help create a feeling of elegance
3083890 the ideal situation is to work from life but thats not always possible
3083891 i think a good approach is to begin a study from life then finish it later from a photograph
3083892 you can only go so dark with graphite before it leaves an undesirable sheen and glare on your drawing
3083893 but i kept the charcoal to a minimum so as not to take away from the overall simplicity of the study
3083894 i push the medium of watercolor to create paintings that are perhaps richer and denser than one would normally expect from a watercolor painting
3083895 i often hear viewers comment that my watercolors look like real paintings
3083896 i can only imagine that this is because they expect watercolors to be more subtle and light and mine are usually not i find this amusing because i have always thought that watercolors were real paintings
3083897 i choose things that have evidence of wear and tear that evoke a sense of the passage of time
3083898 when setting up a still life i usually start with one object that inspires me and then arrange things with it until i am satisfied with the composition which can take a long time
3083899 i do not set up the still life in the studio because while the studio light is great to work in it is not the kind of light that inspires me
3083900 i do this so i can paint freely through those areas of white instead of dancing around them
3083901 i find that no white paint can ever have the luminosity that the white of the surface has
3083902 i bought it just because i loved the blue color and the rusted surface
3083903 i found the tiles at a local closeout sale and the heirloom tomatoes at a farmers market i love how colorful and varied they are i wanted to paint the can and the tomatoes and tiles complemented it
3083904 which has great light flooding in at various times of the day
3083905 my husband is also an artist and our house and studios are intermixed
3083906 the art often overflows into other areas of the house and our home life overflows into our studios
3083907 i start every watercolor painting with a very light graphite sketch to make sure i get the proportions right
3083908 composition value relationships and color harmony are the basis for my approach and define my process
3083909 i also make a value sketch to lock in the relationships and make sure that the painting has movement and then i choose my color palette
3083910 pouring washes enables me to mix wonderful and spontaneous colors on the paper
3083911 finally i respond to what is happening on the paper and work to bring the painting to resolution
3083912 i love the sights sounds colors and textures of farmers markets and find that early morning is the best time for beautiful light and shadows
3083913 i was struck by the way the light described the forms of the onions and bok choy and i used negative space painting to create that effect the colors of the market are always inspiring and in this case i liked the complementary color scheme the shadows also played well in the composition and helped create movement through the piece
3083914 there are usually dozens of boats anchored there during boating season framed by a rocky coastline and lapping waves in the foreground
3083915 in this picture i wanted to capture the feeling and mood of the day a balmy sunny summer day with a slight fog hovering over the area i attempted to re create the delicate coloring of the water and sky and the soft warm lights reflecting in the clouds i incorporated a number of experimental layered drybrushing effects in the rocks as well as multiple glazes until the texture felt right to me yet still maintained a sense of mass and solidity boats is one of four watercolors in a series each depicting a different aspect of this peninsula and what makes it unique
3083916 this approach helps me become familiar with my subject and plan for spontaneity
3083917 i get to a point where i will depart from painting just what i see in front of me and begin to paint how i feel about what i see i then work from memory and intuition trying to express what is important to me i dont want simply to record things like the eye of a camera but rather with the heart of a poet and the artists eye that god gave me
3083918 the prickly pear cactus manages to flourish under the most difficult of circumstances in this case seemingly forcing its way through solid rock
3083919 it is always important to vary the edges from soft to hard in order to integrate your focal point with the background and to avoid making the subject look like a cardboard cutout
3083920 found still life based on various pieces and parts from a storefront window
3083921 we came upon the windows of the fleur de paris vintage hat shop and i challenged each artist to create a composition from what we saw
3083922 because it was nighttime the lighting was entirely artificial much of it came from inside the store but some was reflected from nearby streetlights
3083923 the materials i used are old favorites arches 260 lb cold pressed watercolor paper and winsor amp newton transparent watercolors
3083924 my approach to the painting was to layer very thin washes i am willing to spend whatever time and find whatever patience is necessary to make every painting work for me
3083925 this combination produces a rich depth of glazed color along with an interesting surface quality
3083926 i was inspired by the contrast of the ragged cornstalks against the dark forest background
3083927 by the fall the garden gets neglected and the weeds compete with the remaining vegetables this makes for an interesting albeit untidy scene
3083928 my primary subjects are the magnificent landscapes and seascapes of cape cod massachusetts
3083929 i am always mesmerized by the beauty and power of the ocean
3083930 the crashing waves the shifting tides the morning light the flickering dance of a million stars on a perfect moonlit night each element is a miracle to behold in back to the sea i tried to capture in microcosm the essence of the oceans energy the small rivulet of water erodes the sand pushing the water into small tributaries that eventually fall back to the sea
3083931 this same process has shaped the contours of the earth since time began
3083932 but once i do its usually the first thing on my mind when i open my eyes in the morning and remains the focus of my attention until the day i finish the painting
3083933 sometimes i get lucky and produce that one perfect shot but most times i utilize a montage of photos to inspire the right composition
3083934 this part of the process is critical for me for if i plan to spend days living breathing and dreaming about my work i need to connect with it from the start
3083935 this process allows the whites and light values to jump out and act as a roadmap for masking and painting
3083936 i look for a striking abstract design within a realistic framework usually a still life subject and often just one object with dramatic lighting
3083937 after painting a pale ghost of the entire subject to establish the form i then build up colors and shading with many layers
3083938 i may glaze over an area many times charging the wet surface with several colors that mingle on the paper after this colorful underpainting i apply more and more glazes to build up the shading and then apply details i never use black paint but instead mix up several pigments to make a saturated wash
3083939 i saw an amazing glow through the loose onion skin and an elongated shadow full of reflected color and light and knew i had to paint it
3083940 i felt a dark background would add drama so i added an edge to separate the two extreme values
3083941 it took several layers to achieve the dark value i wanted
3083942 growing up watching my dad chronicling the dying south with his paintings i am naturally drawn to the same subject matter in my watercolors
3083943 highlands was my childhood home in the early 1970s and i have always loved the blue ridge mountains particularly the dogwood trees
3083944 i remember the dogwood blooms would sometimes stay until the first of summer when i was 7 i would run through our front yard in sock feet swat the gnats with a frisbee and watch the sun pierce through the evergreens and light up the blossoms
3083945 i try to visualize the finished work from the very onset rather than let the work evolve although sometimes it has a mind of its own
3083946 i approach a watercolor as a planned sculpture of many layers
3083947 my colors are more intense and warmer this creates the depth i need to call attention to my subject
3083948 nobody wants to be in a sinking ship they want to be on the right side at this crucial moment
3083949 we remain close allies in the war on terror and will continue our close ties with the democratically elected government of pakistan
3083950 i took the risk and came out of twice bombed mamund because even though we were spared in the bombing we may starve as no supply is coming up there
3083951 the cbf is unaware of the matter the news reached us through the media we want to be left in peace at least for a day one day they criticize our shirt the next day they talk about the player i dont know whatll come next
3083952 he is here with us and has played in two games
3083953 the fact is that officially the cbf has not been informed of anything
3083954 the cbf always abides by the rules established by fifa and it will abide by any fifa decision on the rafinha case
3083955 it is a fundamental issue and we cannot be treated this way

3083959 i use broad as a moniker of respect for a woman who knows how to throw a mean right
3083960 conversation is the art of never appearing a bore of knowing how to say everything interestingly to entertain with no matter what to be charming with nothing at all
3083961 etiquette is for those without manners in the same way that fashion is for those without style
3083962 let there be no doubt in your minds that the dominant political forces at work in pakistan today are competing to appease and please the modern crusaders in the white house and are working to destabilize this nuclear capable nation under the aegis of america
3083963 pervez has insulted and compromised pakistans sovereignty by allowing the cia and the fbi to operate freely in pakistan and arrest interrogate torture deport and detain any person whether pakistani or not for as long as they like thus turning the pakistani army and security agencies into hunting dogs in the contemporary crusade

3083978 i just wanted to get into the finals and thats all i did it doesnt matter until the finals as long as you have a lane it doesnt matter where you are
3083979 i really thought theres no way and then i changed and i said you know what that is ridiculous this is the olympics and im here for the united states of america i dont care how bad it hurts in like five seconds i was thinking all these things i just got a supercharge and took it from there
3083980 i was watching michael phelps after the anchor leg touched
3083981 the whole thing is genuine thats the good thing about the olympics
3083982 but i dont think that alain lost the race its lezak who won it
3083983 jason is the most phenomenal closer ive ever seen in my life
3083984 hes been able to get his hand on the wall from behind from ahead it doesnt matter
3083985 he was just a part of it and we were a part of it whether he wins eight gold medals or not it wasnt going to be our responsibility for that to happen

3084007 russias catherine the great annexed crimea from ukraine in 1783 in the mid 19th century crimea served as the battlefield for britain france and other allies to fight russia soviet leader nikita s khrushchev gave crimea back to ukraine in 1954
3084008 we should be very firm that this response on the part of russia is disproportionate to whatever the level of violence was before it is way out of line in terms of what the violence was it has to be condemned and the world needs to stand against it
3084009 we could do two things number one is stand with the europeans weve got to stand together with european allies
3084010 secondly theres a real danger of a broader regional conflict here because if those russian ships leave that port in the black sea and if ukraine decides that it is not going to allow those ships back into that port because ukraine has always claimed that as ukrainian territory that is a potentially much greater conflagration involving a wider regional area

3084014 wishes to place on record that no less than 90 of the communications that he receives from stockholders relate to postings that stockholders have read on internet message forums there is absolutely no doubt that a number of parties are desperately trying to cause this company and its stockholders great damage all of which is both sickening and despicable
3084015 that this company will under his leadership continue to honor its promises to its stockholders be as open and transparent with stockholders as is permitted by law and that should stockholders be concerned over what they read on these message boards they should check the facts with himself prior to acting on these postings
3084016 that he has remained detached from and will not be drawn into this murky world that exists on these internet message boards with these so called paid bashers and their barrage of personal attacks and despite stockholder requests to the contrary he will no longer discuss this issue with his stockholders in any further announcements whatsoever
3084017 he was eternally grateful to the very many loyal stockholders who have been and continue to support both himself and the company

3084022 in november 2006 the chief of the australian defence force angus houston called me in sinai he said do not do anything that would pit my soldiers against yours
3084023 on the defence i agree we screwed up for the goals although i thought craddock was far worse than stearman and hennessey still doesnt command is area at all especially on set pieces
3084024 giving stack man of the match was an odd choice i think he played well but he only stopped the ball going in the net which is at the end of the day the role of the goalkeeper i cant remember any stunning saves from him just a few good ones

3084031 how blacks and whites together destroyed the promise of the civil rights era
3084032 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
3084033 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
3084034 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
3084035 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
3084036 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
3084037 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury to do everything i can to help out but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
3084038 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities in balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
3084039 the office of national drug control policy reports that abuse of prescription drugs among teens and young adults is increasing abuse of prescription pain killers now ranks second to marijuana as the nations most prevalent illegal drug problem

3084057 not everybody needs it and those who do dont all require the same dosage
3084058 could no longer work comfortably fighting three levels of oppression
3084059 for the last two and a half months i have been fighting three levels of oppression which were stifling my ideas and productivity and it just came to a head where i wasnt able to function and give of my all
3084060 i opted to resign rather than allow myself and the qeh further negative publicity over this issue
3084061 i was offered the job in december 2007 and given a specimen contract which had no probation period a contract was produced six months later with a probation period but before that there were irregularities at the qeh which i questioned
3084062 they seem to feel that there is a political emphasis in all of this i have no political affiliations or bias i have always kept away from politics and when i saw it raise its head to a political level i knew something was going wrong
3084063 you have people working in an institution fighting against people who are trying to make it better i was a senior person in the hospital and i did not like how i was treated in the public domain something was wrong with that
3084064 it really hurts to see how my work and how i sacrificed so much now being reduced to this level for the past 19 years i have been there i came through the ranks i have never done anything else but hospital business and health related matters although others seem to think differently
3084065 i planned all along to give back i have only worked in a public institution i do feel very hurt and very disappointed to the point of depression
3084066 you know what i want to see him first before i make any judgment there

3084069 quite a few of the players know the situation and have been in communication with andrews
3084070 hes got some guys here that really care about him

3084074 according to state government records 120 million out of 200 million children between 6 to 14 years go to school in west bengal but if we consider the huge number of drop outs the figure stands at around 60 million
3084075 we are talking about increasing the quality of students in west bengal but the quantity of students and condition of schools and education is so poor in rural and semi urban areas that no development can take place unless the government intervenes
3084076 in most rural schools the teacher student ratio is 1 80 many of the schools are one roomed besides the poor infrastructure students have to go without drinking water and toilet facilities in most places
3084077 there is no difference between the salary in rural and urban schools though teachers dont directly refuse to go to remote areas they apply for transfers within a few months maximum tenure of a teacher from kolkata posted in a village school is three years

3084082 bbc3 wants to be a young persons channel and they think the way to do that is to be as risky as they can i just never ever watch bbc3 i dont think it is tuned in on my tv it is tv that further polarises and atomises audiences there is that kind of tv where your dad has to leave the room every ten minutes because he is too embarrassed to watch i want to avoid that
3084083 there is a way to talk about taboo subjects and adult subjects without making people feel like they need a bath seinfeld does it the simpsons does it always in such a clever way and that is what you should be aiming for
3084084 that is what i am depressed about at the moment the kind of charmlessness of most comedy on television

3084178 we expect monthly sell through to increase by as many as 300 000 units per month beginning in august in our view u s supply last year should have been somewhere between 720 000 900 000 units per month 40 50 percent of total units produced but nintendo chose instead to divert a significant portion of its available supply to europe since april 2007 as the weak dollar has made u s sales less profitable for the company than european sales it appears that european console supply has caught up with demand while at the same time the u s dollar has appreciated slightly against the yen making shipments to the u s far more likely going forward as a result we think that the company likely shipped the u s a figure closer to its fair share in the month of july and we expect a further increase in wii supply beginning in august

3084215 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
3084216 even in his later years he never hesitated to appear for a cause or endorse something that he felt was for the good of mankind he will be sorely missed
3084217 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
3084218 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
3084219 a lot of artists owe isaac his career because a lot of music was based on his foundation
3084220 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
3084221 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs of others begins

3084229 youre local answer me this to which location do you suggest we transport ourselves next food shelter and a safe refuge from an inevitable pursuit by the lawmen of weasels pit would be a prerequisite

3084252 romanii au pur si simplu incredere in produsele fabricate in romania iar in cazul sampaniei raportul calitate pret satisface consumatorul in plus in romania chiar avem sortimente foarte bune de vinuri spumoase si spumante
3084253 anul acesta a fost foarte bun am obtinut o productie de 6 2 tone de grau de patru ori mai mare decat anul trecut si o recolta medie de rapita de 3 75 tone la hectar acum am inceput recoltatul florii soarelui care de asemenea arata foarte bine si ma astept la o productie mult mai buna decat anul trecut
3084254 anul acesta am obtinut cele mai bune productii la culturile de vara din ultimii ani sper ca si la toamna sa obtin o productie de porumb foarte buna
3084255 pentru anul 2008 s au cultivat 2 2 milioane de hectare cu grau in timp ce pentru anul trecut au fost semanate doar 1 2 milioane de hectare de grau cresterea suprafetelor cultivate cu grau este explicata prin motivatia financiara de care au beneficiat producatorii agricoli in toamna anului trecut astfel ministerul agriculturii a oferit pentru culturile de grau din acest an subventii de 600 de lei pentru fiecare hectar cultivat cu grau
3084256 completely dedicated to the lord and therefore totally dedicated to man
3084257 on the other hand and this is even more important today the multiplicity of charisms and the fact that together they make up the church
3084258 if we truly believe in eternal life and if we believe that god helps us
3084259 have the courage to limit themselves and the clarity to set their priorities
3084260 the time a priest spends with the lord and therefore having time for prayer
3084261 to learn what is truly essential to learn where my presence is truly needed as a priest and where i cannot delegate to anybody and at the same time i should humbly accept that there are many things and moments that require my presence but that cannot be done because i recognize my own limitations i think that such humility will be understood by people
3084262 and with this there is something else i should understand how to delegate and call others to collaborate
3084263 a true community of brothers who should sustain and help one another
3084264 isolation in loneliness and sadness and therefore it is important we get together regularly
3084265 no priest is a priest all by himself we are a presbyterate and only in this communion with the bishop can each one carry out his service
3084266 when i was younger i was stricter i said the sacraments are the sacraments of the faith and therefore where there is no faith there is no praxis of faith and thus the sacrament cannot be conferred and i discussed this latter with my priests when i was archbishop of munich as time has gone on i have come to understand that we must follow always the example of the lord who was very open to those on the fringes of israel at that time as well he was a lord of mercy very open according to many official authorities with sinners embracing them and allowing himself to be welcomed at their dinners attracting them to communion with him
3084267 if we can perceive even a flicker of desire for communion in the church a desire also of these children who want to enter into communion with jesus i think it is fair to be more generous naturally of course one aspect of our catechesis should be to make it understood that communion first communion is not an ending event but rather demands a continual friendship with jesus a journey with jesus
3084268 in these sense naturally we should do everything possible in the context of the preparation of the sacraments in order to reach the parents as well and thus make them aware of the journey they are on with the children they should help their children to follow their own desire to enter into friendship with jesus
3084269 if parents have the desire for their children to make their first communion this desire often a social one should be extended to a religious desire in order to make a journey towards jesus possible

3084285 you are in danger of losing the eternal salvation of your soul jeopardizing the salvation of other innocent faithful and inflicting a most severe wound to the communion of the roman catholic church

3084295 the right is nothing if not filled with liars and hypocrites
3084296 we are well beyond virtualization being a fad or a new craze
3084297 you need to respond to what is happening in the overall marketplace you are at a competitive disadvantage if your competitors have a more flexible and resilient virtual environment
3084298 for cost and profitability it is insane to be running all these servers when you can virtualize
3084299 serving the nation by living our catholic beliefs in political life
3084300 the church claims no right to dominate the secular realm
3084301 as catholics we need to take a much tougher and more self critical look at ourselves as believers at the issues underlying todays erosion of catholic identity and at the wholesale assimilation absorption might be a better word of catholics by american culture
3084302 do not conform yourselves to this age but be transformed by the renewal of your mind that you may discern what is the will of god what is good acceptable and perfect
3084303 the catholic faith is much more than a set of principles we agree to but rather an entirely new way of life people must see that new life being lived they must see the joy that it brings they must see the union of the believer with jesus christ p 190
3084304 the teaching of vatican ii exists first and foremost in the council documents themselves no interpretation of the council has merit unless it proceeds organically from what the council actually said and then remains true to it
3084305 christ fully reveals man to himself and makes his supreme calling clear
3084306 we need to root the social dimension of our catholic faith and everything else we do in gods love which is the fuel for our mission of evangelization we cant offer catholic social action to the men and women of the world without at the same time offering them jesus christ
3084307 the catholic church is a web of relationships based on the most important relationship of all jesus christs gift of himself in the eucharist for our salvation none of us earns the gift of christs love none of us deserves the eucharist
3084308 what needs to be done by catholics today for their country
3084309 the answer is dont lie if we say were catholic we need to prove it americas public life needs people willing to stand alone without apologies for the truth of the catholic faith and the common human values it defends p 197
3084310 therefore put away all falsehood speak the truth each one to his neighbor for we are members of one another

3084342 just because life is tough out there you shouldnt rid yourself of competition
3084343 neither is the current economic slowdown a justification for waiving through any application
3084344 the job of the regulators is to assess the long term impact of the alliance on competition not to provide special protection from the immediate challenges of the economic cycle with which every other airline has to deal with
3084345 i think its important to keep at least a daily flight on all the major routes

3084351 it is encouraging that the growth in health care costs is going down but there is still more work to be done

3084376 i was just drawn into it as well i just holed up listening to blues tapes and traveled around when i could to hear the music and try to pick it up so it kind of became those two instruments
3084377 i tend to be a real patriot about east iowa musicians and i dont know if thats because its a uniquely cool music scene or if its because its such a surprise to people that i wind up defending it
3084378 the bottom line is that i really dont know but im associated with some people that im really proud to be associated with and maybe its just a coincidence that we all live in this little area here
3084379 i may have dabbled with songwriting just a touch when i was learning guitar but it really came in when i began to write tunes with grade school kids and at risk kids not to romanticize them but a lot of them in their alienation had already been drawn to music rap music or heavy metal usually just because i was playing acoustic music was not a real problem they just knew that it was a guitar and that i did this for a living and it sounded cool
3084380 i understand what was said and all it has done is motivate me
3084381 any time in my life that i have heard criticism or been told i couldnt do something it has only served to push me harder

3084401 the 2008 convention is about ensuring that those peoples voices are heard and their call for change is heeded
3084402 from monday through thursday our convention program will highlight the people of this country who want positive change and who believe barack obama is the leader who will listen to their concerns and get our country moving in the right direction again
3084403 nobody wants to be in a sinking ship they want to be on the right side at this crucial moment

3084413 we dont always make the best decisions when were young
3084414 it appears that the more that obama speaks the more afraid folks in south carolina get
3084415 we are expecting the white democrats to be fleeing the democratic ship when november 4 comes around plus the democratic candidate bob conley that is running against senator lindsey graham is also running away from the democrats and you can quote me on that
3084416 people who may have been apprehensive about mccain now see this race as potentially winnable
3084417 people are getting more enthusiastic about mccain because he is getting more aggressive toward obama which makes republicans and conservatives believe mccain actually can win
3084418 the more people hear about obama the more enthusiastic they get about mccain
3084419 but its not that these hard core conservatives i talked with at the county fair here are softening their attitudes toward mccain theyre sliding toward him out of fear of a liberal obama presidency and they think mccain can win
3084420 the idea that mccain all of a sudden could win is generating a degree of excitement and involvement among people many of whom may not have been very excited or motivated by mccain at the time he locked up the nomination
3084421 we hear people saying mccain may not have been my guy but
3084422 mccain is attracting independents and hillary democrats the more time he spends in nevada the more people like him its a small state and easy to reach out to voters
3084423 from milk toast internationalist to brave mccain like warrior in under 24 hours

3084429 our construction alone will create some 330 000 new places in junior high schools including in some of indonesias poorest and remote areas

3084517 ive seen a lot of people struggle with microphone stands in the past and ive seen many musicians trip over them onstage and in the studio i just knew that there had to be a better way

3084520 i really do like the fact that no other european has won those two majors consecutively
3084521 because i obviously hold a lot of european players that i grew up watching in high esteem to believe that i achieved something that they hadnt is very special
3084522 i know i love the idea of the back nine of a major of sunday
3084523 i love it so much im actually disappointed im eight months away from the next major
3084524 theres guys that get a little bit fortunate they get in contention in a major and manage to get things going their way either because they play well or because somebody else comes back

3084531 i hope i can give the wood brothers a shot in the arm that they need to really get the momentum to move forward
3084532 i knew that he was going to be good we both came in together and left together and that was probably the win right there to be able to beat him off pit road once we did that i kind of got up through the esses better than him and we pulled away
3084533 it was a big hit for a bunch of guys
3084534 we were ready to attack i know with nine to go you get up on the wheel and push hard pushing and shoving is ok but that was crazy i guess there wasnt much place to go they kept pushing and shoving
3084535 i knew getting a good start was going to be good and once i got that then it changed all my worries

3084540 when we do have close ones theres usually the candidates from that race here anxious to see what the final results are

3084767 newly obtained documents prove that in 2003 barack obama as chairman of an illinois state senate committee voted down a bill to protect live born survivors of abortion even after the panel had amended the bill to contain verbatim language explicitly foreclosing any impact on abortion
3084768 obama said that had he been in the u s senate two years ago he would have voted for the born alive infants protection act even though he voted against a state version of the proposal the difference between the state and federal versions obama explained was that the state measure lacked the federal language clarifying that the act would not be used to undermine roe vs wade the 1973 u s supreme court opinion that legalized abortion
3084769 senator obama says if he had been in the u s senate in 2002 he too would have voted in favor of the born alive infant protection act because unlike the illinois bill it included language protecting roe v wade

3084866 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3084867 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3084868 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3084869 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

3084871 i had 40 on pump 6 and i would also like to get hitched
3084872 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3084873 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3084874 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3084878 doing nothing is not an answer to high gas prices congress created the policies that are responsible for high gas prices congress needs to lift the ban on american oil production and exploration in order to get those prices down

3084916 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3084917 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3084918 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3084919 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3084920 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3084921 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3084922 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3084923 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3084924 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3084925 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3084926 the tongue weighs very little yet few people can hold it
3084927 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3084928 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3084929 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3084930 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3084931 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3084932 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3084933 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3084934 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3084935 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3084936 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3084937 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3084938 who are open to doing something on the production side
3084939 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3084940 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3084941 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3084942 we feel that a customer would want to buy products that cesar recommends since hes a specialist in his field
3084943 we are pleased to be able to add chris to our athletic training staff
3084944 he is an outstanding athletic trainer that has worked in both the national football league and at the collegiate level including in the southeastern conference our student athletes will benefit from his knowledge and experience
3084945 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3084946 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3084947 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3084948 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3084949 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3084950 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3084951 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3084952 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3084953 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3084954 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3084955 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3084956 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3084957 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3084958 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3084959 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3084960 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3084961 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3084962 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3084963 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3084964 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3084965 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3084966 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3084967 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3084968 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3084969 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3084970 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3084971 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3084972 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3084973 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3084974 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3084975 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3084976 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3084977 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3084978 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3084979 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3084980 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3084981 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3084982 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3084983 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3084984 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3084985 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3084986 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3084987 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3084988 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3084989 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3084990 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3084991 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3084992 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3084993 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3084994 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3084995 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3084996 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3084997 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3084998 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3084999 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions

3085115 let there be no doubt in your minds that the dominant political forces at work in pakistan today are competing to appease and please the modern crusaders in the white house and are working to destabilize this nuclear capable nation under the aegis of america
3085116 pervez has insulted and compromised pakistans sovereignty by allowing the cia and the fbi to operate freely in pakistan and arrest interrogate torture deport and detain any person whether pakistani or not for as long as they like thus turning the pakistani army and security agencies into hunting dogs in the contemporary crusade

3085120 my biggest dream would be to get gold in front of a home crowd in london
3085121 everyone wants to be an olympian and to get an olympic gold medal
3085122 i was doing a public session in a swimming pool saw people diving and thought id like to do that
3085123 my dad took me down on saturday mornings and after half a year i got talent spotted out of nowhere
3085124 im not even going to try and define it lets call it an x factor

3085130 the non disparagement provision is over broad and may impede impair or otherwise chill witness testimony in the united states trustees ongoing investigation of countrywide or in current or anticipated litigation against countrywide
3085131 what we have done is take two very different approaches to the challenge of creating bulk metamaterials that can exhibit negative refraction in optical frequencies
3085132 both bring us a major step closer to the development of practical applications for metamaterials
3085133 natural materials do not respond to the magnetic field of light but the metamaterial we created here does
3085134 it is the first bulk material that can be described as having optical magnetism so both the electrical and magnetic fields in a light wave move backward in the material
3085135 the geometry of the vertical nanowires which were equidistant and parallel to each other were designed to only respond to the electrical field in light waves
3085136 the magnetic field which oscillates at a perpendicular angle to the electrical field in a light wave is essentially blind to the upright nanowires a feature which significantly reduces energy loss
3085137 what makes both these materials stand out is that they are able to function in a broad spectrum of optical wavelengths with lower energy loss
3085138 weve also opened up a new approach to developing metamaterials by moving away from previous designs that were based upon the physics of resonance previous metamaterials in the optical range would need to vibrate at certain frequencies to achieve negative refraction leading to strong energy absorption resonance is not a factor in both the nanowire and fishnet metamaterials
3085139 i gotta say omars a great character thats not an endorsement that is not an endorsement he is not my favorite person but hes a fascinating character hes this gay gangster who only robs drug dealers and then gives back you know hes sort of a robin hood and hes the toughest baddest guy on this show but hes gay you know and its really interesting its a fascinating character
3085140 his favorite harry potter character may be dumbledore he wont comment when its mentioned that the headmaster of hogwarts may be gay
3085141 is there any room left to mention that i turned out to be right
3085142 i wonder if anywhere in this article there is room left to mention that the last two weeks has seen a desperate scramble emergency sec orders suddenly called congressional hearings demands from the us chamber of congress and an association representing 8 000 banks to keep naked short selling from collapsing the us financial system
3085143 in a naked short the usual process of short selling is circumvented because the seller doesnt actually borrow the stock and simply fails to deliver it
3085144 for this reason naked shorting can occur even when actual shares arent available in the market it allows manipulators to force prices down without regard to supply and demand

3085148 i am going to sit there and watch michael phelps break my record anonymously thats almost demeaning to me it is not almost it is
3085149 they voted me one of the top five olympians in all time some of them are dead but they invited the other ones to go to the olympics but not me yes i am a bit upset about it
3085150 i won seven events if they had the 50m freestyle back then which they do now i probably would have won that too
3085151 hes almost identical to me hes a world record holder in all these events so he is dominating the events just like i did
3085152 what will this mean to our community and to a vigorous democracy when we dont have an adequate press response

3085239 the longstanding doctrine of patent exhaustion provides that the initial authorized sale of a patented item terminates all patent rights in that item
3085240 e liminating exhaustion for method patents would seriously undermine the exhaustion doctrine patentees seeking to avoid patent exhaustion could simply draft their patent claims to describe a method rather than an apparatus
3085241 but the question whether third parties received implied licenses is irrelevant because quanta asserts its right to practice the patents based not on implied license but on exhaustion and exhaustion turns only on intels own license to sell products practicing the lge patents
3085242 n othing in the license agreement restricts intels right to sell its microprocessors and chipsets to purchasers who intend to combine them with non intel parts

3085300 and so protecting life is the honorable duty of the russian military much as it was during the great patriotic war when the red army hoisted the hammer and sickle flag on the reichstag building signifying the defeat of fascism

3085302 well go into each game theres only eight games in the group and well be looking for at least 17 points if were going to qualify and thats got to be our aim
3085303 macedonia is going to be a tough game they showed against england when they drew 0 0 at wembley that they are an excellent international side
3085304 it will be tough but weve got to try to get our own game going
3085305 our strengths are our team work our passion our belief and our never say die attitude and if we can keep that going well certainly be a very difficult team to beat
3085306 the dutch are going to be favourites no doubt about that their all round ability in their squad their team play is fantastic but you dont win anything on paper
3085307 just because youre favourites doesnt mean youll win so well certainly not have to fear anybody
3085308 with northern ireland youve got one eye on macedonia and what the starting line up is going to be
3085309 so its going to be an important game and hopefully we can show the form weve had in previous games
3085310 thats your vision thats your aim when i took over the job thats what really excited me
3085311 ive been really excited with the squad of players theyve really got a lot of hunger and passion and have the same beliefs that i have
3085312 the fans have been tremendous and theyve played a big part in the success of our performances and progress made in the last couple of years
3085313 we need everybody all the help we can get we know weve got the tartan army right behind us and the support theyve shown so far has been absolutely magnificent
3085314 i dont think theres another country in the world with such passionate fans and if we all work together we can make this vision happen and take the country to south africa
3085315 thats our aim thats our vision and with a little bit of luck and everyone working together its certainly possible

3085337 those values may appeal to democrats in washington d c or san francisco but this is harris county texas and we have much higher standards here i strongly urge the harris county democrat party to choose the honorable path and withdraw the invitation

3085447 we knew that the 2009 budget deliberations would be difficult to begin with due the increasing costs of fuel building and maintenance materials and machinery
3085448 however through mayor ballards quarterly budget review we have learned that the tough budget we are facing as a community was made worse by the lack of foresight and the crass political calculations of former mayor bart peterson and other democrat officials such as monroe gray and sheriff anderson
3085449 it is simply irresponsible the level of which the past administration simply left out known required spending from the budget in order to make it look like spending was under control it clearly was not
3085450 as republicans have pointed out many times before the prior administration exercised no control over spending instead of making tough decisions like real leaders they borrowed our city into debt that will be paid for by our children and grandchildren
3085451 i do not know if these acts were committed out of malice or ignorance but the peterson administrations inability to lead even in the final days of his term has cost taxpayers millions of dollars
3085452 as we have already noted the past administration wasted millions of dollars in public safety and other areas simply through mismanagement and deficit spending the ballard administration simply by being honest in budgeting and following acceptable accounting standards can save millions in public safety alone
3085453 i think it is very important that we know exactly what the city is facing as we begin 2009 budget deliberations
3085454 while we cant dwell on the mistakes of the previous administration forever it is important to note upon whose doorsteps our dire situation rests men like bart peterson monroe gray greg bowes and frank anderson got us here we can just all be thankful that the voters chose a real leader like mayor greg ballard who has the vision to make our city fiscally healthy in the long term and the political backbone not to play shell games with the budget for his own short term political gain

3085460 my husband threw away all of his packers stuff already
3085461 brett throws a little bit faster than our quarterback so you will be used to the high school speed and then here comes the nfl speed
3085462 and a lot of times it goes straight through your hands and to your chest and it stings a little most of the time and leaves a nice red circle in the middle of the chest
3085463 we would go out there and fish and he would be cutting the grass or the weeds in his cutoff shirt and khaki shorts
3085464 he is an awesome guy he has a catfish pond and another pond stocked with florida bass any man would fall in love with his home as soon as they step foot on it its just a paradise a place for release brett doesnt even like to fish hes a hunter but he will come out with us and keep us company
3085465 everybody talks about the brett that was wild and partied ive only known him for nine years but now he will go out and start working on his property to clear his head he will get up with the chickens and get out there i will have to go out and find him on his land i usually just follow the tracks of the tractor or four wheeler and he will be chain sawing something or on the dozer doing something
3085466 he showed me stuff that he printed out on a computer
3085467 it was first class they even had pictures of deer
3085468 he said its so tough in new york that they can go 11 5 and not make the playoffs
3085469 but as far a country guy coming to the city it wasnt that at all
3085470 at the moment we have to take kazakhmys other otc people at its word about not making a bid of course next year or the one after the situation could change

3085474 this collaboration proved that there is more to the south than just down home cooking and the shameful history of jim crow
3085475 and about a million other inside jokes that ive been gleefully regurgitating since this song came out
3085476 an utterly brilliant display of lyricism that isnt about anything in particular straight dope
3085477 i recognize that guy i think hes on a soap opera
3085478 he was the main subject of conversation its very hard to believe hes gone
3085479 he was very obliging a grand lad and a good all rounder

3085482 i will have to take a cab i been drinkin and i cant drive and watch the kid
3085483 would you have rather grown up in an orphanage than be adopted ungrateful bitch
3085484 hey maybe i shouldnt write inflammatory comments just to rile people up and polarize any sort of productive discussion that could occur
3085485 it is important to recognize that it is not for us to consider as a matter of policy whether home schooling should be permitted in california that job is for the legislature it is not the duty of the courts to make the law we endeavor to interpret it justice h walter croskey wrote in a ruling signed by the two other members of the panel our first task interpreting the law of california is made more difficult in this case by legislative inaction to that end the court said additional requirements for home schoolers in other states such as standardized testing or home visits should be considered by the california legislature
3085486 the bad news is that the teachers union big nanny war on never ends homeschoolers are a threat to their turf a threat to their funding a threat to their long held and fiercely protected monopoly

3085493 they poked us and stabbed us with the machetes and they were asking for money specifically dollars

3085495 i said we need help i said my husband was not moving
3085496 i felt he really was so committed to that character the guy that was playing that guy that as an audience you bought his sincerity very few people i think could pull that off
3085497 robert was black the whole time my mom came on the set and she thought it was don cheadle

3085693 when it comes to new driver and student driver car magnets rookie driver products are the preferred choice of new teen drivers
3085694 parents sometimes feel that theyre only needed for the initial learning experience of driving
3085695 once teens get their license they tend to think their job is over but parents still have an important role to play in keeping teens safe
3085696 teens can look around them and see everyone else including their parents doing things they shouldnt while driving such as using a cell phone speeding or playing with the radio
3085697 they dont understand that while this behavior is unsafe for all drivers younger drivers are less experienced and have not yet automated their driving skills so the same behaviors put teen drivers at higher risk of crashing
3085698 were not trying to take the fun out of growing up and getting a license
3085699 we just want to educate the public about the importance of balancing the joy of teen driving with responsibility and safety

3085712 all i know is just what i read in the papers in fact all i know is what i read about criminals and congress congress has been getting more money out of us lately than the criminals the criminals dont take it till after you get it but congress is making us all sign i o u s for all we will ever get during our lifetime

3085721 do you think that dark knight is the turning point for comic book movie adaptations or do you think comic book movies have always been this good it just took a more serious movie for the public to realize it

3085723 well i figure its my job to give you what you dont ask for and what you dont know that you want
3085724 is geek culture here to stay or are superhero movies just a fad
3085725 i think its here to stay i think in terms of comic book movies it was only a matter of time before a technology caught up with what they can do on the page and b they proved to be financially viable i think once they proved that like you make one of these you have a good shot making 300 million domestically you know why not mine some of the most creative material ever written and its just been sitting around for 50 60 years and since we work in an industry where originality is not hailed you know why not just go to the source material which has been time tested and proven but not necessarily available to the mainstream audience because they were just like oh funnybooks those are for kids and thats just talking about the superhero stuff pause in case you didnt follow um i think geek cultures here to stay thank god for quentin tarantino
3085726 it was on the first scene where bruce willis comes in and finds out that the girl that he had saved had become an exotic dancer it was the first time that jessica alba appeared on stage with a lasso and i had picked the music we had on stage it was emmylou harris wrecking ball and she danced an elegant dance swinging the lasso pause and i found myself bursting into tears because i realized a dream had just come true

3085737 i can understand why he is under criticism hes taken a job at a football club who had a huge financial injection
3085738 people expected big things at this place and so far those massive things have not been delivered
3085739 but people need to be aware that it is a process and no matter how much money you throw in there has to be a foundation
3085740 we know what we can both do and our record is quite good when you are talking about goals
3085741 it is still early days but we are kicking off next week with the game against chelsea and we can take a lot out of the game against united
3085742 it will be difficult at chelsea but it will be difficult for them too

3085748 even though it decision makers clearly recognize the importance of green it solutions such as virtualization and server consolidation there are always going to be growing pains involved with making a significant change to an organization
3085749 if going green means replacing servers that are already delivering reliable it to an organization then widespread adoption may take some time
3085750 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3085751 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3085752 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3085753 having spent years responding to emergency situations where lives are in imminent danger it disturbs me to think that some individuals are purposely undermining emergency responses with their abuse of 911 lines

3085758 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3085759 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3085760 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3085773 the reality is we will have a new president in three months and what bush and the republicans are trying to do amounts to a land grab for the oil companies

3085787 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3085792 who can demonstrate at properly constituted interview panels that they have the experience and competencies to help shape the vision and operations of gt
3085793 this yields a much better picture of the financial health of the company and provides the basis for the government to collect all the inter connectivity arrears and other debts including those owed by government agencies for the effective recapitalization of gt

3085803 the principal works of bahaollah are the kitab ul ighan the kitab ul akdas the kitab ul ahd and numerous letters or tablets addressed to sovereigns or to private individuals
3085804 o ye beloved of the lord it is incumbent upon you to be submissive to all monarchs that are just and to show your fidelity to every righteous king serve ye the sovereigns of the world with utmost truthfulness and loyalty show obedience unto them and be their well wishers without their leave and permission do not meddle with political affairs for disloyalty to the just sovereign is disloyalty to god himself this is my counsel and the commandment of god unto you well is it with them that act accordingly
3085805 the purpose of god in creating man hath been and will ever be to enable him to know his creator and to attain his presence to this most excellent aim this supreme objective all the heavenly books and the divinely revealed and weighty scriptures unequivocally bear witness whoso hath recognized the day spring of divine guidance and entered his holy court hath drawn nigh unto god and attained his presence a presence which is the real paradise and of which the loftiest mansions of heaven are but a symbol such a man hath attained the knowledge of the station of him who is at the distance of two bows who standeth beyond the whoso hath failed to recognize him will have condemned himself to the misery of remoteness a remoteness which is naught but utter nothingness and the essence of the nethermost fire such will be his fate though to outward seeming he may occupy the earths loftiest seats and be established upon its most exalted throne
3085806 the sabbath is for man not man for the sabbath
3085807 there are however a few standards we might wish to add to the list one of the prerequisites of justice for example is that producers and consumers should carry their own costs rather than dumping them on other people those who do the dumping tend to be the rich and powerful while those who are dumped upon tend to be the weak and indigent environmental and social externalities in other words typically represent the theft by the wealthy of the natural and material wealth possessed by the poor they amount to a monumental subsidy for the rich it is a source of constant astonishment to me that those who profess to support free market economics routinely overlook this distortion
3085808 this theft has reached so great a scale that it is arguable that the majority of the worlds large corporations depend on it for their continued existence the american professor of business administration ralph estes found that one took into account only those costs which had been properly established by authoritative studies in 1994 corporations in the united states were permitted to inflict 2 6 trillion dollars worth of social and environmental damage or five times the value of their total profits many companies object that if they were forced to pay the full price for the resources they use and the damage they cause they would be driven out of business to this the only sensible answer is good wealth in this case would cease to be stolen from the poor and handed to the rich the price of the most damaging goods would rise enormously but this should surely please the practitioners of free trade as it provides a classic market response to a social and environmental problem unlike localization it punishes only those who cause the damage and offers relative rewards to those who export less harmful goods
3085809 if humanism were right in declaring that man is born to be happy he would not be born to die since his body is doomed to die his task on earth evidently must be of a more spiritual nature it cannot unrestrained enjoyment of everyday life it cannot be the search for the best ways to obtain material goods and then cheerfully get the most out of them it has to be the fulfillment of a permanent earnest duty so that ones life journey may become an experience of moral growth so that one may leave life a better human being than one started it it is imperative to review the table of widespread human values its present incorrectness is astounding it is not possible that assessment of the presidents performance be reduced to the question of how much money one makes or of unlimited availability of gasoline only voluntary inspired self restraint can raise man above the world stream of materialism
3085810 it would be retrogression to attach oneself today to the ossified formulas of the enlightenment
3085811 if the world has not come to its end it has approached a major turn in history equal in importance to the turn from the middle ages to the renaissance it will exact from us a spiritual upsurge we shall have to rise to a new height of vision to a new level of life where our physical nature will not be cursed as in the middle ages but even more importantly our spiritual being will not be trampled upon as in the modern era this ascension will be similar to climbing onto the next anthropologic stage no one on earth has any other way left but upward
3085812 not one drop of foreign oil shall be imported after ten years
3085813 if we look into the causes of our problems we find that they come from the fact that people are able neither to govern nor to be governed they do not know how to govern others and they do not know how to govern themselves they do not know how to be governed by others they do not know how to be governed by themselves

3085817 why didnt you get so defensive when i said you had green hair
3085818 be conservative in what you do be liberal in what you accept from others
3085819 why were the elite so hawkish well i heard a number of people express privately the argument that some influential commentators made publicly that the war was a good idea not because iraq posed a real threat but because beating up someone in the middle east never mind who would show muslims that we mean business in other words even alleged wise men bought into the idea of macho posturing as policy
3085820 know nothing politics by paul krugman new york times august 7 2008
3085821 one of the great events which is to occur in the day of the manifestation of that incomparable branch is the hoisting of the standard of god among all nations by this is meant that all nations and kindreds will be gathered together under the shadow of this divine banner which is no other than the lordly branch itself and will become a single nation religious and sectarian antagonism the hostility of races and peoples and differences among nations will be eliminated all men will adhere to one religion will have one common faith will be blended into one race and become a single people all will dwell in one common fatherland which is the planet itself

3085836 we call on russia to stop immediately all military activity on georgian territory
3085837 we call on all sides to show restraint we consider that the latest developments such as the crossing of the georgian border by russian troops change the dimension of the conflict
3085838 seriously concerned about the disproportionate use of force by the russians and the lack of respect for the territorial integrity of georgia
3085839 the military operations including air and missile attacks have no relation to and go well beyond the cis peacekeeping operation
3085840 we cannot create an anti russia coalition in europe and on this point we are close to putins position

3085996 for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
3085997 perhaps real world climate sensitivity is very much below the ipccs estimates perhaps therefore there is no climate crisis at all the correct policy approach to a non problem is to have the courage to do nothing
3085998 i was impressed by an hour long academic lecture which criticized claims about global warming and explained the implications of the physics of radiative transfer for climate change
3085999 to me the value of this paper lies in its dispassionate but ruthlessly clear exposition or rather expos of the ipccs method of evaluating climate sensitivity the detailed arguments in this paper and indeed in a large number of other scientific papers point up extensive errors including numerous projection errors of climate models as well as misleading statements by the ipcc consequently there are no rational grounds for believing either the ipcc or any other claims of dangerous anthropogenic global warming

3086004 this seems discourteous i had been invited to submit the paper i had submitted it an eminent professor of physics had then scientifically reviewed it in meticulous detail i had revised it at all points requested and in the manner requested the editors had accepted and published the reviewed and revised draft some 3000 words longer than the original and i had expended considerable labor without having been offered or having requested any honorarium

3086062 we believe that the social norms marketing campaign has really had a fairly dramatic impact on the students at our university
3086063 as a clinician what i find so interesting about social norms marketing is that it shares many of the principles that we use in motivational counseling when we see an individual in a clinical setting it creates a discrepancy between what the patient may be doing or believing and what is actually the norm it presents the information in a very respectful and objective way that enable an individual to make a healthier decision

3086072 since written articles condemning me in the most vehement of terms particularly because of my condemnation of paul hill and my reluctance to condemn all hormonal contraceptives as abortifacient
3086073 when i set out to produce my own film with my own money i had no idea of all the detailed legal nuances that would come into play
3086074 from actor and crew contracts to music licenses it was a daunting stack of legal obligations i had to rapidly educate myself on
3086075 it was real important to me to have two real college football teams competing in the fictional bowl game in two tickets to paradise
3086076 i wanted to visually reference the teams logos and feature them on tickets t shirts etc i felt this was important to the atmosphere of a bowl game and that the audience would be distracted by fake school names
3086077 its always intriguing when youre approached with an opportunity like that
3086078 but its the universitys responsibility to protect its name its logos and how it all is used the university wants to understand the premise of the movie is it something that the fans of marshall would appreciate the university wouldnt want to be involved in a project that is offensive to its fans
3086079 in the script texas beats usc by three points in a squeaker to reference the gambling lingo john mcginleys character uses
3086080 usc would not agree to let us use their logo if their team lost the fictional game ridiculous as it was i could sort of see their point in terms of brand management thats when i hit on the idea of marshall being in the game i was familiar with the story since i was a kid the plane crash was on my ninth birthday and i remember the reports the cinderella team overcoming adversity etc i thought the school might like it since frankly in this era theyd be considered a longshot to be in the bcs game the officials at the school were into it and we went ahead
3086081 a great side benefit of having marshall was access to the motivated alumni base in southern california
3086082 keith spears marshalls former vice president for institutional advancement got a huge number of them to show up to be extras at the tailgating scene we shot at qualcomm stadium home of the san diego chargers of the national football league energetic passionate wonderful people they added so much to the movie it was a great experience for me to get to know them
3086083 rhonda mullins administrative assistant in marshall communications helped a great deal in getting the alumni folks together
3086084 she made contacts and assisted in coordinating the qualcomm activities of the marshall crowd
3086085 we had a much bigger crowd than texas alumni and they were stalwart in their support of the herd even in a fictional game
3086086 at one point the film crew asked if some of the mu alumni would put on texas t shirts to even out the numbers our herd fans refused and stayed true to their green and white d b had to go down to a local hooters restaurant and solicit extras
3086087 a similar legal issue in the filming concerned the use of products
3086088 we needed a beer company and a stationary store and both office max and coors came on board in a big way using the office max store and its employees saved us a ton of money and they didnt make any demands of us script wise they requested i highlight an hp product since that is what they were pushing in their advertising and i was glad to do it
3086089 they office max pushed through the approvals to hp so that didnt cost me any extra time
3086090 i wasnt willing to cut the scene where the driver opens a beer and passes it to a sleeping passenger in the back seat it is a movie about misbehaving on the road after all so we worked out a fairly intricate deal
3086091 i agreed to never show any other companies products to create a fictional product for use in and around the car always feature coors in bars and restaurants and never litter with coors products there was a bunch of other stuff too but that was the gist of it they gave me significant cash and use of uniforms trucks warehouses etc so it was a huge help to creating a big look for the movie
3086092 of course thats good for marshall university and all the people who love marshall and enjoy seeing the university in a different light
3086093 in terms of the game in this movie marshall fans are passionate and theyre loyal whether or not marshall wins or loses the fictional game in a movie the university still wins
3086094 i though it was a whale but it was a wolf
3086095 ich rauchte nicht nur haschisch ich trank auch wein und bier wenn ich kein dope hatte

3086107 we are looking at the files they are 20 or 23 of the former state governors i believe that in the next two weeks we will know which of them are to be investigated or not some of them are already being prosecuted for money laundering money laundering is not in our mandate
3086108 we dont need an independent counsel to investigate and prosecute them
3086109 we are scrutinizing the files to see whether there are cases that we could now pursue many of these allegations were committed as far back as 2003 we need to see which of these allegations are motivated for election purposes
3086110 for this category of people we dont need an independent counsel
3086111 the chief justice will study the allegations and consider whether it is worthwhile to appoint independent counsel to investigate those allegations when the independent counsel investigates he does not prosecute he reports to the legislature it is for the legislature to take over from there
3086112 as far as we are concerned nobody should feel offended if investigated it is what the laws say that we will do it is misconception to look at the status of a person and conclude that you are not going to investigate him

3086150 it is clearly a very upsetting event that has led to indiscriminate market selling and russias perception in the west will suffer as a result
3086151 however it has no significant impact on russias economic fundamentals and corporate earnings and at the end of the day we firmly believe this is what ultimately drives the markets rather then emotions and swings in investor sentiment
3086152 this conflict will have a negligible effect on the russian economy

3086190 a little more about canada as the opening ceremonies close
3086191 in any case whether we organise primaries in these constituencies or not we are going to field candidates to contest the elections
3086192 instead of selling 70 per cent to vodafone the government can still retain 30 per cent off load a properly valued 40 per cent of gt shares to a strategic investor and float 30 per cent on the stock exchange for citizens
3086193 it is absolutely unreasonable for any nation to surrender her sovereignty in any instance and very expensive for the younger generation to suffer the consequences of the irresponsibility of their selfish predecessors
3086194 the objection to the sale of gt has moved way beyond politicking to the extent of protecting and preserving national property for which reason most civil societies pressure groups and most stakeholders must voice out their concern to the so called listening government
3086195 npp the supposed listening government must bow their heads in shame and pray to god for forgiveness in disappointing the nation in such a manner that spells their incompetence recklessness and lack of vision
3086196 it is unfortunate when people think the irresponsibility of a government appointee must necessitate the sale of a company as a solution rather than removing those incompetent appointees from office
3086197 we emphasise that the sale of gt will spell doom for ghana because this is going to incapacitate the ghana telecom university which is the only government institute training our children and adults alike in the field of ict telecom and related subjects
3086198 unfortunately users are very trusting of messages left by friends on social networking sites so the likelihood of a user clicking on a link like this is very high

3086200 pockets of violence and militarism experienced during the primaries of the ruling new patriotic party npp and the on going limited voter registration exercise have the tendency of jeopardizing ghanas security if they are not nipped in the bud
3086201 they havent imbibed the values and the norms inherent in their own party regulation and then in their manifestos you dont break the rules and the laws of the country so that you get access to political power that kind of political power is immoral
3086202 we must face the fact and the reality on the ground the political leaders have sown seeds of violence animosity and hatred throughout the country
3086203 the youth have been psyched up for action all that they are waiting for is the order to act this we must stop from happening civil society actors our religious leaders must speak out now against evil
3086204 the religious leaders must use the pulpit not only to encourage their members to pay their tithes but also to speak against perpetration of violence corruption intimidation and political antagonism if we die we cannot pay tithes
3086205 if political parties fail to see the essence of playing by the rules governing elections
3086206 it is not the armed forces that should do it because that would be tantamount to a military state it is not the police that should do it it is not civil society because that would amount to basic civil disobedience its the politicians who should lead the way for peaceful general elections in december
3086207 we must not enforce the law based on the political party colour that one adorns we must not arrest somebody for merely smelling an attempt to commit a crime whiles we look elsewhere when another actually commits a crime
3086208 the people of ghana should be critical of the behaviour of their leaders

3086215 the muslim religion is not on trial here ladies and gentlemen
3086216 before the doctrine of deceit can be understood we must have a context of islamic doctrine in general what is needed is more than facts but an entire line of reasoning

3086225 glauben sie an nichts nur weil sie es geh rt haben glauben sie nicht einfach an traditionen weil sie von generationen akzeptiert wurden glauben sie an nichts nur auf grund der verbreitung durch ger chte glauben sie nie etwas nur weil es in heiligen schriften steht glauben sie an nichts nur wegen der autorit t der lehrer oder lterer menschen aber wenn sie selber erkennen dass etwas heilsam ist und dass es dem einzelnen und allen zu gute kommt und f rderlich ist dann m gen sie es annehmen und stets danach leben
3086226 what we call drugs at 74th street baptist church we call a sinny sin sin
3086227 this is the russian answer to the recognition of kosovo that recognition was in fact a gift to russia
3086228 shows that it cannot be counted on double standards to pass
3086229 recognizing kosovo will bring nothing but trouble no one can be denied the right to self determination but only within the bounds of common sense
3086230 with its irresponsible behavior causing new divisions in europe and globally and undermining international relations
3086231 my dad was one of the first to go on outreach and visit
3086232 for years he would come home from the trip and tell me i needed to go and that i would love it i thought he was crazy i wanted nothing to do with africa
3086233 the rest is history i fell in love with it and ended up extending my trip from two weeks to five weeks that first summer
3086234 the emphasis at southeastern on reaching the nations is outstanding
3086235 i know i will be well equipped when i leave here
3086236 in 2006 i came as the only short termer and served in numerous capacities
3086237 most of my time was spent by helping to keep camp running smoothly preparing food and assisting the team members where and when i could
3086238 while the team is in mozambique we ran the entire behind the scenes part of the ministry on a day to day basis i helped prepare food and do odds and ends to keep camp running smoothly
3086239 this included but was not limited to cooking the food chopping wood and hauling water from the river
3086240 the lord has really been teaching me a lot over the past two months
3086241 this being my third summer serving and doing more of the practical side of ministry it has really given me an appreciation of those who serve behind the scenes
3086242 to the glory of god he came to know christ as his savior it was so encouraging to see how genuine his faith is
3086243 many people have been praying for his salvation and several of those people that had been daily lifting him up in prayer were on outreach with us when he became a believer
3086244 i think so often we get caught up in our day to day lives that we forget how great a need there is for the gospel
3086245 being here has been a great reminder how much work there is to be done still
3086246 at this time there are no plans for tori to appear in the 90210 spinoff

3086254 es ist erforderlich zur diskussion ber das problem des status dieser republiken zur ckzukehren die um die anerkennung ihrer unabh ngigkeit ersuchen
3086255 die hauptgefahr ist nicht georgiens pr sident michail saakaschwili selbst der lediglich eine marionette ist sondern diejenigen die hinter ihm stehen
3086256 gerade diese nato kr fte stehen hinter saakaschwilis r cken

3086264 no incarnation there is no christianity in any distinctive sense
3086265 truly no man can ransom another or give to god the price of his life for the ransom of their life is costly and can never suffice that he should live on forever and never see the pit
3086266 jesus my god thy blood alone has power sufficient to atone
3086267 its like anybody who is the treasurer of an organization whether you agree or disagree its your responsibility to sign the checks so i signed the checks
3086268 in terms of the people the association has to work with if were going to get legislation passed unfortunately the republicans have held the power and were trying to change that now
3086269 all were asking for is an opportunity to have a debate and a vote on our plan
3086270 everyone here is obsessed with tabloid celebrities and their lives and wanting to be like that
3086271 in america you have the people who watch the lohans reality show and want to be like dina and ali lohan and live in a house with a throne in it everywhere theyre just everywhere
3086272 my intention is not to shock you but one of the first things im going to lecture on is that there is evidence that proves your greatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgrandmother was a mudcat
3086273 this is the class for me this guys a god damn genius im gonna soak his brain matter of all its firmament
3086274 besides i had the best free love ever in my heyday dating 5 women at once one time i can repose among my sexual memories and those wonderful and beautiful and so dear to me women who meant so much to me during those moments so sex therapy is sociology
3086275 go ye into all the world and spread the gospel
3086276 build up your defenses in case you are attacked from outside
3086277 it is clearly a very upsetting event that has led to indiscriminate market selling and russias perception in the west will suffer as a result
3086278 however it has no significant impact on russias economic fundamentals and corporate earnings and at the end of the day we firmly believe this is what ultimately drives the markets rather then emotions and swings in investor sentiment
3086279 this conflict will have a negligible effect on the russian economy
3086280 this guy could sell some bread to a baker or oil to saudi arabia
3086281 if i can have this much fun just eating pizza imagine what a blast i am while doing other stuff brushing the cat microwaving popcorn and purchasing toilet paper are just a few more things i do with wide eyed abandon and uninhibited joie de vivre
3086282 comments have come flooding in on the report of lesbians marching through a san diego neighborhood
3086283 this venue is very important because we dont have enough of that
3086284 it is good to get back to the principles of what this festival is about people are going to see something they have never seen before
3086285 we have got a venue with a huge spectrum of performers
3086286 the good thing is that there is a huge family atmosphere here
3086287 for me it is what the festival is all about collaboration with different cultures communication sharing and enjoying each others cultures
3086288 we have 29 child performers from cambodia some incredible performers from brazil called the capoeira knights and a new show called hemmingways havana
3086289 together with old friends of mine the zawose family we have got something very special and unique
3086290 their father huckwe was a well known international musician who worked with peter gabriel and toured the world
3086291 he died five years ago but he had seven wives and more than 40 children who were all taught to learn and play his music
3086292 there is a great wealth and understanding of music and dance in their culture
3086293 after his death they did not know which direction to go in
3086294 i did feel for a long period that there wasnt anything new to buy
3086295 but i really like the slim fit its not so roomy not so bulky and its a lot cleaner
3086296 this is a trend that you have to buy otherwise you look outdated
3086297 suddenly a pair of cargo pants and a polo shirt doesnt look good anymore
3086298 womens wear has painted themselves in a corner by offering too many options and with everything a trend it is very easy not to buy anything
3086299 if you are keeping up with fashion people notice and it gives them more confidence
3086300 i had looked in the mirror and never was impressed i looked like a little kid who was waiting to grow into his clothes
3086301 i feel extremely confident in the way i look everyone has noticed
3086302 a myriad of men are born they labor and sweat and struggle they squabble and scold and fight they scramble for little mean advantages over each other age creeps upon them infirmities follow those they love are taken from them and the joy of life is turned to aching grief it the release comes at last the only unpoisoned gift earth ever had for them and they vanish from a world where they were of no consequence a world which will lament them a day and forget them forever
3086303 where do you get that isnt this passage one about holy living and getting along with others
3086304 without holiness sanctification of heart and life no one will see the lord
3086305 blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god
3086306 take up the shield of faith with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one
3086307 i want to go and see the wonders of hippopatamus new york please book me a flight from dallas
3086308 im sorry madame but there is no such city perhaps you want albany or syracuse
3086309 never lose the wonder of the lord otherwise you will grow stale dull and eventually lose your fervor in serving him
3086310 he was wounded for our transgression he bore our sins in his body on the tree for our sins he sacrificed with his blood his gave release and with his stripes we are made whole
3086311 thou are worthy o lord to receive glory honor and power for you have created all things and for your pleasure they are and are created
3086312 for me to live is christ and to die is gain
3086313 for from him and through him and to him are all things to him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity
3086314 seeing that his divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness through the true knowledge of him who calls us by his own glory and excellence he helps us escapes the corruption that is in the world by lust
3086315 do you not know that those who run in a race all run but one receives the prize run in such a way that you may obtain it and everyone who competes for the prize is temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a perishable crown but we for an imperishable crown therefore i run thus not with uncertainty thus i fight not as one who beats the air but i discipline my body and bring it into subjection lest when i have preached to others i myself should become disqualified
3086316 my friend you are now witnessing a miracle there files a dead duck
3086317 though i am free from all men i have made myself a servant to all
3086318 i have been sitting in that seat for forty two years
3086319 do for others as you would like them to do for you
3086320 i know the plans i have for you says the lord plans for good and not evil to give you a future and a hope
3086321 prevention should be priority number one priority number two and priority number three
3086322 filing taxes is not optional it is a legal requirement mr snipes now faces up to three years in federal prison for his willful failure to comply with the law
3086323 100 of what is collected is absorbed solely by interest on the federal debt all individual income tax revenues are gone before one nickel is spent on the services tax payers expect from the government
3086324 for me its doing something to get better every single day i dont think about the big picture as much if im having a bad practice i try to end on a good note
3086325 for decades hes been washingtons biggest celebrity john mccain and as washington embraced him john mccain hugged right back the lobbyists running his low road campaign the money billions in tax breaks for oil and drug companies but almost nothing for families like yours lurching to the right then the left the old washington dance whatever it takes john mccain a washington celebrity playing the same old washington games

3086350 our country has a long and varied history of stolen elections systematic disenfranchisement and manufactured election irregularities
3086351 yet most of us still accept on faith the integrity of the election process i hope that watching uncounted so close to the presidential election will shake to the core any preconceived beliefs and encourage immediate action before its too late
3086352 the notion of stolen elections is something we assign to third world countries but not this beacon of freedom and democracy that we like to view ourselves as

3086360 the defense ministry has been conducting a very wise policy

3086367 most unsettled territorial conflicts in the former ussr area have much in common
3086368 bulgaria supports a strong and active european position in the south ossetia conflict the reports of victims among the civilian population in the region of the town of tskhinvali cause particular anxiety as an european union member bulgaria would support the unions more active diplomatic involvement in order to prevent the further escalation of the tensions and to contribute to the solution of the conflict in the region of south ossetia
3086369 it is in our interest that russia and georgia settle their relations in the name of the peace in the black sea region i still believe that georgia should have been granted a membership action plan map if this had happened nato would have had a bigger influence in the internal processes on the one hand and on the other such positive changes in georgia as well as an invitation for membership would have certainly triggered a less emotional reaction
3086370 romania reaffirms the need to observe the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia romania calls on both parties to prove responsibility and immediately cease fire in order to allow for negotiations that guarantee peace and stability in the region
3086371 russia wanted to show the world it remains the only alternative for oil and gas transit to europe moscow takes advantage of the lack of will or of ability to react of international organizations to show that the caucasus stay within its sphere of influence and that georgia is not a serious alternative for gas or oil transit to europe
3086372 on the one hand russia is a major military power on the black sea and is an important trade partner to turkey on the other hand tbilisi is a close partner of ankara and nato of which turkey is a member another dilemma turkey faces is pressure from ethnic lobbies in abkhazia the other breakaway region of georgia which claim the turks are their distant relatives and that turkey should support them in their struggle against georgia

3086377 the world just got a little less funny he will be missed dearly
3086378 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
3086379 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the preeminent comedians of our generation
3086380 my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man
3086381 my working experiences with bernie were so amazing that from that point on i wouldnt have cared if he called me in the middle of the night to come and be in a scene where i didnt have anything to do but sit in the background and eat cereal i wouldve just done it because i loved him like that
3086382 i guess its cool a lot of the potential students are really smart and want to go into difficult fields its fun to see them get excited about certain things in the university
3086383 uh oh theres going to be a lot of disappointed readers out there
3086384 wow it must get frustrating when people dont listen do the parents ever get snooty with you
3086385 sometimes i just try to be friendly and helpful anyway
3086386 thats funny but hopefully these future students didnt inherit their parents i qs is there a particular question that you can always count on being asked
3086387 not really theyre average since theyre in ciw the bookstore decorates them
3086388 what random bing facts do you offer on your tours
3086389 i point out the spine of the campus which runs from academic a to dickinson community 10 12 of students are involved in greek life during spring fling we have a pool party in the fountain with bubbles
3086390 i think so right they put bubbles in the fountain
3086391 you seem unsure of that do you ever get questions that you just dont know the answers to and if so how do you respond
3086392 i just say im not actually sure and direct them to speak with an admissions councilor or to look on the website for more information
3086393 meeting nice students and parents and when people laugh at the jokes i make
3086394 do you reuse jokes or do you just go with whatever pops into your mind
3086395 i repeat the same speeches every time unless im interacting one on one with a family
3086396 being a tour guide is a lot of responsibility you are essentially representing binghamton do you get nervous
3086397 no i dont usually get nervous my personality is very friendly and i am an articulate person so i think i represent the student body well
3086398 well those are great qualities to have how do you plan on using your experience as a tour guide for your future goal in other words what do you plan to do
3086399 it will be a good thing to put on grad school or law school applications to show that i got involved in the university and it shows that i have good public speaking skills and can handle being in front of large groups of people
3086400 any last questions i have to go be a tour guide soon
3086401 yes its probably one of the more cliche questions in an interview but what have you learned so far from your experiences as a tour guide
3086402 i believe very strongly that any approach to reforming our education system must begin with creating safe disciplined learning environments
3086403 as someone who has seen discipline problems from every angle i can tell you that this is smart policy and the governor and i share this priority as superintendent of public instruction i will do everything in my power to help hoosier teachers set the right tone in their classrooms beginning with support of this legislation
3086404 as any teacher can tell you one rotten apple can spoil the bunch
3086405 its unfair to the majority of students who want to learn that one troublemaker can disrupt an entire class period as a former teacher myself i can tell you that there is a certain fear of litigation that comes with trying to maintain even the most basic level of order in a classroom the governors proposals hit at the very core of that fear and will instill a new level of confidence in teachers that will benefit every hoosier student

3086426 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3086427 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3086428 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3086429 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3086430 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3086431 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3086432 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3086433 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3086434 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3086435 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3086436 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3086437 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3086438 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3086439 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3086440 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3086441 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3086442 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3086443 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3086444 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3086445 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3086446 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3086447 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3086448 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location

3086451 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3086452 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

3086455 a proposal put by the defence ministry to build a permanent settlement of migron nearby
3086456 we have listened to police and victims groups who have been requesting such a tool for years
3086457 compelling offenders to abide by the conditions of their release is a key aspect of our reform of canadas prison system
3086458 they want to send the society a message and i received that message
3086459 i dont think its a general feeling from all the citizens
3086460 but we have to work very hard to convince everyone that were there to help them and work with them to protect people
3086461 i have to work with all the community to find the solution
3086462 the constitution clearly expressed the more elevated position of islam over the other religions

3086466 luck wasnt on our side we played well against korea but lost we were definitely the better team today but once again we didnt get anything out of the game we just arent having any luck at the moment but thats football sometimes you win sometimes you dont so ill take the defeat sportingly
3086467 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3086468 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3086469 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3086470 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3086471 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3086472 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3086473 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3086474 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3086475 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3086476 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3086477 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3086478 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3086479 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3086480 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3086481 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3086482 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3086483 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3086484 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3086485 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3086486 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3086487 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3086488 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3086489 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3086490 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3086491 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3086492 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3086493 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3086494 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3086495 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3086496 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3086497 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3086498 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3086499 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3086500 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3086501 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3086502 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3086503 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3086504 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3086505 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

3086623 i thought that since u s is supporting georgia there would be some control over the situation in south ossetia and that there would be a peaceful solution to the conflict but what is happening there now its not just war but war crimes george bush and georgian president mikhail saakashvili should answer to the crimes that are being committed the killing of innocent people running over by tanks of children and women throwing grenades into cellars where people are hiding
3086624 the war is when military fight against military but the georgian army is killing innocent civilians this is genocide
3086625 while the ossetians claimed over 1000 dead the bbc neither reported this or any newsreel coming out of ossetia showing the destruction caused by the georgian shelling of the breakaway republic all we are getting is one sided reports of the destruction being caused by the russians
3086626 the bbc is giving carte blanche to the georgian point of view to be aired on its services while nothing whatsoever is being heard from the ossetian side the bbcs repetitive playing of a statement by george bush given several days ago without balancing these against statements from the russian side indicates where the bbc is coming from

3086631 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
3086632 in essence the americans have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals

3086777 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3086778 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3086779 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3086780 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3086781 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3086782 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3086795 my view is that the united states if we had a stronger relationship with russia we could exercise strong diplomacy to stop this effort against georgia we should immediately go to the united nations security council condemn russias action and then get the security council to pass a strong resolution getting the russians to show some restraint and possibly at the same time generate some u n peacekeeping troops the problem though is that we dont have the kind of influence and strength in our relationship with russia to persuade them this has been one of the failures of the bush administration failing to build a strong relationship a mutually beneficial relationship with russia so wed have the kind of influence to persuade them to stop some of these very very dangerous efforts within their territory

3086972 he hasnt played that much but colts offensive line coach howard mudd has liked him from day one he has been able to play four line spots for us and because he has been around he knows what were doing and thats a big plus
3086973 were hoping he can turn into one of those versatility guys who ends up being a guy who plugs in and plays a lot of places
3086974 there have been a lot of guys who have asked how hard has it been
3086975 i kind of have to shrug my shoulders because when i got here they switched positions on me i had never played offensive line it was starting from square one again so i didnt really have the experience to say the defensive line is much harder to block
3086976 i missed out on three full games of playing time i had the extra time off there to think about some things to set my priorities
3086977 now coming in liljas hurt he will be back but for now i have the opportunity to step up and show what i can do with the first group
3086978 i know it was disappointing to him that he wasnt able to play when we needed him to he had kind of trained himself for that and he knew we needed him and he wasnt able to go that was difficult for him mentally but i think it has just steeled his approach
3086979 he really looked forward to this camp and he has done well
3086980 it really took until the week after minicamp in may for me to get my head right and back in the game
3086981 taking reps with center jeff saturday and quarterbacks jim sorgi and peyton manning in summer school helped a lot to get used to everything im more involved and more comfortable with the style as a whole thats going to help our offensive line no matter whos out there

3086983 its wonderful when you accomplish one of your goals hopefully i can take this and progress throughout college

3086990 dr nkrumah was a wise intelligent and dynamic leader who would employ capitalist tools to build a welfare society if were to be alive the leadership of the convention peoples party cpp has misunderstood him and this is regrettable
3086991 there are increasingly positive signs of the ways prudent democratic governance measures institutional processes and strategies governance mechanisms are serving as core vehicle for conflict management
3086992 democratic governance programming that is blind to conflict and peace may have negative though unintended impacts on development progress and peace
3086993 politics is only useful if values principles are premised on norms but i doubt whether those who want to lead us have imbibed these values parties have failed us and lessons have not been learnt from the past events there are no democratic values and if even there are they only remain rhetorical what happened in places such as tamale and ejura sekyedumase are ample evidence that our politicians have not imbibed any lessons

3087040 understanding how elephants and other animal populations react to droughts will be a central component of wildlife management and conservation
3087041 our findings seem to support the hypothesis that older females with knowledge of distant resources become crucial to the survival of herds during periods of extreme climatic events
3087042 climate change is expected to lead to a higher occurrence of severe drought in africa and our study suggests that such extreme climatic events may act as a selection force on animal populations as animals battle to cope certain individuals such as these grand dames of the elephant kingdom might become increasingly important
3087043 its enticing to think that these old females and their memories of previous periods of trauma and survival would have meant all the difference
3087044 the data seem to support the speculation that the matriarchs with the necessary experience of such events were able to lead their groups to drought refugia

3087088 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3087089 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3087090 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3087091 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3087092 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3087093 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3087094 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3087095 ive only met her once she didnt make eye contact with me

3087098 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3087099 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3087100 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3087101 its the ability to cast white as black and black as white which is surprising the ability to cast the aggressor as the victim and blame the victims for the consequences
3087102 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages

3087111 se han propuesto otras salidas a la situaci n que no implicaban el despido de los trabajadores como por ejemplo la reducci n de la jornada laboral pero la empresa no nos ha escuchado
3087112 mostrar nuestro apoyo a los trabajadores despedidos adem s de que el alcalde se ha ofrecido para reunirse con el comit de empresa para buscar un acuerdo dialogado con cementos antequera
3087113 estamos apoyando esta movilizaci n porque pensamos que en esta situaci n el despido de los trabajadores es contraproducente ya que lo que hay que hacer es intentar mantener a los trabajadores y hay opciones que permiten mantener esos puestos de trabajo

3087153 and they didnt lower the fed funds rate or tell people to take out arms adjustable rate mortgages when they shouldnt have
3087154 what is unknown and more significant is what long term rules the sec plans to propose
3087155 in this time of economic downturn that would not be a popular outcome for wall street
3087156 the effect of this is that ebay can continue to profit at the expense of consumers and trademark holders
3087157 in our view this approach makes no sense as a matter of law or policy
3087158 be compelled to investigate and take action to protect its customers and stop the illegal conduct
3087159 the court is not unsympathetic to tiffany and other rights owners it is the trademark owners burden to police its mark and companies like ebay cannot be held liable for trademark infringement based solely on their generalized knowledge that trademark infringement might be occurring on their websites
3087160 we do not believe the law allows auction sites like ebay to continue to turn a blind eye to this problem while reaping profits from the listing and sale of counterfeit merchandise
3087161 stated trademark law does not impose a duty on tiffany to police ebays site ebay designed the site and has the responsibility to police it
3087162 it is clearly a very upsetting event that has led to indiscriminate market selling and russias perception in the west will suffer as a result
3087163 however it has no significant impact on russias economic fundamentals and corporate earnings and at the end of the day we firmly believe this is what ultimately drives the markets rather then emotions and swings in investor sentiment
3087164 this conflict will have a negligible effect on the russian economy

3087190 do not attempt to a run over the witch and by all means do not b drive over the children or you will go to jail for a minimum of one year
3087191 if the person takes a step back and pulls in his or her cane thats a definite sign that you should go
3087192 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
3087193 what else are they not telling us for fear it will hurt the democrats prospects
3087194 ryan merasa kesepian dan kangen sama novel jadi dia tulis surat buat novel dalam suratnya ryan meminta dukungan dari novel agar ryan diberikan kekuatan dalam menjalani kasus ini
3087195 iya mungkin saja tapi saya nggak tahu untuk siapa bonekanya dan bonekanya juga tidak ada di ruang saya
3087196 it is just a matter of time now i am in real fear for my own life i need things to proceed quickly
3087197 i thought she loved me but she just wanted my cash
3087198 it was like he has signed his own death warrant
3087199 his wife lived behind the main house with her thai boyfriend every time we went to visit she would come out and scream and order us away this is my house this is my land
3087200 ian knew that he was going to be murdered he had already complained that while he was away she had put something inside a beer in his fridge
3087201 he had felt ill so he sent the beer away for analysis to a local hospital he was awaiting the results
3087202 but it was an open secret in the area that ian was going to be murdered but she had a secret police lover
3087203 when i recently went home to birmingham a policeman told me perhaps your friend will not be alive when you come back
3087204 so when i went to his house on sunday and saw his car was there and the house locked up i knew then his time had come his wife came out shouting at me and my wife to go away we decided to call the police
3087205 ian was a nice and charming man always helping others
3087206 but secretly he was broke and he had nowhere to go once his home had been taken away from him
3087207 he told us all he was going to be murdered and quite frankly we believed him and thought so too
3087208 friends had brought him a stun gun a tazer to use to protect himself we wanted him to go home to england but he was spending his last pennies trying to get his property back he was due in court today
3087209 for the last three months he had been a prisoner in his own house we have been bringing him food but he has been living on mashed potatoes
3087210 ian beestons wife and a thai friend from petchabun province somchit janong 48 have both been arrested for her murder we have assured the british embassy that the investigation will be thorough
3087211 we havent announced anything for this type of cheap mini notebook and were still taking this wait and see attitude
3087212 the fact that there are a number of models coming out might give the indication that the market is growing and everybody wants to do this but whats interesting is you pull back the covers and talk to people in the industry and theyre kind of scared
3087213 if you cant grow the market with this form factor then what youre providing is a lower experience for less money which isnt good for the consumer and isnt good for the hardware maker and really isnt good for the channel as well
3087214 in previous simulations this region came out smooth but now we have enough detail to see clumps of dark matter
3087215 some of those clumps are so dense they will emit a lot of gamma rays if there is dark matter annihilation and it might easily be detected by glast
3087216 there are several candidate particles for cold dark matter and our predictions for glast depend on the assumed particle type and its properties
3087217 for typical wimps anywhere from a handful to a few dozen clear signals should stand out from the gamma ray background after two years of observations that would be a big discovery for glast
3087218 it simulates the dark matter distribution from near the time of the big bang until the present epoch so practically the entire age of the universe and focuses on resolving the halo around a galaxy like the milky way
3087219 we see a lot of substructure even in the inner part of the halo where the solar system is
3087220 every substructure has its own sub substructure and so on there are lumps on all scales
3087221 we can make comparisons with the dwarf galaxies and stellar streams associated with the milky way the appearance of these stellar systems is closely linked to the substructure of the dark matter halo
3087222 this general picture of star formation and the ability to compare how stellar objects form in different time periods and regions of the universe will eventually allow investigation in the origins of life and planets
3087223 the abundance of elements in the universe has increased as stars have accumulated
3087224 and the formation and destruction of stars continues to spread these elements further across the universe so when you think about it all of the elements in our bodies originally formed from nuclear reactions in the centers of stars long ago
3087225 dr yoshida has taken the study of primordial star formation to a new level with this simulation but it still gets us only to the halfway point towards our final goal it is like laying the foundation of a skyscraper
3087226 we must continue our studies in this area to understand how the initially tiny protostar grows layer by layer to eventually form a massive star but here the physics become much more complicated and even more computational resources are needed
3087227 greg thanks for completing your actiwatch download initialization session we are targeting next week the 11th 17th for your second week of sleep logging thanks for your participation
3087228 preliminary review indicates that we will require additional imagery for all of these targets
3087229 id like to think ive made some people pause reflect and reconsider ideas and assumptions they held as true but it would be naive to think that everyone who clicked on to the page now thinks differently
3087230 look different dress differently worship in a different way and live in the same community as them
3087231 if it resulted in a smile to a stranger or a knock introducing yourself to your neighbor then id be very proud
3087232 we have a speculative bubble in prices thats giving way to what now i think are more moderate levels
3087233 i think we look forward to a resumption of an improvement in equity prices based on still good earnings coming out of many companies
3087234 all the coffee varieties differ by the number of shots used and the amount of milk and foam to add
3087235 im afraid im not good at giving witty answers at all and so itd be a very boring interview
3087236 bloggers are the complete negative to journalists or actually vice versa
3087237 i7 handle attached so theyll officially be intel core i7 processors about maureen ogara
3087238 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3087239 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3087240 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3087241 its the ability to cast white as black and black as white which is surprising the ability to cast the aggressor as the victim and blame the victims for the consequences
3087242 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3087243 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3087244 i found this this band means a lot to me
3087245 the rise and fall of ziggy stardust and the spiders from mars
3087246 the rise and fall of ziggy stardust and the spiders from mars
3087247 they were adorable super nice too ryan and i talked for a few minutes while he was packing up his stuff and then i talked to the bassist who i was introduced to but still cant remember his name lol
3087248 aww i am so proud of you me and everyone we know
3087249 k la making me proud handing out the stickers i have no idea about any of the bands you mentioned but it sounds like you had a time and a half

3087258 typically the artemis call for entries is done in the month of january with the deadline being in early february and the actual publication coming out in april each year is a little different and when the call for entries goes out it indicates which professors are excepting entries for which genres
3087259 i believe you just submit your work to a writing professor keep an ear out for when theyll be accepting submissions or ask a liberal arts professor about it they should know more
3087260 how do you get into artemis anyway is there an editor i speak to i had a similar literary journal in high school and got my poetry published i would love to do that again at scad
3087261 i was drown in by those 6 lyrics that seem to brighten up even the darkest day i feel as passionate about music as you do i wish my life had a sound track in fact in my head it usually does yes the 90s was a cheesy romantic lighthearted time filled with wonderfully bad teen movies in which my love affair with music began
3087262 gooooooo rosa great job we listened to you while sitting here in orlando keep up the good work

3087270 ma possibile che con interent non ci sia la possibilit di guadagnare qualcosa
3087271 no one device offers the depth and breadth of entertainment that xbox 360 can deliver and we know consumers need increasingly more and more space to store the amazing digital entertainment content we provide
3087272 now the xbox 360 has triple the space to house all your entertainment needs at no extra cost
3087273 we are selling third party games and they are doing very well and better than our competitors
3087274 we want tenders for all projects to be launched by december with winners identified contracts negotiated and signed and in many cases with work started in the field
3087275 fearlessly trained his men and molded them into a effective fighting force
3087276 you cant stop 19 men armed with box cutters by invading countries with tanks bombers and missiles
3087277 i think he durston truly believes we can live in a world threatened by terrorists without using military action
3087278 choice between a combat veteran who wont send anybody to a war he wouldnt fight himself
3087279 a total breakdown of the norms of human social behavior
3087280 the question was put to me of whether we should kill him
3087281 it could have been an incident ive talked so many times with people who were there who made opposite decisions and had to live with the consequences
3087282 two weeks before a lot of people got elected in 94 nobody even knew who they were it can happen
3087283 clearly registration in a lot of districts is moving away from republicans
3087284 take back our government from the special interests that control it and to restore government of by and for the people
3087285 the best preserved and most wholly admirable castle in the world
3087286 they receive handsome pay to play deals live by their fans and often love their work so much they come out of retirement to return to what they do best
3087287 company officials are strongly considering the option of not submitting a proposal as the companys integrated defense systems sector tries to respond to the draft rfp within the governments speedy timeline
3087288 today we are able to provide financial remediation to investors who were misled by vivendis false financial reporting
3087289 its quite special to be playing as number one and i was quite excited about that
3087290 i had some problems but i managed to finish the match i will see what the doctors say and receive some treatment and see how i will feel for tomorrow
3087291 its a special dress for the olympics so its quite cool i received a lot of compliments from the girls and from the people around here
3087292 its a little bit different to what i used to wear but you get so wet from sweating thats not so nice too much humidity
3087293 i have so many supporters here that make me so motivated and theyve given me a lot of mental support particularly in todays match a very close match
3087294 my goal is to try to get the number one ranking back
3087295 i need to play well again i need to win the big matches thats what im looking at at the moment
3087296 i wanted to go to the market today but we have to play so many matches
3087297 i spoke to my manager and my coach and i decided to try my best because anything can happen
3087298 i tried and fought from the first point to the end and it happened
3087299 its unfortunate timing its very bad but theres nothing i can do
3087300 this is an individual medal its a greater achievement i was the captain of a team that won a gold but this is far bigger
3087301 i hope this will be an eye opener for all those who have followed only one sport cricket
3087302 abhinav has shown the world that an indian can also stand on the podium
3087303 it is a total result of his hard work and his family support
3087304 abhinav has the youth factor hes presentable good looking and well a gold is a gold there arent many who can beat that combination
3087305 while corporations in india are not yet making a beeline for non cricketers the gold medal will do the trick
3087306 hearty congratulations to abhinav bindra for winning indias first ever individual gold medal at the olympics he has done the country proud
3087307 thats a great effort winning an olympic medal is something really special on behalf of the indian cricket team congratulations to bindra
3087308 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3087309 any of the campaigns that would have tried to push that would have been burned by it
3087310 they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
3087311 it has been volatile even after this went into effect
3087312 im not sure it will get back to where it was a month ago
3087313 short sellers didnt make the stock go down they didnt lever up the company
3087314 and they didnt lower the fed funds rate or tell people to take out arms adjustable rate mortgages when they shouldnt have
3087315 what is unknown and more significant is what long term rules the sec plans to propose
3087316 this things going to crest a half a billion soon
3087317 we will feel mounting pressure to plunder the environment we will have a crash program to build more nuclear plants strip mine and burn more coal and drill more offshore wells than we will need if we begin to conserve now inflation will soar production will go down people will lose their jobs intense competition will build up among nations and among the different regions within our own country
3087318 this is our generations moment to save future generations from by creating a market for clean burning fuels that can stop the dangerous transformation of our climate
3087319 why did i start running for president i got hit on the head with a rock
3087320 when i woke up id made my announcement and then it was too late no im teasing
3087321 shed ourselves from the racist zionists in america they control everything but they wont keep us down any longer throw the jews in the oven this november its the only way we can free america and make sure barack obama is elected
3087322 level the playing field for the suffering palestinians many non militant arabs and muslims await some degree of fairness from you if you are elected
3087323 theyve asked him for a million dollars and i hear hes agreed to give at least 500 000
3087324 will bring the best resources from around the world with a specific focus on medicine education and the law
3087325 we want to develop the leaders of malawi who stay in malawi and help their country
3087326 we want programs that can be copied in developing countries throughout the world not just a celebrity one off
3087327 it was so long in the gestation process that by the time we were making this movie i was so excited just to be there its the most enjoyable thing ive ever done
3087328 those were all movies i grew up watching and was very affected by
3087329 i enjoyed getting in there and watching them while getting ready for this movie but this is really a comedy and lives in its own place i think sometimes in times of war people want escapism too
3087330 oh there were some hard days it rained every day we shot in a raging river and then there was the beginning of the movie with the war action scenes after the copters and bullets im in handcuffs as my character my hands tied behind my back and i have to say cut it was a pretty big day at work
3087331 since i was about 10 or 11 i wanted to be a director i always thought thats what i would end up doing later on when i wasnt acting anymore because you never know where an acting career will go
3087332 dont get me wrong i love acting too but directing is much more fulfilling as a creative process
3087333 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3087334 our voters and edwards voters were the same people they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
3087335 we asked people if your candidate is not viable what will you do 82 percent of edwards supporters said they would support another candidate and 18 percent would not
3087336 when we asked which candidate they would then support 32 percent said clinton and 51 percent said obama had this actually happened statewide obama would have been even further ahead of clinton
3087337 as the campaign progressed few edwards people gave any indication that clinton was their second choice
3087338 and obviously a campaign without edwards would have had a totally different dynamic with different foci with different media coverage for all of the candidates and so on the great thing about wolfsons quote is that it seems like it might be right but of course can never be proven one way or the other
3087339 i was wrong to vote for it i have to take responsibility for that and i do
3087340 theres not a single voter in america who doesnt understand that their president is human and their president will sometimes makes mistakes
3087341 if the most important thing to any of you is choosing someone who did not cast that vote or has said his vote was a mistake then there are others to choose from
3087342 well hes not blatantly out here but he certainly sounds gay
3087343 heads up on the locally grown recipe contest well feature your recipes in the paper and on video even if you dont win
3087344 heads up on the locally grown recipe contest well feature your recipes in the paper and on video even if you dont win
3087345 i live within 2 miles of the plant and every time i go out i see trucks coming in getting filled and going out
3087346 they have to go through residential areas to get to and from the highway its a lot of dirty noisy traffic my concern is that the increase in storage would lead to an increase in production something the company could do without getting an increase in the production limits on its permit
3087347 what we are seeking is an upgrade not an expansion in any way shape or form
3087348 we have agreed in writing to limit our future expansion to what we are currently permitted to produce
3087349 mugabe has no respect for the owners of zimbabwe and deserves no respect in these negotiations no deal will be clinched by showing him undeserved respect when he gets angry he is prone to making judgemental errors the sooner he is provoked and challenged will he attempt to prematurely terminate the negotiations or give in to the peoples demands at every turn possible it must be rubbed into him that he lost the election on 29 march and must not expect to be elected by mutambara and tsvangirai in an election convened by president mbeki in the form of mediated negotiations
3087350 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
3087351 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
3087352 this is such a fucking clich is so not really happening to me
3087353 life is like a snowball the really important thing is finding wet snow and a really long hill
3087354 the snowball how warren buffett collected friends wisdom and wealth

3087356 die stadt kann nicht so tun als w rde sie das birdland nichts angehen
3087357 der masseverwalter muss sich jetzt einen berblick verschaffen ob eine fortf hrung des betriebs im konkursverfahren kostendeckend ist
3087358 unfassbar hohe summen haben kulturstadtrat andreas mailath pokorny und b rgermeister michael h upl ber die jahre in das birdland gesteckt das nun endg ltig konkurs angemeldet hat
3087359 h upl und mailath pokorny sind sehenden auges in ein kulturpolitisches debakel gelaufen das gesamte konzept war von anfang an zum scheitern verurteilt
3087360 von der stadt hat es eine einzige investitionsf rderung gegeben die wurde brigens unter vp kulturstadtrat peter marboe beschlossen
3087361 with gasoline prices soaring interest rates on car loans rising and the economy wobbly those consumers who are still in the market for a new vehicle are opting for less expensive models
3087362 we are very excited to be working with pacifictel we currently have several customers in ecuador and have deployed thousands of units in this country during the last 12 months significant broadband expansion initiatives are already being planned by pacifictel
3087363 this account win is important for a couple of reasons firstly because pacifictel is an established ilec in a growing economy and a service provider that airspan wants to be associated with as a provider of wimax equipment secondly it is yet another new account win for airspan with our wimax solution set adding to our momentum of account growth across all regions of the world
3087364 inauguration of the 3g pilot project is a milestone in mobile technology of the country and i hope that the alleviation of poverty will be facilitated through this modern technology
3087365 you have got the frequencies earlier at almost free of cost this must not happen this time as the frequency is a national asset
3087366 do you live your life like an open book you should if you can set the right example because the best gift you can give to others is sharing your life lessons so take a page from your book of life and read it from the highest mountain for all to hear
3087367 i cant help it if im still in love with you
3087368 its still too early in 2008 to declare an album of the year but consider that lonesome song a contender for the honor
3087369 a pretty full tilt country record pre urban cowboy country
3087370 wow jessica simpson had a lot of boyfriends growing up
3087371 i have confession to make i couldnt give a hoot about the iphone
3087372 as a technology pundit and entrepreneur im not supposed to say that on the contrary im supposed to be 1 wowed by steve jobs brilliance 2 awed by the iphones cool technology and sleek packaging 3 eagerly analysing how the device is going to change the world 4 racing to make my own web business mobile friendly read iphone friendly 5 tut tutting about apples command and control approach the business just to keep by sic critical credentials up and of course 6 rushing out to get one of my own
3087373 i currently carry a blackberry because my work life is so e mail centric that i get anxious when im off e mail for too long at a stretch and of course it s now hard to imagine being without a cellphone maybe the iphone would be somewhat better for these things but it wont change the fundamentals check e mail and make phone calls thats really all i want to do on a mobile device
3087374 because my work life is so e mail centric that i get anxious when im off e mail for too long at a stretch
3087375 its hard to second guess exactly what the reasons are you can say piracy you can say user migration
3087376 but the ground truth is just that the sales numbers on the pc are not what they used to be and are not what they are on the consoles
3087377 we still think the pc is a market worth supporting but were not making decisions around the pc
3087378 its probably more of the junior partner in the cross platform strategy although obviously our day to day development is predominately on the pc
3087379 an islamic regime must be serious in every field there are no jokes in islam there is no humor in islam there is no fun in islam

3087385 we are living at a moment when the massive outward migration of the affluent that characterized the second half of the twentieth century is coming to an end
3087386 more effective communication of the findings of science and the wise use of this information in policy processes was an undercurrent in many of our discussions
3087387 another common thread in discussions with academics and government officials was that of outreach efforts to religious groups for the purpose of exploring areas of common concern and agreement there was broad interest in initiatives that could nurture such dialogue with islamic faith communities
3087388 everyone with whom we met seemed keen to explore avenues for cooperation with aaas
3087389 this has been one of the drivers of a remarkable and sustained period of economic growth an average of 7 per annum between 1997 and 2007
3087390 the irish government is committed to doubling the science establishment between 2006 and 2013 and we are at present adding 40 new research groups in our seven universities each year
3087391 as part of this drive to create a genuine knowledge based society
3087392 dublin is bidding for the title of european city of science in 2012 with serious competition from other european cities this will be centred around an event somewhat modeled on the annual aaas meeting and on the same scale
3087393 as part of that we hope to strengthen links on science issues across the atlantic and we have suggested to dr mccarthy that one theme might well be the atlantic a shared resource a shared responsibility in which the scientific challenges of managing this sea that unites us will be explored
3087394 working with our partners in europe with its strong scientific institutions and shared scientific traditions is key to addressing science and society issues that cross the atlantic and national boundaries from global challenges with climate change energy and food to science literacy and education
3087395 were playing someone who has us outmatched you cant analyze it statistically
3087396 were not showing everything so that does concern me a little bit
3087397 at the same time weve been tested for two years

3087400 recently the writer matt bai asked if barack obama means the end of black politics and talked with a lot of elected black politicians who seemed ambivalent about him because he does not seem to fit the role of race hero as they define it he seems to be a man of reconciliation not confrontation they seem to want a civil rights leader with a new coat of paint bai wrote of the rev jesse jacksons response to obamas fathers day speech in which he was critical of absent black fathers saying to jackson this must have sounded a lot like a presidential candidate polishing his bona fides with white americans at the expense of black ones something he himself steadfastly refused to do even during his second presidential run in 1988 when he captured more votes than anyone thought possible i dont know where bai was in 1988 but i was on jacksons campaign tour for the midwestern and southwestern portion i heard him say that as president he could not legislate against poor performance in school or irresponsible sexual conduct but things change we have also seen obama attacked by john mccain and heckled by black people for the same reasons that he does not appear to represent or have a special place in his platform for black americans even though he is running for president of the united states this is a remarkable moment or perhaps it is not when the republicans attack a candidate for not focusing on black americans we can only think of that as a ploy another black rabble rouser demanding that obama be true to his community is no more than the latest loudmouth mired in identity politics
3087401 the biggest challenge facing black politicians is moving into the bigger game facing the nation as a whole this might actually be done by making it clear as the civil rights movement did that the troubles and dilemmas of black americans are only the troubles of the nation in microcosm either our country will remake itself in order to sufficiently live up to the challenge of global competition or it will not the more time we spend piddling around with identity politics the better an edge we will give to china and india neither of which has misread the neon handwriting on the wall that handwriting is very clear educate your people especially in math and science produce high quality products and dont cry oppression if you have to work hard that is beyond black politics beyond color beyond special interests groups reality usually is
3087402 last week i was pleasantly surprised that a whole mob of republican leadership of the house of representatives made a stand for affordable american energy using circus like press conferences outspoken congressmen legitimately called attention to the irony that house democrats took their vacations despite the fact that many of their constituents are not able to afford vacations this summer because of energy costs on wednesday house minority leader john boehner said instead of allowing a vote on the american energy act which would promote energy production conservation and innovation to bring down fuel costs they instead chose to simply skip town and leave americans on their own to pay the price more specifcally republicans were pushing for legislation that will lift a ban on offshore oil drilling in addition they were focusing on the development oil shale fields in the west at first take i was surprised that the republicans were even interested in the issue in such a deeply engaged way as the co chair of the stop the war on the poor campaign i am committed to seeing the interests of the poor trumpeted as someone who receives no money from big oil compaines sic and a non scientist i decided to read the summary of several bills to ascertain whether the legislation proposed seemed to be reasonable i wanted to know for myself whether the needs of the american public were being ignored in favor of the interests of the rich and powerful

3087514 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3087515 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3087516 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3087517 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3087518 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3087519 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3087520 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3087521 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3087540 it is clearly a very upsetting event that has led to indiscriminate market selling and russias perception in the west will suffer as a result
3087541 however it has no significant impact on russias economic fundamentals and corporate earnings and at the end of the day we firmly believe this is what ultimately drives the markets rather then emotions and swings in investor sentiment

3087561 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
3087562 we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank including outrageous profits from 4 a gallon gas prices in the u s we should require that u s taxpayers be reimbursed for the cost of large projects
3087563 there is very much an interest in moving the financing from us to the iraqis in terms of the united states no longer being involved in the physical reconstruction business
3087564 for god commanded saying honour thy father and mother and he that curseth father or mother let him die the death but ye say whosoever shall say to his father or his mother it is a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me and honour not his father or his mother he shall be free thus have ye made the commandment of god of none effect by your tradition
3087565 and honour not his father or his mother he shall be free thus have ye made the commandment of god of none effect by your tradition
3087566 then came his disciples and said unto him knowest thou that the pharisees were offended after they heard this saying
3087567 but he answered and said every plant which my heavenly father hath not planted shall be rooted up
3087568 for in six days the lord made heaven and earth the sea and all that in them is and rested the seventh day wherefore the lord blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it
3087569 question has the church power to make any alterations in the commandments of god
3087570 answer instead of the seventh day and other festivals appointed by the old law the church has prescribed the sundays and holy days to be set apart for gods worship and these we are now obliged to keep in consequence of gods commandment instead of the ancient sabbath
3087571 who are kept by the power of god through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time
3087572 thus saith the lord keep ye judgment and do justice for my salvation is near to come and my righteousness to be revealed blessed is the man that doeth this and the son of man that layeth hold on it that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it and keepeth his hand from doing any evil
3087573 also the sons of the stranger that join themselves to the lord to serve him and to love the name of the lord to be his servants every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it and taketh hold of my covenant even them will i bring to my holy mountain and make them joyful in my house of prayer their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people
3087574 even unto them will i give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters i will give them an everlasting name that shall not be cut off
3087575 cry aloud spare not lift up thy voice like a trumpet and show my people their transgression and the house of jacob their sins
3087576 if thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath from doing thy pleasure on my holy day and call the sabbath a delight the holy of the lord honourable and shalt honour him not doing thine own ways nor finding thine own pleasure nor speaking thine own words
3087577 then shalt thou delight thyself in the lord and i will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth and feed thee with the heritage of jacob thy father for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it
3087578 and they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations and t hou shalt be called the repairer of the breach the restorer of paths to dwell in
3087579 her priests have violated my law and have profaned mine holy things they have put no difference between the holy and profane neither have they showed difference between the unclean and the clean and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths and i am profaned among them
3087580 and her prophets have daubed them with untempered mortar seeing vanity and divining lies unto them saying thus saith the lord god when the lord hath not spoken
3087581 say unto them which daub it with untempered mortar that it shall fall there shall be an overflowing shower and ye o great hailstones shall fall and a stormy wind shall rend it
3087582 hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail which i have reserved against the time of trouble against the day of battle and war
3087583 and the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven from the throne saying it is done and there were voices and thunders and lightnings and there was a great earthquake such as was not since men were upon the earth so mighty an earthquake and so great and the great city was divided into three parts and the cities of the nations fell and great babylon came in remembrance before god to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath and every island fled away and the mountains were not found and there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven every stone about the weight of a talent and men blasphemed god because of the plague of the hail for the plague thereof was exceeding great
3087584 ye have not gone up into the gaps neither made up the hedge for the house of israel to stand in the battle in the day of the lord
3087585 they have seen vanity and lying divination saying the lord saith and the lord hath not sent them and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word
3087586 and the third angel followed them saying with a loud voice if any man worship the beast and his image and receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of god which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the lamb and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever and they have no rest day nor night who worship the beast and his image and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name here is the patience of the saints here are they that keep the commandments of god and the faith of jesus
3087587 and the dragon was wroth with the woman and went to make war with the remnant of her seed which keep the commandments of god and have the testimony of jesus christ
3087588 and it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another and from one sabbath to another shall all flesh come to worship before me saith the lord
3087589 blessed are they that do his commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates into the city
3087590 thus saith the lord the holy one of israel and his maker ask me of things to come concerning my sons and concerning the work of my hands command ye me

3087625 we quite frankly didnt know whether it would be possible to bring the core essence of the franchise to handheld and have it actually work it was 20 something gameplay prototypes that were built all trying different mechanics and uses of the hardware some were pretty cool others were total disasters at some point we hit upon the idea of creating a peripheral that would have the fret buttons plugging into the gba slot of the ds

3087643 a moment of silence is not a government endorsement of religion just because someone might use the time for prayer
3087644 no student is compelled to pray under the texas law the court should dismiss this lawsuit because the parents who filed it cannot demonstrate that their children have suffered any harm therefore they do not have legal standing to challenge the statute
3087645 reflect pray meditate or engage in any other silent activity that is not likely to interfere with or distract another student
3087646 there is no evidence to support the parents claim that observing a moment of silence causes any injury to their children

3087658 you o king your thoughts came while you were on your bed about what would happen in the future and the revealer of secrets informed you what will be as for me it is not because i possess more wisdom than any other being that this secret was revealed to me but rather to make the interpretation known to the king so that you may know what has occupied your thoughts
3087659 thou o king art a king of kings for the god of heaven hath given thee a kingdom power and strength and glory and wheresoever the children of men dwell the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand and hath made thee ruler over them all thou art this head of gold
3087660 and after you will arise another kingdom inferior to you and then another a third kingdom of copper which will rule the whole earth
3087661 it will be strong yet mixed it will be a diverse empire part of potters clay and part of iron the kingdom will be divided but will be strong but there shall be in it of the strength of iron
3087662 after this i was watching and behold another beast like a leopard with four birds wings on its back the beast had four heads and it was given dominion
3087663 after this i was watching in night visions and behold a fourth beast exceedingly terrifying awesome and strong it has immense iron teeth and it was devouring and crumbling and trampling its feet what remained it was different from all the beasts that had preceded it and it had ten horns as i was contemplating the horns behold another horn a small one came up among them and three of the previous horns were uprooted before it there were eyes like human eyes in this horn and a mouth speaking haughty words
3087664 thus he said the fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon the earth which shall be diverse from all kingdoms and shall devour the whole earth and shall tread it down and break it to peaces
3087665 and the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise and another shall rise after them and he shall be diverse from the first and he shall subdue three kings
3087666 will become the public face and driving force of europe

3087674 the eu has influence over russia russia does want to be accepted as a legitimate member of the international community it is of course a member of the g8 the un security council it wants to be a member of the world trade organization it wants to have special privileged relations with the eu and with nato so it does care about what the world thinks
3087675 it needs to emphasize to russia that it should not use the conflict over south ossetia and now abkhazia to wage a bigger broader conflict against georgia itself and again we do have influence to make sure that doesnt happen
3087676 most of the people seem to be at the moment in the public buildings such as schools
3087677 there are also in georgia about 1 600 collective centers hosting some 100 000 internally displaced already there is some room in those we are also ready to provide temporary shelter if needed as well as the basic non food items such as the blankets that will be brought in jerry cans kitchen sets and so on
3087678 the situation is still very volatile and we estimate that many people need help and many are seeking safety elsewhere
3087679 therefore it is essential that unhcr and other humanitarian agencies are able to reach the affected and the displaced and that those who are indeed trapped in the conflict areas are granted passage to safer areas as soon as possible it is also absolutely essential that both sides respect humanitarian principles and ensure the protection and safety of civilians

3087682 in a biological context when two rather similar species i e energy transduction mechanisms compete for the same source of energy e g food the one with even slightly more effective mechanisms e g claws teeth feet etc captures more than the other
3087683 gradually the population of the more effective species will increase at the expense of the other
3087684 let us assume that a mutation happens to improve the speed of a cheetah
3087685 consequently this cheetah will catch more food i e more energy will channel through this individual the path has become steeper likewise a deleterious mutation will reduce the flow via the particular path that has turned less steep in this case the non mutated paths are the healthy rivalries and will enjoy correspondingly larger flows due to the diminished competition
3087686 a system evolves to reach a stationary state with respect to its surroundings
3087687 that is to say when the surrounding environment is high in energy then the system will evolve to a high energy stationary state matter on earth has evolved over eons in increasing its energy content to match that of the solar radiation density during this process mechanisms of energy transduction have improved but presumably there are still ways to catch more of the sunlight to power activities that are presently fueled by non renewables

3087724 i think a large part of the answer as to why i am a christian as opposed to following an alternative faith is exactly the same reason why i speak english rather than french or mandarin this is the culture i have grown up in
3087725 despite the atheist onslaught ed of the last two hundred years or so the roots of our culture remain christian
3087726 obviously my religious experience has some relevance for this religious revelation leading to christianity as opposed to other religions but only in that the experience was mediated understood using the christian categories which i had absorbed from culture and education or which were presupposed by them
3087727 its possible that the different faiths are paths up the same mountain with the same destination
3087728 i consider it to be a snare and a delusion to engage very much time in which is the best path

3087808 rapidly rising health care costs are not simply a federal budget problem

3087817 a number of groups that the state department has funded or collaborated with have links to entities such as al qaida hamas and hezbollah all of which are designated as terrorist organizations by the united states government

3087825 the ministry is the one that finds these mistakes they do not stay quiet about them

3087827 you just get used to it after a while you get used to living in that culture of fear
3087828 they did not die we had lost them to harassment and intimidation
3087829 the first time i got a call from state security i freaked out i was terrified
3087830 we wondered how everybody else did its interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was short listed
3087831 it raised my eyebrows a bit when mississippi was selected
3087832 obviously there were factors other than what they were looking in the site visits the group that did the site visits were scientists and know what they were looking for i dont know what dhs was looking for
3087833 we were surprised when some of the things we felt were our strengths were turned back on us as weaknesses
3087834 you told me more about the process than i know
3087835 i havent talked to anyone about it not to jay cohen or anyone
3087836 mississippis governor does not know of one dhs is in mississippi right now for a site visit and just confirmed with us that there is no scoring system
3087837 mississippi has put forth a compelling application and it does not surprise me that someone might be trying to diminish the strength of our proposal by spreading this rumor
3087838 it appears that the undersecretary responsible for this program may have corrupted the site selection process by putting his thumb on the scale in favor of a particular site and its contractor in violation of his own rules and over the objections of his own advisers
3087839 this raises the question of whether dhs is interested in bioresearch or just shameless empire building
3087840 if any of the five finalists scored lower than those eliminated from the process weve got a big problem on our hands
3087841 while i take the committees concerns to heart i do not concur with the low scores
3087842 did not appropriately consider the unique contributions certain consortia committed to make in their proposals

3087849 barack they almost always call him by his first name is special when he was just a teenager he made the long journey to his fathers village he had to ride on the back of a truck how many teenagers would do that

3087853 the narrative of the song is supposed to be more broad than my own personal experience but having crohns disease for most of my life certainly figures in to the storyline considerably
3087854 i am supposed to be made to feel like a patient but instead i feel like a target market for whichever pharmacological contrivance is being pushed this week anyone who has ever been treated for depression should be able to relate to the molten rage and resentment that occurs when you realize that your drug therapies are not only keeping you from feeling depressed they are also keeping you from feeling human
3087855 if you happen to be into the history of psychology dr menninger and the hospital that bore his name are pretty notable my grandfather was actually a student of dr menninger and worked out there for a few years back when sociopaths were still being given lobotomies and getting smothered to death with their pillows by big native americans

3087857 georgia is an ancient country at the crossroads of eastern europe and central asia and one of the worlds first nations to adopt christianity as an official religion
3087858 after a brief period of independence following the russian revolution the red army forced georgia to join the soviet union in 1922 as the soviet union crumbled at the end of the cold war georgia regained its independence in 1991 but its early years were marked by instability corruption and economic crises
3087859 there are two levels of ways to look at this what kind of leadership is needed in terms of diplomacy and what plays well with american voters
3087860 it plays to the sense that mccain is decisive and can give people a lesson in this part of the world thats obscure for many americans
3087861 its a question of the other interlocking pieces of this how did we get there one america has been at best disinterested in russias interests of late when kosovo declared its independence we completely ignored russias statements at the time when they were promising us payback
3087862 bushs own inattention and getting us trapped in parts of the world that make our deterrent capability not respected
3087863 i suspect theres not good time for anybody whos running for president to go on vacation
3087864 it is being used as an opportunity to score more points in the national security realm but i dont know that it benefits him that strongly or how much people are paying attention
3087865 fade in the face of olympic news and also economic concerns at home and summer vacations
3087866 so let it be i have to reject death and to burn the tears of the songs that are soaked with blood and to strip naked the olive trees from all the fake bushes and if i am singing for joy from behind the frightened eyelids it is because the storm promised me wine and new toasts and rainbows and because the storm brushed away the sound of lazy birds and the borrowed bushes from the standing trees and let it be i have to brag about you oh wound of the city you are the portrait of lightening in our sad nights the street frowns at my face and you protect me from the shadow and the looks of hate i will sing for joy from behind the frightened eyelids since the storm hit my homeland it promised me wine and rainbows
3087867 im happy now ive really wanted to play in the samsung world championship just in my dreams but now its a dream come true now

3087879 hay que comprobar cu l es la situaci n legal
3087880 es un intermediario por lo que no hay indicios de ilegalidad
3087881 lo que no se puede hacer es usar a los consumidores como rehenes en un conflicto entre sectores porque los consumidores han comprado un billete y ryanair lo ha cobrado y aceptado aportando adem s un localizador
3087882 we started writing new songs for this album the first week of january while simultaneously planning a mid west tour of america in february and recording our comin atcha live 2008 dvd while we were on the road coming home in march we hired terry to jump back into writing and recording music with us while we edited the dvd and routed a summer tour of europe were riding a wave of energy that doesnt come easy for a band of rookies much less a band whose been doing this for over 20 years and we wouldnt have it any other way
3087883 we jumped right back into the studio to work on forever more with terry while setting up a tour of american festival shows in july and august playing alongside bands such as matchbox twenty the wallflowers queensr che kiss and judas priest its great that we can play with any band of any music genre because weve never been pigeon holed into a style or label of music throughout our career
3087884 forever more demonstrates this idea of writing songs in a diverse fashion the title track is one of our deeper cuts complete with heavy lyrics de tuned riffs and acoustic interludes while i wanna live is one of our more uplifting songs that bounces musically and delivers a lyrical message that suggests living life to the fullest
3087885 its a real nuisance the urine has made its way into the machine and has affected it several times it then has to be cleaned up by somebody
3087886 its all fine to think this is bit of a laugh but quite frankly there is a toilet on the floor directly underneath the area hes done this hes just being disgusting
3087887 the 200 flys never easy but it wasnt a max swim i was going into it ranked sixth or seventh so i can reserve it a little bit for the semifinal
3087888 the aim was just to get through to the semifinals as long as im through im happy
3087889 weve done enough races now and ive got a good feel of the pace im going
3087890 i knew 1 55 1 56 would be enough to get through and thats how it felt i was doing as i was swimming along
3087891 its always a bit risky but if youre planning to get through to the final thats what we knew id have to do save a little bit
3087892 as i turned i saw i was a little bit behind those guys so i knew id have to pick it up a little bit yeah
3087893 four years ago in athens 2 13 would have been close to a medal so its pretty amazing that 2 13 doesnt even make the semifinals here
3087894 im happy with my race i got a new zealand record but a bit gutted that i didnt make the semi and also because i didnt finish the race how i wanted to
3087895 many teenage girls see self harm as normal behaviour according to research from girlguiding uk and the mental health foundation the report a generation under stress found girls aged 10 15 felt under pressure to grow up before they felt ready
3087896 the conference isnt all about guns but rather about teens finding faith
3087897 reading the great british press one might be forgiven for thinking that all our teenagers are binge drinking drug addled knife wielding thugs ready to leap out and stab a granny for a fiver there is a real problem with knife crime in some parts of the uk lets not pretend otherwise and there are many other problems concerning young people in this country but i thought it might be timely to remind ourselves that youth doesnt necessarily mean yob so here are ten reasons to cheer our teenagers 1 teenagers are more likely to do voluntary work than people from any other generation in fact they are 10 times more likely to be volunteering in our communities than regularly being antisocial in them 2 more teenagers than ever before are staying on at school after 16 to study 3 and more than ever are going on to further and higher education 4 despite the vilification young people are far more likely to say england is a good place to grow up in 90 than adults 71 5 and yet it is young people who are the most likely to be victims of crime 6 they work hard at school a record 62 of teenagers achieved 5 gcses grades a c last year compared with 44 a decade earlier and 26 ten years before that 7 nearly two thirds of 10 to 15 year olds have helped raise money for charity 8 according to english schools inspectors bad behaviour in comprehensives is at its lowest level for at least a decade 9 175 000 under 18 year olds are unpaid carers in the uk with some 13 000 providing more care than a full time job 50 hours 10 in a recent survey more than nine out of ten young people said they thought their schoolwork was important and more than three quarters enjoyed going to school this list doesnt mean teenagers are all little angels they arent and they never have been but it would be a shame to demonise a social group that is actually happier achieving at a higher level with better health and more opportunity for travel sport and cultural activities than any previous generation in our history

3087899 the political tsunami of march 8 general election is going to sweep dap too for its coming party polls later this month 44 new faces will challenge the 29 incumbents mostly dap old guards
3087900 the new cec will definitely be a lively mix of experience and youth and newcomers like pua liew and daps guitar playing mp for jelutong jeff ooi are quite likely to make their debut in the line up if they succeed they will lend the dap a more contemporary image that will help the party connect with the younger crowd as well as change the way non chinese perceive the party

3087905 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3087906 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3087907 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3087908 its the ability to cast white as black and black as white which is surprising the ability to cast the aggressor as the victim and blame the victims for the consequences
3087909 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3087910 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection

3088134 could ralph naders entrance and exit have helped al gore the impact of decoy dynamics on consumer choice
3088135 we found that the entrance and exit of a third option the nader effect can profoundly impact consumers preference
3088136 the presence of the third alternative shifts the focus of the customer if you have two automobiles extolling their fuel efficiency while a third promotes style purchasers pay more attention to the fuel efficiency criterion then when one of the high fuel efficiency cars leaves the market the other fuel efficient car draws consumers in the case of automobiles it might be fuel efficiency and in the case of political candidates it might be health care when the third choice exits the remaining candidate with the most similar attributes becomes the favorite even if they werent before
3088137 we also call this effect the phantom decoy effect because like pre announced software that is never released these desirable options that become unavailable may never actually exist
3088138 the increase in affinity that a product may receive when a decoy option real or not is removed can mark a significant change in consumer choice
3088139 in terms of elections even a 5 percent increase in preference makes a huge difference at the ballot box

3088173 clearly elisabeth was a victim in this as well even though she was physically unscathed he said
3088174 having to deal with this event has been hard for her
3088175 she has shown incredible strength in the last couple of days weve been able to talk through it and there have been a lot of tears and hugs the fact that shes able to get in amongst it and already be able to address what happened is a testament to her strength of character

3088194 i saw a toyota corolla car stopped on the side of road
3088195 then seconds later three military vehicles of foreign troops were about to pass the small car when a strong explosion with dark smoke blackened the area
3088196 weve won our first gold medal in womens swimming for 48 years
3088197 after hearing him speak you felt like you could do anything
3088198 we made them put a patch over one eye and they were running into one another it was quite dangerous but the players soon realized how important vision coaching was
3088199 we won the rugby world cup through a great team of people and now were taking it to the next level with the boa

3088202 thats a great mark of somebody whos going to go places
3088203 i saw katie hoff at 250m and saw her move off and i thought oh gosh shes gone
3088204 but i told myself to stick with it i was so tired but i came off the last turn and thought just go for it youve got nothing to lose just put your head down and go and i just went for it
3088205 as soon as i rang home everyone was screaming and shouting
3088206 then i got back to the olympic village the team had stuck on the door congratulations becky jo and i walked into the team meeting and everyone stood up and gave us a massive round of applause
3088207 its just so nice from somebody like mark foster who has been to five olympic games and i look up to and for him to be doing that for me is just unbelievable its every sportsmans dream
3088208 i dont want to take my medal off i walked into the dinner hall with it on and was just sat reading the internet with it on around my neck its the best day in my life so far
3088209 even if jeremy clarkson has slagged them off as chavvy

3088212 you can say cowboys are cool and hippies drool but not if youre behind the state seal of kansas
3088213 it is profiling it is discrimination it is like saying the black kids cant use the pool
3088214 but frankly it is the management of the festival were concerned about not the people there
3088215 they are making illogical and penal decisions to snuff out our event to chase our event out of town
3088216 it has always been that way but that is not really a good answer
3088217 it is hard to defend that despite the other event being three to four times larger our event pays three to four times the law enforcement bill
3088218 we had to make a statement that this is a music festival not a drug festival
3088219 weve worked really closely with law enforcement and fire and medial folks to determine what is a safe number
3088220 we have set it at 13 500 and i dont expect us to ever go over that
3088221 im not sure giving ultimatums to us is going to work that well
3088222 how to fool people with the little boy lost impressions where will that child go with his arrogance and ignorance too bad so glad he is gone

3088235 en general ser un jugador de referencia dentro del equipo por su calidad en el juego y por su experiencia en la competici n
3088236 es un gran atacante sacador y receptor pero el ataque de zona 4 y 6 son sus principales armas de competici n en el campo
3088237 con los objetivos de triunfar ganar campeonatos y de catapultarse a los m s altos niveles del voleibol

3088242 there wont be anyone left for us marriage shouldnt be about money it should be about love
3088243 but he chose me and i agreed to marry him right away
3088244 at least 20 percent of the families on the island have been lifted out of poverty
3088245 we were angry at each other in a quiet way
3088246 a marriage that is not based on love often brings problems
3088247 how can you live happily ever after when you met your husband three weeks before the wedding
3088248 any country will do ill take anyone who will accept me
3088249 we had to work no matter how hot it was no matter how much it rained from 5 in the morning until 5 in the afternoon sometimes we could only afford rice porridge
3088250 its my destiny to be poor if i had another daughter id ask her to marry a foreigner
3088251 taiwanese women want to get married when they are much older and they are also very opinionated
3088252 no one ever came on our trip without finding their dream bride

3088254 there wont be anyone left for us marriage shouldnt be about money it should be about love
3088255 that said we expect the overall commercial real estate mortgage market to continue to slowly deteriorate as liquidity is very hard for borrowers to access making refinancing hard to line up
3088256 we believe sandridges underperformance appears exaggerated though is not dissimilar from other
3088257 we view positively results from the 3 d survey as well as indications that the pinon field extends farther to the south than expected
3088258 i think peoples expectations got too high because they began to believe that these prices couldnt drop and almost the beginning of bubble mentality had taken place over the last year or so
3088259 no one knows how far prices will drop but the fact the world economy is slowing is finally getting recognized in the marketplace
3088260 the eu grand strategy is to develop georgia as an alternative route for caspian oil and gas by bypassing russia
3088261 but if georgia is no longer a safe passageway then all of these schemes for diminished dependency on russia go up in smoke
3088262 life is like a snowball the really important thing is finding wet snow and a really long hill
3088263 the snowball how warren buffett collected friends wisdom and wealth
3088264 the nine stores are located in areas where we can leverage our operations advertising and logistics
3088265 the stores are averaging 25 000 square feet and provide extended coverage in areas where the company already understands the customers needs
3088266 i dont think it is the governments business to tell you how to spend your leisure time
3088267 legalization of marijuana will come at the expense of our children and public safety it will create dependency and treatment issues and open the door to use of other drugs impaired health delinquent behavior and drugged drivers

3088278 we are seeing a significant opportunity at sidus our mortgage lending subsidiary as customers seeking trust and stability have returned to the banks for their mortgages
3088279 lending policies and procedures and credit quality will remain the key areas on which we will continue to concentrate during the remainder of 2008 and into 2009
3088280 we remain confident in our ability to manage our bank through this difficult and volatile environment there are several metrics on which we base this optimism first we believe that our net interest margin has bottomed during the second quarter of 2008 and expect it to expand over the next two quarters as 48 of our cds reprice at lower rates secondly we anticipate cost savings related to the cardinal transaction to be in the range of 750 000 over the second half of 2008 which should positively impact operating expenses we do recognize that our asset quality may deteriorate slightly during the second half of the year nevertheless for the remainder of 2008 we believe that yadkin valley will outperform the industry average recorded in the second quarter which showed nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans at 1 01 and median net charge off ratio of 0 31
3088281 she was the love of my life and her children and her family everyone who knew her
3088282 she was absolutely the love and the light and the glue of our family

3088284 she would have called to let me know she was all right
3088285 loved her kids she loved god and she loved to teach
3088286 it shows that pagans who were a minority prayed in the center of the city and lived in harmony with the jewish majority
3088287 its the best whitey has played in a long time
3088288 the one day game has made him into a bit of a fiddler and nudger trying to create runs where there arent any and his improvisation has been vital to us over the years
3088289 here he was able to play proper cricket and i thought he batted magnificently that was the andy white of old back to before he went to northamptonshire
3088290 i hope this is a big kick on for him and he carries into all the odis coming up he was a different class to anything else weve watched in this game
3088291 its all very disappointing if we had four full days play i think we would have won it ok
3088292 we never seem to win this competition without overcoming a few obstacles along the way and this has given us a new challenge we have to go to africa now and get a result either against namibia or kenya or maybe both
3088293 canada dug in well and it wasnt the easiest pitch to try and get wickets the weather conditions meant that there wasnt a great deal of pace and bounce and although there was a bit of turn players had plenty of time to adjust
3088294 it was always going to be a war of attrition and unfortunately the weather didnt give us time to bowl them out andre botha being injured didnt help our cause but weve big games coming up and i didnt want him to break down
3088295 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light save it for 2050
3088296 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot image america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3088297 her advisors couldnt execute strategy they routinely attacked and undermined each other and clinton never forced a resolution

3088309 thanks to you making me call old employers for recommendations one of them just offered me a great job
3088310 late one night i saw a job posted on the company s own web site that was perfect i applied online and the next day got a call from them i dont think i had the experience for the job i applied for but the recruiter was very nice in helping me find a position that would be a good fit
3088311 coincidentally i got a temp job at the same company as an administrative assistant for a vp in the hr department i wrote a thank you letter to the recruiter and mentioned i was working on the ninth floor for two weeks and that maybe we should meet it turned out she worked on the same floor
3088312 because i was already working there i was able to interview with 3 different people on my lunch hours and i got hired full time
3088313 i interviewed with an insurance firm and i thought they liked me as i was leaving the interview i thought i want this job im going to try something different
3088314 so i went to the front desk and asked to use their word processor the hotel secretary let me type up a thank you letter that re emphasized all the reasons i thought i was a perfect fit for the job then i paid a bellhop five dollars to take it up to mark jones in suite 101 he was the guy i interviewed with
3088315 i got the job when the hiring manager called me the next day he remembered me from the instant thank you letter i sent
3088316 sunscreens are based on six ingredients a number of which are penetration enhancers actively forcing their way through the skin
3088317 oxybenzone is approved by fda the european union and canada as a safe and effective sunscreen ingredient
3088318 this unfortunate attack on sunscreen products is an unjustified attempt to discredit an extensive long standing body of scientific data

3088323 just trying to enjoy 100 percent the experience and later try my best on court
3088324 i feel really good about the match not a lot of unforced errors no service breaks
3088325 i did the right things to come out on top
3088326 its a great thing going out there playing for your country
3088327 it was a lot i cant count but it was cool i guess
3088328 i had a lot of opportunities i didnt convert so that was tough
3088329 but i was winning the serves without problems he had more problems than me when he was serving so that gave me confidence
3088330 its just a matter of losing some matches where i feel like i shouldnt have lost
3088331 and then sometimes it plays a trick in your mind where you think maybe youre not playing that well actually but its actually not the case so its a matter of keeping yourself in a positive mind set

3088345 it is becoming more common to find presidential candidates who didnt serve in the military yet their qualifications are adequate to hold the highest office in the land
3088346 as a community organizer in the altgeld gardens public housing project in the mid 1980s obama then 23 quickly emerged as a tireless and pragmatic advocate for the community traits that characterize the kind of president he says he wants to be

3088364 theres no way you can defend in particular john edwards lack of honesty with the american public
3088365 i am going to suggest that if the democrats want to continue their fundraising dinner with senator john edwards as the keynote the dinner should be renamed the sex lies and dirty money dinner i dont think that any political party should embrace and endorse the morally bankrupt ideals of lies deceit and extramarital affairs
3088366 those values may appeal to democrats in washington d c or san francisco but this is harris county texas and we have much higher standards here i strongly urge the harris county democrat party to choose the honorable path and withdraw the invitation

3088377 he has had every opportunity to turn this company around and tap the abilities of its first class employees but instead he has run it into the ground
3088378 these dismal numbers speak for themselves they are a reflection of his inability to lead his incompetence as a manager and his failure in virtually every category that can be measured we have tried every conceivable way to convince him to invest in and maximize the goodwill of his employees he has failed miserably

3088392 it is clearly a very upsetting event that has led to indiscriminate market selling and russias perception in the west will suffer as a result
3088393 however it has no significant impact on russias economic fundamentals and corporate earnings and at the end of the day we firmly believe this is what ultimately drives the markets rather then emotions and swings in investor sentiment

3088407 however the issue i asked to be addressed in this regulation is not abortion or contraceptives but the legal right medical practitioners have to practice according to their conscience and patients should be able to choose a doctor who has beliefs like his or hers

3088465 the strike authorization vote demonstrates members solid support for their bargaining team and their strong determination to achieve a fair settlement with qwest
3088466 the truth is our leaders want a contract not to call a strike
3088467 the fact they did authorize one doesnt make it any more likely
3088468 were hopeful we will reach an agreement in a timely manner
3088469 the suspected site is contiguous to a known location in the town of newfane so it is not surprising
3088470 we should have confirmation by the end of this week
3088471 tony kornheiser is currently not on the radio he will be doing monday night football this fall and will not return to our radio stations after this
3088472 we didnt get the kind of ratings that we were looking for and therefore didnt have the revenue or the profit
3088473 this lets us move our distribution to wfed which has a tremendous growth opportunity
3088474 there have been many challenges but the greatest one is probably trying to get to know the strengths and weaknesses of the organization both on and off the ice this takes time and being around the people on a daily basis i believe any strong organization starts with good people in the right places and now that i have spent a full year here i feel that i have a better handle on our strengths and weaknesses
3088475 we are likely done adding nhl caliber roster players until we get through training camp and get a better feel where some of our young players are with respect to being ready to contribute at the nhl level if possible i believe that a nhl team should not operate close to the cap you need flexibility to deal with injuries and opportunities that may arise it is very quiet right now as it usually is in august but we are ready for any opportunities that may come our way
3088476 there are very few legitimate number one centers in the league and obviously even fewer that have been available ollie jokinen did get traded and mats sundin is a free agent but other that those two there were no other opportunities to fill that need we are pleased we were able to add r j umberger he has not been a number one center in the nhl and played mostly wing in philadelphia recently but he feels center is his natural position he wants the chance to play center and the plan is to play him with rick nash and kristian huselius we believe derick brassard will be a top two line center but he has yet to prove that at the nhl level nikita filatov has the skill and hockey sense to play as a top two line center in the future although he has played wing more than center in the elite tournaments he has told me he prefers to play center we feel that with those two players our long term future is bright but again they still have to prove it in the nhl with respect to a true offensive defenseman we believe christian backman and fedor tyutin move the puck well and eventually kris russell will help fill that void we are hoping kris takes a step this year and becomes a regular contributor on the power play
3088477 i have no doubt that kris russell is better off today having the experience of playing in the nhl last year as opposed to playing in syracuse the nhl is a very tough league for young defensemen and we were all proud of the way kris handled himself last year after earning his way onto the team i told him at the end of the season he should be proud of playing a full year in the league as a 20 year old and the struggles he went through were very typical for someone his age at that position
3088478 this question is something i have thought about i believe you have to stay true to your identity and not try and be something that you are not the combination of size and skill helped produce a stanley cup for the anaheim ducks two seasons ago right now under hitch we have developed an identity as a team that is tough to play against and that defends well and has a franchise type player in rick nash the key will be to retain that identity and add more skill as we move forward we think the addition of huselius helps in this area but our high end skill will come from our young players when they are ready to contribute on a consistent basis brassard jakub voracek filatov and russell
3088479 by acquiring i2 we double our addressable market in manufacturing to include discrete manufacturing complementing our current market leadership in process manufacturing and strengthening our retail and transportation management presence

3088484 gen y students look to their parents for advice and support and this is just another example of a trend with this generation

3088493 the fund remains a unique diversifier most growth oriented investors could benefit from including it in their mix by virtue of the fact that it wont correlate with anything they currently own it is up 7 1 year to date which is something we cant say about many other funds at this time

3088501 this general picture of star formation and the ability to compare how stellar objects form in different time periods and regions of the universe will eventually allow investigation in the origins of life and planets
3088502 the abundance of elements in the universe has increased as stars have accumulated
3088503 and the formation and destruction of stars continues to spread these elements further across the universe so when you think about it all of the elements in our bodies originally formed from nuclear reactions in the centers of stars long ago
3088504 dr yoshida has taken the study of primordial star formation to a new level with this simulation but it still gets us only to the halfway point towards our final goal it is like laying the foundation of a skyscraper
3088505 we must continue our studies in this area to understand how the initially tiny protostar grows layer by layer to eventually form a massive star but here the physics become much more complicated and even more computational resources are needed
3088506 in previous simulations this region came out smooth but now we have enough detail to see clumps of dark matter
3088507 some of those clumps are so dense they will emit a lot of gamma rays if there is dark matter annihilation and it might easily be detected by glast
3088508 there are several candidate particles for cold dark matter and our predictions for glast depend on the assumed particle type and its properties
3088509 for typical wimps anywhere from a handful to a few dozen clear signals should stand out from the gamma ray background after two years of observations that would be a big discovery for glast
3088510 it simulates the dark matter distribution from near the time of the big bang until the present epoch so practically the entire age of the universe and focuses on resolving the halo around a galaxy like the milky way
3088511 we see a lot of substructure even in the inner part of the halo where the solar system is
3088512 every substructure has its own sub substructure and so on there are lumps on all scales
3088513 we can make comparisons with the dwarf galaxies and stellar streams associated with the milky way the appearance of these stellar systems is closely linked to the substructure of the dark matter halo
3088514 the fishers go out at 5 oclock in the morning on the indian ocean trying to pass the shore break the sea has bigger and more fish but if they dont manage to pass the shore they will fish in the canal this day only a few fishers managed to pass it some kept trying for several hours the weather was particularly difficult that morning

3088528 i have maintained from the first descriptions of the material contained in the daschle letter that the quality appeared to be such that it could be produced only by some group that was involved with a current or former state program in recent years the level of knowledge expertise and experience required and the types of special equipment required to make such quality product takes time and experimentation to develop further the nature of the finished dried product is such that safety equipment and facilities must be used to protect the individuals involved and to shield their clandestine activity from discovery

3088548 we jumped right back into the studio to work on forever more with terry while setting up a tour of american festival shows in july and august playing alongside bands such as matchbox twenty the wallflowers queensr che kiss and judas priest its great that we can play with any band of any music genre because weve never been pigeon holed into a style or label of music throughout our career
3088549 forever more demonstrates this idea of writing songs in a diverse fashion the title track is one of our deeper cuts complete with heavy lyrics de tuned riffs and acoustic interludes while i wanna live is one of our more uplifting songs that bounces musically and delivers a lyrical message that suggests living life to the fullest

3088554 life isnt predictable some things just dont work out as planned setbacks happen problems show up thats just life happening to fight it is to fight the seasons but through the ups and downs there is one striking consistency we all have the power of choice liberating idea isnt it we have no power over the way some things ultimately turn out but in every hour and in every day we have the capacity to choose how we will think perform and show up and thats a ton of power and each of these choices is like a seed it gets planted and must ultimately bear some fruit every action is a cause set in motion there isnt a single choice you make that doesnt drive some result so today choose your best stand in your power to create remarkable things at work and in home remember you are not a victim you are so much more

3088738 were going to be the most successful company in radio

3088746 theres never been as much hype about a 100m dash as there is now
3088747 this is probably one of the hottest 100m in history asafa is looking good usain is running incredible times hes lighting up the track
3088748 these two guys are doing things no one has ever seen before and i fall into the category of someone who can run 9 7 too
3088749 having three guys whove run 9 7 seconds in the same race as well as two guys whove run 9 8 secs is amazing as everyone knows the world record used to be 9 9 and 9 8 but now weve got three men who can run 9 7 anything is possible
3088750 after four rounds you dont often see a world record time but this time could be different

3088972 natural gas is on the menu of possible fuels for the future

3088974 if someone can make a business out of it thats great the public benefits are rather small so i dont think our government should put much effort into promoting it

3088977 our findings seem to support the hypothesis that older females with knowledge of distant resources become crucial to the survival of herds during periods of extreme climatic events
3088978 climate change is expected to lead to a higher occurrence of severe drought in africa and our study suggests that such extreme climatic events may act as a selection force on animal populations as animals battle to cope certain individuals such as these grand dames of the elephant kingdom might become increasingly important
3088979 its enticing to think that these old females and their memories of previous periods of trauma and survival would have meant all the difference
3088980 the data seem to support the speculation that the matriarchs with the necessary experience of such events were able to lead their groups to drought refugia

3089059 mr goode or gerald goode is an administrator at a community college he comes from a long line of overeducated academic liberals helen goode is geralds wife a local activist who someday dreams of becoming an activist they have a adopted son ubuntu who is from africa they have a biological daughter named bliss she often disagrees with her parents and sometimes pokes some holes in their worldviews they have a dog who is also vegan he craves meat and often tries to eat other pets in the neighborhood

3089061 the air and artillery bombardment left the provincial capital without water food electricity and gas horrified civilians crawled out of the basements into the streets as fighting eased looking for supplies
3089062 i thought that since u s is supporting georgia there would be some control over the situation in south ossetia and that there would be a peaceful solution to the conflict but what is happening there now its not just war but war crimes george bush and georgian president mikhail saakashvili should answer to the crimes that are being committed the killing of innocent people running over by tanks of children and women throwing grenades into cellars where people are hiding
3089063 the war is when military fight against military but the georgian army is killing innocent civilians this is genocide
3089064 while the ossetians claimed over 1000 dead the bbc neither reported this or any newsreel coming out of ossetia showing the destruction caused by the georgian shelling of the breakaway republic all we are getting is one sided reports of the destruction being caused by the russians
3089065 the bbc is giving carte blanche to the georgian point of view to be aired on its services while nothing whatsoever is being heard from the ossetian side the bbcs repetitive playing of a statement by george bush given several days ago without balancing these against statements from the russian side indicates where the bbc is coming from
3089066 georgia is an outpost of us and nato forces on the immediate border of the russian federation and within proximity of the middle east central asian war theater south ossetia is also at the crossroads of strategic oil and gas pipeline routes
3089067 georgia does not act militarily without the assent of washington the georgian head of state is a us proxy and georgia is a de facto us protectorate
3089068 in yesterdays attack the advancing tanks were supposedly crewed by ukrainians two unidentified bodies found today are said to have black skin possibly they are americans but we cant say for sure yet we will be able to publish the official conclusions after carrying out special tests
3089069 there are lots of bodies over there a lot of people have been killed mostly ossetians but also georgians they had american emblems on their forearms and they were in black uniforms
3089070 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
3089071 in essence the americans have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals

3089149 it is clearly a very upsetting event that has led to indiscriminate market selling and russias perception in the west will suffer as a result
3089150 however it has no significant impact on russias economic fundamentals and corporate earnings and at the end of the day we firmly believe this is what ultimately drives the markets rather then emotions and swings in investor sentiment
3089151 this conflict will have a negligible effect on the russian economy
3089152 i cant write about it just yet because my heart is too full

3089167 the eu grand strategy is to develop georgia as an alternative route for caspian oil and gas by bypassing russia
3089168 but if georgia is no longer a safe passageway then all of these schemes for diminished dependency on russia go up in smoke
3089169 the first significant break in russias previous monopoly control over all oil and natural gas from the caspian sea states
3089170 azerbaijan and georgia for example rely on this pipeline for the political independence they often act out
3089171 an alternative pathway for the flow of caspian oil and gas to the west
3089172 georgia has been one of the leading recipients of u s military aid ever since

3089185 theres a variety of tactics that employers have been employing over the last three to six years that has had an impact on the market
3089186 pretty much every employer has to do something or is doing something in an effort to bring that number down
3089187 it is encouraging that the growth in health care costs is going down but there is still more work to be done
3089188 when costs go up as great as this theres a lot of market pressure brought to bear on all of the parts of the market to bring those costs down and i think thats whats been happening over the last six years or so
3089189 now were focused on the weak demand side of the equation

3089195 we are being a penny wise and pound foolish by not spending more on prevention
3089196 this wasnt just a big national problem this was a big problem in florida
3089197 its not just more government spending for the sake of government spending
3089198 where congress comes in is to keep on top of it
3089199 from that standpoint congress bears some blame for the lack of oversight
3089200 if you increase the money for oversight then it looks like youre fattening up the bureaucracy even when its really for oversight and fighting fraud
3089201 the more decisions are made out of washington the more stakeholders you have in what congress says
3089202 i know a lot of these people at these trade associations they dont like fraud any more than anyone else but theyre there to fight for their constituents and to make sure they get the good end of the lollipop
3089203 there are so many individual stakeholders who will oppose any reform if they think it will affect their interests adversely
3089204 our members called their congressmen and said this is going to put us out of business
3089205 it was an issue of fairness in allowing these providers to continue to serve their patients
3089206 it did harm to small business people about two thirds of the bids were thrown out because of technicalities
3089207 you got the feeling it was put together hastily and not well thought out
3089208 once you move it to a competitive marketplace its difficult to say that youre overpaying for this or underpaying for that because its not the government thats determining the price
3089209 here is the important lesson to take away from this
3089210 having your voice listened to is a privilege not a right and its a privilege thats earned in proportion to the contribution level not volume level
3089211 we were looking for quotations that were accessible and that had popular appeal on a global scale we were also looking for wit and delivery delivery is important
3089212 well its not the men in your life that counts its the life in your men

3089245 i think the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking
3089246 i think the market realizes this kind of pressure from congress may in fact lead to a change in policy
3089247 the republican members did not answer questions about whether they would take the blame if gas prices go up again
3089248 u s average retail gasoline prices fell over the past two weeks and could ease further in coming weeks if the price of crude oil keeps dropping
3089249 lundberg noted that recent fuel price increases in china india and other developing economies have impacted overseas crude oil demand which in turn has led to the fall in global crude oil prices
3089250 moslems are everywhere run for your lives unless your not me then go fuck yourself
3089251 we are only now able to discuss conditions based time horizons because security has improved so much this would not have been possible 18 months ago
3089252 theres a variety of tactics that employers have been employing over the last 3 to 6 years that has had an impact on the market
3089253 pretty much every employer has to do something or is doing something in an effort to bring that number down
3089254 it is encouraging that the growth in health care costs is going down but there is still more work to be done
3089255 when costs go up as great as this theres a lot of market pressure brought to bear on all of the parts of the market to bring those costs down and i think thats whats been happening over the last six years or so
3089256 to me that was a strong indication of her love she is a fabulous person
3089257 very very very happy to report her condition is upgraded
3089258 theyre not at the point where they want to discuss the specific nature of the injuries
3089259 we are extremely grateful for the outpouring of assistance and generosity that we have received and hope to convey our appreciation to everyone who has supported us and kept us in their thoughts and prayers
3089260 beijing is a safe city but unfortunately we are not immune to violent acts
3089261 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot
3089262 were listening to as many people as we can to try to get more ideas about how we can help spur on floridas economy
3089263 were listening and learning from them and i think thats important to do every day
3089264 empty chair charlie is so out of touch with florida he does not even get why he is out of touch
3089265 in this time of economic uncertainty floridians want real leadership and concrete ideas on how to end the republican recession not photo ops and publicity stunts
3089266 at a minimum bush could tell floridians correctly that he was doing what he could recognizing that governors have a very small role in directing the states economy charlies in a tougher spot because there is no discretionary money
3089267 i think the real issue is not the listening tour but is it a hearing tour
3089268 the public has to believe the governor feels what they feel and cares what they care
3089269 when hurricane katrina is there youve got to be on the ground youve got to have the smell of the flood in your shirt
3089270 is that symbolic it sure as hell is but its very important to show that youre concerned because for the floridian and the voter that makes that difference

3089273 i think that so far theres not been much talk about the people affected by the buyout
3089274 i definitely think that there could have been a better outreach
3089275 you cant say were going to pass a law that is going to fix everything
3089276 symbolism matters a lot in politics its important that people know their elected officials are paying attention
3089277 i think we should be favourites to win this game
3089278 with such a massive square it is quite a quick scoring ground and i think if we get our heads down and bat well then we should certainly knock 197 off
3089279 a lead of 250 260 would have been dangerous but the balls in our court
3089280 i wanted us to get to a lead of 250 but im happy with a 197 target and i really think weve got a good chance our bowlers still havent been where we know they can go in this series and this would be a good time for them to hit their straps

3089334 wheres my mind when you need it to come up with a name
3089335 i thought up the name queen its just a name but its very regal obviously and it sounds splendid its a strong name very universal and immediate it had a lot of visual potential and was open to all sorts of interpretations
3089336 rock should be heavy enough for the boys and sweet enough for the girls
3089337 you can say cowboys are cool and hippies drool but not if youre behind the state seal of kansas
3089338 it is profiling it is discrimination it is like saying the black kids cant use the pool
3089339 but frankly it is the management of the festival were concerned about not the people there
3089340 they are making illogical and penal decisions to snuff out our event to chase our event out of town
3089341 im not sure giving ultimatums to us is going to work that well
3089342 there is no thrill in the hunt for me any more
3089343 how many flies does it take to screw in a light bulb
3089344 there really isnt much of a hunt to it any more these kids now days are all either street punks runaways teen hookers or junkies you can swing a dead cat and hit one of the little bastards huddled up in the corner of an alley because they are to goddamn stupid to find a coat and too goddamn stubborn to go home
3089345 i thought it was just me that felt that way
3089346 no i have felt that way for about thirty years now and it just keeps getting worse this world has no bloody respect for old men and even less for men like me makes a man want to go out and tear out all of their worthless cold dead hearts and shove them back down their throats just to get them to feel something
3089347 capable maybe willing oh yes able indeed so lad but i have developed this terrible thing called morals you know that thing most people set aside early in life so they can get what they want and not feel guilty for it
3089348 yes i know it all to well but i thought that was ethics
3089349 is subjective to the time place and circumstance a man of morals is ever so regardless of circumstance dont you ever forget the difference boy
3089350 you believe in morality you only kill when you must but what of the simple moral dilemma of what you are what of god

3089354 i eat three times a day i like rare steak extremely rare not always human in fact it has been a while since i had human meat like i said i dont like the choices around here
3089355 what of the hunger i thought the hunger was always there i thought it was necessary for you to feed or you would die
3089356 you really have a lot of ass backward information about us the hunger just like with a vampire is ever present the difference is that a vampire is a vampire all day every day werewolves are only in our beast form once every full moon werewolves are not like vampires a vampire is consumed with a constant lust for blood yes i always hunger but it is only uncontrollable when the moon is full it is then that i must hunt the rest of the time i am practically a vegetarian we werewolves can be a tad more discriminating
3089357 for a vampire it is all about the blood for a werewolf it is all about the meat a vampire is a little like an alcoholic he will drink just about whatever presents itself when he is thirsty i can be a tad more choosey tell me kid have you ever eaten a moldy hamburger or chewed on a gristly or fatty steak try fat guy or old woman it is ten times as repugnant
3089358 long ago i met this sweet young lady in the park it was midnight and she was just passing through from one street corner to the next when i saw her her name was suzette she was a catholic girl her parents had raised her to be pious but they had not raised her to stay out of dark parks at midnight
3089359 i still remember her scent it was the scent of untouched faith mixed with lilac body lotion there is nothing quite so appetizing as the scent of pure untouched nubile female
3089360 do you think these the romantic fantasies of a doddering old man
3089361 you have no sense of style no sense of romance no sense of the true meaning of darkness
3089362 he stood abruptly and walked to the other side of the room turning his back on me

3089365 that young sir is because you are not looking deep enough werewolves age at a slightly decelerated rate compared to humans

3089367 please forgive me i meant no disrespect earlier i just had this funny flash of one of those old b flicks in my head when you described the scene
3089368 you have an ingrained notion of what it is to be me just like everyone else out there and those horror flicks websites and books by less than knowledgeable authors really dont help matters i think it is time you asked me what is really on your mind

3089384 absolutely it was definitely worth it the law itself needed to be changed and with the legislators help we got some of those things changed was it worth it for us i think in the long run it was an expensive process to go through but you look 30 years down the road you dont look one year down the road

3089405 the office agrees that the ruling in the cartoon network case may be pertinent to the issues raised in this rulemaking
3089406 and that interested parties should be given sufficient time in which to consider and comment upon the implications of that ruling therefore the office has decided to extend the deadlines for submission of comments
3089407 in the case of a vcr it seems clear and we know of no case holding otherwise that the operator of the vcr the person who actually presses the button to make the recording supplies the necessary element of volition not the person who manufactures maintains or if distinct from the operator owns the machine

3089409 today am and fm radio stations pay zero royalties to artists when they play their songs over the air
3089410 that means every time you hear a song no performer from the front man to the session musicians is compensated as a point of reference that same song played over the internet satellite radio television or in any other western democracy would earn a royalty for the artists and musicians that brought the music to life in fact when those same am and fm radio stations that broadcast music for free stream performances over their web sites they pay a royalty for those songs but continue to refuse to do so when they play it on your traditional radio corporate radio is the only music platform getting a free ride

3089412 this case demonstrates that the commission will aggressively seek out and pursue affinity frauds it is also a signal to investors to be wary of friends touting great investment opportunities in this case wextrust purported to be a globally diversified private equity and specialty finance company specializing in investment opportunities ranging from real estate to specialty finance and investment banking the reality as alleged in our complaint was very different
3089413 our complaint alleges an affinity fraud of very large scale in this case one of the defendants used his extensive connections in the orthodox jewish community to solicit more than 250 million from unsuspecting investors affinity frauds are especially pernicious because the victims tend to let their guards down in circumstances where they might otherwise proceed with much more caution

3089511 the note reports that obamessiah has a number of ex judas and other assorted faux disciples to accomodate for the denver convention chiefly the clintons now that john edwards has self destructed but will leave a bad odor around the convention with the unanswered questions
3089512 security technologies such as anti virus and anti spyware solutions are effective once malicious code has been identified and confirmed as a mainstream threat and these vendors are doing their best to keep up with the rapid onslaught of new threats
3089513 however because they are predominantly reactive in nature they will continue to fall short when it comes to protecting against real time and zero day threats no solution will ever be 100 percent effective but by adding proactive intelligence gathering techniques to these defensive anti virus technologies the gap between infection and protection can be greatly reduced

3089516 attack took about half of the day i e a bit less than 10 hours
3089517 so if you have a gige lan any trojaned machine can poison your dns during one night
3089518 while i think its bad that anybody who can hammer you at gige speed for ten hours can poison your cache its not a threat to the real world the way 11 seconds at 10 megabit was
3089519 any dns server with a host based firewall can implement a 100 effective mitigation for the polyakov attack and its possible that an upstream outboard firewall could also be made to do it
3089520 at some point isc will have to put logic like this into bind of course but protecting against the polyakov attack is like synflood protection in that its a rate limit problem

3089537 barack obama is about to make one of the most important decisions of this campaign choosing a running mate
3089538 you have helped build this movement from the bottom up and barack wants you to be the first to know his choice
3089539 once youve signed up please forward this email to your friends family and co workers to let them know about this special opportunity
3089540 no other campaign has done this before you can be part of this important moment
3089541 be the first to know who barack selects as his running mate
3089542 by a slight but statistically significant margin 22 to 16 people say that recently they have a less rather than more favourable view of the putative democratic nominee
3089543 pews respondents said they want to hear more not less about the republican candidate
3089544 the bad news bears before they became good news bears
3089545 there are so many more players who have to come in on major buying decisions and theyre all trying to cover their butts
3089546 early on most salespeople ask when a prospect plans to buy
3089547 but few reps will cycle back and ask it again
3089548 you had told me you planned to buy by september 30th is that still your target
3089549 most inventory reports sort by part number would it help you to be able to sort by last date of use
3089550 so many salespeople are overwhelming buyers by leading with the product
3089551 instead the product should be proof of the vision youve created for how their problem will be solved
3089552 its easy to load up a retailer but the plans were proof that theyd actually sell the stuff
3089553 this was going to affect his workload and how he was judged and monitored
3089554 being a thoughtful technical buyer he wanted to understand how everything was going to lay out
3089555 if your client thinks that what youre selling falls in the nice but not necessary category youve got to try to deepen the need
3089556 hell probably say things like its too soon to start thinking about that
3089557 i dont even know yet if im going to lose my job
3089558 well im 50 and ive been with the company for 14 years im afraid it wont be easy to find another position
3089559 youre really trying to get the prospect to see the value of action versus the cost of inaction
3089560 whats a big business problem you havent been able to solve
3089561 maam we could have recovered this limb if you had come in 2 weeks ago when she first broke it
3089562 without this what would i be without this what kind of blog would i have without this would i have a blog that i would want linked to his and his most important friend
3089563 thecheappop com is a terrific site for pop culture news with lots of original material all written with wit and good nature its been running strong since october 2005 in web terms a near miracle of staying power
3089564 saying goodbye to phone books means omni hotels will preserve approximately 217 200 pounds of paper each year
3089565 our goal is to preserve more than 18 000 trees over the next decade we feel good about the impact this initiative will have on the environment
3089566 the world is changing and how we measure that change economically and financially is clearly a challenge and an opportunity we have seen a reweighting of risk around the world but the world itself is being economically rerated and so we need an index that allows investors to take advantage of these changes indian companies will obviously have a place in the global dow as will companies from other emerging countries where we have seen an unprecedented economic emancipation over the past two decades
3089567 while we must reflect the global stock market as it is we must also recognize the rapid rise of companies in countries such as india we have already seen great indian companies acquiring famous brands such as jaguar and land rover but these developments are just the beginning of a long term trend that will fundamentally change the international corporate landscape as with the dow jones industrial average the component choices for the new index will be based on the editorial judgment of the worlds leading business journalists that is dow jones journalists
3089568 the number of women reporting that they receive less pay than their male counterparts has changed little over the last two years
3089569 while companies have taken great strides to address equality in the workplace there is still a lot of work ahead companies understand the value of having a diverse workforce and many are scrutinizing and improving their recruitment compensation and promotion practices
3089570 many indian businesses from blue chips to middle market companies are keen to explore opportunities to expand their business both domestically and abroad which plays well to credit suisses strength of combining local expertise and global reach these hires will further strengthen our ability to take full advantage of this important market opportunity
3089571 transpromo is the hot topic but the question everyone has is how do you do it
3089572 my presentation and those of our customers focus on the journey from the decision to create integrated customer communication using transpromo techniques to the final execution of a financially successful program
3089573 we think the crop circle is a perfect visual for communicating papa johns use of 100 whole grains to make our new whole wheat crust pizza
3089574 were very proud to be the first pizza company to offer a whole wheat crust pizza nationwide that combines great taste with the natural nutrition of whole grains the benefits of whole grains are many and we hope this sends a positive message to kids heading back to school people flying in to denver for the dnc and health conscious consumers everywhere
3089575 this was an incredible opportunity for me to showcase the beauty of a colorado wheat field through the style of art i enjoy creating most
3089576 fortunately papa johns was willing to allow me to lead the design of the image which was important to me and after i got the opportunity to meet the folks involved i knew this was going to be an amazing project
3089577 consumption is now starting to rise as americans discover a wide range of new whole grain choices that are quick and delicious
3089578 our 100 whole grain stamp makes it easy to find products like the new papa johns whole wheat crust and to see at a glance the amount of whole grains they contain
3089579 we are delighted to partner with one of koreas retail leaders
3089580 we believe our new ssg citicard quattro is an attractive card offering that includes a wide range of universal benefits as well as reward programs that can be customized by the cardholder according to his or her personal taste
3089581 our research identified a significant gap between what people say and what they do when it comes to protecting sensitive information online
3089582 personalising content and delivering relevant advertising online will only succeed for consumers and for advertisers if it is done in a trustworthy and transparent manner in addition business and government will need to offer approaches that recognise that at certain times personalisation and data use will be welcomed and in other cases users will demand limits on the use of their data
3089583 by taking a practical down to earth approach to data protection and privacy we can simplify good practice for the majority of organisations who seek to handle personal information well
3089584 visual studio 2008 sp1 and the net framework 3 5 sp1 had an extremely positive impact on our ability to develop a web based application that our customer misys healthcare systems could use to manage patients records in fact it helped us boost development speed by 60 percent
3089585 the microsoft asp net ajax improvements and new capabilities such as ado net entity framework and ado net data services meant we didnt have to worry about any of the underlying plumbing and could simply focus on building a highly responsive and interactive experience for users
3089586 the beauty of the net framework has always been that it makes it easier for developers to build applications that are visually stunning well connected and highly secure
3089587 however we want to make sure we are keeping the end user experience in mind as well which is why we created the net framework client profile the net framework client profile significantly speeds up the installation of windows and enables a much more consumer friendly experience this is a huge step forward for the more than 4 million net developers worldwide
3089588 using the entity framework has significantly sped up our development cycle by removing a lot of the custom code we have to write
3089589 the entity framework took away the tedium of having to write standard data access code and business objects which gave our team a big productivity boost
3089590 john tonight theres someone up there moon looking down at us
3089591 no one can call us with the phones down so our work is just piling up while we sit here
3089592 hey we have our mobile phones if its not important enough for them to look up our numbers then why worry about it
3089593 you know thats not how itll happen as soon as the phones get up wham were here until the sun drops below the trees in the west
3089594 theyve been down for two hours perhaps theyll be down all day and we can leave early
3089595 you arent going to bug the phone people again are you
3089596 daniel williams wanted to talk to me today so im heading up to his office
3089597 im going to talk you through what im doing and i dont want you to interrupt until im done okay
3089598 first ive discovered what password i can use to access amt on all our vpro enabled computers
3089599 i dont have access to altiris though i have tried to gain it unofficially of course
3089600 in light of that ive done some googling and found that amt has a web interface that anyone can access using a browser i havent figured out how yet but i dont think itll take me long lets see how to access amt via a browser this first hit talks about someone who is unable to access it
3089601 no but no need for you or tevita to worry about that
3089602 i believe i used the same methods our traitorous employee working in cahoots with nifty networks used to gain these powerful credentials ill be conducting security training for our employees soon to try and plug that method
3089603 good question but the better question im posing to you is this how can we better secure the amt technology see here under remote control i can remotely reboot this persons system and boot it up into an application i can use to wreak havoc nifty no
3089604 good you see the issue im tempted to not tell you how i did it mystery lends me an air of the supernatural or at least my uber geekness why reveal how thats like a magician revealing his secrets once the how is known it isnt so magical anymore okay so im taking far too much pleasure out of this i simply watched you and tevita closely and caught you entering the password it took several tries before i finally got it right
3089605 as i said before dont worry about it everyone is too trusting when entering passwords ill address that in our upcoming security meeting what i want to discuss is how we can rectify this situation specifically i want to remedy the fact that anyone who does a smidgen of research will know that the administrative username for amt is admin weve handed any potential hacker one half of the credential equation
3089606 yes i see your point luckily i already know how to fix that its as simple as making the admin password random on each system and using kerberos to use our domain credentials for access
3089607 good the second point is i noticed that i can use a non secure web address to access this can you get ssl enabled for all amt communication
3089608 yes specifically amt uses tlc the successor to ssl i believe i saw an article on how to enable that on symantec juice
3089609 even better get those measures in place and let me know when its completed
3089610 im enabling tls you know encryption when i enable it on the server side the clients will not be able to communicate back with the server until i update the profile and they have the right certificates
3089611 is that such a good idea certificates are tricky we could easily mess up the whole thing and have no amt access
3089612 tevita it isnt that complicated i have all the altiris documentation on how to do it besides theres a specific article on how to do it after the installation here http juice altiris com article 2737 how enable tls within out band management after install piece of cake
3089613 trust me if we had a hierarchal structure of certificate authorities it might get a bit dodgy but im just setting up the one root
3089614 yeah and the flux capacitor needs just such and such gigawatts of power
3089615 i dont know anyone who understands it all that well
3089616 its really simple we give the root ca aka the king the credentials that are acceptable secondly the altiris server gets the credentials so it can work with the ca and the clients we then load the matching credentials on the clients via the provisioning profile now everyone has the credentials
3089617 again simple communication is unidirectional for a given parent child certificate set with basic tls in vpro all the clients have server certificates the altiris server uses a client certificate to authenticate with the client so that the client machine will accept the amt commands sent it
3089618 alright that sounds simple enough but what about the ca whats that for
3089619 whats with the third degree tell me master qui gon what are midichlorians
3089620 am i that transparent i didnt know you liked starwars
3089621 i dont like that movie quote your questions are contrived
3089622 hehe yeah im just trying to prove a point its not that simple
3089623 but it isnt that complex either the ca tells the server side component the amt client if the client connection from the altiris server is to be trusted i know having the amt clients act as the server seems a bit backwards but since we want amt functionality to be secure it makes sense the altiris server that tells amt what to do needs to prove itself this ensures a rogue server cant just initiate any amt functionality without having the proper certificate so the server provides a client certificate which the amt system authenticates with the ca before allowing the altiris server in
3089624 okay okay that sounds simple enough ill be sure to avoid amt until next week when you get tls finally working kidding take it easy im just joking
3089625 probably not he didnt threaten anyone or do any actual damage and the price of the hard drives he tried to steal doesnt equal enough to be a felony especially since he claims he was only after the hardware
3089626 but why come back here we know who he is
3089627 maybe but that other guy gives me the creeps i wouldnt be surprised if his name happens to be lex luther
3089628 no way lets just call security and let them deal with it
3089629 the security company might be too slow to respond heck they took forever to show up when our ninja friend showed up the first time you go tell bobby and ill shadow these two shifty guys
3089630 many of our hamline staff members have a lot of social contact and out of class contact with students
3089631 this is an opportunity for our staff to experience what our students go through when they study abroad what our international students are experiencing on our own campus and just to discover what its like to be in a place where people dont necessarily look speak or live just like they do
3089632 as the compliance industry continues to grow employers are increasingly hiring certified compliance professionals because the certification shows that these professionals have the required commitment and training
3089633 as the trend toward requiring business compliance officers grows hamlines health law institute is in a leadership position to meet this important educational need
3089634 its thrilling that two of our hamline students have been awarded this prestigious scholarship
3089635 these are exemplary students who will use their study abroad opportunities to enrich not only their college experience but their entire lives
3089636 i think spain will be an incredible place to teach and for me to learn especially after my experience in chile
3089637 they are both spanish speaking countries and post dictatorship societies but on different continents
3089638 he just kept pushing me and sometimes it was really tough
3089639 he gave a lot of constructive criticism but when i was praised by him the satisfaction was unexplainable and when i look at where i am now i know that if it wasnt for that intensity that he has advising students to be vigilant about their studies i may not have reached this level

3089649 now once more the belt is tight and we summon the proper expression of horror as we look back at our wasted youth sometimes though there is a ghostly rumble among the drums an asthmatic whisper in the trombones that swings me back into the early twenties when we drank wood alcohol and every day in every way grew better and better and there was a first abortive shortening of the skirts and girls all looked alike in sweater dresses and people you didnt want to know said yes we have no bananas and it seemed only a question of a few years before the older people would step aside and let the world be run by those who saw things as they were and it all seems rosy and romantic to us who were young then because we will never feel quite so intensely about our surroundings any more

3089656 this years olympics is a great stepping stone on the path to glory in 2012 the swimming team is better placed this olympics than it has been for several olympics
3089657 i said publicly at the olympics in athens the swim team have tried hard and have many lessons to learn we will see if they have
3089658 great britain has sent a team of medal chances 2012 is the next key target but we need to step forward from the 30 medals we won in athens we will win more on the track than any other discipline but we need to find heroes that will replace daley thompson steve cram kelly holmes and linford christie
3089659 let the games begin and yes our athletes will beat the swimming team in beijing and london
3089660 we are eager to build our boeing fleet with these additional 737s and 767s to meet continued demand for air travel in our region

3089662 today running tracks are genuine high tech sports equipment they must neither be too hard nor too soft but they must be sufficiently elastic to generate a catapult effect that returns the largest possible amount of energy introduced into the track surface back to the athlete

3089666 lets do what we want to do and then simply talk about it in their language and ideas
3089667 since in their worldview they do not think what we are doing is possible they will think we are doing what they want us to be doing because we are talking their language we will be left alone to do exactly what we want to do right under their noses they will be happy and we will be happy without there being any need for confrontation soon they will discover that we are growing and they are not because they are stuck standing there watching us
3089668 how can we do this in a way which works fully for those in the enterprise and those in the community rather than for one more than the other
3089669 if these ideas are true what kind of an organization does it suggest
3089670 work is the means adopted for attaining a higher level of satisfaction for human aspirations and demonstrating collaboration with the other members of the community to promote the common good to ensure that it is contributed freely productively and in a manner that makes everyones collaboration viable the members shall respect its discipline namely a hierarchy
3089671 when humans are confronted with conflict their mind brains shift to a very primitive and highly reactive way of thinking called the
3089672 system of human organization that creates a conflict free environment for decision making and action implementation

3089883 why dont parents trust the video game industry as much as they trust the adult entertainment industry or the alcohol industry
3089884 to some parents video games are full of unknowable dangers while researching for grand theft childhood parents we spoke with in focus groups often bemoaned the fact that they didnt know how to use game controls and felt unequipped to supervise or limit video game play of course parents dont want their children drinking alcohol but thats a more familiar risk
3089885 i have found no joy in football since i returned from russia so i would rather not stress about the game anymore i am finished with football even my manager hasnt helped either and nobody wants me anymore in football so i suppose i should say it was nice while it lasted

3089888 i dont know why players coming back from europe are not properly utilised so that the country benefits from their experiences how come people like lucas radebe and phil masinga are not involved in the mainstream systems of football in the country i fail to understand this

3089899 there is no question of going back on our stand for removal of khanduri he has not been able to win over even one minister to his side after the panchayat results are out we hope the central leadership will replace khanduri without any pressure from us
3089900 there are no plans for a change in leadership the grievances of the mlas have been heard at highest level and their points would be taken care of

3089926 we must regulate you with fat user fees because you are wastrel and polluting
3089927 as usurpation is the exercise of power which another hath a right to
3089928 us presidential runoff john mccain said that russia should not interfere in the conflict in south ossetia the pro georgian propaganda in the us media testifies to the same opinion it brings up the idea that the georgian aggression against the unrecognized republic of south ossetia has been coordinated with the us administration
3089929 the international community collectively held their breath waiting for the reaction of russia after the savage brutal criminal attack by georgia on south ossetia after having offered a cease fire in hostilities the back stabbing georgians immediately violated the cease fire invading south ossetia and causing massive destruction and death among innocent civilians among peacekeepers and also destroying a hospital at approximately 11 30 p m moscow time georgians opened fire with heavy artillery from the side of the georgian villages of ergneti and nikozi against the city of tskhinval the defense ministry of south ossetia announced on thursday georgian troops attempted to storm the city much as hitlers panzer divisions blazed through europe also noteworthy is the fact that georgian tanks and infantry were being aided by israeli advisors a true indicator that this conflict was instigated by outside forces
3089930 ask anyone in the caucasus region and they will tell you never to trust a georgian because they would shake your hand with a smile and then stab you in the back on friday morning we saw a perfect example of this treachery when hours after declaring a ceasefire georgian military units launched a savage attack on the civilians of south ossetia
3089931 the number of mutations neodarwinism requires to evolve a species
3089932 a cave in malta contains so many fossils that maltas present size would not keep this awesome quantity alive for just one week in america a death pit exists near hollywood with eagles doves and approximately two hundred and fifty saber tooth tigers and fifty elephants
3089933 incidentally when the spaniards migrated to america there was not one elephant to be found and not one single horse in america and yet horses have been found buried and fossilised by the hundreds and thousands in america
3089934 the geologic column was formed with great rapidity in a matter of months
3089935 so there is an open cast coal mine in germany that has a tree going through the layers of sedimentary deposit i find that very interesting and a valid challenge however name the place in germany somewhere in germany is not good enough it is rather a large place especially after unification once the location is known then i am sure there will be throngs of scientific experts examining this challenge to their current beliefs
3089936 re the global flood yes we all know that the mediterranean was flooded but that is not a global flood a global flood is impossible well not quite if all volcanic and tectonic plate movement were to stop right now i e no more mountain building then errosion given millions of years would eventually deposit all mountains content etc into rivers and ultimately the sea then and only then do you have any chance of a global flood somehow i cannot see tectonic plate activity ever stopping can you
3089937 they all take a very long time and certainly longer than this mythical 6000 years
3089938 another strawman argument says that sediments can be rapidly deposited well maybe so they can but sorry guys that does not mean that all or the majorityt of sediments have been laid down quickly lets take limestone which is basically something akin to coral like organisms dying and slowly building up layers well we can witness this today but we dont see these layers rapidly building up do we yet again a little piece of creationist information proves to be misleading which of course is the sole intent oh by the way if sediments can be rapidly deposited then that must be happening now and we should be observing the very formation of fossils
3089939 i notice you are still denying beneficial mutation even after the effort that arcana has made to point you in the direction of numerous examples of beneficial mutation how can you ignore this
3089940 anyhow all of this is wasting my precious time and i will have to sign off now
3089941 and i have pointed out that we have in fact seen increases in genetic information and have even given an example of a known mechanism for such increases much like your refusal to acknowledge transitional fossils your claim about mutations only losing genetic information is completely factually baseless
3089942 heres a rebuttal for mark izaaks stupid assertions regarding noahs flood
3089943 why should many fossils buried together come as a suprise and how does this disprove evolution rather it supports evolution but millions i think you are exagerating a tad
3089944 oh go on fusion make my day and challenge me on that topic please
3089945 global flood and frozen fossils in the arctic you really are rambling now i have already explained in simple terms that a global flood is impossible what on earth are you implying
3089946 why should many fossils buried together come as a suprise and how does this disprove evolution rather it supports evolution but millions i think you are exagerating a tad
3089947 put a joint of pork in a pork joint fully intact albeit the meat may have lost some of its flavour and be a bit tough
3089948 the berskovka mammoth frozen remains found in snow perfectly feasible and i remember the discovery of a mammoth in siberia not sure if it this one and it was almost fully intact mammoths have only recently become exinct so why and how does this disprove evolution put a joint of pork in a pork joint fully intact albeit the meat may have lost some of its flavour and be a bit tough yet again totally irrelevent content from this sham of a website in a pathetic attempt to discredit evolution i was going to label s8int as inappropriate but i think i have to use the word immoral
3089949 now if you told me that the fossil bones of a human were found in the same layer as those of a dinoasaur then that would at least be a challenge but i guess your creation scientists are still busy on trying to magic that one up in some remote region
3089950 in various levels of the muck stone artifacts were found frozen in situ at great depths and in apparent association with the ice age fauna which implies that men were contemporary with extinct animals in alaska
3089951 the horse is merely the tip of the iceberg giant tortoises living in the caribbean sea the giant sloth the sabre toothed tiger the glyptodont and toxodon these were all tropical animals they werent wiped out because alaska and siberia were experiencing an ice age
3089952 unless one is willing to postulate freezing temperatures across the equator such an explanation clearly begs the question
3089953 animal tusks and bones rolled up in front of the blades
3089954 as i said before if there had been a global flood there would be a uniform sediment layer and we would find fossils everywhere not just in these isolated locations
3089955 have you ever had your head out of a book long enough to look at a gravel pit or a stream bed has it ever occurred to you what conditions would be like with water above the continental shorelines going around and around the earth pulled by the moons gravitation and swirling due to the coriolis effect didnt think so
3089956 this is another red herring do you have an actual point that is relevant to the discussion what is it about these conditions you claim to have existed supports your claims
3089957 secondly the technology to make forged steel rivets wasnt even around at the time you purport that the ark was constructed
3089958 site medzamor in soviet armenia is of intriguing interest an international scientific report published in 1969 expressed the belief that these finds point to an unknown period of technological development
3089959 medzamor was founded by the wise men of earlier civilizations they possessed knowledge they had acquired during a remote age unknown to us that deserves to be called scientific and industrial
3089960 on putting the two parts together it formed a bell shaped vessel 4 1 2 inches high 6 l 2 inches at the base 2 1 2 inches at the top and about an eighth of an inch in thickness the body of the vessel resembles zinc in color or a composition metal in which there is a considerable portion of silver on the sides there are six figures of a flower a bouquet beautifully inlaid with pure silver and around the lower part of the vessel a vine or wreath inlaid also with silver the chasing carving and inlaying are exquisitely done by the art of some cunning craftsman this curious and unknown vessel was blown out of the solid pudding stone fifteen feet below the surface
3089961 immense volumes have been written to expound our knowledge and conceal our ignorance of primitive man primitive cultures were not necessarily the ancestors of our own for all we know they may be the degenerate remnants of higher cultures

3089965 mark 10 15 verily i say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child he shall not enter therein
3089966 if you actually read the material you might notice that
3089967 the horse is merely the tip of the iceberg giant tortoises living in the caribbean sea the giant sloth the sabre toothed tiger the glyptodont and toxodon these were all tropical animals they werent wiped out because alaska and siberia were experiencing an ice age
3089968 unless one is willing to postulate freezing temperatures across the equator such an explanation clearly begs the question
3089969 woolly mammoths woolly rhinoceros giant armadillos giant beavers giant jaguars giant ground sloths and scores of other entire species were all totally wiped out at the end of the pleistocene massive piles of mastodon and sabre toothed tiger bones were discovered in florida valentine 1969 while whole mastodons toxodons giant sloths and other animals were found in venesuala quick frozen among the mountain glaciers berlitz 1969 all died on a global scale at about the same time
3089970 it has been estimated that some ten million animals lay buried along the rivers of northern siberia thousands of tusks formed a massive ivory trade for the master carvers of china all from the remains of the frozen mammoths and mastodons of siberia
3089971 the cause of these extinctions must be common to both hemispheres if the coming of glacial conditions was gradual it would not have cause the extinctions because the various animals could have simply migrated to where conditions were better what is seen here is total surprise and uncontrolled violence leonard 1979 source atlantisquest com
3089972 for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any twoedged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart
3089973 there are no other credible creation accounts only absurd pagan mythology theres only evolution theory or biblical creation the creation account as told in the bible is backed by the bibles overwhelming credibility and real science not uniformitarian theory
3089974 you have been severely misinformed either by some tv program or a marxist professor
3089975 jesus taught the flood was real history as real as his future second coming
3089976 a very common view is that the biblical story of noahs flood was not historical at all and was borrowed from flood legends in mesopotamia the gilgamesh epic in 1853 the archaeologist austen henry layard and his team were excavating the palace library of the ancient assyrian capital nineveh among their finds were a series of 12 tablets of a great epic the tablets dated from about 650 bc
3089977 when the dove returned with a freshly picked olive branch noah knew the water had abated and its non return a week later showed that the dove found a good place to settle
3089978 all people groups remember a global flood a local flood this might work if there were similar flood legends only around the ancient near east but there are thousands of such flood legends all around the world
3089979 the ship was made from plywood with technologies allowing for the size apparently including forged steel rivets
3089980 the flood was global in scope scientifically proven many ways

3089999 if jesus challenged us with the command get out of it we should take him to mean stay where you are but cultivate that inward detachment again if he were to say to us be not anxious we should take him to mean of course it is not wrong for us to be anxious we must work and provide for ourselves and our responsibilities but all the time we ought to be inwardly free from all anxiety perhaps jesus would say to us whosoever smiteth thee on the right cheek turn to him the other also we should then suppose him to mean the way really to love your enemy is to fight him hard and hit him back
