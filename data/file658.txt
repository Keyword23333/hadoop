6580011 there are still some issues to work out but its very premature at this point to say that we have an agreement
6580012 the reason we are where we are today talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger and we are making progress together in the defeat of iraqs enemies of all stripes

6580094 we take all allegations of sexual assault extremely seriously when this allegation was first brought to our office no arrest had been made we then spent more than five weeks attempting to build the case our extensive investigation included multiple interviews with the complainant herself forensic analysis of evidence from the apartment in which the assault was alleged to have occurred analysis of records and numerous interviews with witnesses who spoke to both the complainant and mr marzilli in the time prior to the alleged incident based on that investigation we found numerous factual and legal deficiencies that precluded us from moving forward with a criminal prosecution after we announced that we were unable to move forward with a prosecution a cambridge district court clerk issued a complaint against mr marzilli in connection with the same alleged arlington incident the complaint issued by the clerk was based on a much lower standard of proof than the one that we must meet in order to prosecute a case it also was based on a small fraction of the information that we developed during our five week investigation and since that time the clerk reviewed one affidavit submitted by the complainant and her lawyer during the hearing the defense was not present there was no interview of the complainant there was no witness testimony there was no additional investigation and there was no attempt to corroborate any of the information provided in the affidavit we have since reviewed the affidavit filed with the clerk to compare with the evidence that we developed during our investigation there is no new evidence provided in the affidavit that overcomes the significant factual and legal deficiencies that we uncovered during our investigation as a result we continue to be unable to move forward with a criminal prosecution and have filed a nolle prosequi of these charges we have spoken with the complainant numerous times throughout this process our decision that the evidence in this case does not support criminal charges should not be taken in any way as a sign that we did not take her or her allegations seriously at the same time we have an ethical and professional obligation to bring cases when the evidence meets a criminal standard of proof this case does not meet that standard the complainant still has numerous legal options to pursue beyond criminal prosecution if she so chooses we continue to move forward with our prosecution of mr marzilli for the series of crimes that he is alleged to have committed in lowell crimes for which our office has indicted him we will continue to move forward with our prosecution on behalf of the victims in that case

6580210 we do not have enough room to increase our religious activities
6580211 tail docking a dog would be illegal putting a lobster in boiling water would be illegal but it will be legal to abort a six month old child if this bill passes
6580212 from the outset i have declared that i am pro life i find it extremely difficult to support a bill that enables a woman to abort a baby up to six months gestation
6580213 it effectively is the status quo and provides accepted safeguards and i also have a very solid view that men should not be telling women what to do with their bodies
6580214 i support the original model as proposed by the victorian law reform commission which goes further than the governments bill and puts the decision in the hands of women at any stage of the pregnancy
6580215 treating abortion as an ordinary medical procedure deprives the unborn our most vulnerable human beings of the legal protection which the law should afford them
6580216 abortion understood as the intentional destruction of the unborn child in the womb is always wrong and unjust the unborn child is a human being entitled to the protection of the law no less than any of us
6580217 every attempt to harm an innocent human person violates principles of justice and is always wrong there are many alternatives to the death and destruction cultivated by the bill the welfare of mothers and families should be a first priority in the formation of public policy
6580218 the bill fails the objectives set for it by the government it does not reflect current clinical practice and community standards and also fails to provide legal certainty to women or medical practitioners and should be opposed
6580219 the bill does nothing to reduce the incidence of abortion
6580220 while the victorian law reform commission found that less than 1 percent of abortions are performed after 20 weeks gestation the bill in allowing abortions up to 24 weeks pregnancy increases the possibility of a much larger number of abortions occurring when a substantial majority of the community want a reduction in the number of abortions
6580221 it places restrictions on abortions after 24 weeks which are bound to be ineffective the restrictions imposed after 24 weeks will deter no one no doctor ever needs fear prosecution
6580222 the so called conscientious objection clauses are a totally unacceptable interference in the freedom of those doctors and nurses who refuse to take part in or sanction the deliberate destruction of human life
6580223 in certain circumstances it compels doctors to do the very thing to which they conscientiously object namely the killing of an unborn child
6580224 the bill is a clear breach of the human rights of doctors and nurses forcing them to act against conscientiously held moral cultural or religious beliefs

6580250 russian and georgian people have always been together we know that russians have saved georgians from enslavement and extermination more than once we know how we helped each other in our shared trials whether it was the great patriotic war or hardships of the soviet period when faith and church were persecuted
6580251 we know how rich are our orthodox christian cultures how many russian georgian families live in russia and georgia how many georgians live in our country and make their worthy contribution in its economics culture science and other spheres of life today its very important not to waste the potential of our friendship and our mutual help
6580252 only a madman can declare all georgians are enemies and kindle anti georgian moods in the country
6580253 politicians come and go conflicts are always crowned with peace but nations keep on living and we have to show wisdom good will patience and love so that our orthodox peoples could always feel their connection to one gods affair to one church of christ and always prefer peace to hostility and love to hatred
6580254 this is a big honor to be seen down here
6580255 art is a proven way to increase revenue and tourism there are people who come to experience the natural landscape as well as the cultural landscape here in chattanooga

6580277 well cut through the hype and the campaign ads and shine a light on how they view the sanctity of life the defense of marriage and religious liberty in the public square
6580278 well also talk about the events of the week and how that plays into the election
6580279 its entirely possible that newspaper staff has not connected the dots between having a state constitutional amendment and requests to publish same sex marriage or commitment announcements
6580280 readers should give publishers the benefit of the doubt unless and until they determine that the newspaper is in fact disrespecting the vote of the people and publishing such counterfeit announcements
6580281 at that point people need to hold the newspapers accountable

6580286 id like to give you a piece of my mind
6580287 before you hire a company to build a house you would i expect insist on detailed plans showing what the finished structure was going to look like building a childs mind and character is what public schools do their justification for prematurely breaking family and neighborhood learning where is documentary evidence to prove this assumption that trained and certified professionals do it better than people who know and love them can there isnt any the cost in new york state for building a well schooled child in the year 2000 is 200 000 per body when lost interest is calculated that capital sum invested in the childs name over the past twelve years would have delivered a million dollars to each kid as a nest egg to compensate for having no school the original 200 000 is more than the average home in new york costs you wouldnt build a home without some idea what it would look like when finished but you are compelled to let a corps of perfect strangers tinker with your childs mind and personality without the foggiest idea what they want to do with it

6580312 its hilarious when these people call us cowards and traitors i have the medals and ribbons and the discharge papers to prove that i did my job and i did it to the best of my ability
6580313 they said it was a hotbed of insurgent activity but really it was revenge for blackwater contractors getting killed
6580314 fixed establishments and mobile medical units of the medical service
6580315 every house we went into we poured machine gun fire into we shot anything that moved or didnt move
6580316 our whole mentality was why send a marine when you can send a bullet thats what we were told wed just pound a house full of rounds and search it
6580317 i guess it would be like the police beating people up because they had to fill out a report
6580318 we were supposed to be going after the terrorists that attacked us and all we ever did was harass civilians and blow up their houses
6580319 i remember piling everything people owned in one room of the house and setting it on fire just because we found some guns there that probably were put there after the family fled the house
6580320 they were purposefully doing more harm than good just to keep me over there
6580321 i looked at it like im saving other soldiers lives
6580322 the governments attitude is were america were the biggest kid on the block we have the biggest stick were going to do whatever we want
6580323 theres a lot of profit taking going on not so much a change in fundamentals
6580324 russia blocked the entrance to georgias main oil port and russia is showing that it can control europes natural gas supply
6580325 part is the dollar and part is russian saber rattling
6580326 i would put much of it down to geopolitical tensions with russia and that probably means the markets overreacted
6580327 the tension between the u s and russia is on the minds of traders but the supply demand figures are a more compelling story at this stage
6580328 we can chalk basically all of the upside volatility in higher commodity trade thursday up to spillover reactions from the gains in crude oil
6580329 the neocons in washington seem to be hoping for a new cold war with russia and they just might get it
6580330 unfortunately fear of such a cold war adds to the price of oil
6580331 what weve been seeing is a migration from money market funds where brokers were generating a management fee to bank deposits where they can potentially earn a wider spread
6580332 i think the pursuit of higher returns and higher income prompted this transition in an environment where some of their investments may not have turned out the way theyve expected
6580333 retail deposits are important as a relatively low cost funding source
6580334 given the appeal of deposit funding the investment banks with larger retail brokerage businesses have every incentive to promote these accounts they will potentially become a more important component of the strategy of these firms
6580335 the banks have always been an important part of our strategy and a key differentiator that we will continue to optimize on
6580336 from a cultural standpoint goldman typically does not acquire big assets but it gets small assets and grows them
6580337 i believe goldman doesnt have the need to buy a bank as for lehman i think it is a survivor and has a high franchise value it just needs to readjust its business mix
6580338 i do think its going to happen it makes sense for them to do it
6580339 if you get below bank of america just about every bank is up for grabs
6580340 if youre funding with core deposits people give money to the banks for practically nothing and deposits go up every year theyre stable and cost less
6580341 the data is clear it shows without a doubt that small monoline companies do not work
6580342 if youre funding with core deposits people give money to the banks for practically nothing and deposits go up every year theyre stable and cost less
6580343 if they can build up reserves in a reasonable pace it should not have any significant impact on oil prices
6580344 once china has the reserves its good for the rest of world because without such stockpiles china is more likely to bid up oil prices if there is a global supply disruption
6580345 it would be unreasonable to expect the straight line trajectory of the dollar to go uninterrupted price action rarely retains its parabolic status and sooner or later a counter trend occurs
6580346 today were seeing precisely that with the apparent catalyst coming from friction in u s russian relations
6580347 i think that everyone is starting to believe that commodities are the place to be again money rotated out of commodities and now they are rotating back in
6580348 the sharp drop in crude prices single handedly triggered the sharp dollar rally between july and mid august now that oil prices are creeping higher once again it would only make sense to see the u s dollar slip as well
6580349 for the time being the u s dollar is still at the whim of oil prices
6580350 loss of momentum on this weeks failure to break 1 4600 vs euro and 1 8500 vs british pound was palpable so no one is really surprised by the correction
6580351 the market has yet to unwind overbought conditions for the dollar vs euro we continue to believe that the buck will resume its strengthening trend and view this as an opportunity to get long dollars at better levels
6580352 what seemed like a protracted and dire situation for the u s economy is actually coming home to roost in other nations economies who are now suffering the flip side of this whole paradigm namely excessive exchange rate strength which is suffocating their economies
6580353 motion presents non frivolous arguments suggesting he currently lacks a rational understanding of the connection between his role in his offense and the punishment imposed upon him

6580356 barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as quote respectable and mainstream obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama

6580358 nationally prices are probably pretty overvalued by about 10 percent
6580359 further weaken the housing market and prolong the downturn there
6580360 more people out of work is going to put more pressure on people being able to pay their mortgages so thats going to lead to more foreclosures and more people walking away from their houses
6580361 theres no rush for anyone to buy in now or even when we see the signs of a housing bottom
6580362 a better value now than it was a year ago
6580363 still above the historic average which means that houses are expensive relative to apartments
6580364 weve had boomers accumulating multiple housing or rental houses on the expectation that housing was a one way ticket up and that belief has been shattered
6580365 if youre buying to live in a house its probably ok to purchase a house now

6580385 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew

6580387 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
6580388 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
6580389 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
6580390 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
6580391 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
6580392 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
6580393 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
6580394 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
6580395 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
6580396 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
6580397 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
6580398 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
6580399 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
6580400 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
6580401 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
6580402 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
6580403 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
6580404 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
6580405 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
6580406 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
6580407 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
6580408 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
6580409 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
6580410 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
6580411 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
6580412 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
6580413 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
6580414 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
6580415 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
6580416 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
6580417 there once was a leika with fury who considered herself both judge and jury with her wedding dress worn and chock full of scorn she trapped all men inside missouri

6580421 congresswoman tubbs jones was a leader like none other she spent the last 10 years of her life in congress serving the state of ohio and the nation with decisiveness fairness and integrity she will be deeply missed by all who loved and admired here
6580422 the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender community has not just lost an ally but a friend representative tubbs jones could always be counted on to speak out for civil rights and was an outspoken advocate for lgbt equality she will be greatly missed
6580423 from employment non discrimination to the military to equality for bi national couples congresswoman jones was an ardent advocate for the dignity of every american she never shirked from any civil rights battle and never failed to stand up and give voice to those who often felt voiceless

6580432 as we look at the emerging world of connected tv were excited
6580433 users always want to improve the richness of their tv experience after the flat panel explosion we think bringing the internet to tv is next step in the evolution of that experience
6580434 they were trashing it so bad the city got onto me i said the city is the one that needs to help me with this
6580435 to say theyre not bothering anyone or doing anything wrong is a misnomer
6580436 do i think homeless people are bad no but theyre here because its easy and because we werent enforcing public order crimes weve received a mandate from the citizens to clean up the city and take back the neighborhoods so here we go
6580437 the ones that were usually out here giving us problems are in jail right now
6580438 i cant rest i understand some of it i dont like people begging me if youre not bothering nobody why do you have to move where do you want me to go
6580439 nationally prices are probably pretty overvalued by about 10 percent
6580440 further weaken the housing market and prolong the downturn there
6580441 more people out of work is going to put more pressure on people being able to pay their mortgages so thats going to lead to more foreclosures and more people walking away from their houses
6580442 theres no rush for anyone to buy in now or even when we see the signs of a housing bottom
6580443 a better value now than it was a year ago
6580444 still above the historic average which means that houses are expensive relative to apartments
6580445 weve had boomers accumulating multiple housing or rental houses on the expectation that housing was a one way ticket up and that belief has been shattered
6580446 if youre buying to live in a house its probably ok to purchase a house now
6580447 this would also lead to a new violent conflict in the middle east because jerusalem is a red line for muslims and arabs
6580448 we are trying to get individuals to become more aware of their health
6580449 im big and beautiful and doing my best to keep my stress levels down so i can stay healthy
6580450 thats big not lazy not a glutton and certainly not deserving of the pompous poisonous disrespect served up daily to those of us with more bounce to the ounce
6580451 the state will feel good about itself for offering something and the person of size will end up paying 300 a year for the bad luck of having a chronic disease his her state sponsored insurance program failed to cover in an appropriate and meaningful fashion
6580452 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6580453 we have been and are working closely with the obama campaign to make sure we have an exciting and unified convention
6580454 our delegate whips along with the obama delegate whips are a part of a team that will be on the floor of the convention to make sure delegates have everything they need whether thats answering questions or passing out signs during hillarys speech the whips are a traditional part of every conventions floor operations

6580457 organization representing a coalition of conservative activists committed to raising important issues that deserve deeper examination given their impact on policy in accordance with federal law the american issues project only solicits and accepts contributions from individuals and not from any business corporation
6580458 beyond the speeches how much do you know about barack obama what does he really believe consider this united 93 never hit the capitol on 9 11 but the capitol was bombed thirty years before by an american terrorist group called weather underground that declared war on the u s targeting the capitol the pentagon police stations and more one of the groups leaders william ayers admits to the bombings proudly saying later we didnt do enough some members of the group ayers founded even went on to kill police but barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as quote respectable and mainstream obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama american issues project is responsible for the content of this ad
6580459 i dont regret setting bombs i feel we didnt do enough
6580460 the idea here was to talk about the fact that his friends hate america and thats who hes aligning himself with
6580461 the fact that john mccain dispatched his paid consultant to launch this despicable ad from a so called independent committee shows how desperate he is to change the subject from his shocking disconnect with the economic struggles of the american people
6580462 if obama cant answer questions on topics like the ayers connection appropriately and effectively and candidly then it does not speak well of the kind of candidate he would be in the fall against sen

6580468 to warn the press of the novels potential to provoke anger among some muslims
6580469 common stock warrants turn in the most spectacular performance of any group of securities the speculative potentialities of common stock warrants are enormous with potential profits and potential losses so great it is a source of wonder that so little understanding of the nature of common stock warrants exists not only among the investing public who might be forgiven this sin but even among the many professionals of the business upon whom the public depends for information and guidance
6580470 the shooting match between inflation in prices and deflation in assets is still a long way from won
6580471 the markets are telling us to prepare for hard times and a global spate of the worst deflation to be seen in generations
6580472 brazils market price index recorded 0 12 deflation in augusts preview
6580473 the cause of weaker broad money growth is not difficult to find
6580474 lombard street research calculates the three month growth rate in money supply is just 2 1 well below the six month rate of 6 3 and the 12 month rate of 11 5
6580475 if our firm is in trouble we would rather fund ourselves than fund hedge funds
6580476 convey any additional information about economic activity that is not already embodied in m2 another but narrower measure of money and has not played a role in monetary policy process for many years
6580477 have we reached the moment when gold bugs must start questioning their deepest assumptions
6580478 have they bought too deeply into the dollar collapse m3 monetary bubble tale ignoring all the other moving parts in the complex global system nobody wants to be left holding the bag all the way down to the bottom of the slide long after the hedge funds have sold out
6580479 thats well above the average 32 billion in aussie dollars raised in the same period in 2005 to 2007
6580480 the ccaa is a sketch an outline a supporting framework for the resolution of corporate insolvencies in the public interest
6580481 parliament wisely avoided attempting to anticipate the myriad of business deals that could evolve from the fertile and creative minds of negotiators restructuring their financial affairs
6580482 it left the shape and details of those deals to be worked out within the framework of the comprehensive and flexible concepts of a compromise and arrangement i see no reason why a release in favour of a third party negotiated as part of a package between a debtor and creditor and reasonably relating to the proposed restructuring cannot fall within that framework
6580483 here the debtor corporations being restructured represent the issuers of more than 32 billion in non bank sponsored abcp notes
6580484 he lower court judge justice campbell was required to consider and balance the interests of all note holders not just the interests of those who launched the appeal whose notes represent only about 3 per cent of that total that is what he did
6580485 during strong economic recoveries tax revenues are high normally accounting for a large portion of the gdp
6580486 im going to let the campaign speak for the campaign
6580487 if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6580488 were delighted to have a debate on judgment with barack obama who bought his own million dollar mansion in a shady deal with a convicted felon sen obama is obviously frustrated and abandoning his politics of hope for negative personal attacks
6580489 i will put my judgment on foreign policy over the last five years against john mccains anytime anytime
6580490 i think an objective analysis would say ive been right a lot more than he has for all his years in washington
6580491 might permit an innocent american to be subjected to such intrusive surveillance based in part on race ethnicity national origin religion or on protected first amendment activities
6580492 integrate more completely and harmonize the standards that apply to the f b i s activities
6580493 simply based on somebodys race religion or exercise of first amendment rights
6580494 this document clarifies the rules by which the f b i conducts its intelligence mission
6580495 this seems to be based on the idea that the government can take a bunch of data and create a profile that can be used to identify future bad guys
6580496 but that has not been demonstrated to be true anywhere else
6580497 yeah i like this team i like being here its obviously a very competitive team right now so yeah why wouldnt i
6580498 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
6580499 you can jail a revolutionary but you cant jail the revolution
6580500 there will be no prison which can hold our movement down the walls the bars the guns and the guards can never encircle or hold down the idea of the people
6580501 the first lesson a revolutionary must learn is that he is a doomed man unless he understands this he does not grasp the essential meaning of his life

6580503 we saw the original title was a big success and we had the developers cat daddy thinking down the line for the brand
6580504 so there will be a carnival games 2 but when that is i cant say that right now we just have to assess the market and see when the right time is to release the title
6580505 estamos frente a la bancarrota del sindicalismo tradicional en chile
6580506 la imagen que m s fuerza me provoca es la coherencia que siempre sostuvo entre el discurso y la pr ctica el hecho de poder constatar que hay sujetos en la historia del pa s que se han entregado a la lucha por los intereses de los m s postergados es decir los trabajadores con una pr ctica congruente y una fuerte dosis de autoridad moral el hecho de colocarse ante la existencia de aspectos que trascienden a la simple coyuntura eso me llam profundamente la atenci n y hablo de trascendente no en un sentido idealista de la sociedad y la historia sino con aquella mirada que considera a los hombres y mujeres en los campos del conocimiento las ciencias el arte la pol tica esto para m es relevante toda vez que hoy estamos carentes de personalidades que le den a su vida un valor superior respecto de las cosas estrictamente materiales
6580507 yo era muy joven cuando conoc a clotario como estudiante y como muchacho clotario siempre estuvo dispuesto a apoyar aquellas expresiones estudiantiles y a los j venes trabajadores que estaban no vinculados a las formas tradicionales de hacer pol tica o a los partidos tradicionales siempre clotario goz de un reconocimiento efectivo de aquellos comprometidos con las transformaciones sociales aut nticas y con la lucha extra amente tambi n tuvo una animadversi n hacia aquellos sectores ligados a los partidos en especial a los partidos estalinistas en este marco se gener mi conocimiento a la figura de clotario como un joven conocido m s para l uno mira a los grandes personajes de la historia y procura emular algunas conductas clotario es una de esas personalidades importantes que dan luz sobre aspectos oscuros que la sociedad chilena transita hoy y que se observan cuando se escucha a ciertos dirigentes pol ticos que todo lo hacen en funci n de la negociaci n del objetivo pol tico coyuntural olvidando siempre a los m s postergados es decir a los seres humanos
6580508 hay una enorme inspiraci n que proviene de luis emilio recabarren para m es la figura m s importante del pensamiento pol tico social de los trabajadores chilenos a n no existe otra persona que pueda superarlo en consecuencia tica e incluso en el campo de la educaci n de los asalariados recabarren fue el gran profesor de los trabajadores y sindicalistas chilenos y explor much simas disciplinas en los amaneceres del siglo xx cre un peri dico desarroll el teatro la formaci n permanente desgraciadamente la historia se ha encargado de ocultar su nombre peligroso para los poderosos porque tras l hay toda una vivencia una propuesta una doctrina que deber a ser asumida por los trabajadores pero que lamentablemente es repetida s lo formalmente recabarren y clotario son las dos figuras emblem ticas del movimiento obrero chileno
6580509 actualmente existe muy poca vinculaci n entre las aspiraciones de los trabajadores por mejorar sus condiciones materiales respecto del escenario en el que lo hacen
6580510 tenemos a una enorme cantidad de chilenos que no son personas humanas se puede ser ciudadano en un estado dominado fuertemente por el consumo por un sistema capitalista ultra aqu s lo se puede ser ciudadano si se es sujeto de cr dito es decir un sujeto capaz de adquirir bienes y servicios a trav s de un salario estable en tiempos donde reina la flexibilidad laboral y superior a los 300 mil pesos mensuales 600 d lares que corresponde pr cticamente a un 30 de los trabajadores chilenos bajo este sistema la mayor a est compuesta por sujetos condenados a vivir la marginalidad a reproducir la pobreza en sus hijos a trav s de la educaci n la salud la previsi n social etc y un individuo as es infeliz entonces si la vida es tan precaria y s lo puede ofrecer infelicidad los trabajadores deben dotarse de dirigentes que comprendan este fen meno que lo socialicen que lo discutan que sean capaces tanto de explicar esta infamia como de proponer y practicar la transformaci n profunda de la sociedad y ello se logra por medio de una revoluci n social que coloque en el centro a la persona humana al sujeto que hace posible la riqueza esta discusi n fue planteada hace 150 a os y contin a plenamente vigente
6580511 lo que estamos observando es una destrucci n de las fuerzas productivas una concentraci n cada vez m s grosera del capital y el poder y eso naturalmente est lejos de la democracia lo anterior no ofrece soluciones a los grandes problemas de la humanidad incluso la situaci n es contradictoria a lo que dicen los propios te ricos de la sociedad capitalista a los grandes liberales que combaten el oligopolio el monopolio y promueven la competencia sin embargo en chile vemos una condensaci n econ mica cada vez mayor y la nica forma de revertir el actual estado de cosas es radicalmente de manera revolucionaria innovadora
6580512 eso habla de que estamos viviendo una etapa tr gica el sistema capitalista ni siquiera ha podido garantizar a las sociedades actuales un m nimo decoro las b sicas necesidades fundamentales que en otros per odos se hab an logrado de alguna manera producto de las conquistas de los trabajadores el hecho de que luego de la ltima post guerra mundial el sistema garantizara un elemental r gimen de seguridad social en algunas reas hoy est en tela de juicio el capitalismo para su mantenimiento requiere arrancar todas las conquistas logradas por los trabajadores dejando a fuertes contingentes de asalariados convertidos en mano de obra barata en esta estrategia se encuentra el embate del capital contra los convenios contenidos en la organizaci n internacional del trabajo oit considerando que para algunos durante los 50 del siglo pasado la oit era una mera expresi n de una concepci n tripartita conservadora ahora la oit para el capital es una instituci n contenedora de ciertos derechos y por tanto busca aniquilarla plantea que no se justifica ya porque el capitalismo ha concluido que la relaci n trabajo capital tiene que resolverse bipartitamente es decir el estado y los organismos internacionales deben renunciar a cautelar principios y derechos fundamentales esto explica entre otras variables el bajo porcentaje de la negociaci n colectiva en chile menos de un 9 porque la negociaci n colectiva como se alaba la socialdemocracia y muchos sindicalistas que repet an que el mejor reasignador de recursos era la negociaci n colectiva actualmente est n ocultando este planteamiento porque si la negociaci n colectiva era la mejor forma de reasignar recursos pero hoy pr cticamente no existe qui n reasigna los recursos s lo el mercado entonces ahora la tropa de antiguos pseudo socialistas quedaron desarmados
6580513 el derecho laboral surgi hace casi 150 a os a trav s de grandes juristas franceses italianos europeos que entendieron que la asimetr a entre el capital y el trabajo demandaba la formulaci n jur dica de una concepci n que equiparara al trabajador frente al empleador para negociar esta cuesti n la comprendieron en su momento hasta las miradas m s reaccionarias de la historia y por ello producto de la revoluci n bolchevique y el terror al comunismo la socialdemocracia europea los partidos capitalistas norteamericanos entendieron bien el contexto y generaron reg menes que cautelaron los derechos m nimos de la gente as garantizaron trabajo estable seguros de desempleo decentes salud gratuita y pensi n pero todo ello ahora mismo se est acabando
6580514 la huelga de 30 d as de las trabajadoras y trabajadores del santander banefe fue altamente educativa para quienes participamos en el proceso la ense anza m s grande est ligada a que los trabajadores hicieron su propia experiencia y pudieron sacar conclusiones importantes una de ellas es que la unidad sigue siendo una de las herramientas fundamentales para los intereses de los asalariados esta consigna tan lugar com n fue refrendada por los hechos no es suficiente claro est se requiere tambi n de representantes sindicales honestos dispuestos a dirigir sobre la base y el ejercicio de la m s amplia democracia y potente comunicaci n los conflictos nosotros tuvimos 14 asambleas en un mes de huelga ello genera un buen debate convicci n elevaci n de la moral y limita la incertidumbre que es un arma que suelen usar los empresarios
6580515 el conflicto tambi n revel elementos que no siempre est n presentes en la lucha sindical tradicional si bien el holding santander logr mediante sus poderosos recursos que la huelga y sus razones sufrieran un cerco comunicacional m s que importante afortunadamente nosotros explotamos la veta de la comunicaci n internacional ello signific que muchas organizaciones sindicales internacionales solidarizaran con nuestra lucha y el sistema financiero hoy es vulnerable a este fen meno el negocio de los bancos es la especulaci n entonces los grandes inversionistas al ver un conflicto que comienza a cobrar notoriedad p blica internacional presionan sobre la instituci n financiera en problemas
6580516 el conflicto hay que proporcionarlo pero sin duda fue importante para los trabajadores bancarios chilenos considerando que el grupo santander es el m s grande de iberoam rica para nosotros el hecho nos plantea grandes desaf os y conclusiones nos dice que con unidad convicci n voluntad y comunicaci n permanente es posible comenzar a derribar ciertos mitos basados en el poder o de las grandes corporaciones financieras supuestamente impenetrables por otra parte el conflicto tambi n descubri la certeza de que los trabajadores estamos solos somos la mayor a pero estamos solos de organizaciones sindicales reales una muestra fue la pr cticamente nula solidaridad de la central unitaria de trabajadores cut a pesar de todos los esfuerzos que se hicieron por tratar de comunicarse con la direcci n m xima de la cut para que prestara alg n tipo de apoyo por qu porque las personas que est n en la direcci n de la cut son ignorantes respecto de las nuevas luchas de este pa s y de las nuevas formas de la organizaci n capitalista del trabajo y por otra parte tampoco son capaces de dar cuenta de la realidad de temas tan relevantes como la educaci n en chile por ejemplo lamentablemente la cut hoy representa a sectores minoritarios
6580517 la mayor conmoci n que provoc la huelga de santander banefe y que activ sin buscarla por esos medios la solidaridad internacional fueron los grados de violencia que cobr el conflicto el primer d a fuimos detenidos casi 90 compa eros fue ultrajada una compa era el segundo d a un dirigente nacional fue brutalmente golpeado en el hall del banco durante toda la huelga fuimos seguidos por vigilantes de civil como en los peores tiempos de la dictadura militar ello y m s fue denunciado al gobierno a los parlamentarios a los partidos pol ticos sin embargo de qu nos sirvi cuando hay una complicidad en el hacer y en el silencio de los poderes establecidos y el capital financiero contradictoriamente con lo que podr a pensarse la indiferencia de los representantes del modelo dotaron de una mayor fuerza moral a las trabajadoras y trabajadores en huelga la violencia del capital no nos extra a tanto sino m s bien la pobr sima solidaridad sindical salvando excepciones que recibimos dentro del pa s
6580518 los trabajadores bancarios quedamos en una posici n un poco mejor que antes y adem s el conflicto nos permiti conocer nuestras potencias y limitaciones y una de las fortalezas de la confederaci n es la autonom a y la independencia de clase con las que nos conducimos poco a poco la confederaci n se arma de organizaciones reales de dirigentes que se forman en la lucha y mediante el ejercicio de la democracia y la acci n directa
6580519 la elecci n de la cut es irrelevante no tiene ninguna trascendencia para los trabajadores chilenos a pesar de que existan un par de dirigentes sindicales interesantes que desde hace poco est n tratando desde la cut de instalar un discurso y una pr ctica diferente pero en general lo que hay en la cut es la reproducci n de un ejercicio superado por la historia las elecciones est n organizadas sobre listas que responden a partidos pol ticos que en chile representan una cuota marginal de chilenos hoy es innegable para cualquiera que la gente y sobre todo la juventud no siente ninguna identidad con los partidos tradicionales yo pienso que estamos frente a la bancarrota del sindicalismo tradicional en chile y por eso lo que ocurra en las elecciones de la actual cut no tiene importancia para los intereses genuinos de los trabajadores del pa s lo m s probable es que las cosas queden tal cual est n en las listas hay personas que ni siquiera son dirigentes sindicales
6580520 las necesidades y realidades de los trabajadores transcurren por cauces distintos a las maneras que se expresa y organiza la cut todav a la cut vive en gran medida enfrascada en un modelo de desarrollo existente hasta 1973 pero rest ndole la autoridad moral de los dirigentes de esa poca hoy la cut cay en un pragmatismo exacerbado en el superestructuralismo y es antidemocr tica hasta en la elecci n de sus representantes
6580521 la cut sirve para blanquear las pol ticas del gobierno en t rminos generales funciona como ap ndice del gobierno y por lo tanto puede servir para validar la miseria de ingreso m nimo impuesto a los trabajadores para ello por lo menos siempre tiene prensa
6580522 las relaciones de producci n han variado tanto en chile que la organizaci n de los trabajadores se torna sumamente compleja toda vez por ejemplo que el sector de servicios terciario ha cobrado un vigor notable pero laboran en condiciones extraordinariamente precarias y no cuentan con tradici n de organizaci n hay muchos trabajadores que viven de la parte variable de su salario que son comisionistas trabajadores que se emplean luego de las 6 de la tarde y sus ritmos de funcionamiento son distintos etc todo ello demanda organizaciones diferentes que las tradicionales hoy hay que concentrarse en los trabajadores de los sectores m s dominantes de la econom a servicios comercio telecomunicaciones transporte
6580523 el sindicalismo no puede estar sujeto a los lineamientos jur dicos actuales ordenados por la patronal el sindicalismo desde sus albores ha estado al margen o en los l mites de la legalidad y por tanto ha obligado a que se haga la ley en funci n de sus demandas y luchas y no al rev s las leyes sociales nacieron en el mundo como fruto de las luchas y crecimiento del movimiento sindical organizado las leyes sociales de 1924 ley de la silla protecci n a la maternidad etc fueron consecuencia de las grandes luchas que dio luis emilio recabarren a comienzos del siglo pasado y que obligaron al presidente alessandri a promulgarlas para contener el avance del mundo obrero y por eso en 1931 nace el primer c digo del trabajo no como expresi n de la voluntad de la burgues a de la poca sino como resultado de la lucha de los trabajadores y hoy abrigamos grandes esperanzas toda vez que el promedio de edad de los trabajadores chilenos es mucho menor que el de las actuales dirigencias sindicales
6580524 en el contexto actual que gane la alianza por chile o la concertaci n para los trabajadores no significa ning n cambio significativo seguir a predominando el modelo econ mico actual las instituciones jur dicas no sufrir an grandes transformaciones en consecuencia para los intereses de los trabajadores resulta indiferente votar por pi era o lagos hay que recordar que el legado presidencial de ricardo lagos escobar se resume en el aumento de las inequidades sociales la concentraci n de la riqueza la violencia simb lica del capital sobre el trabajo se agudiz y lo que quedaba de servicios p blicos fue privatizado qu podemos esperar los trabajadores de un nuevo gobierno de la concertaci n o uno de la alianza por chile aqu en el corto plazo hay que construir una alternativa pol tica tal cual los empresarios que representen sus intereses incluso en el parlamento

6580763 what was special to me about baseball was the inclusiveness of it
6580764 if you could do it if you had the talent you had the opportunity
6580765 it helped them win the super bowl so its going to be a good gauge for us
6580766 i try to keep all quarterbacks who are behind me healthy
6580767 obviously you want to keep that guy healthy as well
6580768 any one of those guys could have been right up there for mvp of the super bowl they took over the game
6580769 its really going to depend on how many plays we have offensively and how long their first group is in
6580770 with every preseason game ive played in id like to play the whole game
6580771 its kind of a touchy situation but based on how much ive played or havent played i would think i would play more
6580772 we want to really be crisp out there for the third game knowing that we will not likely be out there for the philly game next week this game is going to be as close to a regular season procedure as possible we really want to go out there and make a statement
6580773 they were really impressive against cleveland and they have some really good athletes in their front seven
6580774 we feel like were a pretty good group up front too
6580775 i think we have potential and weve laid a really good groundwork here in training camp
6580776 youre starting to see signs not of life but things beyond just the xs and os its getting to where youre starting to do some things in some pretty difficult situations and being able to get the blocks
6580777 obviously its a new year a lot of things have changed its a preseason game for us im not thinking about the past theyre the team to beat in this league were just trying to get better this week
6580778 you dont want to have a setback this late in the process well just see how it is
6580779 hes very excited and just looking forward to getting up there and joining his team mates and pitching on saturday
6580780 hes worked extremely hard to put himself in this position and to be able to come back and compete at the highest level this season
6580781 injuries are a part of the game and every athlete at some time has to deal with the prospect of getting hurt
6580782 i dont think theres anything that he needs to redeem himself for at all
6580783 he was just basically a player who was unfortunate and got hurt now hes healthy and i think hes looking to get back up there and give the yankees everything that he has

6580786 we experienced the world cup together even though it wasnt planned we both went through tough times there we just looked at each other were still kind of in shock right now
6580787 there is no doubt in my mind i would have made those saves
6580788 i dont even think about that whatever i said last year
6580789 i am just enjoying this moment right now i feel great i just won a gold medal
6580790 i told her a number of times she was by far the best goalkeeper in the world
6580791 that game today she played unbelievable if it wasnt for her there would be two goals definitely in the back of the net
6580792 weve seen brazil three times since that last match but it wasnt the same on the world stage is when teams really come to play so it sat with us a little bit
6580793 after the first game i didnt know that a gold medal would be possible
6580794 i cant even recall the saves or how it happened but all i know is that i was playing with a different energy tonight and it just felt so good
6580795 you usually have the nerves going anxiety right up until the whistle blows something felt different i was excited i knew we had nothing to lose we definitely were medaling we didnt know what medal i just knew if i work hard things will happen things will fall into place
6580796 i had to keep it low and strike it hard
6580797 never in my wildest dreams did i thought i would score the goal that would give us the olympic gold
6580798 he clearly wants to leave if he doesnt want to stay they should get rid of him
6580799 its all about starting pitching and wednesday our starter had a tough outing
6580800 it just seems like its been not quite good enough every time i go out there ive got to continue to work and put zeros up and thats all i can worry about
6580801 thats what weve been doing all year we just try to be flexible and adjust to the circumstances
6580802 i must learn to love the fool in me the one who feels too much talks too much takes too many chances wins sometimes and loses often lacks self control loves and hates hurts and gets hurt promises and breaks promises laughs and cries

6580837 these homicides affected the community greatly back in the 1990s and they continue to reverberate

6580840 why do we break the promises we make are we living for ourselves dont give up on love and throw it all away dont give up on love and let it fall away when did it become so easy to run from your pain dont give up on love and throw it all away well i heard you say you cant change a stubborn heart yeah i can relate cuz thats how i feel when i talk with you why should it take losing everything to realize it might be time to change and your restless heart wont win cuz you take but you dont give and youll keep moving on until you learn what love is

6580843 its got to be stopped when politicians and unions conspire to give away pension increases on a retroactive basis and cut their deals in private taxpayers have a right to be outraged and its happening again t
6580844 there is something wrong with governmental decision making when public leaders make secret decisions to give windfall benefits to selected employees and leave behind them a huge bill for somebody else to pay long after they have left office it completely violates the concept of intergenerational equity and there is clearly little or no value to any taxpayers at any time so its no wonder that these practices have stirred up a hornets nest among the taxpayer associations they have a right to be mad

6580872 camera phones are now going in the same direction as digital still cameras but at an accelerated pace together with memory size it really has become one of the key battlegrounds in the mobile technology arms race
6580873 now camera phones are competing head on with entry level digital still cameras
6580874 my expectation is that it wont be long before we start comparing camera phones with
6580875 as far as the applications go eight megapixels will be one of the things people will be looking for this christmas
6580876 consumers always tend to think that a higher number of pixels means its a better camera but more pixels do not automatically mean better quality
6580877 mainstream camera manufacturers like kodak tried to fight this a few years ago and realised it was futile they concluded that it does not matter how much you spend on marketing the fact that other factors like the lens can give better pictures with less pixels consumers always follow the numbers
6580878 its not all about size and its not all about megapixels

6580880 for so far back in time there has been zero vat on childrens clothing as part of government policy to support families but the point is with obesity and better nutrition levels in general children are getting bigger the upper limits have to change so that more childrens clothing falls within the zero vat band
6580881 it would be impossible to change the vat rules every few years just because children are getting progressively bigger
6580882 families are being squeezed by a whole raft of rising costs from increased utility bills to higher petrol prices the zero rating of clothing and footwear must be reformed

6580909 the rapid development of digital technologies offers researchers unprecedented possibilities for the timely and efficient sharing of information
6580910 i welcome especially the fact that scientific publishers have started to move gradually towards new dissemination models and are collaborating with researchers on open access they have given valuable input to the commission on these areas which has been used in the preparation of the pilot project this will allow a mutually beneficial coexistence that maximises the effects of open access on publicly funded research while leaving room for privately financed business models in publishing

6580915 i really do believe that promoting brown fat growth is a plausible approach to weight control
6580916 to me it is attractive because of its simplicity if more of our fat were brown fat the mouse studies suggest that we would be leaner and better able to resist obesity
6580917 we showed that brown fat and white fat have completely different origins
6580918 brown fat is derived from muscle that was a huge surprise
6580919 the hope is that this research will lead to better ways to treat obesity especially for people who are overweight because of their genes
6580920 right now there are not many good options for these people
6580921 answers to these questions would take us a step closer to the ultimate goal of promoting the brown fat lineage as a potential way of counteracting obesity
6580922 we know that we can stimulate the production of brown fat in mice

6581151 its one of our most beautiful and artistic films to date in typical celeste fashion yet is full of raw and hardcore sex scenes with industry favorites such as our own jana cova plus kinzie kenner and erik everhard celeste has the amazing ability to capture sexual performances that our seemingly contradictions lascivious liaisons is both intense and intimate fierce and passionate and it appeals to both men and women
6581152 earned every bit of the highly recommended i rated it for while i admit to thinking jana cova was a major reason for the rating the levels of playful fuck for the buck and replay value also impressed me lascivious liaisons was a solid combination of creative talent on both sides of the camera that many of you will find to be passionate energetic and very much appreciated so pick up a copy when it comes out fans of jana will probably want two copies given how lovely she looked on the cover as well

6581274 there is every real chance our players could get caught in some incident and now the taliban have openly declared war on the pakistan government
6581275 there will be a considerable amount of pressure on young player and fringe players to go they will not feel secure in their place in the team so they will be under pressure to go
6581276 they will have a difficult decision they will be torn and some of them will feel they have to go
6581277 weve never had a complaint from a customer about people spamming them because of their idisk public folder name there is no way to remove your account name from the idisk folders im very sorry

6581288 this crack is moving and moving closer and closer to the front its just a matter of time till a much larger piece is going to break off it is imminent
6581289 as we see this phenomenon occurring further and further north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern
6581290 its a signal but we dont know what it means
6581291 the crack is not alarming i would say it is normal
6581292 it could go back for miles and miles and theres no real mechanism to stop it
6581293 the clown circumambulated the inner ring three times before tripping over his shoe and tumbling off to the right amid thunderous applause
6581294 i havent pitched so many games in a row like these two days before but i know it was the top level game and we played in olympic arena so there is not only physical issues but also the mental spirit its the strong belief to drive me to win
6581295 it is probably our last olympic games hopefully our victory tonight could help with retrieval of the sport it is a big motivation for us and much meaningful than the game itself we will promote it all over the world every corner of the world
6581296 it will have a big influence allowing childrens dreams to come true it will have a huge effect on the back softball campaign to bring it to the olympic games
6581297 its interesting because everyone says all the time that we win and no one can compete it was proven today that other teams can win the sport should remain its global its been a beautiful last two weeks of softball
6581298 the ioc international olympic committee took my softball dreams away you know and that is like a knife to the heart
6581299 what we have got to do is ask the people that are voting that do not really quite understand to come out watch the sport
6581300 i think he rogge is enjoying the game and mr samaranch too he has been very busy and tired as many events and functions needed him to be there but he still spent time to see our sport
6581301 some of our players are beyond 30 this is definitely the last chance for them to achieve glory
6581302 they did their best but their will was not strong enough and they lacked confidence in the matches
6581303 in retrospect we won in the 1990s due to good mental condition you can see firmness sparkling in the players eyes
6581304 weve had dogs of equal aggression in the pound but after a while that aggression subsides they become quite complacent and they get used to the pound staff as well but this guy after 13 months just no change

6581312 we know that he had extended contact with the girl whos now 16
6581313 our concern is there may be additional victims because he clearly has no qualms about contacting girls who are significantly underage
6581314 it is a scary comfort level that we need to disrupt and send a message that we are not going to tolerate
6581315 im very aware of what is going on right now all around us and it is going on all around us its everywhere in this park right now even with the police and in broad daylight
6581316 now what were experiencing when we do these operations its getting harder and harder to find people using drugs and selling drugs in the park
6581317 we will hit them weekly if not more and we are going to be diligent on it to keep driving those individuals keep it clean so the community can use that
6581318 im having a herpes outbreak but youd never know it
6581319 were doing better but we are not where we want to be yet
6581320 theyre the government sooner or later we are going to have to deal with them
6581321 id say were at about a c plus level as far as our on track performance
6581322 were good enough to make the chase based on how weve run week to week
6581323 i told mike after having about a fifth place car at pocono i knew that i was not a fifth place driver so we needed to work on our stuff
6581324 it definitely wouldve been great to win but you dont want to take an unnecessary risk and take out a top five finish and finish 20th or something
6581325 at this point in the season a third place is great but a win wouldve been better but a 20th wouldve been just about devastating for us since were trying to make the chase
6581326 i feel like weve been in a situation where weve kind of been just stuck in the middle and i dont want to be where we are in the points right now
6581327 but in some ways this is an easier position to be in because we just go out there and run hard every weekend and we can take changes and do things that can maybe get us that win
6581328 weve been stuck in the middle where we cant take too big a risk you cant risk fuel mileage you cant risk putting two tires on weve got to stay with four tires and we cant get too risky with our set ups all that stuff youre just trying to ride along there and not make mistakes
6581329 im relieved and now we just dont worry about anything
6581330 we can just drive as hard as we can do anything we possibly can and just go all out and thats all we can do and well see where we end up
6581331 it is what it is and you just go out and race as hard as you can
6581332 it wouldnt be anything we do any differently if we were first and if we were 20th so we go out and where it falls is where it falls and not a lot we can do in between
6581333 i think its pretty obvious that weve made strides over the last couple of months and i am pretty happy with the performance of the cars and where everything is at right now so im pretty confident with everything that weve got going on
6581334 i look at it every weekend every sunday night when i get home
6581335 this is an agreement that of course will establish a missile defense site here in poland a missile defense site that will help us to deal with the new threat to the 21st century of long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea

6581381 i know the countrys behind me i will do my best
6581382 as a program manager i am very happy because this shows we have successfully slowed down or controlled the hiv epidemic through prevention care and treatment
6581383 i think the government will de restrict the property market once things start getting more competitive once things start to slow down people start to look at other places and the competition starts to get more competitive they will need to start doing more things to attract more foreigners

6581386 im kind of nervous real excited and im just ready to move in and get everything set up
6581387 my mom was nervous that she had to move everything herself because i cant help very much but theyre helping a lot
6581388 i remember being a freshman and it was kind of unnerving so its nice to help people
6581389 we want this to be a day that they can enjoy and not one where they have to feel like theyre moving boxes back and forth
6581390 this feather proves mr peterson an innocent man and provides for his freedom immediately hopefully
6581391 for some reason she went outside and while she was out there an owl that was out there hunting that particular evening swooped down hit her in the back of the head
6581392 the district attorneys office dismissed it as absurd citing the absence of feathers and most people labeled it ridiculous
6581393 a bird came down out of the treeline took a sharp lefthand turn and went back up in the treeline
6581394 had been whacked in the head with a baseball bat
6581395 you could see the red dots in the back of my head where the talons actually hit me
6581396 i put my hand to the back of my head and i brought it down and it was full of blood
6581397 owls do attack people it has been documented im not the only one
6581398 and my attack is on tape so theres no refuting whether or not this actually took place
6581399 it will take time to get this analyzed by dna et cetera and we want to start the process
6581400 you have your second bud that will give you a half crop
6581401 then youve got your third bud which will give you no fruit but the vine will stay alive thats where we ended up last year
6581402 our third bud just created growth but no fruit so it was very devastating
6581403 the upside was that we had a very small crop but it was intensely ripe and of very high quality
6581404 as much as i would like it to it all runs down the hill because its raining so hard i would rather see an all day soft rain where it actually penetrates into the soil

6581406 at the governments request the bank will assist the authorities in assessing the toll of the damage and reconstruction needs with international partners and other stakeholders through a follow up mission

6581408 two of the most critical allies that he picked in the war on terror that he identified early on in his administration putin and musharraf have disappointed him mightily
6581409 whoever walks into the oval office in january is going to have his hands full
6581410 it is a huge challenge given the current pakistani government is much less willing to challenge the taliban than musharraf was
6581411 the combination of russian anger and strength is a potent mix that the next president will have to deal with
6581412 we will have the best and brightest and by the way they dont have to be democrats

6581452 the difficulty we face is that most class members are deceased a not insignificant proportion will be deceased
6581453 though we do not admit liability we chose to settle this case because we are and have been firmly committed to the well being of our residents
6581454 litigation is a long expensive process that would take our focus away from where it belongs on our residents
6581455 but the reason we brought the lawsuit is because of the fundamental failure of the government the department of public health does nothing its in bed with the industry its left to private citizens willing to take up the cause
6581456 we appreciate that sun mar is stepping up to the plate and taking action to ensure its compliance with such important regulations as maintaining minimum staffing

6581564 our study confirms that women experience significant bone loss due to cancer treatments and that zoledronic acid can prevent this loss
6581565 while our findings are promising its too early for us to recommend this drug for all premenopausal women undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer because we dont yet have all the information we need on dosing cost effectiveness and whether this drug actually prevents bone fractures
6581566 however this research does show we need to be more vigilant about monitoring patients bone densities before and during treatment so we can protect bone health and offset bone fracture or osteoporosis risk
6581567 which found that nasas 22 project technology development program is making progress toward its goals to support the agencys moon effort but there was room for improvement particularly in communicating the risks and human health factors associated with new technologies as well as with longer term projects aimed at reaching past the moon to mars and beyond other hurdles include federal budget limitations and shifting requirements of nasas constellation program overseeing the lunar lander and its heavy lift ares v rocket technology development program but that technology is necessary for future human exploration
6581568 even the most talented of engineers and scientists will find it difficult to make forward progress without the necessary tools to do so
6581569 we hope that this report will help to strengthen that road to the future not cause it to be questioned

6581579 we have found that most violations stem from a few common mistakes that can be for the most part easily avoided
6581580 we hope to educate the community of commercial distributors redistributors and resellers on how to avoid violations in the first place and to respond adequately and appropriately when a violation occurs
6581581 too many software projects rely on only one or a very few team members who know how to build and assemble the final released product
6581582 such knowledge centralization not only creates engineering redundancy issues but it also endangers gpl compliance which requires you to provide build scripts
6581583 it would be very easy for there to be an idea that you can hold companies to ransom

6581701 i am extremely pleased to have a journalist of davids caliber with such extensive newspaper experience take on this very important position in the diocese of dallas i know he will use his talents to provide a new direction and continuity to both texas catholic and el cat lico
6581702 i am thankful and excited about the opportunity to use my gifts and talents to help the diocese of dallas in its mission of reaching out to all catholics here the responsibility is a great one that i do not take lightly and i plan to use my years of experience in the media for service that has no higher calling
6581703 whatever else history may say about me when im gone i hope it will record that i appealed to your best hopes not your worst fears to your confidence rather than your doubts my dream is that you will travel the road ahead with libertys lamp guiding your steps and opportunitys arm steadying your way
6581704 i leave you hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal

6581706 we also have been working with some of their key software providers to port some of the applications that they have internally natively onto force com for them to use
6581707 and all of that together suddenly we were one of their key technology vendors and it really gave them the ability to sign what we call an enterprise license agreement with us
6581708 having a big hitter commit to developing on force com is really important
6581709 previously those committing have tended to be saas smb players like centive or xactly or midmarket on premise apps vendors looking to get saasy quickly like coda
6581710 talked proudly about not needing to rely on a third party vendors erp but creating its own apps
6581711 so i wonder if that might be a possibility as well as the ability to tailor salesforce crm more to the needs of its sales reps

6581714 there was not a huge clamor for windows xp sp3 like there was for vista sp1 and that shows in the results its pretty clear that a lot of xp users are very content with sp2
6581715 they heavily promoted vista sp1 and went out of their way to put a good foot forward for it but they barely mentioned xp sp3

6581903 childhood vaccination rates for measles continue to exceed 92 percent

6581905 disconcerting as it may be to true believers in global warming the average temperature on earth has remained steady or slowly declined during the past decade despite the continued increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide and now the global temperature is falling precipitously
6581906 the reason this matters is that there is a close correlation between variations in the sunspot cycle and earths climate the previous time a cycle was delayed like this was in the dalton minimum an especially cold period that lasted several decades from 1790 northern winters became ferocious in particular the rout of napoleons grand army during the retreat from moscow in 1812 see picture was at least partly due to the lack of sunspots

6581924 we had a two story one family home no one home heavy smoke condition on the second floor upon arrival still not sure as to what caused it with no one home
6581925 because there were so many people that assumed that i was coming to american and trying to use it as a stepping stone of sorts i tried telling people and they just didnt listen that i appreciated that at a time when i had been out of coaching american gave me a great opportunity to come back theres a lot to that
6581926 its not just all about what conference or how much money youre making
6581927 at least for me a big part of it is being wanted and being in an environment where youre comfortable and happy and the big one is are you in a place were you truly believe you can win and all of those things were true for me and have been true for me
6581928 actually getting into the tournament was that important threshold that we had to reach

6581930 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
6581931 there are four committees and how they relate to each other will come forward very shortly

6581934 putting small children in front of them its a bad idea
6581935 most of them are on supervision for downloading child pornography on the internet and trading child pornography on the internet
6581936 if the board of education came out and said were gonna put a school in a building right under a probation office that handles hundreds of hardened criminals there would be an uproar this is the same thing
6581937 the last place that any of our offenders would commit any type of crime is near our office
6581938 its not in my backyard its not in my childrens playground thats what were saying
6581939 the key task for policy makers going forward is to ensure that older people can increasingly play an active role in our ageing society
6581940 the days of assuming older people are dependants must now come to an end
6581941 vitamin k has a potentially beneficial role on insulin resistance but evidence is limited in humans
6581942 we tested the hypothesis that vitamin k supplementation for 36 months will improve insulin resistance in older men and women
6581943 vitamin k supplementation for 36 months at doses attainable in the diet may reduce progression of insulin resistance in older men
6581944 there was an inverse association between plasma phylloquinone concentrations and bmi in the women suggestive of an impaired response to vitamin k supplementation
6581945 in summary 36 months of vitamin k supplementation had a beneficial effect on insulin resistance in older men but not older women
6581946 as the parent study was not designed to test this hypothesis these findings need to be replicated in a study designed specifically to test the hypothesis that vitamin k plays a protective role in insulin resistance in older adults

6581979 this year i think we are developing a little slower but i think were going to peak higher than we did last year
6581980 we still have a lot to work on weve meshed a little bit as a team and that will only take us so far through the early part of the schedule we still need to work on more than just the basics though we have to break our freshman into the collegiate game then we can go into our tournaments and well be ready for the season

6581989 the program appears to be on the brink of collapse after an estimated half billion dollars in taxpayer funding has been spent on it
6581990 we are seeing plan sponsors turning to innovative designs and health improvement programs as a vehicle for containing health plan costs through cost effective treatments reducing complications from chronic disease and lowering demand for health services the most effective strategies include mining data to identify a plans cost drivers redesigning plan provisions to eliminate barriers to care and providing incentives to comply with recommended care for specific diseases

6581995 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

6581997 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

6582002 unfortunately the sport of soccer is also a business and in order to bring eddie to the galaxy we were required to make salary budget space available and our only available option was to move carlos
6582003 carlos is proven to be one of the great goalscorers in the history of this league and i have the highest regard for him we wish him the very best in the future
6582004 i know its conrad so i tell him to ignore it and we keep going

6582010 the overall survival detailed in the expanded fda approval of vidaza is extremely important for patients with higher risk mds a group with limited options and median survival of about 15 months with classical treatments
6582011 vidaza however is also effective across a broad range of mds subgroups including who classified aml patients the largest subgroup in our study
6582012 the clinical data from this randomized phase iii controlled study demonstrated that patients with higher risk mds treated with vidaza benefit from a significant survival advantage a critical measure of a drugs effectiveness
6582013 additionally the efficacy and safety profile of vidaza allows for long term therapy in patients with higher risk mds underscoring the ability to treat until disease progression for optimal survival benefit
6582014 this decision by the fda reflects the unprecedented survival advantage demonstrated by vidaza in patients with higher risk mds
6582015 vidaza is another example of celgene developing novel therapies for critical blood diseases that are enabling patients to live for years rather than weeks and months todays decision strengthens our companys ability to deliver vidaza and our other therapies to patients in need around the world
6582016 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6582017 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6582018 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6582019 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6582020 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6582021 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6582022 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6582023 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6582024 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6582025 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6582026 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6582027 real estate agent hunting 2 0 in a story this past weekend the consumerist also picked up on if youre an agent it means that your online presence identity and activity are now important to attracting new clients in a changing landscape
6582028 identification and tracking of persons using rfid tagged items in store environments
6582029 shopping malls airports train stations bus stations elevators trains airplanes restrooms sports arenas libraries theaters and mu se ums
6582030 rfid tag scanner located in the desired tracking location scans the rfid tags on a person as that person moves around the store different rfid tag scanners located throughout the store can pick up radio signals from the rfid tags carried on that person and the movement of that person is tracked based on these detections the person tracking unit may keep records of different locations where the person has visited as well as the visitation times
6582031 the personal information will be obtained when the person uses his or her credit card bank card shopper card or the like
6582032 why do they have to throw it in our face
6582033 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6582034 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6582035 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6582036 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6582037 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6582038 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6582039 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6582040 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6582041 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6582042 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6582043 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6582044 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6582045 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6582046 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6582047 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6582048 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6582049 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6582050 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6582051 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6582052 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6582053 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6582054 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6582055 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6582056 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6582057 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6582058 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6582059 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6582060 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6582061 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6582062 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6582063 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6582064 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6582065 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6582066 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6582067 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6582068 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6582069 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6582070 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6582071 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6582072 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6582073 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6582074 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6582075 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6582076 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6582077 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6582078 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6582079 they tower over us and they seem as if theyll be here forever
6582080 all of that came down from this mountain over time wind rain ice running water all of these things have taken this impossibly strong mountain and worn it away you can see the results lying all around us and it still goes on even today a year from now there will be even more debris down here eroded from the face of the cliff years from now this entire mountain will be worn away
6582081 i was wondering if you wanted to come over later
6582082 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6582083 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6582084 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6582085 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6582086 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6582087 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6582088 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6582089 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6582090 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6582091 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6582092 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6582093 im alright a little hungry and a little cold though
6582094 dont worry you can have this i wasnt that hungry anyway
6582095 d do you think the others while come back for us
6582096 i dont know but we have to think about ourselves for now were running low on food and supplies another day or two and well be completely out of food and water
6582097 the fires dimming im stirring the coals around to keep it going
6582098 please dont be mad at me im sorry i pretended to be someone else
6582099 this is why i didnt want to be found out
6582100 i i know but i just dont want to be treated as a kid now im tough and i can do fine on my own if i need to i dont need others giving me things or asking if i need anything
6582101 so i thought that if i changed into someone older someone your age you wouldnt treat me differently and i would be more useful to the group
6582102 if i stayed as myself when we crashed i was sure that i would be a hindrance to the group slowing everyone else down because they would be so worried about me because of my true age
6582103 i first discovered my ability to change when we were trying to escape from tv tokyo
6582104 hey sweetie your father and i will be working pretty late tonight so i prepared your favorite dish spaghetti and meatballs youll just have to warm it in the microwave oven for a few minutes and take it out be careful not to burn yourself on the plate o well probably be home around 1 00 a m or later dont stay up too late and be sure to get up early to make it to your c ute haha little group tomorrow morning love mom
6582105 come on mom im not a little kid anymore its like youre writing to a little child
6582106 you and dad work so late all the time im usually stuck cooking for myself anyway and doing the dishes and washing the table and doing the laundry and folding it afterwards im practically all grown up as it is
6582107 i was at work and overheard something on the radio go to our room and turn on the tv right now
6582108 i just picked up your mother and were on our way home right now
6582109 maimi honey listen to mommy were on our way right now hang in there
6582110 honey you have to listen to me you have to run you have to get away from the house and get to your friends
6582111 yes sweetie you have to get back to your friends no matter what
6582112 nothing sweetie now listen up open the top drawer of our dresser and look for a white envelope inside the white envelope is over 100 000 yen i want you to take it and run as far away from tokyo as you can
6582113 no sweetie you have to go on without us at this rate we cant make it to you
6582114 i know you are were all scared but you have to do this we know you can
6582115 run maimi run and dont look back dont come back for anything save yourself
6582116 maimi you have to save yourself i know you can do it weve seen how much youve grown up and matured far beyond your years
6582117 go maimi go now run and keep on running you have to
6582118 uh yeah im fine just took a spill thats all
6582119 i mean yeah bro just lost control of my horse for a second nothing to worry about
6582120 and thats how i first discovered my ability to morph into other people
6582121 i see so how why not tell any of us even when you already know that were also mutants
6582122 well i saw it as an advantage i could change into someone older and not have to worry about anyone treating me like a scared little kid
6582123 with all youve been through i think youve proven that you can take care of yourself if you need to
6582124 so how far do your powers go can you only copy peoples appearance
6582125 no ive copied other s m a t girls appearances and found i could also mimic some of their powers but theyre much weaker in comparison
6582126 cool wait so you can change into anyone you see
6582127 yes i can make an even better copy if i make physical contact with the person im copying
6582128 please dont be mad at me im sorry i pretended to be someone else
6582129 this is why i didnt want to be found out
6582130 i i know but i just dont want to be treated as a kid now im tough and i can do fine on my own if i need to i dont need others giving me things or asking if i need anything
6582131 so i thought that if i changed into someone older someone your age you wouldnt treat me differently and i would be more useful to the group
6582132 if i stayed as myself when we crashed i was sure that i would be a hindrance to the group slowing everyone else down because they would be so worried about me because of my true age
6582133 no ive copied other s m a t girls appearances and found i could also mimic some of their powers but theyre much weaker in comparison
6582134 cool wait so you can change into anyone you see
6582135 yes i can make an even better copy if i make physical contact with the person im copying
6582136 hmmm i think i just had a terrific idea that might help us get out of this dire situation
6582137 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have and he said im not sure ill have to check with my staff true quote im not sure ill have to check with my staff so they asked his staff and he said at least four now think about that i guess if you think that being rich means you gotta make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy is fundamentally strong but if youre like me and youve got one house or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so that they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective

6582162 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6582163 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people

6582178 this convention of churches resides in a strategic partnership with the mission boards of the southern baptist convention and this service of worship will dynamically reveal just how magnificent the work of the international mission board truly is because of the faithful sacrifice and investment of local southern baptist churches
6582179 we are living in crucial times for the proclamation of the gospel
6582180 and it is during moments like these when we come together as a family of southern baptist churches where we thank god for his mighty power in calling out men and women for missionary service its a time to recommit our lives and our churches to investing in the missionary imperative given to us by the lord jesus christ
6582181 we stand on the shoulders of giants who have left us a legacy of faithfulness and zeal for the gospel that we dare not abandon
6582182 i am prayerfully anticipating that this service of worship will be a time when all north carolina baptists come together expecting a mighty move of god in our midst i hope every church throughout the baptist state convention of north carolina will send a large delegation to greensboro to participate and display before a watching world the vital connection between local churches state conventions and the national entities of the southern baptist convention it is here we find our purpose as a denomination to go into all the world and preach the gospel of the lord jesus christ

6582199 si vous regardez du c t du secteur des ressources naturelles ici au canada il y a quelques opportunit s que nous pourrions explorer

6582201 nous devons rechercher les occasions que dautres nont peut tre pas explor y a t il ici au canada des opportunit s auxquelles nous ne nous tions pas attard s auparavant
6582202 when im out there i would hope that our teams a lot more confident that we can make big plays and when its nut cutting time they know the balls coming to me and i can make a play for us
6582203 hes always one of the top receivers in the league possibly the best receiver in the league
6582204 but he doesnt start out with the ball in his hands so its up to us to make sure he doesnt see the ball too often
6582205 it should be a very intense game and hopefully not too high scoring
6582206 hes one of those big play guys that you need to have on your team
6582207 hes the mvp of the league hes the best player on our team and just having him on the field just brings more attention to him and gets receivers jason clermont myself and clarence coleman more time to do things with the ball
6582208 just knowing that hes going to be out there on the field you know hes going to draw a lot of attention defensively so whether or not hes getting the ball or other receivers it just opens up things more for your team
6582209 its just being a manager of the game taking care of the ball making good decisions eating popcorn and watching guys like ken yon rambo the top receiver in the west make plays on the other side
6582210 they pin their ears back early on and they try to get after the quarterback make big plays and cause turnovers
6582211 we were physical and we were able to chop down some of those guys up front were a physical team that plays hard
6582212 they bring this mindset that they think theyre tougher than us so we have to bring that mindset too
6582213 i dont think hes fair dinkum on this matter i dont think its fair dinkum i think its political
6582214 if you look at mr mulcahys history you could pretty well determine why he wouldnt know an ethic if it popped up in his porridge

6582220 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6582221 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6582222 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6582223 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6582224 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6582225 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6582226 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6582227 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6582228 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6582229 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6582230 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6582231 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6582232 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6582233 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
6582234 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
6582235 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6582236 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6582237 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6582238 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6582239 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6582240 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6582241 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6582242 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6582243 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6582244 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6582245 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6582246 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6582247 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6582248 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6582249 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6582250 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6582251 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6582252 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6582253 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales

6582258 there is no other program like it available in the americas
6582259 surfing is a multimillion dollar business i believe it would bring more experienced people into the industry
6582260 everybody can surf but not everybody knows the business behind how surf companies are run
6582261 i think very few people know how surfing contests are run and how to run them efficiently effectively and fairly
6582262 surfing has always been a countercultural activity so to my mind as it gets more institutionalized it loses some of its soul
6582263 i had no direct knowledge and no direct participation in the recent care of the patients in question
6582264 patient confidentiality laws prevent me from discussing these or any other patients who may have been admitted to the facility
6582265 not a very good track record especially at an expensive hospital like that
6582266 weve got experiences skills technologies and strategies to share with californians who are battling the same water challenges as queenslanders
6582267 only she didnt know if she was going to get out
6582268 she knows it wouldnt have stopped he would have kept hitting her
6582269 all she could think about was she might not see her kids again
6582270 shes really all about her family i can picture that giving her strength
6582271 it just shows the mindset of the victim to not only stay calm and think on her feet to get out of the situation and to a safe place but to give us a good description
6582272 we know that he had extended contact with the girl whos now 16
6582273 our concern is there may be additional victims because he clearly has no qualms about contacting girls who are significantly underage
6582274 the update on the deadline is nothing is going to happen with it
6582275 thats whats going to happen with that i dont care about how many threats shaw wants to pull well be doing a press conference if elitexc doesnt see the light here pretty soon and if shaw doesnt stop talking expletive
6582276 i aint waiting until 5 oclock if elitexc officials are holding their breath then someones going to pass out
6582277 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa

6582279 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana

6582281 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6582282 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6582283 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad

6582288 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
6582289 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
6582290 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6582291 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6582292 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6582293 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6582294 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6582295 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6582296 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6582297 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6582298 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6582299 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6582300 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6582301 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6582302 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6582303 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6582304 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6582305 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6582306 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6582307 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6582308 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6582309 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6582310 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6582311 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6582312 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6582313 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6582314 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6582315 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6582316 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6582317 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6582318 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6582319 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6582320 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6582321 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables

6582360 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6582361 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer

6582363 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6582364 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca

6582367 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6582368 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6582369 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6582370 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6582371 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6582372 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

6582437 they feel like theyre making good progress they dont have a hard timeline to share on when that will be complete but its important to bring it back up to operations as safely and quickly as we can
6582438 we were able to get through last weekend with some temporary runouts weve decided that were better off to temporarily close a small number of stations

6582444 i dont understand how confidentiality of the donor would be an issue
6582445 bill said this his father was a great friend of my father
6582446 ill be very frank vietnam divided families divided people it was a terrible time of our country people didnt know one another since then ill be very frank ayers has been in the forefront of a lot of education issues and helping us in public schools and things like that
6582447 its really unfortunate theyre friends so what people do make mistakes in the past you move on this is a new century a new time he reflects back and hes been making a strong contribution to our community

6582450 theyll manage to take this all the way past the election
6582451 battlestar galactica marathon or maybe thats just me even the dalai lama is said to have a passion for expensive watches
6582452 i think they have one of the best offenses we face especially against me theyre all low ball hitters
6582453 i threw a lot of breaking balls and tried not to be so predictable throwing sinker away sinker away
6582454 manny got a stolen base to get us going the bullpen did a great job
6582455 it seemed like dodgers catcher russell martin never moved his glove from where he set up
6582456 i threw him six or seven splits last night i started him with a breaking ball he had to be looking for it i got a little mad started turning it loose
6582457 its very challenging to win a game when you score one run
6582458 though i do believe that there is calculable amount of water to be consumed by individuals it is not a fixed amount and
6582459 the government regularly receives a variety of suggestions for new or different bank holidays
6582460 however it is not possible to please everyone as to whom or what should be celebrated
6582461 creating space and time for volunteering is essential for the health of our society and i firmly believe that this day would encourage more people to get involved with their local community
6582462 the right time for uk companies to leverage off the prominence of our olympic win
6582463 now is the time for uk business to start bidding for olympic contracts for 2012 and beyond
6582464 international sporting events are big business with billions of pounds worth of contracts up for grabs every year
6582465 with all the key decision makers in beijing it is essential that british businesses can promote their expertise and capabilities to an international audience

6582472 the water has covered the beach there isnt really any beach left at all
6582473 we havent been out since tuesday because of the bad driving

6582479 that to me is the most striking part about it transmitting 60 watts at 75 percent efficiency over several feet
6582480 the power pack for your laptop isnt that efficient its one of those things thats almost too good to be true
6582481 discuss their respective visions for the role of service in americas future
6582482 as much as half of the water used to grow food globally may be lost or wasted
6582483 thats like leaving the tap running and pouring 40 trillion liters 10 6 trillion gallons of water into the garbage can enough water to meet the household needs of 500 million people
6582484 improving water productivity and reducing the quantity of food that is wasted can enable us to provide a better diet for the poor and enough food for growing populations
6582485 reaching the target we propose a 50 percent reduction of losses and wastage in the production and consumption chain is a necessary and achievable goal
6582486 we have put this on hold for a few years and this year works out just right und had hoped it would be at a commencement but a convocation for orientation seems like the right thing
6582487 that doesnt sound like posted by languagehat at august 21 2008 05 57 pm
6582488 only a radical break from the status quo that is a profound transformation of the private property system access to power of the exploited class and a social revolution that would break this dependence would allow for the change to a new society a socialist society or at least allow that such a society might be possible
6582489 thus part of what it means to be political and to take political action is to be the church to begin to live out in the present as the church what god intends human beings to be the preaching of the gospel and the celebration of the sacraments are seen in this light political actions this does not give us a blueprint for transforming society or give us a set of concrete historical steps to take in that process of transformation

6582492 this ruling is totally unprecedented in michigan these judges have shown they will do anything to protect the status quo and their perks the real losers here are the taxpayers of michigan
6582493 one of the most important jobs of the supreme court is to guard against the encroachment of the executive branch on the power of the other branches i think he has been a little bit too willing or eager to give an administration whether mine or george bushs more power than the constitution originally intended
6582494 the constitution should be based on the criteria of proven record of strictly adhering to the constitution of the united states of america and not legislating from the bench some of the worst damage has been done by legislating from the bench and by the way justices alito and roberts are two of my most recent favorites
6582495 i have prepared for this moment for a long time nothing except a gold can satisfy me
6582496 i maintained a good stage last year but i couldnt manage to make achievement in world championships but this year i did it with my good form

6582499 it doesnt matter what colour the medal is i have trained for this competition for a long time what keeps driving me to perform is my love for wrestling

6582502 it was better than a sunny and hot day i didnt feel it was very slippery
6582503 i was in good condition i think my regular training is the most important factor contributing to my victory
6582504 i was so glad when i woke up and it was pouring with rain although i wouldnt have minded hot conditions as i may have been able to pick a few more off
6582505 if you had told me last night id have done 87 45 i would have said i had to make the medals
6582506 of course im a bit disappointed to be 33 seconds away from the medals but when i saw the pace and how quickly it was going i knew it was too fast

6582511 we immediately notified local and federal law enforcement agencies and are looking to cooperate with them
6582512 to halt international military cooperation events between russia and nato countries until further instructions
6582513 i cant imagine a circumstance right now that we would engage in military cooperation with the russians until the situation in georgia is resolved
6582514 we still have some very important issues that we need to work with russia on
6582515 i did what i was told to do then he said i had confessed

6582521 discoveries like this are rare and its a chance for us to celebrate the amazing nature of wildlife
6582522 although the cliveden snail hitched a ride to the uk accidentally it doesnt appear to be a threat to our native wildlife
6582523 were now working to ensure that it has a secure future at cliveden

6582549 he is an amazing man for his age and he spent so much time sitting on top of that statue working in the hot sun it took strong will power to continue the task
6582550 i was first offered a site at the angkor wat complex but this was not suitable because they shut the area at 6pm and i want this statue given to the public so they can enjoy it anytime they want

6582566 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6582567 most teachers hold themselves accountable they didnt go into teaching to make money they dont have seven houses
6582568 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses

6582576 in an event where the world record hasnt been in jeopardy since the owner of that same mark took a bow from athletics the mens triple jump final at the beijing olympic games was arguably one of the best the event has ever witnessed

6582662 tons of molten metal was found 21 days after the attack
6582663 steel doesnt begin to melt until 2 700 degrees which is much hotter than what these fires could have caused
6582664 there are holes in this story that you can drive a truck through
6582665 we conducted the study without bias without interference from anyone
6582666 we have only one single minded goal in this effort
6582667 dr steven jones found it in the dust that landed in the entire area of lower manhattan and he finds it in the chunks of previously molten metal from the towers
6582668 if water had been available it is likely that sprinklers would have operated and the building may still be here today
6582669 it looks like they want to wrap up this investigation and blame the collapse on normal office fires
6582670 when suddenly not only are you feeling more insecure with your job you cant get rising wages or rising incomes and the cost of everything from gas to food to healthcare to trying to send your children to college keeps on skyrocketing
6582671 when you find out that you lost your healthcare your pension or you never had it it turns out youre not the only one
6582672 millions of americans have been going through that same loss of security
6582673 these tend to be folks that relocate here they tend to be younger voters also folks who obviously based on their lifestyle would be open to the prescription for change sen obama is offering
6582674 barack obama can spend all the money in the world in some of these republican leaning states but he will still be the most inexperienced presidential candidate in the modern era and he will still have the most liberal record in the united states senate
6582675 he is more liberal than a lot of the state
6582676 its going to be a very difficult race for him in north carolina
6582677 he cant make any promises that are going to help us tomorrow
6582678 its going to be a long time coming out of this
6582679 were doing great things in west virginia and we have a lot of work ahead of us
6582680 once a staunchly democratic state west virginia has voted republican during the past two presidential elections and gave obama such a primary drubbing that out there can no longer justify calling it purple
6582681 they just dont know you barack you need to come back and spend a little time here
6582682 i believe what we see now is the coalition that has formed over the last eight years is still in place
6582683 the message that is important to that part of ohio to that part of western pennsylvania is a message that resonates with west virginia too
6582684 we still intend to work hard and full throttle because you cant take anything for granted in west virginia
6582685 for a lot of people who have health insurance they are paying more for health care but it may not show up as concretely as paying 70 to fill their gas tank
6582686 college costs health care costs and energy costs are up and income is down
6582687 any one of those subjects touches a raw nerve for the middle class in this country im seeing it in race after race
6582688 the issue of health care may be getting less attention than it deserves from the media but its still a top concern for voters and among the top issues that sen obama talks about on the campaign trail
6582689 there is a stark contrast in the way both candidates would address the issue because the views on providing affordability accessibility and portability of health care are so divergent it could hardly escape the conversation each candidate will have with voters
6582690 if people had to pass that many signs that announced how much health care costs you can bet it would be at the top of the agenda
6582691 it is strikingly different from 2000 when gore spent 60 percent of the time at most events talking about health care
6582692 in new york we dont think of alternative power as something that we just import from other parts of the nation
6582693 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6582694 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6582695 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6582696 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6582697 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6582698 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6582699 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6582700 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6582701 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6582702 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6582703 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6582704 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6582705 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6582706 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6582707 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6582708 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6582709 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6582710 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6582711 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6582712 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6582713 americans across our country are hurting because of the cost of energy
6582714 its time for america to get serious about energy independence and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this
6582715 everyone says america is the land of opportunity for renewables
6582716 its kind of hard to clear a case with a victim you cant find
6582717 with these robberies were questioning in some cases whether they are really taking place
6582718 bang bang per n es m o o te mato huev n
6582719 en medio del delirio ambiental reinante en el pedregoso exilio europeo dijo testimonios independientes cual el de este insobornable se or cualifican como otros tantos recursos a la tercera instancia te ayudan a comprender que no que no te has vuelto loco que esas pesadillas que tanto te atormentan son m s bien pruebas fehacientes de tu cordura y lucidez
6582720 if we let people see that kind of thing there would never again be any war
6582721 heating of floor beams and girders caused a critical support column to fail
6582722 video and photographic evidence combined with detailed computer simulations show that neither explosives nor fuel oils played a role in the collapse that brought the building down
6582723 seven world trade center is one of the key points of evidence one of the smoking guns
6582724 there have been much hotter longer lasting and larger fires in skyscrapers that have not fallen down
6582725 our take home message today is the reason for the collapse of world trade center 7 is no longer a mystery
6582726 it did not collapse from explosives or fuel oil fires
6582727 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
6582728 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
6582729 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
6582730 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
6582731 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
6582732 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning
6582733 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
6582734 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
6582735 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
6582736 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
6582737 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
6582738 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
6582739 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
6582740 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
6582741 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
6582742 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
6582743 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
6582744 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
6582745 the challenges we face today from saving our planet to ending poverty are simply too big for government to solve alone
6582746 if you get a federal grant you cant use that grant money to proselytize to the people you help and you cant discriminate against them or against the people you hire on the basis of their religion
6582747 federal dollars that go directly to churches temples and mosques can only be used on secular programs
6582748 for those of who us who believe in protecting the integrity of our religious institutions this is a fundamental right
6582749 return the law to what it was before the current administration
6582750 any religious organization that does not want to comply with that requirement simply doesnt have to take the money
6582751 if you cant hire people within your faith community than youve lost the distinctive that is the reason why faith based programs exist in the first place
6582752 disagrees with sen obama that hiring at faith based groups should be subject to government oversight
6582753 wants a faith based program thats even better than the bush program
6582754 his plan reminds me of much that was best in both then vice president al gores and then texas gov george w bushs respective first speeches on the subject in 1999
6582755 especially in urban america all the empirical evidence continues to show that local faith based organizations can make a measurable civic difference
6582756 i am disappointed that any presidential candidate would want to continue a failed policy of the bush administration it ought to be shut down not continued
6582757 i didnt grow up in a particularly religious household but my experience in chicago showed me how faith and values could be an anchor in my life and an anchor in the community
6582758 while i could sit in church and pray all i want i wouldnt be fulfilling gods will unless i went out and did the lords work
6582759 i think it is a bold smart engaging attempt to use religious organizations to help the poor and to do for the faith community what the bush administration could not
6582760 but im concerned that his position on hiring rights will bog down this initiative just like bushs position on the other side did the same thing
6582761 i have always believed that the second amendment protects the right of individuals to bear arms
6582762 but i also identify with the need for crime ravaged communities to save their children from the violence that plagues our streets through common sense effective safety measures
6582763 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6582764 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6582765 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6582766 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6582767 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6582768 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6582769 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6582770 were doing jokes about people in his orbit not really about him
6582771 people have a tendency to react as far as their ideology allows them
6582772 i think some of us were maybe too quick to caricature al gore and john kerry and theres maybe some reluctance to do the same thing to him
6582773 anything that has even a whiff of being racist no one is going to laugh
6582774 the audience is not going to allow anyone to do that
6582775 most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive and we agree
6582776 totally inappropriate and frankly i understand if sen obama and his supporters would find it offensive
6582777 we put people in a crazy box they might be truly offended by it but the reaction is part of the standard digestive process bill maher who is host of a politically oriented late night show on hbo said if you cant do irony on the cover of the new yorker where can you do it one issue that clearly has some impact on writing jokes about obama is a consistency among the big late night shows not only are all the hosts white the vast majority of their audiences are white i think white audiences get a little self conscious if race comes up sweeney of obriens show said things might be somewhat different if even one late night host was black black comics are not having any trouble joking about obama said david alan grier a comedian who starting in october will have a satirical news magazine show on comedy central chocolate news i tell jokes on stage about him grier said reciting a few that would not ever get onto a network late night show nor into the new york times but he said of the late night hosts those guys really cant go there its just like the gay comic can do gay material it comes with the territory
6582778 no way theyve had 200 years of presidential jokes its our time jimmy kimmel the host of the abc late night talk show jimmy kimmel live
6582779 theres a weird reverse racism going on you cant joke about him because hes half white its silly i think its more a problem because hes so polished he doesnt seem to have any flaws maher said that being sensitive to obama was in no way interfering with his commentary though on hbo he has more freedom about content than other comedians theres been this question about whether hes black enough
6582780 i have this joke what does he have to do dunk he bowled a 37 to me thats black enough kimmel said i think his ears should be the focus of the jokes mostly the late night shows seem to be in a similar position were just waiting
6582781 there hasnt been a lot of frame of reference about obama yet not like hillary or mccain but there will be
6582782 it is hopeless this one is like the other one they are all the same nothing will change dont expect change
6582783 hell have to be good to israel if not he wont be re elected to a second term
6582784 will remain the capital of israel and it must remain undivided
6582785 the arabs need america to be straight and unbiased but anyway we feel that american policy will not be changed too much
6582786 one day he is with the palestinian cause one day hes with israel we have a saying here whats better a black dog or a white dog its all the same for us nothing will change
6582787 we rooted for this and that and nothing happened its deja vu
6582788 unless the americans realize that they really have to change and become more evenhanded and apply justice in the region things will be the same
6582789 obama is excellent he is direct he is like the successor to jfk
6582790 yes they are all bad but still obama might be a little less bad
6582791 for me it doesnt matter that hes black or his name is hussein
6582792 hes an american and so i disagree with most of what he says about the arab world i mean condoleezza rice was black and poor and she still invaded iraq
6582793 i think its very impressive that someone can start very poor and reach the top like this
6582794 would not object to a little revolution now and again in british columbia after confederation if we were treated unfairly
6582795 ich hoffe dass der so d ster und realistisch bleibt wie der erste batman von regisseur chris nolan
6582796 ich war schon ewig nicht mehr im kino aber f r den film lass ich sogar das l nderspiel von deutschland heute abend sausen dabei bin ich eigentlich spider man fan
6582797 geiler film bis jetzt das habe ich aber auch nicht anders erwartet
6582798 der war klasse ich kenne alle batman geschichten auch aus den 60er und 70er jahren doch der film spielt heute und das ist super der joker ist genial wirklich schade das heath ledger tot ist
6582799 russian president is beginning to sound like a broken record first his troops will be out on monday then his troops are going to be out on wednesday now his troops are going to be out on friday i am begining to wonder if the russian president is ever going to keep his word or can he keep his word or what is going on there
6582800 c mo pueden tenerle tanto miedo si su casa esta bien fea
6582801 it was the american colonels even more than the generals who were asking for more troops
6582802 we believe in why we are fighting here and we want to finish this fight we know we can win it
6582803 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
6582804 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
6582805 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
6582806 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
6582807 when suddenly not only are you feeling more insecure with your job you cant get rising wages or rising incomes and the cost of everything from gas to food to healthcare to trying to send your children to college keeps on skyrocketing
6582808 when you find out that you lost your healthcare your pension or you never had it it turns out youre not the only one
6582809 millions of americans have been going through that same loss of security
6582810 these tend to be folks that relocate here they tend to be younger voters also folks who obviously based on their lifestyle would be open to the prescription for change sen obama is offering
6582811 barack obama can spend all the money in the world in some of these republican leaning states but he will still be the most inexperienced presidential candidate in the modern era and he will still have the most liberal record in the united states senate
6582812 he is more liberal than a lot of the state
6582813 its going to be a very difficult race for him in north carolina
6582814 he cant make any promises that are going to help us tomorrow
6582815 its going to be a long time coming out of this
6582816 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6582817 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6582818 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6582819 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
6582820 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill
6582821 the real impact is that organizations of all sizes now may choose work loads that is portions of their data or certain office locations where cloud storage is appropriate from a cost availability risk perspective
6582822 many applications will benefit from the use of amazon ebs any application that can benefit from reliable block storage can benefit from amazon ebs
6582823 there arent too many authors of note who have passed through l a in the last three decades whom connie hasnt interviewed and interviewed well
6582824 this inherently transdisciplinary archive will provide material for research projects for generations of scholars and students
6582825 digitizing these tapes will give students and others an opportunity to hear and watch these outstanding authors for themselves whenever they want
6582826 seeing authors up close like this provides a rich point of view to their work
6582827 drucker believed that a healthy society is run by organizations whose values are shaped by a wide range of disciplines history sociology psychology culture and religion
6582828 in fact drucker once described management books as dreadful trash and suggested that he derived much of his philosophy from novelists such as austen balzac and others
6582829 is a beautiful setting for the tapes to call home
6582830 the couple originally denied reports that they were pregnant in an attempt to take back the right to release the joyous news themselves
6582831 more than 55 000 people die in scotland each year palliative care should be an integral part of the support given to patients and their families and carers during the last months days and hours of their lives
6582832 we were joking about calling them mary kate and ashley
6582833 i know guys are supposed to say i want a boy but i just have a feeling im going to be good with girls
6582834 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6582835 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6582836 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6582837 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6582838 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees
6582839 it honors the hard work of so many people who supported sen clinton
6582840 many of the pennsylvania delegates worked their heart out for sen clinton and theyre excited to cast a vote for her from my vantage point that will be closure for them
6582841 the government has taken tremendous liberties with our liberty taking away our liberty in the name of fighting terrorism using fear to take away peoples rights and their privacy in this country
6582842 and thats caused me and a lot of americans to lose a great deal of faith in the government which ought to be protecting our liberties not taking them away
6582843 they simply dont want the competition from an outsider so to speak somebody that might make them feel uncomfortable by raising some issues some new perspectives some new choices for the american people
6582844 youll get to see hillary speak on tuesday and barack obama the next president of the united states on thursday
6582845 and i hear hillary and you will have a chat ill make sure to stop by
6582846 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6582847 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6582848 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6582849 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6582850 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
6582851 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
6582852 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6582853 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6582854 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6582855 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6582856 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6582857 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6582858 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6582859 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6582860 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6582861 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6582862 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6582863 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6582864 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6582865 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6582866 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6582867 trying so hard to be perfect that it is stultifying
6582868 if obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him it wont be the economy thats depressed it will be the rest of us
6582869 to be in love with a country or a political regime is a tricky business you get your heart broken even more surely than by being in love with a person you may even lose your life i knew a woman political activist in the old days in this case the 1950s she spent her days and her nights working to undo the white regime in south africa needing a rest she went to visit nigeria to see her dream made flesh found it was run by human beings and committed suicide everyone who has been involved with idealistic rhetorical politics knows a thousand versions of this story from all over the world
6582870 theres something for every woman and thats very important to us ive always hated when lingerie is uncomfortable so the fit and comfort was key
6582871 it is well known that anyone who was a p o w instantly has special knowledge dealing with all matters dealing with foreign countries even in the face of absurdly untrue and factually incorrect statements
6582872 this crack is moving and moving closer and closer to the front its just a matter of time till a much larger piece is going to break off it is imminent
6582873 as we see this phenomenon occurring further and further north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern
6582874 its a signal but we dont know what it means
6582875 the crack is not alarming i would say it is normal
6582876 it could go back for miles and miles and theres no real mechanism to stop it
6582877 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
6582878 id rather be hated for who i am than loved for who im not
6582879 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
6582880 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
6582881 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
6582882 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous

6582886 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
6582887 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst

6582889 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
6582890 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals

6582900 black theology refuses to accept a god who is not identified totally with the goals of the black community if god is not for us and against white people then he is a murderer and we had better kill him the task of black theology is to kill gods who do not belong to the black community black theology will accept only the love of god which participates in the destruction of the white enemy what we need is the divine love as expressed in black power which is the power of black people to destroy their oppressors here and now by any means at their disposal unless god is participating in his holy activity we must reject his love

6582910 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6582911 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6582912 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6582913 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6582914 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6582915 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6582916 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program

6582944 i told her a number of times that shes by far the best goalkeeper in the world
6582945 and if she goes by you youre not going to catch her so for us we were trying to keep her outside more than anything
6582946 for sure she really got into that ball very well i think actually it had a certain move to the ball right
6582947 vindicated i dont even think about that whatever i said last year im just enjoying this moment right now i feel great i just won a gold medal
6582948 this game i had a different feeling usually the nerves are going theres anxiety right up until the whistle blows to start the game something felt different

6582960 its a little bit of a surprise how strong some of the numbers were in july
6582961 weve been waiting for some moderation but especially with some of the meat prices and how much has come through relatively recently at the retail level leads me to believe the overall number may be a little bit higher for the year
6582962 we havent seen those prices reflected in the finished products yet

6582966 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
6582967 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
6582968 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited

6582971 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
6582972 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
6582973 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
6582974 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
6582975 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
6582976 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
6582977 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt

6582980 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
6582981 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
6582982 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her

6582988 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6582989 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
6582990 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
6582991 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
6582992 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6582993 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
6582994 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them

6583030 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves

6583032 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
6583033 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
6583034 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
6583035 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
6583036 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
6583037 experts from a ukrainian think tank say russia could provoke ukraine into employing spetsnaz special operations forces
6583038 experts do not exclude provocations from russia aimed at goading ukrainian authorities into decisions to utilize spetsnaz units
6583039 there are signs that the russian side is finalizing scenarios envisaging application of armed forces although the basic principles of action will remain political and economic pressure and a policy of intimidation of the population
6583040 the russian federation has too great an arsenal of non military tools for them to yield to temptation and use armed forces
6583041 after the russian georgian war the arsenal of activities of the russian authorities and the number of anti ukrainian measures on the territory of ukraine will be noticeably extended provocations for the purpose of adoption by the ukrainian authorities of solutions using spetznaz units are not excluded
6583042 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6583043 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6583044 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6583045 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6583046 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america

6583313 its important for our fellow citizens to understand when you think patriot act constitutional guarantees are in place when it comes to doing what is necessary to protect our homeland because we value the constitution
6583314 the power of the executive to cast a man into prison without formulating any charge known to the law and particularly to deny him the judgment of his peers is in the highest degree odious and is the foundation of all totalitarian government whether nazi or communist
6583315 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile it is morally treasonable to the american public
6583316 its like seeing sand castles everywhere and thinking that theyre actually castles
6583317 trucking delivers america trucks transport virtually 100 percent of groceries medicine clothing appliances and even the fuel thats pumped at the local gas station
6583318 diesel fuel prices are hurting us and driving up the costs of all of these consumer goods we need a comprehensive energy plan the national conservation environment and energy independence act is part of this comprehensive solution
6583319 petroleums high price is not only straining family budgets at the pump its driving up the price of groceries and basic household goods because truckers are paying three time more for diesel than they did four years ago
6583320 this plan is a comprehensive energy solution that includes domestic drilling and alternative energy research it will resolve the crisis american families are facing
6583321 but we cant continue to run our business at these high prices the high cost of diesel is cutting into our already tight margins ive had a number of friends go out of business already this year we cant continue to run our business with these high prices
6583322 if ever we needed a call for action this is it
6583323 the cost of obesity is growing out of all proportion
6583324 if the states and territories know the extent of the problem in their jurisdiction that will help them focus
6583325 this is the beginning of an ongoing navy airlift that will initially deliver approximately seven tons of humanitarian aid
6583326 the announcements today impact domestic customers though obviously business customers are also affected by rising wholesale prices as well we will be writing to our sme customers who are not on fixed price contracts to notify them of changes to their tariffs
6583327 the remaining three providers will put up prices soon and then wed expect to see another round of rises in january again in the 22 to 25 per cent range
6583328 business tariffs will see a similar spike at that time
6583329 if you dont give notice soon and you are not on a fixed price contract you will be automatically hit by the increases
6583330 but if you give notice you can shop around and may even get a better deal from your current supplier
6583331 la normativa estaba vigente pero no la hemos usado en los ltimos a os
6583332 a veces los ni os m s peque os obedecen mejor si se les da un azote cuando les das la mano se toman el brazo
6583333 un profesor o director pega al ni o en las nalgas con una pala de madera que t picamente mide unos 45 cent metros normalmente entre tres y 10 ocasiones
6583334 la pobreza y la falta de recursos ayudan a crear una serie de condiciones que desemboca en castigo f sico los profesores se encuentran con clases desbordadas y carecen de recursos como el de consejeros que les ayuden con estudiantes problem ticos
6583335 just as britain invested in the north sea in the 1970s to transform our energy prospects through oil production we must today make a similar investment in renewable technologies to harness britains vast renewable energy resources combined with major reductions in energy consumption
6583336 a massive part of the problem with the governments energy strategy is that at the moment you have lots of different departments dealing with it and that results in some of the splits weve seen between berr and defra
6583337 thats why the olympic delivery model is so interesting because you have berr and the department of culture and sport working together on the project under one authority
6583338 provide clean base load power and is potentially a very important contributor to australias energy mix in a carbon constrained world
6583339 the first question organisations need to answer is whether their turnover rates are outside the norm and need addressing
6583340 the typical organisation in todays environment can view a five per cent staff turnover as a normal cost of doing business
6583341 it managers often worry that investments in training will be reaped by other organisations when it workers shop their new skills around
6583342 but this study indicates that investing in training is actually the best way to retain employees
6583343 while offering competitive salaries and benefit packages may be important for recruitment providing quality of life incentives and enhancing working environments are more important for retention
6583344 i would say we have doubled the size of the uk office and added probably five new desks for our expansion but already were finding that too small
6583345 in the first year we did something like 500 000 and almost got to 1m and then it has doubled every year
6583346 we are running at about 5m for the uk and it is thought that next year we will be looking at about 6 5m
6583347 we are building up to a major september launch the uk sme market is just waking up to the efficiencies to be gained from inventory or stock control and asset management
6583348 that is why we are going through the retail and independent reseller channel rather than the auto id channel
6583349 so you might potentially make 120 per cent margin on wasp
6583350 eligible ratepayers must apply for the relief each year businesses which have not yet applied for sbrr are running out of time as the deadline for applications this year is 30 september
6583351 oh my g d that is the coolest person alive
6583352 a punch and judy man received a standard letter from an event organiser asking him to submit a health and safety risk assessment however when he questioned the need for it they backed off and no paperwork was required it sounds like wires got crossed somewhere and perhaps the standard letter was sent in error hses guidance is clear if there is genuinely no significant risk nothing needs to be written down if a written assessment is needed keep it fit for purpose and crucially act on it paperwork without action does no one any good
6583353 we looked at length of stay and unplanned readmissions and the number of people that returned to a hospital following a stay has decreased between the years 2004 and 2005
6583354 youre talking about massive youth unemployment in east timor of more than 50 per cent of young people

6583361 this is the first report to conclude that tobacco advertising and promotion increases tobacco use
6583362 its the first report to make the conclusion that there is a causal relationship between exposure to depiction of smoking in the movies and youth beginning to smoke
6583363 cigarettes are one of the most heavily marketed products in the united states
6583364 now it is up to the government to consider the evidence and think about what it needs to do in terms of advertising and promotion
6583365 this report sends an unmistakable message to our elected officials that they can dramatically reduce tobacco use by children and by adults by passing legislation that would authorize the food and drug administration to regulate tobacco products and by adequately funding their state prevention and cessation programs
6583366 it appears that many of the conclusions in the report are based on marketing practices that are more than 30 or 40 years old
6583367 we think its important to focus on the marketing practices that we have in place today
6583368 its not about looking at whats gone wrong or to criticise its looking forward at a view for the future and what we need to have in five years time
6583369 the conservatives wanted evidence based policy and an independent review to produce a vision that could feed into their decision making policy we will be using contributed evidence from around the world

6583378 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison

6583381 why doesnt he demonstrate a particular attribute of gods which is that god is a welcoming god
6583382 in the aftermath of the recent outbreaks fda wanted to fast track an important tool to help industry improve the safety of fresh produce

6583404 mosport is a very difficult track it is fast and definitely takes some time to learn its a lot of fun to drive but its tough to be confident here because of the high speed turns many of which are fifth and fourth gear turns and the complexity im really looking forward to the race the pressure is on its a critical point in the championship for all of the drivers and teams and you should see some exciting racing this weekend
6583405 were back to our standard 2 hour and 45 minute event it should be a two stop race if all goes as planned for as fast and challenging as mosport is we usually see few cautions here but at our last race at road america there were more cautions than wed ever seen at that track hopefully this is not a trend i expect sundays race to be a tough one everyone is pushing hard for the championship and with high level of competition in the prototype classes managing traffic is going to be an issue in gt2 ferrari showed tremendous pace at road america we definitely have our work cut out for us this weekend

6583408 there have been very substantial gains at this point dont take any of this to imply that we think were anywhere near finished

6583418 i chose joelle this month because shes a business owner who is not only concerned about the bottom line but with the well being of her employees i also love that she works with her husband and that her family is her first priority i think shes a woman whos got her head on straight and for that reason i chose her to be a role model for skirt readers you can be a successful career woman and a woman who puts her family first
6583419 it chose me i had four sisters and enjoyed doing their hair when i went to have my hair done i always stayed afterwards to ask my stylist questions so when i was about 19 my hairdresser said joelle why dont you go to hair school i signed up the next day because i saw a career path that for me had all the right appeal i could own my own business which would give me the flexibility for a family i would be doing something that would help others feel good and i could become a mentor to young stylists
6583420 i often went with her and witnessed the love and joy she brought to her job because she was making people feel better i realized that i also wanted a career centered on helping people as a stylist and business owner i not only help my clients by improving their appearance im often a shoulder to cry on or just someone to listen and i help young stylists become successful by training and mentoring them it has been a privilege and immensely gratifying to have so many positive relationships with so many people now im considering becoming a consultant to help other salon owners improve their businesses

6583439 the combination of rapidly declining consumer confidence pressure on household incomes fuel price increases and emission regulations has resulted in the second hand car market being hit extremely hard in the first half of the year
6583440 highlighting the large gap between the expectations of vendors and buyers in the current market
6583441 the overall market was down 6 5 per cent or 33 000 units compared to 2007 levels this is the lowest number of second hand cars sold in a 6 month period since 2002
6583442 sales of repossessed vehicles on behalf of finance companies have been strong up 106 per cent year to date and the commercial business has undertaken more insolvency work
6583443 an extensive review of the property requirement for the group has been carried out resulting in some short term savings through amalgamation of branches or subletting properties
6583444 this has enabled the company to keep property costs in line with 2007 which is pleasing given the upward trend in commercial rents staff expenses are higher compared to last year due to the impact of legislative changes affecting holiday pay and the minimum wage
6583445 as indicated at the agm in april the company committed to investing in a repositioning of the turners brand with a large advertising and public relations campaign completed over the may to july period which has resulted in a significant increase in awareness levels

6583457 but looking beforehand there were about 15 guys who were faster than me so i improved on where i was seeded it would have been real hard for me get top 10
6583458 this year he was a half lap behind hes closing the gap
6583459 these guys are the best in the world for a reason

6583476 so it means a lot more to me actually than the 100 means
6583477 hes just blessed with an uncanny frame an uncanny quickness a huge competitive heart and he is having a good time which i think our sport sorely needs to see
6583478 he got an incredible start guys of 6 5 should not be able to start like that its that long massive stride hes eating up so much more track than others he came in focused knowing he would likely win the gold and hes got the record
6583479 youre back there giving it everything youve got its brutal
6583480 hes doing it and making it look so simple michael johnson did it and it didnt look that easy
6583481 im on the track hes in the water we cant compare too much hes the best in what he do

6583521 bei einer niederlage w rde die unruhe in verein und umfeld noch st rker werden klinsmann muss jetzt siege einfahren das bringt die kritiker zum schweigen du musst gewinnen nur das z hlt beim fc bayern wenn das nicht passiert wird es ein windiger herbst f r j rgen klinsmann ich w nsche mir aber dass er siege einf hrt und seine philosophie greift ich m chte ihn noch lange bei bayern sehen
6583522 j rgen klinsmann predigte das offensivspiel das ist alles sch n und gut aber du darfst die abwehr nicht vergessen es kann nicht sein dass du gegen erfurt und den hsv f nf gegentore bekommst die abwehr muss stabil stehen das ist das wichtigste sonst wirst du keine gro en titel gewinnen
6583523 den bayern fehlt die kreativit t bastian schweinsteiger spielt in meinen augen auf der falschen position ich sehe ihn nicht auf der au enposition sondern im zentrum dort w re er noch st rker und w rde die bayern unberechenbarer machen
6583524 ich glaube nicht dass sie in der champions league ein w rtchen um den titel mitreden k nnen daf r fehlt ihnen die qualit t und die breite im kader
6583525 es wird in diesem jahr viel enger als im vergangenen jahr es wird eine enge kiste
6583526 i am going to make an admission that i never never make
6583527 good public policy was made by someone who knew power knew how to use it but also cared deeply about the state
6583528 power is what richardson talks about i dont talk about power hes crazy
6583529 if i had to pick anybody other than my dad to fight on behalf of new mexicans serve six terms in the senate i would pick you sen domenici
6583530 i hope that for every democrat i inspired that there was at least a republican
6583531 this great country of ours has some really big problems that might be tougher than at any time during my 36 years
6583532 energy and the economy are tied in some kind of struggle that isnt good for us
6583533 clearly we have to do some extraordinary things in the next few years to lessen that demand i wish i were there
6583534 more committed to what they would do with them in terms of trying to make some annual events built around it without question they were enthusiastic about providing facilities over time to house them and keep them in perpetuity
6583535 if her sport was drinking that would be the perfect dress

6583537 if her sport was drinking that would be the perfect dress
6583538 he shall have dominion also from sea to sea and from the river unto the ends of the earth
6583539 i am a canadian free to speak without fear free to worship in my own way free to stand for what i think right free to oppose what i believe wrong or free to choose those who shall govern my country this heritage of freedom i pledge to uphold for myself and all mankind
6583540 as we express our gratitude we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words but to live by them
6583541 that has already been determined now we are just haggling about price

6583547 the court has considerable doubt that lenz will be able to prove that universal acted with the subjective bad faith required
6583548 we need a senator who is going to start addressing the issues now republican christine odonnell charged in a telephone interview that was followed by a news conference in dover
6583549 hes using the people of delaware and this senate career as a fallback to his aspirations to another career the situation is too critical for that
6583550 in this election i should be debating my real competition for this job odonnell said
6583551 and the people of delaware should get the opportunity to cast a vote for the person who is going to fulfill their term hes taken delawareans for granted and using the senate as a placeholder
6583552 whether people agree with my positions or not they should be outraged she said
6583553 this is precisely why our country and our state is in the situation it is
6583554 the situation of the american intellectual at the present time
6583555 what do they know of america who only the upper west side know
6583556 a possibilidade de um bloqueio grande e eu diria que isso deve ter sido feito por quest es de conte do

6583558 these actions would ensure that low power auxiliary operations do not cause harmful interference to new public safety and commercial wireless services in the band

6583560 this is an excellent opportunity to be part of a process that ensures the allocation and ranking of awards is done in a manner that is fair unbiased and in the best interests of the graduate students that you are representing it is also invaluable experience with the grant scholarship fellowship process and how these awards are administered something all of us graduate students have to do

6583566 hier ticken die menschen tats chlich ganz anders als bei uns im norden
6583567 ich ackere hart f r mein comeback sp testens zu meinem 35 geburtstag im november will ich wieder auf dem platz stehen
6583568 vor allem der letzte sektor hat es in sich da gibt es zwei passagen wo man die pobacken zusammenkneifen muss
6583569 of all the magazines and pundit venues i despise the new republic is actually at the top of my list even ahead of weekly standard and comrades im sure you dont disagree but marty peretz and his little jamie kirchick alone would be enough to warrant that and theyre just the tip of the heinous iceberg
6583570 ive been raising money to help pay for the trip and what i keep telling people is that this is going to be a life changing experience for me
6583571 theres something to be said that a black candidate is going to be the nominee for the party on the anniversary of the i have a dream speech its just a great feeling to be a part of such a significant event
6583572 we went door to door a lot and would get them slammed in our faces or have insults yelled at us
6583573 but then youd get that one person who was willing to listen and you would explain what you wanted to say and get your point across and that just made it all worth it
6583574 youve got these younger kids who have so much enthusiasm and excitement
6583575 greg was the only one out of all the candidates who had been in our office and he just seemed to have the idealism that you want in a delegate
6583576 i first became involved in politics in 1972 with george mcgovern
6583577 and ive been involved ever since then the reason you first get into something like this is because you believe in what the people or the party represent for me particularly with ted kennedy he was pushing for a health plan and that was very important to me at the time
6583578 and i decided to run to be a delegate and take it to the national level so that i could be on the cutting edge of what was happening and ive been that way ever since
6583579 cuando se entre se definir en el acto si se hace la plast a
6583580 en caso de que no haya ruptura del ligamento cruzado tardar de cuatro a seis semanas en recuperarse pero en caso contrario la rehabilitaci n ser de entre cinco o seis meses
6583581 existe esta oportunidad por la lesi n de vidrio pero todav a no hay nada seguro hay que esperar hasta el d a del partido cuando d la alineaci n el profe pero nosotros estamos preparados por si nos toca entrar pero sino hay que apoyar al compa ero que le toque estar dentro
6583582 siempre los puestos est n muy peleados y vamos a tratar de aprovechar la oportunidad si se presenta tenemos que ir por la victoria pues es lo m s importante y queremos dar un buen partido sabemos que ellos tienen jugadores importantes y que les gusta jugar muy bien al futbol y ser un partido importante y esperamos salir con la victoria
6583583 yo me voy a adelantar a decir que en la eliminatoria que vamos a jugar por ejemplo contra canad ah suelen jugar en c sped artificial nosotros contamos con unas instalaciones de vanguardia entonces no dudo que la casa club del necaxa pueda ser muy atractiva para el t cnico nacional y para la selecci n pensando en que puedan encontrarse en alguna fase de la eliminatoria con alguna cancha de pasto sint tico
6583584 ah es prematuro hablar del tema ah no se ha comentado nada al respecto pero desde luego siempre es una gran ilusi n nosotros contamos con todo para que aqu se pueda albergar un juego de selecci n nacional
6583585 nosotros estamos en comunicaci n constante con paco ram rez auxiliar nacional y eso va a facilitar el hecho de que volteen a ver al necaxa no s lo en el primer equipo en las fuerzas b sicas hay jugadores con enormes cualidades para poder llegar a cualquier selecci n nacional creo que hoy vamos a tener m s presencia que en a os anteriores
6583586 hoy es el momento de ir definiendo el rumbo y esto s lo lo va a dar el ganar hay mucha confianza de obtener un muy buen resultado en zapopan que es el partido que estamos esperando y para el que nos preparamos durante la semana
6583587 normalmente lo hacemos ver el video en la concentraci n o en otros momentos pero nos dio la posibilidad porque despu s vamos a ir a un almuerzo con la directiva y ten amos el margen porque el video lo bamos a ver el viernes all en canc n adelantarlo lo vimos hoy hemos cometido errores como se hab a hablado y es bueno poder debatirlo hablarlo y simplemente adelantamos lo que bamos a hacer ma ana
6583588 n stor est bien el domingo se va a la selecci n sub 20 tuvo un peque o inconveniente en el entreno del martes ayer trabaj hugo ayala y es lo m s probable que juegue
6583589 hay que encontrar de nuevo la v a del gol se han presentado las oportunidades pero en m an lisis el equipo ha tenido situaciones contra cruz azul se tuvo para cerrar el partido y despu s se pag caro y lo mismo el otro d a en un partido que se pudo haber liquidado en el primer tiempo si tenemos un desaf o inmediato es tener m s efectividad a la hora de la definici n que aquellas situaciones que se presenten puedan definir un partido
6583590 es un jugador que cualquier momento puede cambiar el rumbo de un partido
6583591 en lo personal creo que se tiene que llevar un proceso los jugadores de experiencia junto con los j venes creo que puede haber esa combinaci n y no s lo con jugadores de juventud que por ah les pes un poco son jugadores de much sima calidad pero hay que llevarlos de a poco
6583592 fue una buena decisi n de eriksson es un gran jugador cuauht moc y lo vimos en el partido prendi y motiv a la afici n es un jugador que tiene la chispa y en cualquier momento puede cambiar el rumbo de un partido lo busc el gol pero de igual manera motiv al cuadro para seguir insistiendo
6583593 todos fueron importantes porque todos buscaron da la casualidad por ah que cuando entr cuauht moc se tuvieron y aprovecharon algunas posibilidades pero el esfuerzo se hizo parejo
6583594 para uno siempre es motivante ser convocado cada quien tiene que ir mentaliz ndose de que va a jugar y ya ser decisi n del entrenador si jugar s siento que los tres porteros que vamos tenemos las mismas posibilidades hay que esperar la oportunidad y aprovecharla
6583595 han sido pocas satisfacciones y pocas oportunidades de demostrar lo que significa para m esa camiseta as que tras reflexionar mucho prefiero anunciar p blicamente que con el actual equipo t cnico de la selecci n francesa prefiero dedicar todo mi tiempo al fiorentina
6583596 no quiero faltar el respeto al actual seleccionador pero es evidente que no entro en sus planes
6583597 no tiene la preparaci n para dirigir un juego de esta categor a pero eso lo hace la fifa
6583598 buscar la oportunidad de equilibrar el juego despu s de la expulsi n de steve cherundolo

6583651 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
6583652 hat trotzdem spa gemacht aber ich gebe eben lieber im ring richtig gas da will ich n mlich unbedingt die nummer eins sein
6583653 wir waren vorm kauf von kompanys sportlichen qualit ten berzeugt in den zwei jahren sind unsere erwartungen aber nicht erf llt worden
6583654 wir werden die kompletten erl se aus dem transfer mit sofortiger wirkung wieder in den defensiv bereich investieren
6583655 hoffentlich bleiben jetzt alle abwehr spieler sonst muss ich mich mit zwei trainings einheiten selbst in form bringen
6583656 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
6583657 ich kann es kaum abwarten zu spielen ich brauche das spielfeld und die fans im stadion um das adrenalin im blut zu sp ren das ist wichtiger als zu trainieren
6583658 miro ist in einer aufbauphase bei ihm fehlt es noch im eins gegen eins und bei der explosivit t aber das ist nach einer em ganz normal
6583659 ich will in dortmund unbedingt treffen und die torj gerkanone will ich mir auch erneut schnappen
6583660 klinsmann war ja ein gro artiger st rmer hat viele tore erzielt wenn wir nicht treffen muss er spielen
6583661 leider konnte unser partner vfb stuttgart bei der fertigstellung des jahrbuchs aus produktionstechnischen gr nden noch kein aktuelles foto von jens lehmann im neuen torwarttrikot abbilden
6583662 ich habe niemals die erlaubnis erteilt dieses bild zu manipulieren
6583663 gut ansonsten f hle ich mich aber v llig leer im kopf
6583664 ja der frust sechs lange monate nicht spielen zu k nnen ist enorm gro
6583665 meine eltern meine sechs br der die nichten und neffen sie alle haben mir aufmunternde briefe geschrieben mit mama und papa telefoniere ich fast im 20 minuten takt fast rund um die uhr
6583666 nat rlich kehli hat mir sogar gesagt wie sehr mich die jungs vermissen weil pl tzlich keiner mehr da ist der nach dem duschen ihre badelatschen auf der toilette versteckt
6583667 das muss sein nicht mein schicksal steht im vordergrund sondern das der mannschaft wenn ich zur ckkomme werde ich den kampf um meine position wieder aufnehmen
6583668 ein guter und intelligenter junge ich dr cke ihm die daumen dass er seine chance nutzt
6583669 nein ich will unbedingt ins stadion im laufe des freitags soll ich die klinik verlassen d rfen mit kr cken und einer schiene die ich mindestens acht wochen tragen muss
6583670 mit vielen intensiven gespr chen der formulierung gemeinsamer ziele und spa im training
6583671 jeder spieler hat die zeiten eingehalten und viel wichtiger jeder hat selbst den letzten lauf mit der power durchgezogen als w re es der erste sprint gewesen
6583672 es geht ums stehverm gen und das in der bundesliga das tempo h her ist haben wir ja in wolfsburg schon gemerkt
6583673 drei tage vor einem spiel kann man auch noch richtig gas im training geben
6583674 damit habe ich berhaupt nicht gerechnet in den letzten wochen hat sich alles nur um die vorbereitung auf den wm kampf gegen john ruiz am 30 august gedreht da h tte ich nicht gedacht dass berhaupt jemand notiz von meinem geburtstag nimmt
6583675 sie hat mir so gefehlt sie hatte nicht verraten dass sie kommt das ist wunderbar
6583676 werder ist ein top team kriegt mit claudio pizarro einen extra schub aber wir sind auf augenh he mit ihnen in homburg zu spielen war psychologisch schwieriger
6583677 noch ist unsere organisation im spiel nicht perfekt doch wir sind ganz schwer zu schlagen das gibt uns ein gutes gef hl
6583678 davor hat schalke dort 2 0 gewonnen aber ich habe mir beide spiele nicht mehr angeschaut wichtig ist nur was werder letzten samstag beim 2 2 in bielefeld gemacht hat
6583679 apple sold these devices on the promise that they were twice as fast as the pre existing phones and that they would function suitably or properly on the 3g network but thus far apple and the phone have failed to deliver on this promise
6583680 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
6583681 es stimmt ich habe von anfragen an zwei deutsche klubs geh rt
6583682 schlie lich sind wir ein verein mit riesiger tradition haben acht titel und die gr te halle europas
6583683 warten wir mal wenn eine anfrage kommen sollte werden wir uns das nat rlich anh ren
6583684 wir haben ber unser spiel gesprochen er wei wie er sich taktisch zu verhalten hat
6583685 claudio ist ein schlitzohr vor dem tor er wei wohin der ball springt
6583686 wir haben genau besprochen wie er seine zeit hier angehen muss mit vollem engagement und allem was dazugeh rt
6583687 claudio wird sich eine wohnung nehmen und das wird schnell gehen
6583688 seine familie wird oft kommen damit sie ber nacht bleiben kann sollte die wohnung gro sein
6583689 es geht nicht dass claudio alle drei vier tage nach england fliegt will er seine familie sehen muss diese nach bremen kommen
6583690 certains ont pu se faire expliser lext rieur de la base et dautres ont t tu s par nos hommes

6583693 nous nabandonnons pas le conseil otan russie mais aussi longtemps que les forces russes occuperont une grande partie de la g orgie je ne vois pas le conseil se r unir quelque niveau que ce soit

6583695 kazadan hemen sonra aracin yanina gittiginiz ve yardim cagirmak yerine fotograf cekmeye devam ettiginiz soyleniyor dogru mu
6583696 kaza yapan mersedesin icinden birinin bana biz yardim cagirdik dedigini cok iyi hatirliyorum bu yuzden tekrar yardim cagirmanin anlamsiz oldugunu ilk cagrinin fazlasiyla yeterli oldugunu dusundum
6583697 they supposedly fixed the problem which the pilot later said was with the air conditioning and then we took off
6583698 the plane was wobbling from one side to another then i began to suspect we would crash i dont know what happened next i was in a sort of river and saw people smoke explosions which i think woke me up
6583699 i took a child into the truck and he thought he was in a film but he asked when will this film end and where is my dad he asked if it was real if he was in a film but he wanted the film to end
6583700 those responsible say that it will take two days at the most to finish identifying people by their fingerprints dna identification will take a bit more
6583701 we have to closely monitor the records but we see no reason to take such measures he told a news conference
6583702 its been years since engine failure on take off or a fire has prevented a flight from continuing
6583703 pues s cuando no jugamos nos toca ir con mexiquense a los que no jugamos con el primer equipo y pues bien ya tuve la oportunidad de meter un gol el otro d a empatamos al fin de cuentas no es lo que uno m s quisiera pero bueno hay que ir y tomar ritmo
6583704 no todav a no he hablado yo con l tambi n siento que quiere que juegue de punta y bueno el torneo pasado ven a jugando por la banda yo estoy a lo que el entrenador quiera y cuando me necesite
6583705 a lo mejor por la banda pero te digo a donde me toque tratarlo de hacerlo bien
6583706 s obviamente pues s cuando sal busque una opci n para jugar y nada hay que ir poco a poco tambi n la gente que est ah mancilla r os esquivel lo est haciendo bien y esperar la oportunidad estamos trabajando y cuando nos toque hacerlo bien
6583707 s claro la gente que vino tiene mucho que dar ya es cosa del entrenador decidir quien juega yo me tengo que poner listo para cuando me toque
6583708 bien poco a poco ah vamos hemos perdido partidos importantes pero bueno hay que agarrarle poco a poco a lo que quiere jos manuel de la torre y pues nada esperar a que el equipo vaya mejorando yo creo que hay buen grupo y este equipo es ganador as que esperemos estar donde debe de estar este equipo
6583709 we were still right not to cover the story because it came from the
6583710 the story of edwards tryst was reported only by the national enquirer a tabloid that gives supermarkets a bad name
6583711 the national enquirer is a supermarket tabloid that is accurate some of the time and inaccurate some of the time
6583712 contributed to the lack of interest by the times others simply relied on standard elvis ufo aliens bigfoot jokes to dismiss the
6583713 the fact that big newspapers magazines and networks have standards that is they refuse to print every stray rumor just because its
6583714 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
6583715 nobody should avoid taking a statin because of concerns about cancer
6583716 reduced free and total glycerin levels a reduced acid number and reduced free water and sediment
6583717 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6583718 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6583719 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6583720 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6583721 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them

6583726 pirateballerina has assembled an amazing compendium of information on the man sort of an
6583727 pirateballerina com has been a virtual one stop shop for all things churchill
6583728 pirate ballerina seems positively javert like in his her monomaniacal pursuit of mr churchill
6583729 if youve ever wondered whether or not your own blogging habits are a waste of time dont your time wastage cant hold a candle to the pirate ballerina blog
6583730 pirate ballerina aside from being an exceptionally cool blog title is a treasure trove of all things ward churchillian
6583731 theres really no point in anyone blogging about it when pirate ballerina is already doing it to perfection
6583732 the trick with wireless power is not can you do it its can you do it safely and efficiently
6583733 it turns out the human body is not affected by magnetic fields it is affected by elective fields so what we are doing is transmitting energy using the magnetic field not the electric field
6583734 initially it eliminates chargers and eventually it eliminates batteries all together
6583735 that is potentially a world changing event this is the closest weve had to something being commercially available in this class
6583736 the president today declared an emergency exists in the state of florida and ordered federal aid to supplement state and local response efforts due to the emergency conditions resulting from tropical storm fay
6583737 this storm is turning into a serious catastrophic flooding event particularly in southern brevard county
6583738 fay is moving toward the west near five miles per hour seven kilometers per hour this general slow motion should continue for the next couple of days
6583739 after transplantation the patients facial appearance was greatly improved the patient was able to eat drink and talk normally
6583740 i didnt have any idea what was going to be a good score out here its definitely not that easy its perfect conditions youve got great weather the course is in perfect shape right now playing in the morning helped a lot the greens were a little bit more receptive
6583741 the greens are good i mean theyre perfect perfect speed
6583742 i think you can be aggressive i was committed to my lines and made aggressive strokes
6583743 hunter had such a great round and there were some 4 or 5 under par rounds so my 1 under par round is not as good as i thought it would be but i thought i played well and ill take it
6583744 there are tournaments where ill shoot 6 or 7 under and thats as good as i can play and the winner is 21 under and im thinking how did they do that
6583745 i know its difficult out there and the rough is tough but that was just bad play
6583746 when he gets hot he does do some crazy stuff
6583747 if you drive the ball well you have some birdie chances and if you dont you struggle to break par
6583748 i cant recommend this book more highly to anyone out there with a brain a sense of humor and a taste for classic comic absurdity
6583749 hes the last of the dragons which have been hunted to extinction by a secret society of wizards called the magi
6583750 i know its not true i looked at his call log
6583751 a movie about ordinary jewish people in extraordinarily savage times
6583752 if the numbers are accurate and represent the change in learning thats a tremendous gain
6583753 it was in this very spot three years ago he was close bit more than 3 that you told me you loved me i want you to keep telling me you love me for the rest of our lives i want to spend forever with you will you marry me
6583754 oh so i guess you called and cancelled the workshop
6583755 oh i am so sorry but i am not coming
6583756 obviously youve seen teams lose a closer and next thing you know it becomes a little bit of a circus
6583757 weve pieced it together with some pretty good arms and some guys who know how to pitch a little bit weve mixed and matched pretty well this year to give ourselves a good chance to hold leads or to keep us in games
6583758 and now that were going to have matt capps in a couple of days its going to be a good boost for us
6583759 every game i saw everybody stepped up and did a nice job if theres a period where i have to earn it back i understand that
6583760 if i know matt capps hes going to want to jump right back into the fire
6583761 if i know him and we have the lead in the ninth im going to look up and hes already going to be warming up
6583762 thats one of the reasons with the rehab program that we make sure that hes ready if he had come back earlier and hadnt gotten all that it would have been tough to put him back in there in the ninth well see how hes feeling but i dont see why we wouldnt
6583763 everybody has been doing good down there in the bullpen
6583764 i think youve got to compliment general manager neal huntington a lot for bringing a lot of these guys in
6583765 neal and i throughout spring training kept saying that we had a lot of good candidates for our bullpen it worked out
6583766 ich kann im training nur gas geben den rest entscheidet der trainer
6583767 without the facial bone framework reconstruction of the nose and upper lip would not be possible
6583768 its more a malformation than a tumour so there was no clear cut division between healthy and abnormal tissue
6583769 we removed all the lower part of the face including muscle and nerves and replaced it all with the transplant
6583770 now he can close his mouth completely speak and eat
6583771 but he still has some problems smiling because the way we set the muscles wasnt perfect
6583772 i think it might be possible but we have to find a patient and theres a technical problem transplanting eyelids
6583773 were still working on the possibility of transferring the whole face
6583774 she can speak drink without spilling liquid and eat normally
6583775 gave me back an identity because without a face i am nothing
6583776 but as we can see theres still incidence of acute rejection so we need to work on immunosuppressive procedures that are less harmful
6583777 daripada berinvestasi uang di bank lebih baik investasi di usaha sapi perah asal tahu tentang perawatan dan cara menangani sapi perah dijamin lebih menggiurkan dari simpan uang di bank
6583778 mungkin bisa sepuluh juta lebih kalau mau pelihara sendiri dengan pemasukan dari susu perahnya
6583779 sapi baru bisa diperas setelah beranak satu kali atau berumur satu tahun lah minimal sedangkan bila sapi sudah tujuh kali melahirkan maka bisa dipastikan produksi susunya akan turun paling sehari cuma lima liter

6583781 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6583782 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6583783 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6583784 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6583785 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6583786 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6583787 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6583788 this is a planning took where all things are going
6583789 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6583790 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6583791 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6583792 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6583793 wow hybrid a honkin big truck that gets 40 mpg
6583794 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6583795 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6583796 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6583797 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6583798 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6583799 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6583800 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6583801 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6583802 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6583803 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6583804 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6583805 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6583806 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6583807 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6583808 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6583809 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6583810 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6583811 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6583812 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6583813 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6583814 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6583815 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6583816 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6583817 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6583818 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6583819 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6583820 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6583821 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6583822 mccain cant keep track and referred inquiring reporters to his staff
6583823 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6583824 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6583825 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6583826 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
6583827 this is about shifting the power back to the people
6583828 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6583829 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6583830 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6583831 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6583832 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6583833 economic problems that will make this years financial turbulence look like a trip to the debt counselors office
6583834 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6583835 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6583836 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6583837 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6583838 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6583839 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6583840 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6583841 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6583842 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6583843 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6583844 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6583845 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6583846 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6583847 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6583848 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6583849 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6583850 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6583851 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6583852 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6583853 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6583854 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6583855 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6583856 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6583857 puttin on airs again gonna paint yoself as some sort pointy head
6583858 when i was a kid broccoli hadnt even been invented
6583859 no wonder freddie experienced the sort of abysmal soul sadness which afflicts one of tolstois russian peasants when after putting in a heave days work strangling his father beating his wife and dropping the baby into the city reservoir he turns to the cupboard only to find the vodka bottle empty
6583860 if he had been a character in a russian novel he would have gone and hanged himself in the barn as it was he merely sat staring before him and keeping perfectly rigid
6583861 is going to be a great man already he has achieved much the critics say that he is more russian than any other young english writer
6583862 i should have thought the wheeze would be to be more english than any other young english writer
6583863 nonsense who wants an english writer to be english youve got to be russian or spanish or something to be a real success the mantle of the great russians has descended on mr devine
6583864 from what ive heard of russians i should hate to have that happen to me
6583865 then there was another interview where somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have he said im not sure ill have to check with my staff true quote im not sure ill have to check with my staff so they asked his staff and he said at least four at least four
6583866 combined hrt improves sleep aches and pains and sexual functioning
6583867 these gains can now be factored in to a womans choice to use combined hrt this benefit must be weighed against the overall short and long term risks which must be individualized for women based on years since menopause medical history and chosen regimen
6583868 i dont think it is really right that he walks away with nothing
6583869 what if it was a child or his mother or brother or sister
6583870 if somebody is beating on my door i would think they are in trouble
6583871 youre just not up at six in the morning with a pistol in your lap
6583872 he was all the way around a really nice guy real genuine
6583873 why is it so hard for you to trust me
6583874 why is it so hard for you to keep your promises
6583875 what do you expect there are only 3 white people here
6583876 semua orang malah pada nyukurin dia dirampok sebab dia pelit sama orang sini kena hukum karma tuh
6583877 kami harus periksa lagi apa jenisnya jangan jangan cuma senjata mainan
6583878 lokasi itu sudah selesai disurvei pertamina tetapi kami belum mengeluarkan izin eksplorasi
6583879 an alternately amusing and alarming primer on americas off the charts fiscal irresponsibility
6583880 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6583881 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6583882 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6583883 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6583884 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6583885 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6583886 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6583887 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6583888 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6583889 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6583890 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6583891 the cold war by other means and sometimes by the same means
6583892 i looked the man in the eye i was able to get a sense of his soul
6583893 i think it is obvious that nato expansion does not have any relation with the modernization of the alliance itself or with ensuring security in europe
6583894 on the contrary it represents a serious provocation against whom is this expansion intended
6583895 people got used to hearing something cool on a commercial and being like what band is this
6583896 if theyre out there really doing it if theyre playing at the echo then theyre not just being informed by how do i make this for a commercial theyre informed by their whole experience therefore you deliver something authentic
6583897 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6583898 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6583899 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6583900 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6583901 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state mccain plays right in there
6583902 a metal that is dug out of the ground at great cost to be reinterred in bank vaults as a protection against the same stupidity as caused it to be dug up in the first place
6583903 you may have to take it out if you have a bazooka in your pocket and people know you have a bazooka you may never have to take it out
6583904 hey if we really need to well buy 25 billion in preferred convertible
6583905 im honored to do anything to help him win but the state and the budget are most important
6583906 because it shows the mccain campaign knows this is not about the base of the party but reaching the middle where the votes are
6583907 we think that right now iowa is a very strong pickup for us and thats important
6583908 reagan democrats in some races but they are still democrats
6583909 it is a seed of the goosefoot plant the seeds are small flat and oval resembling a mix of sesame seed and millet when cooked the seed transforms into an interesting shape the outer germ twists outward to form a small white tail that is attached to the kernel this gives the cooked grain a circular shape
6583910 it was considered sacred by the incas who called it the mother grain
6583911 its flavor is distinctive rather than bland and will dominate anything it is used in
6583912 quinoa also contains a high concentration of the amino acids cystine and methionine which are usually low in beans thus quinoa pairs nutritionally well with beans
6583913 quinoa is considered a complete protein because it contains all eight essential amino acids most grains are lacking in at least one amino acid thus categorizing them as incomplete proteins
6583914 it is also being tested in research laboratories as a possible way to curb hunger and alleviate protein malnutrition in underdeveloped countries researchers at brigham young university have developed a quinoa cookie that has shown promising flavor appeal when fed to bolivian children
6583915 not only is quinoa delicious eaten as a hot grain it can be a tasty addition to cold vegetable salads or bean grain salads quinoa can also be ground into a nutritious flour
6583916 barack obama knows a lot about housing problems the narrator of the stark new mccain ad states
6583917 one of his biggest fundraisers helped him buy his 1 million mansion purchasing part of the property he couldnt afford from obama rezko got political favors now hes a convicted felon facing jail thats a housing problem
6583918 not ready to lead mccains campaign ads have called him
6583919 this isnt the tony rezko i knew but now he has been convicted by a jury on multiple charges that once again shine a spotlight on the need for reform
6583920 for the first time in my adult lifetime i am really proud of my country and not just because barack has done well but because i think people are hungry for change
6583921 the harvard 100 most influential alumni she has had an amazingly blessed life but you wouldnt know it from her campaign rhetoric and her griping about her and her husbands student loans
6583922 im delighted we have secured 1968 unseen its a fascinating insight into one of the pivotal years of the 20th century and still resonates today it is a welcome addition to our rich autumn line up
6583923 he has been located this morning alive but in a very poor condition at the basin
6583924 theyll give it an overdose of anaesthetic by an injection
6583925 theyll do it as they can the ideal thing is for the whale to come close to shore but they might do it out on the water if they need to
6583926 the last thing we want is that the whale should suffer
6583927 the vets are saying he hasnt got long to go you should take action
6583928 the animal is suffering shark inflicted injuries is experiencing breathing difficulties and its flukes are hanging down
6583929 some people are very upset and some were very aggressive its a bit harrowing personally
6583930 theyve been calling me the worst names you can imagine including effing murderer which is a bit hard to take ive spent my life working with animals
6583931 but its understandable because theres a lot of community concern it says something about our attitude to the environment
6583932 while its got life its got hope he heard me singing and came over i looked at him and he was full of life he had a few scratches and cuts on him and i was a bit worried about his eyes
6583933 all he needed is a mothers milk there was hope another whale could pick him up and adopt him he could have at least learnt to swim with them and eat krill and plankton
6583934 well do an autposy on the what to work out what was wrong with it that may have led to its mother abandoning it
6583935 tighter regulation of the financial markets is almost certainly in the cards but reregulation could have unintended consequences bolstering the power of well organized interest groups reducing access to capital and undermining americas competitive position
6583936 only the tail was recognizable there was wreckage scattered all over the place and dead bodies across a wide area a lot of them were children
6583937 i saw how the plane broke in two and a huge explosion
6583938 i think what comcast and time warner cable are doing is a great first step
6583939 it gets isps out of the business of deciding which applications are important and which arent but there are enhancements to the peer to peer protocol in particular that can make it easier on all isps
6583940 this is a step in the right direction because isps are indeed making their networks more neutral without new legislation requiring them to do so
6583941 but make no mistake bandwidth caps and metered plans are bad for the internet and could stunt the adoption and growth of all broadband services
6583942 if it does then something has gone wrong with competition customers clearly dont want metered plans and bandwidth caps there might be some isps that experiment with these but i dont see it happening
6583943 no me sorprende que lo hayan hecho ya hemos visto a los espa oles antes ser muy agresivos en ese sentido
6583944 les hemos dado una paliza en el agua y ahora hacen todo lo que pueden para encontrar una formalidad que les permita ganar una medalla o subir un puesto
6583945 era f sicamente imposible recurrir a la t ctica los espa oles disparan con p lvora mojada hacen una monta a de una estupidez esto no tiene nada que ver con lo estrictamente deportivo pero ahora estoy mucho m s seguro que hace dos d as de que el oro es nuestro lo contrario me sorprender a
6583946 a well respected and award winning scientist ivins co wrote a slew of anthrax studies including a recent work on the treatment for inhalation anthrax published in the july 7 issue of the antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy journal
6583947 yet ivins had attempted to poison people as far back as 2000 and his therapist said she was
6583948 2 so much of the public reporting about ivins has been devoted to depicting him as a highly unstable psychotic who had been issuing extremely violent threats and who had a violent past
6583949 duley herself has a history that at the very least raises questions about her credibility

6583951 i postulated that the real culprit of the 9 11 and anthrax attacks who engineered it all was thomas e enron white the former co chair of enron who subsequently became army secretary his dominate motive was cover his and others ass and assets was there a massive cover up white who was co chair again of enron was never indicated recently we are led to believe that bruce ivins was behind the anthrax attacks who worked out of the armys fort detrick biological center i wondered if there besides that was any direct connection between dr ivins and tom white
6583952 my veteran able danger colleagues and i share the common fear that the seeds of the next 9 11 attack have already been sewn and that much of the critical data that was harvested for the able danger project that could be used again now in the search for sleeper cells and others that matched the

6583961 the main purpose of these exercises is to increase the cooperation and partnership between u s and georgian forces
6583962 the georgian move against south ossetia was motivated by political considerations having to do with israel and iran according to nfc georgian president mikheil saakashvili decided to assert control over the breakaway region in order to force israel to reconsider its decision to cut back its support for georgias military

6583969 get out the vote is going to be critical for both candidates
6583970 every single one of those quotations came from the campaign of 1960 when the republicans attacked john fitzgerald kennedy
6583971 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
6583972 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief

6584002 roma called us yesterday and asked about the player menez could go to roma but first i must talk to the president of monaco and also to giallorossi club only then can we decide
6584003 i think that in the next three to four days there could be an important approach and this is also facilitated by the fact that the player would like to go to roma
6584004 i know roma watched me against nantes they have already approached my agent and i am just waiting to see how the situation develops roma are one of the best sides in europe it gives me a great deal of pleasure that they are interested

6584006 acorn is concerned about stopping foreclosures obtaining affordable healthcare and gaining living wages
6584007 these defendants undermined the basic precept that consumers are safe to assume that when they purchase retail health and safety products they are buying what the label says they are buying a parent should never have to fear that buying an everyday item like toothpaste could put a family at risk
6584008 this case demonstrates the departments continued commitment to prosecute aggressively criminals who seek to profit by importing and distributing counterfeit goods that put our citizens health and safety in jeopardy
6584009 the defendants lined their own pockets by trafficking in counterfeit goods without concern for the dangers those goods posed to the health and safety of consumers
6584010 these convictions demonstrate our continuing commitment to protect public safety and manufacturers property rights
6584011 something as routine as brushing your teeth should not be dangerous consumers should not have to worry that criminals have tampered with the products they use or ingest
6584012 the risks that substandard tainted and counterfeit products pose to the health and safety of consumers are real and a threat we take very seriously ice and its federal partners are working together to comprehensively investigate these crimes and to ensure american consumers can have confidence in the products they purchase
6584013 those who deal in counterfeit health products are solely motivated by greed they prey upon an unsuspecting public with no regard for potentially placing the publics health at risk we will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to pursue these counterfeiters to the fullest extent of the law
6584014 our results show that hot flushes night sweats sleeplessness and joint pains were less common in women on hrt in this age group
6584015 the increased risk of serious diseases including breast cancer coronary heart disease and blood clots with the use of combined oestrogen and progesterone therapy is now well established
6584016 while this study shows some short term benefits of combined hormone therapy use on symptoms such as hot flushes night sweats and joint pain it did not show overall improvements in overall quality of life or depression
6584017 i recommend that women consult their doctors to talk about the risk and benefits of taking hormone therapy before commencing treatment
6584018 it is clear that even as farm income remains strong rapid increases in input costs are slowing the growth in farm equipment sales
6584019 it seems that other than necessary living expenses delaying the purchase of equipment sale of grain or the purchase of other items is the choice of the day
6584020 the general consensus is that we should have the best overall crop production in 30 years we received rain when it was needed
6584021 however we may see improvement in this index in the months ahead

6584024 typically infertility is either 30 percent a tubal problem or 30 percent an ovarian problem or 30 percent a sperm problem the other 10 percent we just cant figure out
6584025 is that if there are 100 infertile people about 89 of them are taken care of by the local doctor population and 11 make it to us we are able to get seven or eight of those pregnant
6584026 78 percent of president bushs more than 150 signing statements have raised constitutional or legal objections
6584027 signing statements may if used appropriately serve a legitimate function as a tool for continuing dialog between the president congress and the public on the other hand signing statements may be a mechanism to expand executive authority at the expense of the legislature
6584028 you know what happens after the president is called out on his lawbreaking right the white house should expect congress strongly worded letter any day now
6584029 contrary to the rule of law and our constitutional separation of powers
6584030 when im stressing i seem to react more to the sneezing to the runny nose
6584031 if i gave you an allergy test on your skin the reaction pattern would be twice that if you were under a stressful condition than a person who was not
6584032 my nasal passages they swell so i just stay in the house
6584033 patients who suffer from severe allergies need their own space and time
6584034 and one has to realize that the interaction with families is important and they should be supportive
6584035 i want to stress that this storm is becoming a serious catastrophic flooding event
6584036 that perhaps will be the only good thing that can come of this
6584037 theres not a lot of regulation around fin fish its basically been ignored
6584038 now that we have the tool to do it we probably have an obligation to start testing
6584039 my guess is its happening somewhere in the processing and distribution supply chain
6584040 trying to pass one fish off as another is often called species substitution but i have another name for it fraud
6584041 what we need to do is to get it out of university research labs and into the hands of border inspectors and end consumers
6584042 fish should have no odour it should never be wrapped in saran wrap
6584043 all those things are a good indication that theyre paying attention to detail

6584056 in all topics mr obama displays a similar worried serious looking facial pattern even when talking about more positive subjects his facial expressions do not signal positive affective states
6584057 there is an element of the fact that he is on the edges of his comfort zone here
6584058 going into a presidential campaign is not something he has done before and you could say it is written all over his face
6584059 the dominating attitude as transmitted by his vocal style is that of concern and sincere involvement
6584060 his smile is often not fully developed ie his cheek raising muscles do not participate enough in the expression of positive affect to be perceived as genuine
6584061 my six year old nephew was saved but we dont know what happened to his sister
6584062 roberto is in hospital they say he is injured but not seriously he has been sedated and is unconscious he is alive at least we dont know anything of his sister

6584068 since labour introduced its botched untested new contract well over one million people more than the entire population of birmingham have lost access to an nhs dentist
6584069 one in five appeals are successful this clearly shows that appeals provide a vital safety net
6584070 we must ensure that the process is of the highest quality and that it is subject to effective judicial scrutiny
6584071 if the low numbers of asylum seekers to the uk were the result of the world becoming a safer more peaceful place then we would have something to celebrate
6584072 as it is we have real concerns that people who need our help and protection are not able to get here to access it we need to ensure that our borders remain open to refugees who are in fear for their lives
6584073 the days of assuming that older people are dependants must come to an end
6584074 the government must face up to the reality of an ageing population and make a firm commitment to improve health services like mental health and foot care which enable people to stay healthy and independent for longer

6584084 we really need the same level of functionality in network infrastructure to make it departments jobs more feasible and ultimately this has to come from the vendors
6584085 china for example is one of the biggest users of ipv6
6584086 so at some point your web site will only be accessible by developed countries still using ipv4 and you wont be able to sell your goods inwardly into developing countries
6584087 we are utterly resolute in our determination to support this new democracy of afghanistan
6584088 we wont relax our efforts to support and reconstruct afghanistan because we understand that what happens in afghanistan affects the rest of the world we are determined to work with the government and coalition forces to defeat the forces of terrorism
6584089 we have succeeded in winning back territory the longer term solution is that more power will be given to the afghanistan people
6584090 you are the heroes of our country you are the frontline against the taliban what you are doing here prevents terrorism coming to the streets of britain
6584091 this week we are celebrating the olympics where we have had great success people have been winning medals in areas where we have been breaking ground but this week also i believe that our olympic athletes and everybody else in our country will remember that you have showed exactly the same courage professionalism and dedication you make our country proud every day of the week every week of the year
6584092 it shows we do have support for what we are doing it gives us a sense of pride
6584093 plotting in the cabinet is not new it happens in afghanistan too
6584094 you can only attribute human error when the right emergency procedures have not been followed which is not what happened here
6584095 this was not a serious problem with this you can fly
6584096 the passengers probably heard a noise just like a can rattling with something inside

6584098 you know that it has a direct connection of some sort with the automatic weapon pointing at your back
6584099 what kind of freedom do we have now the freedom to be raped by indian soldiers
6584100 the conduct of the security service facilitated interviews by or on behalf of the united states when mohamed was being detained by the united states incommunicado and without access to a lawyer
6584101 all security service staff have an awareness of the human rights act 1998 and are fully committed to complying with the requirements of the law when working in the uk and overseas
6584102 do not participate in solicit encourage or condone the use of torture or inhumane or degrading treatment
6584103 to the extent of making it clear to mohamed that the united kingdom government would not help him unless he cooperated fully with the united states authorities
6584104 the relationship of the united kingdom government to the united states authorities in connection with mohamed was far beyond that of a bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing
6584105 as he will not be able to try to establish the only answer he has to the confessions namely that they were involuntary and abstracted from him by wrongful treatment
6584106 however unfortunately when faced with the choice between the rule of law and upsetting its allies the americans it waivers in this commitment
6584107 for strong reasons of national security to which the court accepted we were entitled to give the highest weight we could not agree to disclose this information voluntarily
6584108 the british government may have been accused of being bushs poodle but the british courts remain bulldogs when it comes to human rights
6584109 talking to people who could provide life saving intelligence is mi5s bread and butter
6584110 there were bodies lying everywhere and wounded people soaked in blood were screaming for help
6584111 only innocent people die when the pakistan army carries out air strikes in bajaur or swat
6584112 if the army is really fond of fighting it should send ground forces to see how we fight
6584113 this is just barbaric we have to devise a policy which is national which protects and serves our own interests
6584114 we have been dazzled we have been impressed we have been blown away by these beijing games but we have not been intimidated i am convinced we can do just as well in 2012
6584115 the success of these games is making them more popular in britain i think the successes of team gb are blowing away olympo scepticism
6584116 i can tell you that the city london is in a ferment of excitement about this people who have never shown the slightest interest in a cycle race are hurling themselves at tv screens and yelling themselves hoarse with excitement
6584117 had it been us i dont think we would necessarily have done the switcheroo with the girl with the braces
6584118 i dont think you will necessarily achieve what you want in this context by showboating and grandstanding
6584119 we are looking for ideas of how londons olympic park can become not just a great place to live work and visit but a place that retains a flavour of the extraordinary a place with the wow factor a place of magic
6584120 as athletes its awfully tough to handle disappointment but thats athletics
6584121 as i told the girls tonight there are going to be other things in life that are more tragic than tonight
6584122 i think these young ladies are very well prepared for what life has for them in the future and im very proud of them
6584123 its the people on the outside that really dont understand the game and really thought we were so dominant
6584124 weve played great softball but if youre in the dugout and on this team you know that any team can get hot on any given night we have a lot of respect for japan they matched us pitch for pitch and got the key hit when they needed to
6584125 i really kind of feel that maybe people would get off our back and realize there is some parity in this game because ive always thought the rest of the world was getting better its nice to see a full room of reporters here because weve had an empty room most of the time who knows what will happen i do know ive been around the game long enough to respect everyone we play sometimes the game looks easy and it really isnt
6584126 major new international softball event to take place next year

6584128 he went in ranked 16th and he finished 20th he needed to finish 12th so it wasnt a foregone conclusion by any means but i can understand hes quite disappointed everyone was throwing well below their personal best mainly because of the terrible weather
6584129 his training in hamilton has been disrupted in winter because of all the wet weather he has struggled for training facilities
6584130 when the conditions are a bit wet youre always a bit tentative about the run up but i felt good and strong i had all the confidence i could qualify but i just didnt produce the big throw
6584131 as a meeting point to many great and original minds pioneers of thought in artistic literary theatrical scientific legal and political circles providing an amicable environment for their recreational and creative pastime as well as a testing ground for the novel and controversial theories and approaches to the issues equally important to the british society and the entire mankind
6584132 british eccentricity is a reluctance to be bound by social spiritual scientific political esthetical or any other limitations and an everlasting desire to explore every manifestation of life around us for the benefit of gaining personal experience and translating it through various mediums such as art business science social events to the others to the society and in particular other individuals which are seeking new knowledge and experience and are ready to perceive it

6584134 i think theres a 10 million shortfall somewhere in their negotiations and theyre looking for a way to do that
6584135 the breadth and quality of open source software continues to amaze us
6584136 weve singled out 60 products for bossies developer tools middleware firewalls and routers productivity apps crm and erp etc and were only scratching the surface when you look at all thats available and how good it
6584137 when six year olds or people who think cats are replacements for people name their pets

6584139 theological premises are shared across the culture war divide by christians who oppose gay marriage and abortion and voted eagerly for george w bush as well as by liberal protestants who consider the contemporary gop an abomination

6584142 i would move forward on legislation to end sanctuary city policies if abbott says such a move would be legal
6584143 primarily because we believe this is a federal issue that needs a federal solution

6584154 uit constante gesprekken tussen fortis en specialisten van de europese commissie was al duidelijk dat de kans op uitstel erg klein was dus hebben we geen formeel verzoek tot uitstel ingediend en zijn we doorgegaan met wat volgens ons de beste oplossing was
6584155 het smeken voor uitstel was slechts beeldspraak om aan te geven dat we hard gezocht hebben naar een andere oplossing
6584156 i would do any trick i could think of to try to save money

6584177 just because we have had high immigration over the last 10 years doesnt mean that the next 10 years will be the same
6584178 as eastern europeans arrive asylum numbers fall and there is reduced demand for migrant workers we would expect the nature of migration flows to change
6584179 a lot of people come from the north chichester is a city of human scale you can walk about and its not so huge that youre just a face in the crowd plus there arent any nightclubs
6584180 of course they bring benefits but the cost of housing has gone up with so many people coming here who have made money from selling their properties

6584189 that does not mean that we will never look to turn teams playing the ball in behind defences is a good way of stretching the game and allowing the team more space in which to pass the ball and when you have players with the pace of anthony thomas and mitchell cole you have to use the weapon of the space in behind

6584193 the uk has one of the toughest borders in the world and we are determined to ensure it stays that way
6584194 our hi tech electronic borders system will allow us to count all foreign nationals in and out of the uk while checking them against watch lists
6584195 people are being allowed through on the basis of this technology it means that 95 per cent of people wont be checked in any way other than by the machine
6584196 instead of pressing ahead with new unproven technology to replace current immigration staff the government should answer our calls to establish a dedicated uk border police which is vital to securing our borders
6584197 there has been a slight change of pl andy o hope jerrys artarama is still in the mix dont see it on lee went to high school with joe this kid was rockin the guitar dbearhug this is just too sad that was a great little shop and stoc
6584198 i am extremely happy that it is all over it has been a massive and unnecessary ordeal fortunately i was able to fight the case all the way but a lot of traders in the same situation are unable to do the same two and a half years is a long time and i have had to put my life on hold

6584204 conduct of the security service facilitated interviews by or on behalf of the us when binyam mohamed was being detained by the us incommunicado
6584205 compelling the british government to release information that can prove mr mohameds innocence is one obvious step towards making up for the years of torture that he has suffered the next step is for the british government to demand an end to the charade against him in guantanamo bay and return him home to britain
6584206 reflects the abhorrence of decent society at the methods employed by the us government in the supposed war on terror we can only hope the foreign secretary will reflect on this judgment and provide direct assistance to binyams defence team
6584207 every year we experience importation of measles from other countries and from those going abroad but this year is different once measles is imported here were seeing it spread to many more people
6584208 many cases are in children who are eligible for vaccination but who have not been immunized because of parents decisions
6584209 we need very high levels of population immunity approximately 95 percent
6584210 we have been lucky to have low levels of measles and other vaccine preventable diseases but children can still get measles and can still spread measles including to those too young to be immunized and those who cant be vaccinated because of medical reasons
6584211 its important in this country to maintain high levels of vaccination that have been so successful in limiting measles to relatively low numbers over the last decade we would like to remind parents as their children go back to school whether or not they attend in schools or are home schooled or attend day care this is a good time to be considering their vaccination status for measles to protect them from acquiring this disease
6584212 without going into the gory details of our family finances we are mortgaged up to the gills like a lot of other people i had a two year fixed rate deal which ran out and it has been very painful to move on to a different one like millions of other people
6584213 gravitating away from ocado towards sainsburys just on price i have to say the difference is pretty big
6584214 im much luckier than other people my wife and i are not really struggling to put food on the family supper table my wife works shes a full time lawyer and i work so we have two incomes
6584215 we are very lucky but we need every penny of those two incomes if we do i cant imagine what it is like for the many millions of british families who arent as lucky as we are

6584217 the problem with those people at channel 4 is that they wanted me to run some sort of contest for candidates with no proper breeding
6584218 i wanted someone qualified to run the place my idea was not to find a group of turkeys and dimwits like a mini big brother so they could all argue cry and not get on
6584219 anyway the tv people are all raging communists thinking i should give away my estate house clothes bedsheets everything
6584220 im very aware of the effect that todays announcement will have on our customers and i recognise that this is a very tough time for everyone
6584221 companies raising prices at the same time and by very similar amounts is what prompted the regulator ofgem to launch its probe into the energy industry the impact on every consumer is going to be harsh but british gas e on and scottish amp southern have not raised their online tariffs
6584222 soaring energy bills pose a huge threat to our standard of living gas and electricity are essential commodities which have now become a luxury many can no longer afford
6584223 the only way to fully protect people from ever rising global fuel prices is to ensure every home in the uk is super insulated and has access to green energy systems
6584224 fuel bills and carbon emissions in uk homes could be slashed by two thirds as a result
6584225 this clearly illustrates why its so important to have binding agreements between countries which will prevent sex offenders hopping from one place to another and possibly going underground where they will pose a serious threat to children
6584226 offenders like glitter can and should be chaperoned while being deported back to the uk where they can be properly monitored it is disappointing this latest development was not anticipated and proper arrangements put in place to make this work
6584227 this case is important because it highlights how easy it is for uk offenders to move around freely when they are overseas even those who pose a high risk to children
6584228 we dont take that kind of money on a novelty bet like this

6584271 it is very sad news and we formula one should do anything we can to help
6584272 i have tested formula one and raced gp2 at the ricardo torme circuit outside the city so valencia isnt unfamiliar to me
6584273 anyway going to a new circuit doesnt really change my preparations everybody is in the same situation so i dont treat things very differently
6584274 i enjoy visiting new race tracks and im looking forward to getting into the cockpit it looks like being an amazing track

6584277 i have dreamed of standing on the start line of the olympic final for the past 10 years
6584278 i am really pleased i knew i had to stay relaxed and calm i also knew i would have to run quick to qualify but i was determined to enjoy it as well
6584279 you could see it was going to be a big championship it was one of the greatest finals ever and i feel very proud to have been part of it
6584280 im disappointed i came here thinking there was a medal shot i went quite hard on the back straight and paid for it in the home straight a lot of the guys were knackered i was one of them
6584281 its not rocket science the set up of the team was wrong if you are asking why then it has to be the coach doesnt it
6584282 it got to pickering he should not have been on that leg

6584299 as customers try new and increasingly complex wireless phone services and products such as playing mp3 files capturing still pictures or video or downloading ring tones they are more likely to call their provider for support
6584300 customer care centers and service representatives are under pressure to handle the increase in inquiries while still trying to understand and resolve the customers issue on the initial contact this can potentially increase the number of transfers and the hold times for customers with an increase in hold times providers run the risk of decreasing customer satisfaction and losing customers to other providers as switching levels are 83 percent higher among customers who are put on hold compared with those who are not
6584301 the fact that verizon wireless performs well in resolving issues with one contact is particularly noteworthy
6584302 overall customer care performance is three times higher among customers whose issues were resolved in one contact over the phone compared with those who had to contact their provider more than once for the same issue
6584303 continentals award winning onepass frequent flyer program has recognized our customers with outstanding benefits for more than two decades and we look forward to continuing this service for many years to come

6584305 the right time for uk companies to leverage off the prominence of our olympic win

6584307 international sporting events are big business with billions of pounds worth of contracts up for grabs every year
6584308 with all the key decision makers in beijing it is essential that british businesses can promote their expertise and capabilities to an international audience
6584309 i am in beijing with british businesses helping them do just that
6584310 at the moment my focus is on doing well in the odis against south africa and im not looking beyond that at this stage
6584311 its something i have been thinking about for a period of time and due to recent injuries in the england camp the opportunity has arisen for me to play a role in this series
6584312 having missed out on selection at various times this year i am well aware of the disappointment that comes from not being a part of the england dressing room with that in mind i want to be a part of the team and if that means bringing myself out of retirement to play a role in this series then im happy to do just that
6584313 concentrating solely on test cricket is the best way forward for me during the next phase of what will hopefully be a long england career
6584314 the last week has been slow and mentally draining and the bad weather has played a role in all of that
6584315 it is not easy to pick yourself up when you have been on tour a long time we have been away a lot this year and the guys are thinking about home hopefully the rain is not englands secret weapon
6584316 its all snuck up on me in the last couple of weeks
6584317 it was very early in the year when i signed for the tigers so it all seemed a distance away then suddenly last week i was playing what could have been my last league game at headingley which really brought it home
6584318 the simple thing would be to stay out there after the world cup
6584319 but hopefully there will be a lot of celebrations going on for our lads when its over i dont want to miss out on those
6584320 there are a lot of similarities with last year when saints got to the cup final and finished top and we ended up beating them in the super league grand final
6584321 the big difference this year is that we know we can do it
6584322 its nothing specific we just havent played well but if you look at the big games weve had against wigan its been a different story
6584323 officially im in the last year of contract ive had preliminary talks and there has been interest from elsewhere but im captain of west ham and very proud of that and i dont see it being any different this season
6584324 im a veteran i have never dropped a stick in my life
6584325 it doesnt matter how big or small your population is if people are motivated and are trying hard to compete you are going to have success
6584326 this time the playing field is even and we want it even more so
6584327 in the past some of them have taken drugs some have not marion jones she dominated for so long she stood in public and said she didnt do them
6584328 the playing field is more level these days the push by the world anti doping agency and other anti doping agencies to eradicate drugs we feel that has helped jamaica
6584329 he had his reasons for leaving me out and said it to my face that he didnt think i was good enough that is his decision i have a chance now to prove to myself and everyone else that he was wrong i dont know why he said it i thought he was very hard for me it is a done deal i have moved on and i cant dwell too much about the past
6584330 it doesnt matter where we pick up points from but obviously it would be nice for me to win against villa
6584331 i would be lying if i didnt think that i had some great years at villa but it just ran out at the end
6584332 i never crossed martin oneill i was fined for saying that i didnt understand why they had got scott carson in now i know it all came as a big surprise and i expressed my surprise the manager took it very personally hes the manager he makes the decisions i will try my best to prove him wrong this is a new chance
6584333 we are moving in the right direction theres no doubt but there is more to do across the board we have a number of sports that do everything they can and they broadly reflect the medal haul from beijing
6584334 if at first you dont succeed youre not chuck norris
6584335 defining a pre viable fetus that survived an abortion as a person he argued would essentially bar abortions
6584336 i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying
6584337 i have said repeatedly that i would have been completely in fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported which was to say that you should provide assistance to any infant that was born even if it was as a consequence of an induced abortion
6584338 had voted against an identical bill in the state senate
6584339 obama is expected to appear in springfield illinois on saturday with his running mate but the official announcement could come anytime between now and then and possibly beyond
6584340 we could see a lot of fields were ploughed but nothing was grow ing as they had been forced to eat the seed
6584341 we also went to a market and spoke to grain traders who said the price of grain had gone up three fold since january and people in the community could not afford to buy anything from the market
6584342 the increase in the price of oil has affected the price of everything such as food fertiliser and trans port and the rising interest in biofuels in america
6584343 hunger is a hugely political issue and much of the blame can be placed at the door of leaders in the rich world
6584344 encouraging farmers to pro duce biofuels has led to food being used for fuel instead of going on to peoples plates
6584345 we hebben liever geen extra politieke lading aan de uitvaart we kiezen voor rust en ingetogenheid
6584346 temeer omdat we in de afgelopen jaren in toenemende mate zien dat journalisten expliciet doelwit zijn in conflictgebieden het zou goed zijn de details te kennen en een reconstructie van de toedracht boven tafel te krijgen

6584349 but it gets a lot of play on fox news
6584350 will run negative ad after negative ad attack after attack with the goal of making you lose focus on the issues and focus on me and try to make me out to be a risky scary guy
6584351 guys are afraid to approach you because they think theyre not good enough for you
6584352 its a shame we have to break our streak tonight
6584353 trust me if i had a choice of going to this funeral or holding you in my arms no doubt id choose you hands down
6584354 i will keep you company when i get back if you want me to im prolly gonna need my jennie fix by then
6584355 were not going to walk away from them and as i said prime minister maliki committed to taking care of them
6584356 i do think it is somewhat understandable that the government struggles to hire former insurgents for its security forces or for its ministerial positions but this is how you end these kinds of conflicts thats why they call it reconciliation its not done with ones friends its done with former enemies
6584357 well see what happens now that there is unequivocal direction and commitment from the prime minister
6584358 well have to see if this prime ministerial commitment is translated into the kind of action that weve wanted to see for a number of months
6584359 i keep thinking the fog could be like the worlds biggest smoke machine
6584360 its not like you can just throw up a bunch of stages and smack a couple of sponsors on it

6584362 name an event where if you took the three headliners of the event if you took radiohead tom petty and jack johnson out of the event 90 percent of the people would still be coming
6584363 its going to be hard to get any street level momentum this year until after outside lands happens

6584370 i have ever thought no bereavement was equal to that of a husbands or wifes but i feel it difficult to believe that any can be greater or anyones sorrow greater than mine
6584371 had only one aim in mind to cover up new mans homosexuality and to disavow his love for another man
6584372 presently experiencing significant friction in their marriage and are currently separated we want to affirm that there has been no sexual im morality on the part of either todd or shonnah nor has there ever been
6584373 we have discovered new information revealing that todd bentley has entered into an un healthy relationship on an emo tional level with a female member of his staff
6584374 it is very important at this time that those watching especially christian people keep a proper perspective on this tragic situation
6584375 the most important thing to say is that todds marital difficulties in no way undermine the integrity of the outpouring of the spirit at lakeland nor the salvations and countless healing miracles that have happened there and in many other places since april of this year god uses imperfect vessels
6584376 todd has never hidden his weaknesses both past and present he has given hope to literally thousands of believers all over the world who dont feel per fect but who want to be used by their heavenly father
6584377 there are areas of todds life that have resulted in the breakdown of his marriage that he is willing to address now it is time for all of us to maintain the out pouring and see it increase in our personal lives
6584378 i cannot believe what i am seeing on tv footage russian soldiers are plundering villages and taking truck loads of goods even peoples clothes theyre taking everything and there are reports of rape and people being kidnapped for ransom by south ossetians backed by russian troops
6584379 after the service at the baptist peace cathedral in tbilisi on sunday i met people from south ossetia who have fled here who have no food to eat their elderly family members have not been able to leave the region and some have been abused or killed the picture is absolutely dreadful its like a medieval war with devastating effects

6584388 could not connect to video device dev video0 please check connection
6584389 were not going to walk away from them and as i said prime minister maliki committed to taking care of them
6584390 i do think it is somewhat understandable that the government struggles to hire former insurgents for its security forces or for its ministerial positions but this is how you end these kinds of conflicts thats why they call it reconciliation its not done with ones friends its done with former enemies
6584391 well see what happens now that there is unequivocal direction and commitment from the prime minister
6584392 well have to see if this prime ministerial commitment is translated into the kind of action that weve wanted to see for a number of months
6584393 they tried to reach a compromise solution but it is too early to say they reached an agreement about all issues
6584394 the iraqi government wants as a sovereign country to be the master of the law in iraq
6584395 there needs to be a strict timetable otherwise these forces will stay forever not having a timetable means they will never leave
6584396 the negotiators have made really really good progress they are satisfied with where they are
6584397 but obviously it is going to be the prime ministers call so this is a chance for me to sit there with him
6584398 we are redoubling our efforts to bring this to a final and successful conclusion
6584399 what were trying to do is put together an agreement that protects our people that respects that allows us to lay the kind of foundation that we need to make sure that we complete the work that weve all sacrificed so greatly to see accomplished
6584400 it will be an excellent agreement when we finally have agreement
6584401 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
6584402 i climbed up to look into and get scrap metal i saw the bags lying in there i thought theyd make good tool bags
6584403 i thought maybe someone had broken into a policemans car and stolen it then i thought something had happened to the officer
6584404 we always stress to the public how important it is to stow it dont show it and how important it is not to keep personal items in the car
6584405 prior abuse against her and prior threats to kill thats vague and we know its vague but its vague for a reason
6584406 the defense objects to it it shouldnt be allowed in the trial of this case this case is not going to be about what happened but why things happened
6584407 using some proprietary technology and a sample of saber tooth cat dna i have created an animal that is delicious and will pull the cattle industry out of its rut
6584408 i dont need to risk my neck for a pail of milk
6584409 i was getting tired of the cattle game but this new cow gives me reason to get up in the morning

6584431 the combination of rapidly declining consumer confidence pressure on household incomes fuel price increases and emission regulations has resulted in the second hand car market being hit extremely hard in the first half of the year
6584432 highlighting the large gap between the expectations of vendors and buyers in the current market
6584433 the overall market was down 6 5 per cent or 33 000 units compared to 2007 levels this is the lowest number of second hand cars sold in a 6 month period since 2002
6584434 sales of repossessed vehicles on behalf of finance companies have been strong up 106 per cent year to date and the commercial business has undertaken more insolvency work
6584435 an extensive review of the property requirement for the group has been carried out resulting in some short term savings through amalgamation of branches or subletting properties
6584436 this has enabled the company to keep property costs in line with 2007 which is pleasing given the upward trend in commercial rents staff expenses are higher compared to last year due to the impact of legislative changes affecting holiday pay and the minimum wage
6584437 as indicated at the agm in april the company committed to investing in a repositioning of the turners brand with a large advertising and public relations campaign completed over the may to july period which has resulted in a significant increase in awareness levels

6584451 i dont think that jed clampett is going to be moving to beverly hills because of the riches he found in missouri oil but there is an estimated 1 4 billion to 1 9 billion barrels of oil in western missouri
6584452 but unlike congressman hulshof jay nixon knows we dont need to give billions away to big oil companies when theyre making record profits and missourians are paying record prices at the pump
6584453 of course he skips out on the job when theres important things to vote on in congress but he goes back to washington for a political stunt on behalf of big oil
6584454 because of democratic house speaker nancy pelosis failure to take action on our nations energy crisis
6584455 christians enthusiastically smashing their foreheads against the wall with delight at the way theyre represented

6584468 was an attempt to divert attention away from the gops own problems
6584469 it seems strange ironic maybe that a group that has their own ethical problems such as disgraced former speaker lance cargill who is said to be under an ethics investigation for shaking down lobbyists would point the finger at someone else roger warren should worry about the beam in his own eye before he worries about the splinter in mine
6584470 well you guys did it so we get to do it

6584473 we have a pretty hard hitting message about dino rossi about what hes done in the past what his record is and what we think that translates into in terms of policy on issues that people care about
6584474 we are urging brits to be particularly vigilant when they travel abroad this summer
6584475 when relaxing on holiday people can be less aware of their belongings and more prone to card fraud and mugging scams we are encouraging people to contact their banks before travelling to keep their valuables out of sight once abroad and to be especially careful when they use their credit and debit cards
6584476 as a nation we are all using our cards more frequently abroad so it pays to be aware of any extra costs that may be incurred for using them overseas as well as taking steps to protect them from fraud
6584477 card thieves are hoping to catch us relaxed and off guard when we are overseas so we need to take the same sensible precautions with our cards abroad as we would in the uk

6584480 he has been located this morning alive but in a very poor condition at the basin
6584481 theyll give it an overdose of anaesthetic by an injection
6584482 theyll do it as they can the ideal thing is for the whale to come close to shore but they might do it out on the water if they need to
6584483 the last thing we want is that the whale should suffer
6584484 the vets are saying he hasnt got long to go you should take action
6584485 the animal is suffering shark inflicted injuries is experiencing breathing difficulties and its flukes are hanging down
6584486 some people are very upset and some were very aggressive its a bit harrowing personally
6584487 theyve been calling me the worst names you can imagine including effing murderer which is a bit hard to take ive spent my life working with animals
6584488 but its understandable because theres a lot of community concern it says something about our attitude to the environment
6584489 while its got life its got hope he heard me singing and came over i looked at him and he was full of life he had a few scratches and cuts on him and i was a bit worried about his eyes
6584490 all he needed is a mothers milk there was hope another whale could pick him up and adopt him he could have at least learnt to swim with them and eat krill and plankton
6584491 well do an autposy on the what to work out what was wrong with it that may have led to its mother abandoning it
6584492 she had a light that shone for the world to see within her and a fighting spirit safely stowed behind her disarming smile
6584493 stephanie had so much integrity and a fiery intelligence that enabled her to become a one woman force for progress in our country
6584494 the united states i think has shown great flexibility i think the iraqis have shown great flexibility and this is an excellent will be an excellent agreement when we finally have agreement and i just want to emphasize well have agreement when we have agreement
6584495 so all of those stories and rumors that are in the newspapers about what the agreement says probably ought to be disregarded until you see a final agreement
6584496 they managed to focus their attention on big picture items
6584497 the whole of beijing infrastructure has been upgraded by from these bus routes to underground train links to just how the city looks i think all these are enduring legacies for future
6584498 its a one party communist dictatorship in addition their economy doesnt need any help
6584499 they dont need to show off to the world they dont have to open up to the world economically theyre already there and so the idea that the olympics was going to be some coming out party for china i just never bought accepted that argument
6584500 the legitimacy of the government comes from its being able to deliver certain things whether its delivering economic growth or its delivering the symbol of these olympics that china can do something not only at the world level but above the world level
6584501 what the olympics do is it forces the leadership to make small steps that are very uncharacteristic for the leadership
6584502 and these incremental steps have an aggregate cumulative effect in the end
6584503 the biggest legacy is the legacy of reducing poverty of improving the lives of people of all chinese being able to choose the place they can live in the work space they can occupy
6584504 i think the olympics were a means to furthering that end and to do it bigger and better
6584505 china will not be the same place after the olympics
6584506 it is impossible to understate what its going to mean to the chinese people to win the gold medal count especially given 150 years of feelings of humiliation and even inferiority
6584507 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6584508 the young people might be a bit energetic now but theyre young and theyll learn how to act more appropriately when they grow up
6584509 i do not compare myself to other people i am just trying to be myself
6584510 the devil is here boy the devil himself the demon couldnt do what the devil sent him to do so the devil came himself

6584529 juventus win the trofeo birra moretti by winning two penalty shoot outs
6584530 i share charlies views we are receiving comments from people saying that if the recommendations go through at the meeting then they may not turn up for work on thursday
6584531 i wouldnt be surprised if staff showed their strength of feeling by walking out the trade unions are not condoning that but are not in a position to control it
6584532 staff are absolutely incensed by the proposals contained within this management report which is a complete turnaround from the decision taken on may 14
6584533 back pay is a massive issue as people have had the expectation for a long time that they would receive this payment they are entitled to
6584534 the money ranges from 1000 to around 8000 and people have essentially spent that money on the assumption they were to receive this back pay
6584535 for the local authority to walk away from that is completely immoral
6584536 the murderers most likely left the building through the front door the back gate was secured and the walls around the yard are impassable
6584537 when they left they would have been wearing bloody clothing or carrying a bag with the clothing and weapons in i want to appeal to anyone who saw anybody coming or going from the flat between thursday and saturday or who saw anything suspicious to contact northumbria police urgently
6584538 the interest in this case within the chinese community has already been high but i want to be able to speak directly to them to reassure them that we are committed to finding the killer or killers of xi zhou and zhen xing yang
6584539 i also want to appeal to them to come forward to us with any information
6584540 when i got there it was chaos a total mess
6584541 the duck huts are wrecked the disabled garden and our volunteer garden are in a complete mess
6584542 this is the worst vandalism i have seen in eight years
6584543 it has just been constant over the summer they seem to be coming here at least every second night and vandalising something
6584544 now we have to install security cameras or get a night watchman and that costs money
6584545 when the vandals kick in the huts the ducks wont run out so they just throw stones at them
6584546 it is traumatic for them and that impacts on the farm too because they wont lay any duck eggs which we sell for about a week
6584547 the place is a mess im retired and took this job on as a sort of pottering job but its turned into major surgery

6584550 for two or three of his researches he deserves the highest honor a scientific man can obtain but the sum of his work is absolutely overwhelming had he never lived the aspect of chemistry would be very different from that it is now
6584551 my record would be a good one to keep for as long as possible it would obviously be great to score in every game because we would win the league if i did
6584552 going in at half time one down produced a mix of emotions for us there was disappointment at how we lost the goal but also encouragement because we had dominated the game
6584553 equalising when we did knocked berwick and we took advantage by getting the second goal soon after
6584554 from now until the end of the season as long as my name is on the teamsheet ill be happy to play even if its in goal
6584555 its pretty hard for the manager to make any changes michael and ben are playing at centre half right now and doing very well so its up to me to push them
6584556 saturdays game is definitely a big one for us stenny are unbeaten in the league like us and either team could go top if other results go their way
6584557 thats another huge incentive for us well also hopefully have some players back from injury for that one
6584558 the area is extremely dangerous and can go from smiles and a wave to extreme violence in less than a minute so all the soldiers are switched on and prepared to react to any situation
6584559 the area is however making slow but steady progress with a new school new health centre a new mosque new roads and a busy bazaar twice a week there is also a cash for workers scheme which the local community engage in for employment
6584560 the town has security check points all around manned by the afghan national police and there is also a further security ring further out from the town known as patrol bases
6584561 an old hotel is within the dc and the previous occupants were the taliban the soldiers patrol eat do sentry duty and sleep this rotation continues there are times when you dont even know what day it is because that is just not important what is important is understanding your enemy and finding out his weakness you see your life depends on that so that is important

6584564 businesses and families alike are feeling the squeeze of higher energy prices
6584565 prices at the pump and in grocery stores are far outstripping workers wages even with the recent dip in oil prices higher energy prices continue to drive up costs throughout our economy and there are indications that businesses may be forced to pass on even more costs to consumers we need a new direction on the economy that promotes a sensible energy strategy boosts our sagging economy and puts people back to work next month congress will consider a second stimulus package that will help get the economy back on track
6584566 our brave soldiers covered our backs in harms way and we must cover theirs when they come home

6584570 according to the journal nbc poll 72 of the respondents said developing alternative energy sources could accomplish a great deal
6584571 when asked whether expanding areas for drilling for oil off coastal states was a step in the right direction 63 said it was
6584572 asked about building more nuclear plants 53 said it was a step in the right direction
6584573 voters are telling us they want everything said neil newhouse a republican who conducts the poll with democrat peter d hart

6584586 i thought id never deal with the price of the pump at a school board meeting
6584587 once the customer went out mccallum jumped on to the counter then behind the counter and on to the floor
6584588 he took hold of the sales assistant by his shirt and began shouting and swearing at him get out of the way and open the f ing till the assistant didnt know how to open the till
6584589 the accused then put his hand behind his back giving the impression to the counter assistant that he might have a weapon
6584590 the counter assistant was becoming terrified and pressed the panic alarm button
6584591 there was a female assistant in the shop but he didnt want to get her involved so didnt shout for help
6584592 he went to the shop originally to buy something but unfortunately these events unfolded
6584593 i would like to think we can cause an upset but we will wait and see what happens

6584606 i gave my opinion i want to hear the opinion of stephen harper
6584607 i dont fall into any of the next polar extremes on this issue
6584608 we need to hear mr harpers position his whole position its not complex its simply a question of yes or no
6584609 the standing rock reservation had a crime rate that was more than five times the national average
6584610 the additional police officers moved there by the bia have substantially reduced the crime rate this is not the time to reduce the number of police officers
6584611 i understand the need to boost the law enforcement presence at other reservations but that should not come at the expense of public safety on the standing rock reservation
6584612 the interior department made a commitment to maintain a significant police presence on standing rock the bia has the funding from congress and now they need to implement that plan and allocate the resources provided
6584613 the employees of honeywell have worked hard and have dedicated themselves to the future of this company and they deserve to have their voices heard
6584614 while i recognize that there are economic challenges facing the manufacturing sector now is not the time to rush to move good jobs out of the region we need to bring all parties to the table to find a solution that not only benefits the bottom line but also considers future of these dedicated employees and continues honeywells relationship with the central new york community
6584615 it appears that the bush administration is once again putting politics before public health in issuing this rule secretary leavitt has ignored the requests of congress and the needs of millions of american women
6584616 for eight years this administration has worked to undermine womens health they wont get away with it on their way out the door
6584617 we remain concerned by the regulations potential to create barriers for women seeking health care to jeopardize federal programs that provide family planning services and to disrupt state laws securing womens access to birth control currently federal law exits to protect a providers religious and moral beliefs therefore the purpose of a new rule to this end remains unclear
6584618 we remain committed to strongly opposing any proposal that could negatively impact the reproductive health of millions of women
6584619 for many the road to china has been a lifelong dream
6584620 today god has called one of his devout disciples home the untimely departure of our beloved friend and fearless leader chairwoman stephanie tubbs jones is indescribable
6584621 this is an enormously solemn day for members of congress the congressional black caucus family ohio residents and the world chairwoman tubbs jones was undoubtedly a true steward of the people she dedicated her life to ensure that life liberty and the pursuit of happiness was afforded to every american her command of the law was only matched by her boundless sense of integrity
6584622 chairwoman tubbs jones illustrious career included a crowd of firsts
6584623 in the halls of congress she was revered by her colleagues as a fair yet firm chair of the standard of official conduct committee throughout ohio communities she was celebrated for her tireless advocacy and intervention within the congressional black caucus family she will be forever cherished and gravely missed
6584624 our collective prayers and condolences are extended to her son mervyn jones ii her sister barbara her entire family her staff and the host of loved ones who knew and loved her
6584625 too often our police and sheriffs deputies hands are tied when it comes to illegal immigration
6584626 in this case police in katy were able to remove someone who is not only in this country illegally but who they also viewed as a threat to children this demonstrates the positive working relationship that has evolved for the benefit of our citizens
6584627 this legislation will put auburn and its unique connection to harriet tubman and the underground railroad firmly on the map of must see places for history lovers everywhere harriet tubman was undoubtedly one of the earliest and most honorable civil rights leaders in our nations history helping african americans escape slavery using the underground railroad
6584628 this bill will provide funding to establish a national historic park in auburn where harriet tubman was active in the suffrage movement and where she established one of the first incorporated homes for aged african americans i am glad that such a historic site in new york will be recognized to preserve the memory of harriet tubman so that future generations will know the great sacrifices that she made and remember her as one of americas great heroes
6584629 harriet tubman was a true heroine who fought tirelessly for the american ideals of equality and freedom to ensure that men and women of all races and creeds would be able to live together as equals
6584630 this bill gives us a unique chance to reflect on struggles of the past and look into a future of progress and growth that we could not have arrived at without the sacrifices of people like harriet tubman memorializing the places where her life began in maryland and her final resting place in auburn new york is a fitting tribute to this remarkable woman and her lifes work that brought freedom to so many others
6584631 harriet tubman was an extraordinary woman not only because of the lives she saved but also for hope and inspiration that her courage has brought to generations of americans
6584632 it is truly a great honor to represent her home and final resting place especially in a congress that has broken historic racial and gender barriers creating a national historic park to preserve harriet tubmans legacy will ensure that harriet tubmans lifes work teaches generations to come
6584633 we are an energy thirsty nation and i believe we need diversified solutions
6584634 working to develop a national energy strategy is prominent part of my legislative agenda todays forum provided a real opportunity to engage community and industry leaders in lynchburg
6584635 what we are seeing here is perhaps a perfect marriage as our nation is acknowledging that we are facing tremendous energy challenges local communities and industry are working collaboratively to find responsible solutions
6584636 it was education in the days of mgr kelly that saw so many working class children in dumbarton become leaders in the professions and the odonnell family contributed greatly to the growth of intellectual leadership in the church and in the community
6584637 he received the sacraments here and now his funeral service is taking place here he would have been a 12 year old altar boy when the bell tower was completed as an extension to the church in 1927
6584638 our law enforcement officials stand ready willing and able to expand on their current safety efforts to include a corps of local volunteers to beef up security on western new yorks waterways
6584639 a maritime watch program could have the same positive impact that trained citizen volunteers have had in curbing crime in our neighborhoods
6584640 we are taking action to secure our northern land border so that we know who is driving into our country but with millions of registered boats in the great lakes alone we must also work to protect the waterways that connect western new york and canada
6584641 a volunteer maritime watch initiative is a key step to adding the extra eyes and ears that could be critical in aiding buffalos law enforcement professionals in protecting our borders and citizens
6584642 what obama is creating is this army of individuals these grass roots activists who are out there trying to change the world in 160 characters or less

6584645 we made some projections of traffic levels contribution amounts and e mail levels based on estimates from folks who worked with john kerry and dean in 2004
6584646 we were watching the traffic go up and up surpassing all our previous records
6584647 so we had to do a lot of work to make sure we kept up with the demand his online success had placed on the system
6584648 i know its going to require money state monies federal monies levee monies levee district monies to make this a reality but if we dont start to do something well be forever talking and taking no action
6584649 i just about died when i went in the store
6584650 i dont know how traffics been but from an aesthetic perspective i think it looks great for me to be taken aback is kind of a big thing

6584656 its making sure we encourage one another and we give little pep talks and we feed off each others excitement
6584657 if you are making more than 250 000 then you are in the top 3 4 percent of this country you are doing well

6584662 in his position representing the players i felt like gene was always very frank and fair when he came in and visited the club he wouldnt come here to visit without wanting to sit down and talk for 15 minutes to see how our players were doing and what else was going on how were they doing how was i doing a time didnt go by when he didnt do that and i appreciated that its a big loss for the nfl community

6584679 as the doctor approached the accused punched him on his left jaw
6584680 the doctor was uninjured but decided to keep a safe distance and call police
6584681 the accused began tampering with the oxygen delivery system and held a cigarette albeit unlit towards the outlet pipe and was heard shouting boom
6584682 this alarmed staff and the patient who was in the same room was removed for their own safety
6584683 this particular night he had decided to stop drinking but when he stops drinking being a very heavy alcohol abuser and binge drinker he can hallucinate he has very little memory of much of this incident
6584684 i would be submitting that a combination of community service and probation would be appropriate
6584685 yesterday i paid our latest home heating fuel delivery 1 100 i also paid my 2 000 plus credit card balance which bought gas and groceries for the month as we approach the traditional retirement age we are slowly paying off our daughters college tuition loan and trying to keep our heads above water please dont use my name i live in a small town and this is so embarrassing
6584686 i am so frightened i spent this winter with my heat turned down to 53 degrees i am a teacher and have my masters degree everything is going up except my salary which next year will go up slightly above 1 percent the middle class is no longer the middle class ive slipped into the lower class after a winter of double heating costs and now these new economic hits
6584687 i am a registered school nurse and my husband is a self employed bread baker we are in our mid 30s and have two young children we always thought if we went to college earned four year degrees and worked hard we would be able to live a decent life we both work very very hard to provide needed services to our communities yet we scratch our heads when trying to budget our income how can it be that two college educated individuals with respectable careers are in such a financial bind
6584688 my husband and i followed all the rules he grew up in urban projects and went into the military service in so he could get gi bill benefits and go to college i grew up picking strawberries as a migrant worker but i was able to go to college on scholarships it doesnt seem right that after working hard and following all the rules for our lives now at 60 were tumbling down
6584689 i am thankful that my employer understands that many of us cannot afford to drive to work five days a week instead i work three 15 hour days keeping the heat at home just high enough to keep the pipes from bursting the bedrooms are not heated and stay at 30 degrees and i still cant keep up
6584690 we eat cereal and toast for dinner some nights because that is all i have
6584691 my parents both in their 60s are back to work so they can make ends meet and struggle to get enough gas money to see their doctors they are opting to close their house up for the winter and stay with my uncle so they dont have to put oil in the furnace meanwhile my mortgage is behind and we are at risk for foreclosure
6584692 it is now evident that speculators in the energy futures markets play a much larger role than previously thought and it is now even harder to accept the agencys laughable assertion that excessive speculation has not contributed to rising energy prices
6584693 difficult to comprehend how the cftc would allow a trader
6584694 to date the cftc has found that supply and demand fundamentals offer the best explanation for the systematic rise in oil prices
6584695 regardless of their classification the cftcs market surveillance group scrutinizes daily the positions of all large traders both commercial and non commercial to guard against market manipulation
6584696 when the cftc granted the 1991 hedging exemption to j aron a division of goldman sachs it signaled a major shift that has since allowed investors to accumulate enormous positions for purely speculative purposes
6584697 legitimate businesses that hedge and take physical delivery of oil are being trampled by the speculators who are in the market purely to make profit
6584698 investment banks had been frustrated with the established exchange because they really were never able to get control of it

6584705 it confirms to me that you have huge companies speculating
6584706 if you had an administration concerned about protecting consumers rather than big speculators this is something that would have been investigated years ago
6584707 revealed how an individual financial player had gained enormous sway over the oil market without the knowledge of regulators
6584708 showed that a significant amount of trading activity was concentrated in the hands of just a few speculators

6584736 until this year i never knew that they were supported solely by this community and get no contributions from the national ronald mcdonald house charities and so i know that the money that we raise stays right here in this community
6584737 she said to me a community without art is a community without heart
6584738 and it took me back to times that i donated my talent to various functions and organizations because it was all i had to donate and i started sensing that other artists might feel the same
6584739 the arts festival is happening again this year but it just didnt feel right to be doing this without making some kind of contribution to a charity to give back to the community
6584740 it was a simple play we had keller and bubba franks on two quick outs keller had better leverage at the five frank had a little trouble getting off the line it was pretty simple

6584746 they will now take their rightful place in the garden rafters alongside those players who have carried their tradition throughout the years
6584747 there will be no more information released until the three individuals have been served we are not releasing names or charges at this time

6584750 regardless of the person who you are playing this time of the year all the teams are big
6584751 what we experienced last year we had a chance to do some damage against quote unquote lower echelon teams but we werent able to get it done
6584752 it was just everything you could want in a season
6584753 we had a great team we had a lot of good guys on that team the whole year was fun and its a great place to pitch well
6584754 we are grateful to the canvass board members for their time and the efficiency with which they conducted the official election audit equally important is the fact that 814 ballots cast by provisional voters have been added to the official election results

6584768 if someone says they are were not getting an accurate version of them its ok to talk about failure but you need to discuss what you learned from it how did you become stronger for it

6584773 we liked the way pavano was throwing the ball and we felt that hughes needed some more work
6584774 hes pitched in big games before hes pitched in the playoffs youre not talking about a kid coming up that is a rookie and doesnt have a ton of innings under his belt in the big leagues were expecting him to throw well and keep us in the game and give us an opportunity if he can go six innings it would be great
6584775 obviously hes very excited to be back in the big leagues and to pitch for the club
6584776 his plan and his focus was to make it back this year and obviously he worked extremely hard to put himself in this position
6584777 obviously his command wasnt there his breaking ball wasnt sharp
6584778 i let a couple of them go and it felt good
6584779 when one guy is out there playing the game despite whatever is going on and somebody else is not thats how teammates get bad tastes in their mouths

6584793 one takes his time to think things out the other one loves to rush and go at a million miles an hour theres definitely tension between the two of them while theyre making decisions during the race
6584794 they are small we wanted to make sure that there wasnt anything to prevent us from putting that pack underneath the seat in front of us when we got on a plane we didnt want something to happen where we got delayed because of our luggage we thought that would help us go faster
6584795 we did extensive research on what to wear what was lightweight and would help us move the fastest

6584804 we are taking action where we find serious breaches of the rules it is not based on the size of the firm but more where we discover breaches
6584805 motor retailers that sell ppi have to meet the same standards as the rest of the financial services industry
6584806 all firms selling ppi must treat their customers fairly including taking proper steps to make sure sales are suitable and customers are eligible to claim on the policy ppi remains a top priority for the fsa in 2008 and beyond
6584807 crude is rallying as the dollar is down and theres this ongoing geopolitical tension between russia and the west
6584808 the jump in the front winter price over the last two days has been a classic squeeze after the market had become fundamentally short during august as oil tumbled in july from record highs earlier this year and spot prices fell towards the end of the month

6584816 we need to bring them in and make them a part of the team that we worked with over the spring
6584817 its just a matter of bringing the team concepts together getting all of our individual talents and forming it into one
6584818 a lot of people dont think we can do it again
6584819 but i think the best part about the team is we are all extremely competitive if you came to watch one of our practices and wed have 4 4 4 we would be tearing each others hair out i think its important that we keep that mentality and we know that we can get back there we should get back there and we have to get back there
6584820 we need to stay focused thats the biggest part of anything because the season is so long and so short at the same time
6584821 as long as we stay mentally focused i think well go very far because we have worked so hard over the spring and summer its just a matter of staying mentally focused throughout the season
6584822 obviously as a senior i hope we have just as good if not better of a season than we had last year
6584823 it definitely is a goal of ours to go back to the final four and play for the national championship
6584824 participava normalmente dos treinos s n o jogava por isso estou pronto para ajudar caso o t cnico queira contar comigo
6584825 estou bem mais experiente que aquele andrade que deixou o santa cruz em 2006 tive a oportunidade de rodar o mundo e conhecer novas estruturas e posso dizer que isso fortaleceu bastante a minha carreira
6584826 quando o avi o come ou a descer em recife eu j senti um frio na barriga e uma sensa o de que coisas boas estavam por vir fui muito feliz aqui e espero dar continuidade agora no sport venho para um clube grande que vive uma tima fase e espero que meu futebol se junte ao dos demais jogadores para ajudar o sport
6584827 fisicamente eu estou muito bem estava atuando em alguns torneios na espanha e fazendo pr temporada no meu clube o c diz o que pode demorar um pouco a documenta o mas acho que para o pr ximo jogo na ilha do retiro eu j deva estar apto para atuar

6584829 ser a ltima vez que jogaremos contra o paran n o teremos outra chance de aumentarmos em mais tr s pontos nossa diferen a para eles e o racioc nio tem que valer nos confrontos com as outras equipes pode ser uma conta bvia mas verdadeira quanto mais pontos conseguirmos colocar em cima dos nossos advers rios menos teremos que torcer para que eles tropecem
6584830 eles estavam na s rie a at o ano passado e n o ocupam uma posi o muito boa na tabela por isso eles precisam muito da vit ria e v o vir com tudo
6584831 ser interessante voltar ao circuito onde eu e o nic jonsson j corremos juntos em 2007 com certeza isto torna tudo mais f cil para n s estou preparado para a prova e vou tentar usar esta experi ncia como uma vantagem
6584832 i have never had a president who inspired me the way people tell me that my father inspired them but for the first time i believe i have found the man who could be that president not just for me but for a new generation of americans
6584833 youre probably thinking a normal teenager doesnt do this well ask dick
6584834 this is disheartening news for my family and me gene was familiar to all chargers fans because of his hall of fame playing career with the raiders and our annual rivalry with his team during his years as player union chief he was a tough relentless negotiator but most important his top priority was the game itself he fought hard for his players association but never at the expense of the fans or the game everyone associated with the nfl today owes a debt of gratitude to gene upshaw
6584835 in his role with the national football league players association gene had the tremendous ability to get things done he was steadfast in his convictions but

6584844 at the heart of any fertility incentive lies an attempt to encourage a particular group of women to orient their bodies in a traditional way
6584845 first time buyers are the people who have been hit hard
6584846 we would say whatever the government can do do it for first time buyers if the government can find a way to underwrite the securitised loans that banks are having difficulty refinancing then that could ease the situation
6584847 trading conditions have been the most challenging in persimmons recent history our results for the period reflect this difficult market
6584848 there has been a major step down in activity since the end of march
6584849 we are seeing large growth in the volume of people coming on holiday but the spend on site is lower than it has been in previous years
6584850 you see people arriving and theyre taking the lidl and the aldi bags out of the boot of the car you can see them with half bottles of gin that are going into handbags when they go into the bars
6584851 ill keep something of the name for the old guy because i have great affection for him
6584852 at the end of the season they used to plant a big bronze statue of course it wasnt real bronze of joe maplin they would turn up and stick plastic roses in the ground because all the roses had gone by that time and they would film all the episodes in about two weeks
6584853 it is and it isnt the brand awareness is amazing if you go out on the street and you mention the words butlins and pontins to any english person they will say holiday camps so at least they know what it is and that is something
6584854 i think the most disappointing thing is the way that the british holiday experience resort call it what you like has deteriorated and luckily at the very last moment investment is starting to come back in and it is getting better if you take blackpool as an example i mean it really did get into some dire dire straits in terms of its marketing the level of violence and drunkenness and it is not just blackpool but all over
6584855 from about the early 90s we used to build into the budget about 500 a week for people kicking the glass in and wed invariably spend it because every night somewhere or other some drunken yob would take a swing with his boot at a pane of glass
6584856 but i really do see a resurgence and an improvement if we invest properly people respect that and if we are careful in the way that we manage the leisure assets it will stop the yob element we almost were in danger of giving in to it but i think people have just had enough
6584857 i was in greens restaurant in duke street st jamess which is owned by simon parker bowles and he said i see pontins are in the field the magazine for country sports
6584858 so i get home open it up and obviously this journo was short of something to do in july because there is not a lot of shooting going on but she was obviously a fan of jive dancing and we do jive dancing weekends at pontins and sure enough she had gone down to camber sands and there was a whole article in the field i mean how on earth do you get pontins in the field i was completely oblivious to the whole bloody thing they didnt ask it was a very good article but im not sure if it is our target market i have to say
6584859 i can confirm we are interested and involved in the process
6584860 a good level of interest particularly from a wide range of private equity companies
6584861 our preference would be to sell as overall one unit but at the end of the day well do what maximises shareholder value
6584862 if that requires selling it in pieces were prepared to do that
6584863 consumer magazines and their publishers have not really got their arms around the internet yet
6584864 but business to business groups have been a lot more successful reed has done particularly well in terms of moving print into online and face to face events as well
6584865 gas and electricity are essential commodities which have now become a luxury many cannot afford the government needs to provide a strategic regulatory environment to ensure the lights stay on at an affordable price
6584866 the government must seize control of this escalating crisis and take immediate action
6584867 this proposal offers to put more money in the pockets of poorer consumers by reducing their outgoings and providing for weekly budgeting to avoid debt
6584868 we are deeply concerned about the effects of household price rises on hard pressed families and other vulnerable people
6584869 we reached an agreement with them to treble the amount they spend to help the poorest this will provide an extra 225m over the next three years and could help 100 000 households who struggle to keep their homes warm in the winter
6584870 vytorins effectiveness has been in doubt and now its safety is questionable
6584871 nobody should avoid taking a statin because of concerns about cancer
6584872 we have been led to believe that there are still running assignments for us next year this is a small setback
6584873 we recognise that market conditions are currently difficult for housebuilders as a result of the global credit crunch which is why we are putting measures in place to support industry including more funding to buy unsold homes and are constantly looking at what more we can do
6584874 however a legacy of housing under supply and our ageing and growing population mean the conditions remain for a healthy housing market over the medium to long term underpinned by low unemployment and low interest rates
6584875 we see at amp t as a far more likely buyer of c amp w uk than the perennial rumour regarding deutsche telekom at amp t has a stated interest of international expansion in the corporate space and c amp w could help with that
6584876 we would see this as a small negative for vodafone
6584877 we had a catch up session with invensys which underpinned our continued confidence in our recommendation and target price the simple reality is that invensys is being valued as a peer of whirlpool and electrolux despite the fact that 80 of earnings comes from infrastructure derived process and rail where order momentum remains encouraging add in its net cash and invensys remains the outstanding value play in uk capital goods
6584878 if the rumour is well founded the shares could have another 20 30 upside but if the actions being taken in retail are not gaining traction and there is no offer then the shares are likely to fall back below 100p again
6584879 the business environment remains difficult however we estimate schroders has surplus capital of around 395m and is therefore in a position to take advantage of the current market conditions should acquisition opportunities arise in asset management or private banking
6584880 the fall in business investment was worse than anticipated it confirms that businesses are being forced to retrench in the face of the economic slowdown
6584881 todays figures support the results of the bccs quarterly economic survey the worsening economic pressures emphasise the need for the mpc and the government to take the correct measures to counter the threat of recession
6584882 it is not only households who are struggling businesses are also finding it difficult to acquire external sources of finance as credit conditions remain tight the environment for investing is deteriorating
6584883 the second half was a vast improvement on the first
6584884 i felt we were negotiating with them in good faith and all of a sudden the brown camp pulls off a media thing
6584885 we wanted to announce debates jointly and thats what we were working toward
6584886 we need to know these candidates as much as anybody
6584887 its very important that these people get a debate here
6584888 we are committed to partnering with community organizations and media outlets across the sacramento chico and reno markets to ensure every voter is able to access every debate
6584889 in order to ensure that any investigation of the allegations is fair and free from any question of interference or influence i am taking a leave of absence effective immediately for the duration of the investigation

6584893 im assuming that as unemployment rises and inflation pressures subside australian financial conditions will need to be shifted from extremely restrictive to only mildly restrictive
6584894 if that is right the rba probably will be forced to return standard mortgage rates from 9 1 2 per cent today to 8 per cent
6584895 over the past two to three weeks there has been a substantial fall in the price of money in the australian marketplace
6584896 thats come about through the reserve indicating there is going to be an interest rate cut over the next few weeks
6584897 what were forecasting through to next year is that those sources of funds will continue to rise and continue to put upward pressure on the banks cost of funds
6584898 it was substantially above the reserves cash rate and its the banks cost of funds that determines the mortgage rate
6584899 one of the defining dynamics of 2008 has been the emerging wave of new young voters getting involved and storming the gates of the traditional political establishment
6584900 they are a key to this election and senator obama is energizing this new generation of voters in a way never seen before our party and our politics are better for their participation and i look forward to hosting this extraordinary event on their behalf
6584901 in order to ensure that any investigation of the allegations is fair and free from any question of interference or influence i am taking a leave of absence effective immediately for the duration of the investigation
6584902 i see them talking and theyre sitting there putting ideas together its like two great minds making one great defense its going to be great
6584903 we expect to make a lot of plays help our offense a lot help our team a lot
6584904 im a firm believer that you always dictate to them dont let them dictate to you
6584905 ive really grown in a lot of different areas not just in calling blitzes or calling plays its a lot of areas j t has been around a lot of guys
6584906 i like to hear about those guys those schemes those games theres been a lot of that just talking a lot of football

6584921 but did i suspect something like this might happen yes i did that was evident last spring
6584922 he said he didnt feel like playing hed lost his desire
6584923 so he went home with our permission we were back healthy in syracuse and didnt need him so we just told him to get ready for this season we didnt have much contact early in the off season but then he came to the development camp in columbus which was a really good sign to me
6584924 he had lost his passion for the game and didnt want to play any more
6584925 the strange thing for me is that from the way he plays hes the last kid youd expect this from hes passionate and always plays with abandon hes a darcy tucker type
6584926 in my opinion stefan just wants to take a break hes tired from all the things hes gone through the last two seasons all the tournaments the games the shoulder injury all that stuff he feels like he needs some time and space
6584927 stefans pretty upset actually at some of the stuff thats been thrown around out there on these many blogs
6584928 these are people who dont know whats going on and theyre saying some very inaccurate and hurtful things its not right
6584929 im talking about the unsolicited comments on the blogs not the newspaper articles that have been written this is a 19 year old kid all right he has some maturing to do but he does not deserve this
6584930 internet s la base de dades falses m s gran del m n
6584931 if you thought yesterdays trophy news was good todays will knock your socks off
6584932 kids parents teens enthusiastic gamers curious consumers and mystery buffs of all backgrounds
6584933 i recall showing it to censor james ferman who thought it was fine and funny enough but thought we were showing him the reels in the wrong order we werent the film just doesnt make sense
6584934 we were dealing with single screens back then there was always the next american blockbuster queuing up behind you if your film didnt perform then theyd pull it to make way for something more profitable
6584935 its not the film i want on my headstone or in my obituary when i die but its not without fans it doesnt matter if a film is regarded as part of our national heritage or some rubbish like that audiences couldnt care less about that stuff they either like it or they dont
6584936 every day i am faced in my office by a wall of old vhs tapes
6584937 im constantly asking myself what here isnt available on dvd bloodbath kept leaping out at me
6584938 there were no prints of bloodbath to be found and it wasnt even sold to television so we had nothing to fall back on the original negative had to be found
6584939 these rights may be passed down through families or companies as producers either pass away or get out of the business
6584940 films may even be stowed away under their production title one that may bear no relation to the one used when released into cinemas
6584941 the labs store and preserve these films for decades in controlled environments theyre not charities and these things cost money many movie owners simply abandon the negative rather than pay hefty costs if this happens the film is usually thrown out a fate thats far too common
6584942 the enduring appeal of film continues to be even more pronounced in times of economic uncertainty and we feel confident that the strong line up of films in the second half will drive admissions particularly in the fourth quarter
6584943 i spent a lot of time and energy on it the harp isnt something that you just pick up and it was fucking cut out it really hurts
6584944 he thinks i was demanding and a real handful but i think i went along almost 90 of the time without questioning his vision
6584945 im very lucky to have the career ive had when i think of the piece of nothing roles that i could be playing in which your character is just a romantic plot device your body is your only stock in trade and you effectively have nothing to contribute artistically to the process i feel very lucky indeed
6584946 there was a period of time when i felt i had to be ashamed of it
6584947 i know its not a piece of art but its a film im really proud of it has a good story and the central character is very bright i would be happy to watch it with one of my cousins and say actually this is a good message for young women
6584948 i think i managed to convince my parents into this by putting up the image of being a very serious and responsible teenager
6584949 i spent a lot of time in my room reading she puts a heavy ironic stress on the word i think that persuaded my parents it would be a good experience for me and it was but it taught me very quickly that i was nowhere near as grown up as i thought i was
6584950 for a long time i wanted to be a writer but i think i thought more about the act of writing than about writing itself i imagined myself sitting at a desk in a flowing dressing gown with my head in my hands so theres probably a reason that didnt blossom into a career
6584951 it isnt just work its peoples lives and passions and you think this isnt something i can do just to pass the time
6584952 i thought there is nothing i would rather do for a living i love my job in a very limited way i feel im reasonably good at it and morally its not a bad choice for my life as long as you do good things that you really believe in that you feel have some kind of purpose what more could any human being want from their job
6584953 in what i do theres a huge reliance on your emotions and your emotional life so quite frankly i need to sit down for eight hours a week and make notes and study and have an awareness of how much i dont know
6584954 i wrote to the woman producer that no real film maker would allow himself to squeeze the madeleine as though it were a lemon
6584955 this is the age of gene hackman and barbra streisand there are no roles for them here
6584956 take the film over inhale it and roar like its demons
6584957 will deliver innovative solutions for the future challenges facing the auto industry
6584958 guarantor for securing the interests of all stakeholders of continental
6584959 id always liked movies in a kind of naive way
6584960 they seemed no less improbable a career than anything else
6584961 i developed a kind of sales kit with slides and videotapes of actors all with a view to presenting investors with something that would look ready to shoot to my surprise they didnt pay too much attention to it they invested on faith
6584962 it was mesmerising it disarmed you it was a period piece and yet of all time it was extremely american it caught the spirit of the people of the culture in a way that was immediately identifiable
6584963 think of the gun in your hand as a magic wand
6584964 whatever you see in badlands is terrys style not mine
6584965 hes very strong visually he was always willing eager to change to things hed see something in the yard and say lets put that in the bedroom thats one thing i learned from him spontaneity
6584966 the shoot went on for ever because the crew kept quitting
6584967 they were completely brutalised theyd be setting up one shot over here then terry would look over in the other direction where the moon was rising up and hed go lets shoot over there i have these memories of everyone tearing off across the desert in pursuit of one sunset or another
6584968 i had a vested interest id fallen in love with sissy so that also kept me going
6584969 i can recall brian shooting with the slate upside down as a form of protest in a disagreement with terry about methods of orthodox coverage and matching shots
6584970 amazingly despite the input of these different hands the film looks remarkably seamless
6584971 except for the actors the art department was the only one that completed the film if the picture survived all those problems its because one thing was consistent terry malicks vision
6584972 people whove worked with terry either love him or hate him
6584973 i love him badlands was a real turning point for me wed spend hours talking about things and then the next day id look at the rewrites and thered be all the things i told him
6584974 holly seems at times to think of her narration as like what you get in audio visual courses in high school
6584975 when theyre crossing the badlands instead of telling us whats going on between kit and herself she describes what they ate and what it tasted like as though we might be planning a similar trip
6584976 she might have cried buckets of tears but she wouldnt think of telling you about it it would not be proper you should always feel there are large parts of her experience shes not including because she has a strong if misplaced sense of propriety
6584977 i will never be better than i was in badlands
6584978 he had a genuine gift it wasnt just an eye it wasnt just a facility with a camera it wasnt just an ability to write it was something inside him that was special he was the greatest director of his time
6584979 the old buzzard had it coming an alafair tucker mystery
6584980 50 and his attorneys met yesterday wednesday with suffolk county authorities regarding the fire that destroyed 50s house the meeting had been arranged weeks ago 50 is eager to review the findings of the investigation when it is concluded
6584981 o papel do servi o p blico no futuro dos eua
6584982 they had what we in the trade business call a blowout
6584983 we had a post tension tendon shift in the concrete slab of the first floor and it caused concrete and insulation to pop off in the garage below
6584984 we have called in engineering expertise to analyze the problem and to fix it its certainly something that we take very seriously but in the context of a 270 000 square foot building were talking about something that takes up 18 square feet
6584985 if you want to pick up books from one end of a shelf to another you put your hands on either side and squeeze tightly to hold the books together so you can pick them all up
6584986 thats kind of the job of the post tensioning tendon to squeeze tightly and hold
6584987 theyve been given full access so we can address problem as quickly as possible
6584988 but this is not something that is major or something that is unheard of there are recognized and proven methods to fix this
6584989 its one thing to have a person painting in the area its another to have a person with a camera trying to get pictures and who might end up getting hurt but weve had people trespassing anyway
6584990 this president is capable of taking us into war in october on the eve of an election to try to change the outcome of the election
6584991 the events in georgia are a premonition of an attack on iran when georgia moved against south ossetia as the olympics are starting the bush administration begins its own olympics the war olympics
6584992 a new book by the author ron suskind claims that the white house ordered the cia to forge a back dated handwritten letter from the head of iraqi intelligence to saddam hussein
6584993 by design those attacks put the american population into a state of intense fear of islamic terrorism far more than the 9 11 attacks alone could have accomplished
6584994 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing
6584995 i have become very concerned with the possibility that this administration may have violated federal law by using the resources of our intelligence agencies to influence domestic policy processes or opinion
6584996 this is not intended to be a mere discussion of violations of law that have occurred
6584997 it is rather intended to be a planning conference at which plans will be laid and necessary organizational structures set up
6584998 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
6584999 78 percent of president bushs more than 150 signing statements have raised constitutional or legal objections
6585000 signing statements may if used drunk newspropriately serve a legitimate function as a tool for continuing dialog between a president congress amp a public on a oar h amp signing statements may be a mechanism to exp amp executive authority at a expense of a legislature

6585007 part of our theory on the case dealt with merrills research
6585008 if applicable identify all individuals who were involved in determining when the firm would place supporting bids or placed such bids
6585009 whether the firm participated in surveying investor interest and providing price talk guidance to customers
6585010 no its just a regular new york accent that has nothing to do with jews
6585011 hey ill hit you up so we can drink party together
6585012 theres lots of things that they could do but typically just they just line up on the wrong side of the argument in my opinion
6585013 they have lots of reasons as to why they do that but i think that theres been this dirty little secret among hardware manufacturers which is that the perception of free content even if youre supposed to pay for it on pcs is some sort hidden benefit that you get when you buy a pc like a right to download music for free or a right to download pirated movies and games
6585014 and i think that just based on their actions what they say is one thing but what they do is another when it comes into debates about whether peer to peer file sharing networks that by and large have the vast majority im talking 99 per cent of the content is illicitly trading copyrighted property theyll come out on the side of the 1 per cent of the user doing it for legitimate benefit you can make philosophical arguments that are difficult to debate but at the same time youre just sort of ignoring the enormity of the problem
6585015 there were known gang areas and there were specific locations in those areas where they knew there would be increased gang activity like where the gangs hang out
6585016 and based on that some search warrants were executed that would be kind of the specific targeting but they were also targeting the areas where known gang members were stopped and run for warrants
6585017 its a number of factors i think the economy is really bad right now and it has been for a while gas prices are high so people tend to shop closer to home and now you can get a smattering of organic in a lot of different places
6585018 members go on vacation they have their own gardens some of them go to the farmers market
6585019 for whatever reason business is always slower in the summer but this is the worst summer weve had since the first year we opened
6585020 when we opened 16 years ago we were pretty much alone in promoting and providing organic produce and other items and we still according to many members have the best organic produce in toledo
6585021 theyre not a megastore theyre a small local store theyre owned and or supported by their customers and its not the same thing as a megachain like meijer or wal mart who are trying to sell the same thing
6585022 if you shop at chains you dont know if the moneys staying in the community or not in fact its pretty certain that its not but in a small community store its worth supporting
6585023 we all just found other directions in life like family and other work other things were more fulfilling
6585024 it just became a thing of life catching up on us
6585025 were such close friends or siblings in one case we just enjoyed hanging out and recording
6585026 some people go fishing we get together and turn it on
6585027 very few bands in the toledo area are at the same level of songwriting theyre good at what they do
6585028 i havent been able to move the country as fast as i wanted to but ive always believed that members of the house if we do something well in our own areas to meet the needs of our own people if its good enough it will meet the needs of the nation
6585029 even though i cant move the nation if i can create the momentum here for energy independence others will follow us
6585030 this is really a unique opportunity that we need to capitalize on
6585031 weve had a small amount of funding before but not at a level that allows us to look at this problem from the basic level and say what do we need to help local companies and nasa the most
6585032 if americas going to make it in terms of energy independence it has to make it in places like toledo
6585033 we never relented in our efforts to give birth to this industry
6585034 were a lot further ahead than the other 434 congressional districts
6585035 it does two things for us it reduces our reliance on fossil fuels but it reduces the burden on the taxpayers here in ohio and across the nation its a big savings to them
6585036 its very difficult to get funds for nondirect mission related types of projects
6585037 by congresswoman kaptur obtaining and securing these funds it allows us to research technologies and determine if theyre feasible for the rest of the air force to use
6585038 we are identified we have a certain core of activities that have been undertaken theres a certain confidence level thats been built up
6585039 we have to continue building on the research capacities and the business capacities that have been developed in this community and they will grow naturally
6585040 we are lowering our third quarter estimates to reflect the difficult operating environment characterised by lower client related trading volumes and losses on hard to sell assets
6585041 based on further deterioration in several indices we expect further writedowns primarily related to mortgage assets
6585042 it just had a big 36 on the top i was shocked
6585043 it is possible to miss a few and still earn a composite of 36
6585044 people will call me a nerd but it is ironic because i dont study that much
6585045 the first time i got a 34 but i didnt finish the math section i had to guess on the math problems my goal taking it the second time was to finish the math section that was my intention i was hoping to get a 34 or better
6585046 so my thought was i am trying to do this home school thing
6585047 i was totally thrilled with a 36 he wished i was a little more excited
6585048 were always monitoring all the general insurance companies in australia
6585049 that includes businesses like allianz australia and wesfarmers lumleys arm but when you look at the prices weve just got more opportunities offshore that make more sense for our shareholders
6585050 we put a proposal on the table and they rejected it and were now just getting on with life
6585051 there is evidence of market hardening in some sectors with premium rate increases particularly in personal lines and small to medium enterprises these representing the majority of our australian portfolio
6585052 however large corporate risks are still experiencing premium rate reductions due to strong competition by some insurers in australia and the london market
6585053 i didnt say i was powerful i said i was a wizard
6585054 theyre all inside jokes they all have some meaning to us theyre not as random as one might think
6585055 one specifically if i cut my hair hawaii will sink i said that this was way back i think we were up in the michigan up playing a show i was 19 so this was a while ago and i was really drunk and i said that and it stuck
6585056 once it got released that first week you kind of wait for the numbers i had a couple sleepless nights wondering what was going on so it was definitely pretty impressive how well it did
6585057 with any record youre going to do when you have even minor success with the first album theres always that pressure to have to one up that album to keep going as far as you can
6585058 with any band you dont want to fall into the whole sophomore slump so theres definitely pressure
6585059 if music styles were a buffet the disc is a little bit of everything a little bit of rock a little bit of hardcore
6585060 ive seen brad leap into the crowd before and pat
6585061 i used to do it but i took a nasty fall one time so i just dont i dont have health insurance i dont want to risk it
6585062 when i was younger and you lack a little bit of maturity theres always that dream of college
6585063 now part of it is wheres the place that youre meant to be in high school you have 70 to 80 kids every year that hopefully besides teaching them the game of football youll give them a little bit that will help them later in life as you go up at each level i think you lose a little bit of that
6585064 i think winning over a long period of time is harder you look at someone like coach dick cromwell rich arbinger ed heintschel i mean those were always my kind of goals of what i wanted to do
6585065 ive had schools contact me over the years especially in the last three but how many people get to go to work at a place you love or you grew up at every day i dont even own any r sum paper ive fielded a lot of phone calls but ive never really answered any of them im so happy where im at with a young family looking forward to gosh coaching my son some day thats a pretty good situation to be in its weird what i used to think i wanted to do and what i want to do now
6585066 its the first time where you have to make some decisions
6585067 part of the success that ive had is having a wife and family that supports it so much loves it and makes it so you can do the job the right way because i only know one way to do this the pillow went up on the tv the other day we interrupt this marriage for football season and you cant do that without someone behind you as tough as it is on them
6585068 like a kid being the first person in their family to go to college being a part of that getting to witness that watching kids as freshmen that could barely carry a bucket of water then theyre starting on a championship team as seniors watching guys graduate and seeing what they are going on to do i have two kids at home but i have a lot more than that in my heart
6585069 surprise new iphone comes loaded with photos of the girl who made it
6585070 i didnt have any idea what was going to be a good score out here its definitely not that easy its perfect conditions youve got great weather the course is in perfect shape right now playing in the morning helped a lot the greens were a little bit more receptive
6585071 i wanted to get that out of my system and just play golf today and i did
6585072 it was a pretty tough week but you learn from your mistakes
6585073 the greens are good i mean theyre perfect perfect speed
6585074 i think you can be aggressive i was committed to my lines and made aggressive strokes
6585075 i thought the scores werent going to be as low
6585076 hunter had such a great round and there were some 4 or 5 under par rounds so my 1 under par round is not as good as i thought it would be but i thought i played well and ill take it
6585077 there are tournaments where ill shoot 6 or 7 under and thats as good as i can play and the winner is 21 under and im thinking how did they do that
6585078 i know its difficult out there and the rough is tough but that was just bad play
6585079 when he gets hot he does do some crazy stuff
6585080 if you drive the ball well you have some birdie chances and if you dont you struggle to break par

6585082 the enduring appeal of film continues to be even more pronounced in times of economic uncertainty and we feel confident that the strong line up of films in the second half will drive admissions particularly in the fourth quarter
6585083 we are utterly resolute in our determination to support this new democracy of afghanistan
6585084 we wont relax our efforts to support and reconstruct afghanistan because we understand that what happens in afghanistan affects the rest of the world we are determined to work with the government and coalition forces to defeat the forces of terrorism
6585085 we have succeeded in winning back territory the longer term solution is that more power will be given to the afghanistan people
6585086 you are the heroes of our country you are the frontline against the taliban what you are doing here prevents terrorism coming to the streets of britain
6585087 this week we are celebrating the olympics where we have had great success people have been winning medals in areas where we have been breaking ground but this week also i believe that our olympic athletes and everybody else in our country will remember that you have showed exactly the same courage professionalism and dedication you make our country proud every day of the week every week of the year
6585088 it shows we do have support for what we are doing it gives us a sense of pride
6585089 plotting in the cabinet is not new it happens in afghanistan too
6585090 i want somebody whos independent somebody who can push against my preconceived notions and challenge me so we have a robust debate in the white house
6585091 in any italian opera house let alone la scala at the start of the season audiences tend to be vocal about vocal failure if someone fails to sing a favourite passage quite well enough the audience will talk about it there and then there will be a buzz of distress and a general muttering
6585092 thats from me cuz his name wasnt on it and i didnt know it was from him til he said that
6585093 can you please stop talking to her for a minute and tell me what the hell you wanted
6585094 i didnt have any idea what was going to be a good score out here its definitely not that easy its perfect conditions youve got great weather the course is in perfect shape right now playing in the morning helped a lot the greens were a little bit more receptive
6585095 i wanted to get that out of my system and just play golf today and i did
6585096 it was a pretty tough week but you learn from your mistakes
6585097 the greens are good i mean theyre perfect perfect speed

6585099 i thought the scores werent going to be as low
6585100 hunter had such a great round and there were some 4 or 5 under par rounds so my 1 under par round is not as good as i thought it would be but i thought i played well and ill take it

6585120 antes del fin de esta d cada m s de la mitad de los 1 439 diarios que se publican en los estados unidos en la actualidad habr n dejado de existir tanto en papel como en la web los primeros en perecer ser n los diarios regionales
6585121 los nuevos medios hiperlocales cuyos servicios se ofrecer n s lo en la web sustituir n a muchos diarios peque os pero no a todos y nunca antes de que aqu llos hayan desaparecido
6585122 mas de 1 300 millones de personas est n gravitando hacia aquello que se adapta a sus gustos individuales se est n alejando de los medios de comunicaci n tradicionales ya que estos son un intento de dar cabida en un s lo molde a las combinaciones nicas de intereses de 1 300 millones de personas
6585123 la raz n por la cual sitios como yahoo y google son los m s utilizados es porque la gente anda a la busca y captura de informaci n sobre infinidad de asuntos que se adaptan a sus intereses espec ficos
6585124 miremos s lo al new york times el l der de los diarios estadounidenses el tiempo que lector medio en internet pasa leyendo la web de new york times en un mes es inferior al tiempo que el lector medio en papel pasa ley ndolo en un d a estas cifras son todav a peores en el caso de otros peri dicos
6585125 abandonen las pr cticas anal gicas y comiencen a adoptar las pr cticas de personalizaci n masiva los elementos tecnol gicos que permiten esto ya existen lo nico que nenesitan hacer los editores es adoptarlas y ensamblarlas
6585126 el periodista ciudadano puede verse tentado a crear l mismo la noticia
6585127 you can always check somebodys background you can never predict the future
6585128 im wondering if he had been an employee of wal mart or rexall drugs or working in a pizza shop if those companies would have gotten that big publicity
6585129 crude is rallying as the dollar is down and theres this ongoing geopolitical tension between russia and the west
6585130 the jump in the front winter price over the last two days has been a classic squeeze after the market had become fundamentally short during august as oil tumbled in july from record highs earlier this year and spot prices fell towards the end of the month
6585131 there is a point where you take over the market
6585132 we see at amp t as a far more likely buyer of c amp w uk than the perennial rumour regarding deutsche telekom at amp t has a stated interest of international expansion in the corporate space and c amp w could help with that
6585133 we would see this as a small negative for vodafone
6585134 we had a catch up session with invensys which underpinned our continued confidence in our recommendation and target price the simple reality is that invensys is being valued as a peer of whirlpool and electrolux despite the fact that 80 of earnings comes from infrastructure derived process and rail where order momentum remains encouraging add in its net cash and invensys remains the outstanding value play in uk capital goods
6585135 if the rumour is well founded the shares could have another 20 30 upside but if the actions being taken in retail are not gaining traction and there is no offer then the shares are likely to fall back below 100p again
6585136 the business environment remains difficult however we estimate schroders has surplus capital of around 395m and is therefore in a position to take advantage of the current market conditions should acquisition opportunities arise in asset management or private banking
6585137 here we have a handful of car dealers who have sold a few thousand policies the firms that are causing the most consumer detriment are the major banks and they are getting away with mis selling millions of policies it is time the fsa picked on the firms causing the real damage
6585138 we are taking action where we find serious breaches of the rules it is not based on the size of the firm but more where we discover breaches
6585139 motor retailers that sell ppi have to meet the same standards as the rest of the financial services industry
6585140 all firms selling ppi must treat their customers fairly including taking proper steps to make sure sales are suitable and customers are eligible to claim on the policy ppi remains a top priority for the fsa in 2008 and beyond
6585141 first time buyers are the people who have been hit hard
6585142 we would say whatever the government can do do it for first time buyers if the government can find a way to underwrite the securitised loans that banks are having difficulty refinancing then that could ease the situation
6585143 trading conditions have been the most challenging in persimmons recent history our results for the period reflect this difficult market
6585144 there has been a major step down in activity since the end of march
6585145 we recognise that market conditions are currently difficult for housebuilders as a result of the global credit crunch which is why we are putting measures in place to support industry including more funding to buy unsold homes and are constantly looking at what more we can do
6585146 however a legacy of housing under supply and our ageing and growing population mean the conditions remain for a healthy housing market over the medium to long term underpinned by low unemployment and low interest rates
6585147 we are seeing large growth in the volume of people coming on holiday but the spend on site is lower than it has been in previous years
6585148 you see people arriving and theyre taking the lidl and the aldi bags out of the boot of the car you can see them with half bottles of gin that are going into handbags when they go into the bars
6585149 ill keep something of the name for the old guy because i have great affection for him
6585150 at the end of the season they used to plant a big bronze statue of course it wasnt real bronze of joe maplin they would turn up and stick plastic roses in the ground because all the roses had gone by that time and they would film all the episodes in about two weeks
6585151 it is and it isnt the brand awareness is amazing if you go out on the street and you mention the words butlins and pontins to any english person they will say holiday camps so at least they know what it is and that is something
6585152 i think the most disappointing thing is the way that the british holiday experience resort call it what you like has deteriorated and luckily at the very last moment investment is starting to come back in and it is getting better if you take blackpool as an example i mean it really did get into some dire dire straits in terms of its marketing the level of violence and drunkenness and it is not just blackpool but all over
6585153 from about the early 90s we used to build into the budget about 500 a week for people kicking the glass in and wed invariably spend it because every night somewhere or other some drunken yob would take a swing with his boot at a pane of glass
6585154 but i really do see a resurgence and an improvement if we invest properly people respect that and if we are careful in the way that we manage the leisure assets it will stop the yob element we almost were in danger of giving in to it but i think people have just had enough
6585155 i was in greens restaurant in duke street st jamess which is owned by simon parker bowles and he said i see pontins are in the field the magazine for country sports
6585156 so i get home open it up and obviously this journo was short of something to do in july because there is not a lot of shooting going on but she was obviously a fan of jive dancing and we do jive dancing weekends at pontins and sure enough she had gone down to camber sands and there was a whole article in the field i mean how on earth do you get pontins in the field i was completely oblivious to the whole bloody thing they didnt ask it was a very good article but im not sure if it is our target market i have to say
6585157 will deliver innovative solutions for the future challenges facing the auto industry
6585158 guarantor for securing the interests of all stakeholders of continental
6585159 i can confirm we are interested and involved in the process
6585160 a good level of interest particularly from a wide range of private equity companies
6585161 our preference would be to sell as overall one unit but at the end of the day well do what maximises shareholder value
6585162 if that requires selling it in pieces were prepared to do that
6585163 consumer magazines and their publishers have not really got their arms around the internet yet
6585164 but business to business groups have been a lot more successful reed has done particularly well in terms of moving print into online and face to face events as well
6585165 my mother was not remotely like that so for me its a glamorous romantic thing
6585166 i love the way its very feminine and i find a strength in that femininity
6585167 the cupcake is a real symbol of femininity and a camp symbol of a bygone era
6585168 anything which is very personal and behind closed doors and pleasurable for women is subversive these days
6585169 was to signify that there is nothing bossy or hectoring in my brand of domesticity the type of domesticity that i know so many women and a few men enjoy
6585170 i think it is a reaction to 1990s ladette culture and the sense of androgyny around that i dont like the idea that we are exactly the same as men i think it is damaging to womens self respect
6585171 i was really interested in the return of ideas like going for tea and cake and all this stuff that was considered twee for my generation girls in their 20s all my friends its a cultural shift almost a movement many people are fascinated by retro ideas i have always been fascinated by the postwar mentality
6585172 its coming back to something with a bit more value when everything today is so fast and technology is so advanced
6585173 its every womans choice if she wants to do these things
6585174 and i never want to judge another woman for the choices she makes and what gives her pleasure but there is something more serious going on here there are problems associated with domesticity because in the past there was the assumption that it was just what women did for a long time we have been saying to men you can do it just as well as we can but if we fetishise the frilly apron and the domestic goddess and the cupcakes then its much harder to say to men come and join us too
6585175 young women dont understand how hard it can be doing this real work if you dont have equality at home a lot of the freedoms and equalities women have won are quite fragile and at the moment we are in danger of moving backwards we have to continue to encourage men to join us and not exclude them
6585176 people think im an idiot and have no interest in feminism for me its about reclaiming traditional values and still being able to call yourself a feminist thats how i class myself but still people say how can you say that when you like to bake cakes but i dont like having rules and i dont like the idea that you cant do something because its un feminist weve been socially persuaded into being embarrassed about our femininity and now we want to embrace it
6585177 to me its not drudgery i will happily sit there for hours decorating the cakes its not a chore for me we love the big flouncy dresses we love seeing peoples reactions to the cakes its just a nice little thing that brings us joy
6585178 its about being allowed to be ultra feminine i think there is a real beauty about that time the 1950s because its so far removed i love looking at photographs of my grandma and what she wore at the time
6585179 there is a whole community of women out there who are into this scene reclaiming baking sewing and knitting its a choice and an aesthetic it links into environmental concerns and is a sort of a rebellion against consumerism i see it as a very empowering thing to do as a woman
6585180 thats why it can be seen as quite subversive because youre doing it as a single woman its for yourself i dont think men expect this stuff any more at all they are not involved in it its a very female led thing my boyfriend doesnt really understand he says what on earth do you do at the wi he has no idea and id much rather keep it that way
6585181 as facilidades de pagamento parcelado e a queda de pre o dos computadores fizeram com que o com rcio eletr nico tivesse um crescimento relevante no ano at aqui por conta da entrada de novos consumidores na web principalmente da classe c
6585182 the canadian public broadcaster has a responsibility to transmit world classical culture to new generations of canadians
6585183 they are substantially moving away from that responsibility they falsely assume that world classical culture is not something that can be marketed to appeal to younger audiences
6585184 por que as leis na natureza s o dessa forma keller incentivou esse tipo de discuss o
6585185 em todo processo f sico h uma seq ncia de estados um estado precedente uma causa para outro estado que seu efeito e h sempre uma lei f sica que descreva esse processo
6585186 a ci ncia nos d o conhecimento do mundo e a religi o nos d o significado
6585187 e se a ci ncia tem a capacidade de atrair algo esse algo inexoravelmente existe
6585188 i think thats got a lot to do with it
6585189 hopefully i can talk to people but i dont get intimidated by people i think growing up i learned that you know you can talk to absolutely anybody no matter where they come from
6585190 ooh i dont know that it is thats really interesting ive never really thought about that properly i dont know that it does because people like me tend to go into newspapers
6585191 ooooh really the chrisabels are taking over oh no no no no no oh we dont like that
6585192 i dont know its something i havent really thought about
6585193 theres that thing of an awful lot of people coming through now where its all about looks and style and no substance
6585194 i think with me i was lucky because my boss at tv am was a real newspaper man and what he wanted on the sofa was a terrier he wanted somebody who could do the job without being threatening but who could still have the credentials because id had all those years out doing piper alpha and lockerbie and prison riots and always got my story always always always id go to the end of the earth to get my story if a day went by and i wasnt on the bulletins that was a failure i had to have something on every day and i worked my arse off i really did
6585195 i could not do this job without all that experience of course one minute im talking about flowery fashion or whatever but then in your ear you will hear there has been a train crash or a bombing or something and instantly you have to go
6585196 right and you go into that mode and thats your job thats what you do
6585197 i mean its fantastic to get to go and talk to george clooney
6585198 oh no no no no no no not at all
6585199 see to me news is news and it doesnt matter whether youre talking about the scandal of whats happening in zimbabwe or youre doing something about the latest hollywood blockbuster its still news very different but its still news
6585200 im damn sure if somethings annoying me its annoying everybody else
6585201 its that kind of naughtiness isnt it watching telly in the morning
6585202 oh no because its a great way of communicating and informing
6585203 not my cup of tea dont like those shows and you know
6585204 ive been dipping in and out of big brother and i found it absolutely horrendous i found it really just people screaming and shouting at one another i found it quite upsetting i think weve definitely crossed a line
6585205 heat magazine really makes me laugh i love circle of shame
6585206 its just hilariously funny i always feel so sorry for those people who spend hours and hours getting ready and then theyve got a funny toe its ridiculous its ridiculous its just crazy
6585207 i love television im a tv addict love it love it love it love it love it absolutely love it
6585208 theres a bit too much hand wringing about that i think
6585209 i know its fluffy and mad and completely bubble headed dont care its so ridiculous but i watch it and say i would love miss jay to come on my show and teach me how to walk in high heels i love him its such funny daft great telly it really is well well done i mean rubbish can be great when its well done its good
6585210 ive always been very careful to say that as a mother we have a huge responsibility to our children we must not be on diets or counting calories or jumping on and off scales saying does my arse look big in this
6585211 and i find this whole thing of celebrities having their babies by elective caesarean and having a tummy tuck at the same time really very damaging i just think its just oooh it makes other women feel inadequate and thats not right its really bad that women feel theyve got to look like that
6585212 having said that i suppose youve got to take your hat off to somebody who lives off two raisins and a banana although it is mad it is mad
6585213 not once has anybody ever said to me this is what you have to wear or how you have to look
6585214 oh well i know exactly what you mean but i hope im the little voice in the wilderness saying this is mad
6585215 i always remember when we were doing the whole thing about paris hilton coming out of jail and we were buying into it because we were covering it as well and i always remember saying to our correspondent do you know what i would love is if all you guys put your cameras on the ground when she came out and all the paparazzi did as well wouldnt it be great wouldnt that be fabulous
6585216 i want all the people of the country to know if you gather as crowds and kick up a fuss the military will shoot so as to hit the target it doesnt shoot into the air to scare people
6585217 many bodies were quietly cremated so that there was no evidence of the massacre
6585218 politics itself is so unsexy isnt it but when the politics in creative works are really explored not used as a vehicle the results can be really interesting
6585219 mate the only shower youll get is if you stand outside naked in the rain yelling howdoo to passers by
6585220 que es en realidad uno de los motivos para escribir esta nota seg n las entrevistas transmitidas por varios medios de prensa muchos de los familiares indicaron que a sus parientes no se les permiti abandonar el avi n luego de retornar en el primer despegue incluso los hijos de un fallecido mostraron un sms de su padre recibido poco antes del accidente
6585221 looks like you need to call so and so heres their number
6585222 all i needed was 5 cs to get into college
6585223 my dads really pleased he started crying when i told him
6585224 most of us felt that we were under more public scrutiny in the 1980s and that increased during the 1990s but it wasnt until labour came into power that education and health became the big political issues
6585225 from my perspective and this is very much my own perspective i would say that labour have lived up to their promises in that they have put significant amounts of money into education particularly into areas of the country where there are high levels of disadvantage
6585226 we worked out that if we could change the school ethos all the energy that teachers were putting in would be much more productive
6585227 i could take you to three schools within 10 minutes walk of here which are not some schools are awful
6585228 if i was to criticise labour policy my biggest criticism would be their obsession with individual schools and a competitive model
6585229 there comes a point at which you have to say ok we have now got a much better system professionals who are much better at their jobs lets pull back a bit from it lets see perhaps if we can get the same attainment with slightly less of relentless testing throughout their career but what politician would be brave enough to do that
6585230 we do not believe that it is in the interest of shareholders that kazakhmys should have a seat on the board of enrc
6585231 despite macro economic uncertainties we expect higher commodity prices to hold
6585232 we anticipate a very strong performance in the second half
6585233 this is a year of consolidation for hochschild and i am pleased to announce solid interim results
6585234 with a stronger than ever project pipeline i look to the future with confidence
6585235 our initial expectations about the purchase price have not been fulfilled
6585236 lone star has the solid basis to support the strategy of strengthening ikb as a leading provider of financial solutions for germanys mittelstand
6585237 these days there are fewer jobs due to stricter building regulations and the rising cost of materials
6585238 there have always been peaks and troughs in the construction industry but the peaks are much lower than they used to be and the troughs much deeper
6585239 we are trying to create a sense of community here its not all bad news
6585240 its a mans world all they have to look forward to is an evening meal of cheap grilled meat and plenty to drink and the freedom to sleep it off where they drop
6585241 i dont drink or smoke and the clothes im standing in cost less than 800 yen
6585242 ive never had a pair of shoes worth more than 1 000 yen
6585243 some people are working out of town but a lot have decided to sleep rough tonight
6585244 we dont allow any alcohol here so on a hot evening like this they prefer to drink outside and sleep in the park
6585245 we have a freedom that other japanese dont have we get three meals a day and its easy to make friends ive made lots of friends here over the years and ive seen lots of them die
6585246 more students were taking gcses early in november especially in english and maths and this meant fewer entries in this summers results students are focusing their efforts more tightly on a smaller range of subjects
6585247 ive spoken to a number of schools who are talking about a more flexible approach to years nine 10 and 11 about targeting different pupils with different levels of ability to move at different paces in different subjects its not uncommon now for some schools to be starting some pupils in some gcses in year nine to create more headroom in the last years of school to move on to a level
6585248 its driven by league tables because 31 is happiness to a school and 29 is abject misery
6585249 schools are focusing on quality rather than quantity it makes sense for students to concentrate on eight or nine gcses rather than 11 or 12 and to do them well
6585250 i particularly welcome the record results in english and maths and the sharp rise in entries in biology physics and chemistry the overall increase in pass rates and top grades is built firmly on improvements in the key subjects of english and maths
6585251 he started doing simple maths questions and puzzles at two
6585252 this highlights the serious error of judgment made by the government in may when it announced the national challenge creating such unnecessary damage to the reputation of many schools pupils and staff in national challenge schools have been placed under serious pressure and this must be matched by support
6585253 schools moving above and below the arbitrary threshold of 30 each year highlights the stupidity of putting a schools reputation at risk on the basis of a single years results
6585254 tarred by that brush that says you are a failing school
6585255 we have to live with it and get on with the job in hand were in the second most deprived ward in the country and we are being described as failures theres academic success but also other success in engaging kids that might not be engaged otherwise
6585256 as we said at the launch of national challenge many national challenge schools are improving fast with strong leadership and high aspirations national challenge schools will still be receiving extra funding help and support to help them continue to improve and sustain those improvements for the long term
6585257 shes doing better she couldnt even do this without ativan last couple of days if you push this button and talk she can hear you
6585258 i will i will pray that you can walk again i will pray that you can feel your feet again
6585259 ergo we the able bodied shouldnt care that a woman was abused and neglected and forced to crawl off a fucking aeroplane
6585260 weve delivered your food were sure its fine now pay up and get out
6585261 we know you have a short lunch break so well get you out of here in a timely fashion
6585262 we are non profit non partisan yeah right we believe that scientific objectivity must be scrupulously respected regardless of our political preferences
6585263 studies show that cold weather kills approximately ten times as many people as hot weather thus global warming will result in lower net human mortality
6585264 forget about trying to accommodate your industry to cap and trade
6585265 instead oppose attempts to limit burning oil and instead create energy abundance and relieve poverty
6585266 access to affordable energy enhances the quality and extends the duration of human life
6585267 we need a person staff at 911 because they are handling ems calls and law enforcement calls and i said that because the sheriffs department ran the dispatch for the county for ever
6585268 do i believe there should be law enforcement however they way the county legislature has decided to go we will maintain the course as they wish
6585269 got a lot of anxiety but im excited im up for the challenge
6585270 we didnt let her bring her car for that reason ya know the gas and her coming home the weekends and that we figured wed hold off from doing that until we see what happens
6585271 theres a bus from here to towanda which is very close to us
6585272 the books we still didnt get them all and weve spent up to 500 dollars already
6585273 basically keeping it down to things i absolutely need not going out and spending the money i dont have
6585274 im going to get a job to get some cash
6585275 promete caso reeleito aplicar o gatilho em janeiro de 2009 com data retroativa a julho
6585276 a lei de responsabilidade fiscal impede o aumento de despesas com pessoas nos seis ltimos meses de mandato
6585277 para o candidato petista ao pa o carlinhos almeida n o cabe a ele emitir ju zo de valor sobre a greve
6585278 se eu fosse prefeito teria feito um estudo jur dico e pago esse gatilho ou em julho ou se houvesse realmente o problema eleitoral daria em junho
6585279 a greve justa se o prefeito errou tempo de consertar se fosse o meu caso j tinha disparado o gatilho no m s de julho com certeza
6585280 n o houve greve tentaram parar mas n o pararam fiquei grato com a postura do servidor por ter entendido isso e n o ter aderido greve
6585281 when the centurion heard this he went to the commander and reported it
6585282 but our how do i apply for citizenship in heaven
6585283 no longer strangers and foreigners but ye are fellow citizens of the saints and of the household of god
6585284 you know that it has a direct connection of some sort with the automatic weapon pointing at your back
6585285 senator mccain should take the day off at one of his seven homes to consider whether his support for outsourcing tax breaks for companies who ship jobs overseas and continued spending of ten billion a month in iraq is really putting country first to us it sounds like just more of the same
6585286 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6585287 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6585288 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6585289 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6585290 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6585291 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6585292 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6585293 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6585294 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6585295 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6585296 who are open to doing something on the production side
6585297 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6585298 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6585299 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6585300 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6585301 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6585302 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6585303 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6585304 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6585305 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6585306 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6585307 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6585308 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6585309 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6585310 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6585311 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6585312 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6585313 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6585314 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6585315 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6585316 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6585317 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6585318 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6585319 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6585320 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6585321 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6585322 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6585323 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6585324 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6585325 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6585326 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6585327 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6585328 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6585329 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6585330 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6585331 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6585332 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6585333 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6585334 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6585335 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6585336 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6585337 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6585338 if you look at each year it increases sometimes and goes down sometimes
6585339 if offenders perceive a low police presence they may be more likely to try and offend
6585340 the odds of a law abiding springfield citizen who is minding their own business getting killed is next to zero
6585341 as the assault rate goes up we risk our homicide rate going up
6585342 i think the reason our homicides remain the same is because many people are bad shots thank god
6585343 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6585344 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6585345 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6585346 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6585347 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6585348 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6585349 omg stop being an idiot and go oot to the cinema wi insert name here but aye
6585350 have you engaged in any activities that might indicate that you may not be considered a person of good character
6585351 krystals dress is in china it got stuck at customs and we had to have the brother of demetrios handmake the dress himself he is sending the dress to dallas and we in turn we are overnighting it to you so you will have the dress by sat and the owner of the company is refunding you 165 00 which never happens
6585352 a grande white chocolate mocha with an extra shot of espresso please and whipped cream
6585353 ich bin zwar atheist aber bestechen lasse ich mich trotzdem nicht
6585354 zwar bin ich atheist aber trotzdem treibe ich keine unzucht
6585355 mein sohn ist sehr krank und k nnte sterben ich bin dazu gezwungen mich bestechen zu lassen
6585356 ich bin zwar atheist aber ich kann vergeben ich habe keine rachegef hle oder hass
6585357 i think theres a particular problem in the internet age with the kind of information that consumers are getting
6585358 this act of malicious duplicity reminds us that no one is completely immune to fraud
6585359 i dont think i want to go into every detail of what i did
6585360 we do not claim to visit every restaurant in our awards program
6585361 i didnt like refusing 70 year old bingo players entry because they didnt have their id with them that day when i knew their names and birthdates from memory
6585362 i understand you can dry it and burn it in the fireplace
6585363 when people tell me its a gateway drug and it leads to other things i tell them yes to a job with u
6585364 ill have an answer for you by the end of the day
6585365 even if its that we dont have the answer yet
6585366 nobody should avoid taking a statin because of concerns about cancer
6585367 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health
6585368 who right now may be afraid to eat uncooked produce
6585369 its one big step forward in improving the safety of fresh produce
6585370 we are currently doing extensive testing with irradiation and it looks to be very promising
6585371 its expensive and it doesnt really address the problem at the source

6585373 wir werden uns vern nftig auf das spiel beim tabellenf hrer vorbereiten
6585374 es ist schon so dass man eine dreist ndige fahrt nicht so einfach aus den beinen bekommt
6585375 und au erdem haben wir bis auf einmal gute erfahrungen damit gemacht wenn wir fr her angereist sind
6585376 ich werde mir schon noch die ein oder andere information ber den gegner einholen
6585377 aber inzwischen spielen ja eh fast alle mannschaften mit viererkette
6585378 die ottersberger werden als aufsteiger viel euphorie mitgenommen haben das kenne ich ja auch von uns
6585379 am vergangenen sonntag war es nur noch ein akteur dessen fehler zu toren gef hrt haben diesmal wollen wir es auf null spieler minimieren ich denke dass sich unsere mannschaft st ck f r st ck findet
6585380 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6585381 its not like we are wealthy people but theyll kidnap you for a watch everyone is living in fear
6585382 before they only kidnapped key well known economically successful people like industrialists and landowners now they are kidnapping people from the middle class
6585383 i have to take her with me if i want to go out i cant tell her dont come with me its rude i dont know wt to do
6585384 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6585385 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6585386 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6585387 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6585388 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6585389 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6585390 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6585391 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6585392 given that an investigation is proceeding weve got no comment to make
6585393 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost
6585394 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6585395 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6585396 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6585397 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6585398 und allahs ist das reich der himmel und der erde und allah

6585400 warum gibt es soviel ungerechtigkeit in der welt wenn es einen gott gibt
6585401 nun heute wird keine seele im geringsten ein unrecht erleiden und ihr sollt nur f r das entlohnt werden was ihr zu tun pflegtet
6585402 wenn es einen gott gibt warum bekomme ich dann nicht was mir gef llt
6585403 oh meine diener wenn der erste von euch und der letzte von euch und die geisterwesen alle das fr mmste herz von dem aller fr mmsten h tten das w rde meiner herrschaft nichts hinzuf gen oh meine diener wenn der erste von euch und der letzte von euch und die menschen und die jinn also alle menschen und geisterwesen vom ersten bis zum letzten tag alle das schlechteste herz von dem schlechtesten von euch h tten so w rde es meiner herrschaft nichts wegnehmen

6585409 ooh youre so lucky there were three other people here looking for it just now but coincidentally they all forgot their library cards
6585410 i think its part of a greater and broader investigation that is still ongoing
6585411 you gotta love this little block of la playa with its handful of shops so unobtrusively tucked away even the burger king is almost
6585412 you mean there is a subway around the corner and i have been eating nothing but greasy crap every night when we order out
6585413 provocative but upon closer inspection lacking depth and relevance to our times
6585414 we are not even in operation yet and we have been receiving phone calls from organizations such as fassy and kaushees place asking when we will open

6585419 i cant wait to come to australia and im trying to find a way to get down there because it sounds great and youre fun people
6585420 and one of my favourite cricketers in the world is from your way i am a huge fan of matty hayden
6585421 hes a cool customer out in the middle and i like his style
6585422 is he a batter or a pitcher and is he big in your country
6585423 its pretty humbling isnt it for an old fisherman and surfer in queensland who now and then plays a bit of cricket
6585424 cleveland steelworkers and usw members across the nation are saddened by the loss of congresswoman stephanie tubbs jones no one could stir a crowd quite like stefanie her life force was so strong that she could project it into a weary crowd and get them all on their feet yelling for more
6585425 we have these fake queues at front of 20 stores around the country to drum up interest in the iphone
6585426 for hundreds of thousands of australians this is the best news of their life and for many of those people had they been diagnosed with exactly the same cancer 20 years ago the outcome would have looked very different it continues to build australia as a leader internationally in cancer outcomes
6585427 he is still alive and hes in very poor condition
6585428 we had expert advice that the animal probably would not make it through the night
6585429 it was suffering extremely so weve had to make the very difficult decision
6585430 its a really tragic result from an operation that people worked really really hard for
6585431 theres no way that the logistics of feeding that animal by hand or in an aquarium is going to work
6585432 there are too many difficulties with it and the animal first of all has to be convinced to eat out of a tube its got to get to an aquarium and then youve got to find a product for it to eat which you can supply for probably a year so i think for humans to try and keep it alive is just going to end up as a disaster
6585433 there were four cookie cutter shark bites in it and that has most likely occurred while it was out in the open water its just another thing that compounds the whole problem

6585437 awesome and friendly staff here serving up great inexpensive organic coffees that are always fresher than i am in the morning even though
6585438 im leaving a few minutes early i can make it to peets for some legal speed
6585439 you know why i like peets because it lets me enjoy the drab homogeneity of a coffee chain without all the knee jerk condescension that comes with frequenting a starbucks
6585440 the combination of rapidly declining consumer confidence pressure on household incomes fuel price increases and emission regulations has resulted in the second hand car market being hit extremely hard in the first half of the year
6585441 highlighting the large gap between the expectations of vendors and buyers in the current market
6585442 the overall market was down 6 5 per cent or 33 000 units compared to 2007 levels this is the lowest number of second hand cars sold in a 6 month period since 2002
6585443 sales of repossessed vehicles on behalf of finance companies have been strong up 106 per cent year to date and the commercial business has undertaken more insolvency work
6585444 an extensive review of the property requirement for the group has been carried out resulting in some short term savings through amalgamation of branches or subletting properties
6585445 this has enabled the company to keep property costs in line with 2007 which is pleasing given the upward trend in commercial rents staff expenses are higher compared to last year due to the impact of legislative changes affecting holiday pay and the minimum wage
6585446 as indicated at the agm in april the company committed to investing in a repositioning of the turners brand with a large advertising and public relations campaign completed over the may to july period which has resulted in a significant increase in awareness levels
6585447 often imitated copied pasted and stolen from but never duplicated
6585448 differences in opinion over what role the chief executive should undertake
6585449 would you not be better off having a chairman president who leads the organisation who is elected every four years and can be thrown out after four years if the whole of the game does not want that person
6585450 im a huge football person and to have been chief executive of the fa is a special thing im proud to have been able to do the job the organisation has come on in leaps and bounds which is very important to me
6585451 such an important player to go at a knock down price
6585452 until the transfer market closes we do not give this matter up as closed the president ram n calder n has promised robinho that if the club is presented with an offer of 40m he will be allowed to leave
6585453 milan had wanted to take the player on loan with the right to buy him but chelsea said no because they wanted us to buy him outright
6585454 we remain determined to retain st phane mbia this decision i repeat is firm and final
6585455 i have been told arsenal are interested but my position is clear i want to start the season with everton im aware that my directors have declared i wont leave but its just a means to make my price higher i understand their position and i would do the same its politics
6585456 i dont want to play for rennes any more i dont worry because english clubs have the resources to sign me when they really want a player they are ready to spend whatever amount im hopeful it will be done by next week
6585457 there are always going to be people who say that were not progressing as fast as we should be
6585458 people expect progress straight away particularly when a manager of fabios quality comes in and with the quality of players we have but it just doesnt happen like that its step by step its about bonding together as a team as a unit and that takes time
6585459 we havent made wembley our home yet thats the biggest thing it feels like when were going there its tough we need to make it daunting for players and teams coming to wembley we will get there but its about getting the confidence up which will happen in the qualifiers im sure well get it right particularly against croatia because of the team mates i have around me and also because of the manager he thrives on challenges
6585460 its about qualifying first and foremost then we want to be peaking when we get there
6585461 far too often ive felt weve peaked in the qualifiers like a couple of summers ago but in the cup tournaments weve not really done the business
6585462 patience is the key things wont happen overnight its an 18 month campaign obviously we are making steps small strides and they might not be noticeable to the public but were feeling them as a team and were getting stronger this was half a pigeon step
6585463 if we qualify winning every game 1 0 with our backs to the wall well take it but weve got to control our performances and if we perform well 99 times out of 100 well get the right result ive never known a squad so hungry to get the campaign started
6585464 he had his reasons for leaving me out and said it to my face that he didnt think i was good enough that is his decision i have a chance now to prove to myself and everyone else that he was wrong i dont know why he said it i thought he was very hard for me it is a done deal i have moved on and i cant dwell too much about the past
6585465 it doesnt matter where we pick up points from but obviously it would be nice for me to win against villa
6585466 i would be lying if i didnt think that i had some great years at villa but it just ran out at the end
6585467 i never crossed martin oneill i was fined for saying that i didnt understand why they had got scott carson in now i know it all came as a big surprise and i expressed my surprise the manager took it very personally hes the manager he makes the decisions i will try my best to prove him wrong this is a new chance
6585468 one of the most unpleasant things that currently exist in the game
6585469 when you consider that the important league season has started and you get the same points for matches now as you do at the end of the season and so many teams are thinking about who is coming and who might be leaving im not saying it detracts from the football but its maybe not the right time for these things to be going on
6585470 its not a case of us finding a solution until a problem occurs while berbatov is still here he is still very much 100 a tottenham player
6585471 my message to them would be to remain calm dont worry it is a long season and there are plenty of games ahead
6585472 they should be aware that we are trying to strengthen up front but quite often the process of signing new players takes a long time we have a list of targets that we are working very hard on negotiations are always tough but we know our objectives and we are working towards them
6585473 lets say berbatov does play i think generally tottenham fans are no exception to any others
6585474 they support the team and if a player is on form if for example he was to knock in one or two goals then im sure that anybody who may have been booing him last week will soon be getting behind him and cheering him thats what its like
6585475 i am looking for a player with experience and gareth barry is one of the players we follow
6585476 ive heard from police always keep your garage door closed because thats the easiest way because someone can grab things from your garage
6585477 the last thing i expected for someone to come into the house
6585478 it was a positive discussion and we will now move forward together
6585479 i can confirm that we had a friendly and positive meeting and were moving forward
6585480 i think wayne rooney gerrard and the other players that are not in a perfect condition physically will be very important
6585481 the movement of rooney and the work that he does every game is very important
6585482 played not only because he can take set pieces and free kicks but because he plays well that is why for me he is in the team beckham terry ferdinand are all the same if they dont play well they will not play
6585483 at the moment the liverpool situation means he is not at his best
6585484 officially im in the last year of contract ive had preliminary talks and there has been interest from elsewhere but im captain of west ham and very proud of that and i dont see it being any different this season
6585485 maybe at times i am a bit too honest and at club level the manager is telling me not to defend too much to try and save some energy for when we are attacking
6585486 sometimes you just want to win the ball back and work hard for the team that is just how i play maybe it does affect my goal tally but hopefully i can learn and get better
6585487 me and steven were asked to play deeper behind jd defoe and i thought it went well given it was the first time
6585488 i just love going out there and playing to enjoy it hopefully we can improve and find the right solution to take the team forward to the world cup
6585489 we knew that before the game and its a shame that they scored both their goals from set pieces but the result was ok for us
6585490 i have probably only had seven days training since we came back from africa
6585491 but playing on sunday against newcastle in the premier league and on wednesday will have helped with the fitness hopefully i can get a few more games under my belt for my club and will be 100 fit for the world cup qualifiers
6585492 we have to take on andorra first then we go on to croatia and all the players cannot wait for that with what they did to us they embarrassed us a bit
6585493 we cant wait to get over there and beat them we want to pay them back
6585494 i dont think playing for england is a very enjoyable experience at the moment
6585495 players do want to play for england because playing for your country is the pinnacle of your career
6585496 when i started playing for england in the 1990s i did enjoy it but later in my international career there were times when while i wouldnt say you played with fear you did know that if things started to go wrong then the fall out from that was going to be very intense
6585497 we get the biggest crowds of any country for our friendlies but the flip side is that the intensity of being in the spotlight is huge we seem to be locked in a cycle of massive build up to the game massive downturn during the game after something goes wrong and a massive inquest afterwards
6585498 that inquest must be traumatic for all those involved and nowadays weve got players being booed when they come off and booed when they come on
6585499 you can go back to john barnes he was crucified on a number of occasions playing for england
6585500 i loved playing at wembley but the wembley crowd can be a difficult lot to play in front of at times players have been singled out for a long time but does it all come back to our overblown expectations maybe we need to take a step back and think about those expectations weve made one final in 80 years
6585501 theres a lot of behind the scenes politics with england
6585502 there are changes at the top changes of direction all the time there are so many issues its complex but i think we have got to look closely at everything we do and fabio capello has got to be given time to put his ideas into place
6585503 it will be interesting to see what capello does when sven goran eriksson first got the job he did get rid of a lot of the players over 30 he had a clean new broom at the time and that in itself gave everything a fresh feel and perspective
6585504 you switch the radio or television on and everywhere theres a phone in
6585505 everyones lambasted because everyones emotions are running so high so what was quite a promising performance up to half time became completely disastrous by the middle of the second half
6585506 theres huge pressure every time you pull on an england shirt so the question is how do we create an environment where players can go and express themselves
6585507 you can never take that pressure off the england players but maybe we can be more realistic about what can be achieved which way to achieve it and how quickly it can be done
6585508 the explanation of the failure is very simple the truth of the matter is that israel is losing the battle for world opinion because it simply has no desire to win
6585509 there was not any snow while i was there this time
6585510 the second half was a vast improvement on the first
6585511 he has been located this morning alive but in a very poor condition at the basin
6585512 theyll give it an overdose of anaesthetic by an injection
6585513 theyll do it as they can the ideal thing is for the whale to come close to shore but they might do it out on the water if they need to
6585514 the last thing we want is that the whale should suffer
6585515 the vets are saying he hasnt got long to go you should take action
6585516 the animal is suffering shark inflicted injuries is experiencing breathing difficulties and its flukes are hanging down
6585517 some people are very upset and some were very aggressive its a bit harrowing personally
6585518 theyve been calling me the worst names you can imagine including effing murderer which is a bit hard to take ive spent my life working with animals
6585519 but its understandable because theres a lot of community concern it says something about our attitude to the environment
6585520 while its got life its got hope he heard me singing and came over i looked at him and he was full of life he had a few scratches and cuts on him and i was a bit worried about his eyes
6585521 all he needed is a mothers milk there was hope another whale could pick him up and adopt him he could have at least learnt to swim with them and eat krill and plankton
6585522 well do an autposy on the what to work out what was wrong with it that may have led to its mother abandoning it
6585523 its very disappointing for me to miss the u s open ive always done well in this tournament
6585524 its a great inspiration to see so many high profile stars from hollywood and the hockey world come together for the inaugural festival cup presented by gmp capital trust in support of right to play
6585525 these actors and athletes understand that sport and play are critical tools to help children and communities in disadvantaged areas of the world build a healthier more peaceful future
6585526 i believe in the positive power of sport and play for children
6585527 in addition to keeping kids out of trouble and engaging them in a constructive activity sports teach children many lessons and values including teamwork and determination the festival cup is a great opportunity to help support the important initiatives of right to play
6585528 were proud to continue our support of right to play and honoured to be a part of this truly unique event designed to promote the benefits of sport health and fair play
6585529 together with hockey and hollywoods stars we look forward to helping raise significant funds and awareness for right to play through torontos first annual festival cup

6585543 we would have probably gone ahead of this maybe just getting a thousand iphones and giving them out
6585544 ive been eager for this title to release on blu ray
6585545 its one of our most beautiful and artistic films to date in typical celeste fashion yet is full of raw and hardcore sex scenes with industry favorites such as our own jana cova plus kinzie kenner and erik everhard
6585546 celeste has the amazing ability to capture sexual performances that our seemingly contradictions
6585547 lascivious liaisons is both intense and intimate fierce and passionate and it appeals to both men and women
6585548 while i admit to thinking jana cova was a major reason for the rating the levels of playful fuck for the buck and replay value also impressed me
6585549 lascivious liaisons was a solid combination of creative talent on both sides of the camera that many of you will find to be passionate energetic and very much appreciated so pick up a copy when it comes out fans of jana will probably want two copies given how lovely she looked on the cover as well
6585550 my desire was to emulate the innocence of the 1940s while exposing the kinky nature that lies beneath most things which appear too sweet to be true
6585551 growing up i remember hearing stories about how wonderful life was back then and how it was a different time a purer time i dont buy that any decade so thoroughly engulfed in war is bound to have a quite a few dark skeletons in the closet look at all the shocking hollywood scandals of the time starlets in the 40s could teach todays girls a thing or two about being bad scandals bad girls and words like lascivious are all about perception and who is doing the perceiving thats what im trying to show
6585552 what do you think is the most important legal issue facing the industry this year
6585553 ho ho that is so interesting id never thought of it that way before

6585557 the thunder and the kickstart are going to be a couple of devices that rim comes out with later this year that will probably look to compete more directly i think with the iphone and phones like that
6585558 yes its gorgeous and yes it has all of the great blackberry attributes but its very squarely aimed at enterprise given the price point
6585559 given early demand were seeing at launch weve already placed a back order with rim we have thousands coming
6585560 we believe businesses can use it as a very fast product in terms of adding applications and doing all the e mail and attachments and contacts that theyve done for years but as well it speaks to consumers in that it has a lot of multimedia functionality and as well the messaging

6585563 residents in the flint area dont know what to do when they lose their home or are at risk of losing their home

6585565 at the one stop housing resource center residents can find housing placement assistance and ways to keep that housing
6585566 all of the resources they need to get back on their feet and maintain that level of independence are available at our center
6585567 we will find housing for those who arrive at the center without a home but we offer so much more our goal is to ensure these individuals find long term housing

6585591 the raider organization the national football league and the world have lost a great man said raiders owner al davis
6585592 gene upshaws career successes as a professional football player and a union leader are unparalleled he is as prominent a sportsman as the world has known he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy we loved him and he loved us we will miss him our hearts go out to terri and the boys
6585593 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6585594 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6585595 gene was a true pioneer as one of the few african american leaders of a major union said shell on thursday
6585596 he was the equal of owners in negotiations and made the league a better place for all players playing alongside of gene was an honor and a privilege he was a pillar of strength and leadership for our great raider teams

6585610 i greatly look forward to the opportunity to raise the vital issue of the undocumented with the front running team for the oval office
6585611 undocumented irish people in america are in constant fear that they are going to be imprisoned these people are not criminals they are hard working people who pay their taxes many with their own businesses who just want to live a normal life
6585612 false hopes have been plentiful for the undocumented in recent years and there is a vital need to keep dialogue open with the americans
6585613 brian cowen went to the us in recent months promising to work on behalf of the undocumented irish in america i would like to know what follow up has been made by the taoiseach undocumented irish are becoming more and more disheartened as more and more false dawns pass by

6585619 we have some returning talent in key positions this year
6585620 returning young is a big key for us this year if we can keep the offensive line healthy we will be productive
6585621 i think we can equal what we did last year but i told them we werent going to be just preparing for next year were going to be a factor in this years championship and thats their goal and i think with the talent they have they should get better as the season goes and i think well be right there at the end like we did last year if not better
6585622 if we can get our passing going and run our offense shes the one the ball will go through first thing
6585623 at skyline we fully expect to be at the state championship game every year i dont know if we have the talent because were so young and untested but our expectations are to be in those games in november

6585678 whether we do it depends on our assessment and risk diversification

6585753 i suppose the conmen thought they would be an easy touch but it was such a crass attempt at fraud anyone could see there was something a bit odd as far as we know no one fell for it
6585754 this has happened because lists of company shareholders are easily available these days
6585755 there is no evidence that fundamental conditions are improving for customers or retail businesses consumer confidence remains low unemployment is rising and the housing market weakening
6585756 its hard to see what could produce the sales growth boost ons are reporting or their finding that smaller retailers are outperforming larger ones
6585757 should be taken with a pinch of salt given that the official sales data have been unusually volatile over the past few months
6585758 todays data adds little to the monetary policy debate the mpc has discussed the official data in great detail and it has found it inconsistent with the surveys and the fundamentals much like the mpc we recommend that the data be treated with extreme caution
6585759 in our view the committee is unlikely to cut policy rates if inflation outturns continue to surprise on the upside especially if the strength is driven from core components
6585760 in the minutes to the august mpc meeting the committee had noted official numbers somewhat at variance with the weak survey results for the second quarter of the year to june and we suspect that the mpc will maintain the assessment for july
6585761 youre not going to go and kill someone are you
6585762 we have been led to believe that there are still running assignments for us next year this is a small setback
6585763 a missed tackle a dropped pick a missed assignment all that comes into their minds when theyre thinking about making cuts so youve always got to perform to your best
6585764 being at the low end of the totem pole coming in ive just got to keep grinding
6585765 each year that i come in i feel like ive got to prove myself and play like its my last year its always an uphill climb for the free agent guy coming in youve just got to work your butt off and show what you can do
6585766 they understand that we can only keep 53 guys and that even though we have an eight man practice squad none of those guys are eligible because they all played last year so they understand that it is what it is so theyre just out here competing and doing the best they can
6585767 its a tragic end to a program that dozens of people have put their hearts and souls into
6585768 its clear the findings have some wider implications for anzs management of other non traditional businesses particularly in our institutional division
6585769 our research tells us the governments plans would have significant and unintended consequences for business we dont believe the government intended to design a scheme to achieve the outcome of businesses and jobs moving offshore but that would be the outcome of the governments plans
6585770 we want to ensure that industry plays its part but that the cost is kept at a level which allows them to stay in australia rather than move to a less demanding jurisdiction
6585771 at the end of the day weve got to understand there is not a bottomless pit of money here
6585772 serious questions need to be raised why the government should transfer billions of dollars of taxpayers revenue to businesses who have known an emissions trading scheme was coming over a decade ago
6585773 we were inspired by the thousands of californians looking to weigh in and share their deeply personal stories we are thrilled that this website of the people by the people and for the people sits squarely at the intersection of easy to use technology and citizen engagement in politics
6585774 taking care of my son makes it extremely difficult to go anywhere now ive told my story my way free from politics and i expect to be heard
6585775 we know our patients have a hard time raising their voice so we wanted to help them we recorded 10 videos and uploaded them
6585776 we do a blood draw a complete blood count to make sure all their organs are working good
6585777 the way we overcome that is to reinforce them immediately for staying with us for getting their needle poked
6585778 its really important with an animal like this you cant force them to do anything so anything that needs to be done to take care of them has to be done voluntarily
6585779 you kind of treat them like theyre your puppy or kitten or something like that of course theyre not theyre much dangerous than that
6585780 hes young hes got a funny name hes not patriotic
6585781 im young ive got a funny name and im not patriotic
6585782 the fall in business investment was worse than anticipated it confirms that businesses are being forced to retrench in the face of the economic slowdown
6585783 todays figures support the results of the bccs quarterly economic survey the worsening economic pressures emphasise the need for the mpc and the government to take the correct measures to counter the threat of recession
6585784 it is not only households who are struggling businesses are also finding it difficult to acquire external sources of finance as credit conditions remain tight the environment for investing is deteriorating
6585785 one in five appeals are successful this clearly shows that appeals provide a vital safety net
6585786 we must ensure that the process is of the highest quality and that it is subject to effective judicial scrutiny
6585787 if the low numbers of asylum seekers to the uk were the result of the world becoming a safer more peaceful place then we would have something to celebrate
6585788 as it is we have real concerns that people who need our help and protection are not able to get here to access it we need to ensure that our borders remain open to refugees who are in fear for their lives
6585789 gas and electricity are essential commodities which have now become a luxury many cannot afford the government needs to provide a strategic regulatory environment to ensure the lights stay on at an affordable price
6585790 the government must seize control of this escalating crisis and take immediate action
6585791 this proposal offers to put more money in the pockets of poorer consumers by reducing their outgoings and providing for weekly budgeting to avoid debt
6585792 we are deeply concerned about the effects of household price rises on hard pressed families and other vulnerable people
6585793 we reached an agreement with them to treble the amount they spend to help the poorest this will provide an extra 225m over the next three years and could help 100 000 households who struggle to keep their homes warm in the winter
6585794 it was the right decision to sell the bank as quickly as possible
6585795 it comes in a packet at the beginning before school starts
6585796 i see that as wrong i say just leave the kids alone and let them get education
6585797 if mom says i need to tell you about this you can sit with your kid and talk about this
6585798 the publisher should have put something else in there like go get a physical somewhere for basketball or football or something not here come here and get abortion counseling
6585799 material will not be distributed or posted unless it has been approved
6585800 again this publication is created as a community service by the shopping news its been created for 16 years what we did this year is the same as all the years

6585803 i had a lot of problems with the mega164 family chips and jtag it just does not work if the ribbon is longer than about 150mm
6585804 when i first got the letter i got that excitement at first you know but then reality hit that it would be pennies from heaven
6585805 im so glad that i was skeptical and decided to look into it because as disappointed as i am now it would have been overwhelming if i had found out after i cashed the check
6585806 theres even a number you can call that was provided in the letter when i called them and asked about the stop payment they referred me to a supervisor who i couldnt get a hold of and they never called back
6585807 i called back later on and asked if this was a scam and they hung up on me so i reported them to the fbi
6585808 particularly for people who may not be as savvy because the check i received was real drawn from a real bank wells fargo
6585809 wal mart had no knowledge of the program or any possible scams concerning j c financial group but were opening an inquiry and forwarding it to our forgery department
6585810 if i say something im going to get in trouble
6585811 basically the unfortunate fact of the matter is that with these personal pre paid cell phones no name or really any information is required for registration which would make it ideal for any scammers purposes
6585812 gt senate candidate dave renzi a republican running for the 48th district senate seat stands outside the route 104 entrance to suny oswego thursday prior to unveiling his three fold economic plan for the area
6585813 certainly one of the top priorities of my senate candidacy should i win would be to push hard for that fourth nuclear power plant
6585814 what were hoping to try to create is to make our district really an energy corridor for the rest of new york particularly in this time our country is so dependent on foreign oil
6585815 so many of our youth are leaving every year and we got a fantastic learning institution here we need to make sure that that is somehow connected to the energy industry
6585816 the burdens that have been placed on those are tremendous the biggest hurdle we need to overcome of course is the tax burden and the red tape small business has had to overcome year after year
6585817 were not getting our fair aid back from the state of new york
6585818 every year our voice is being diminished in the senate
6585819 what theyve been doing is putting the burden on the hard working men and women of the district and we havent had a voice

6585823 the real experts the people who fight to save money and energy costs every day
6585824 many folks who are scared to death of the cost of living especially when they receive their heating bills
6585825 if it helps take away some of that fear and if it helps them get through the winter
6585826 we honor their community spirit and thank them for their help

6585840 to the extent of making it clear to mohamed that the united kingdom government would not help him unless he cooperated fully with the united states authorities
6585841 the relationship of the united kingdom government to the united states authorities in connection with mohamed was far beyond that of a bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing
6585842 as he will not be able to try to establish the only answer he has to the confessions namely that they were involuntary and abstracted from him by wrongful treatment
6585843 however unfortunately when faced with the choice between the rule of law and upsetting its allies the americans it waivers in this commitment
6585844 for strong reasons of national security to which the court accepted we were entitled to give the highest weight we could not agree to disclose this information voluntarily

6585854 i was in the bathroom and i saw the body falling through the air i live on the third floor and i saw the shadow of the body falling i didnt see him hit the ground but i went to look outside because i heard the crash and looked out and saw the body lying there he was facing towards the sky but his eyes were closed there was another boy standing over him saying oh my god hes dead hes dead
6585855 he ran away from the group and he went up the stairs and he got to the 12th floor and was climbing down a man who was looking out of his window said the boy got to the eighth floor and then they were banging on his hands they banged his hands to make him fall to make sure he lost his grip
6585856 there was a boy lying on the ground and a group of boys were crying one of them was on the phone saying theyve pushed him off the 13th floor the paramedics were trying and trying to resuscitate him they really tried
6585857 ive spoken to his family and they are most proud of the fact that he got a c in maths and a c in science he also got two other c grades
6585858 he was just a boy he was loving and caring and he got along with everybody it didnt matter who you were he would talk to anyone
6585859 he was so excited to get his results and he spoke about them all the time and how he was going to college in september
6585860 we dont know where he was going but we assume he was there at the wrong time at the wrong place he fell but thats all we know
6585861 he was like my brother i was at my house with a mate when he gets a call and said ahmed just got dashed off the block
6585862 i came down and i saw him lying on the floor it was horrible he was a good guy he didnt smoke at all or anything like that he took life seriously hes even scared of heights one time we couldnt even get him to climb over the second floor

6585869 consumer magazines and their publishers have not really got their arms around the internet yet
6585870 but business to business groups have been a lot more successful reed has done particularly well in terms of moving print into online and face to face events as well
6585871 we have been led to believe that there are still running assignments for us next year this is a small setback
6585872 the enduring appeal of film continues to be even more pronounced in times of economic uncertainty and we feel confident that the strong line up of films in the second half will drive admissions particularly in the fourth quarter
6585873 i think thats got a lot to do with it
6585874 hopefully i can talk to people but i dont get intimidated by people i think growing up i learned that you know you can talk to absolutely anybody no matter where they come from
6585875 ooh i dont know that it is thats really interesting ive never really thought about that properly i dont know that it does because people like me tend to go into newspapers
6585876 ooooh really the chrisabels are taking over oh no no no no no oh we dont like that
6585877 i dont know its something i havent really thought about
6585878 theres that thing of an awful lot of people coming through now where its all about looks and style and no substance
6585879 i think with me i was lucky because my boss at tv am was a real newspaper man and what he wanted on the sofa was a terrier he wanted somebody who could do the job without being threatening but who could still have the credentials because id had all those years out doing piper alpha and lockerbie and prison riots and always got my story always always always id go to the end of the earth to get my story if a day went by and i wasnt on the bulletins that was a failure i had to have something on every day and i worked my arse off i really did
6585880 i could not do this job without all that experience of course one minute im talking about flowery fashion or whatever but then in your ear you will hear there has been a train crash or a bombing or something and instantly you have to go
6585881 right and you go into that mode and thats your job thats what you do

6585889 ive been dipping in and out of big brother and i found it absolutely horrendous i found it really just people screaming and shouting at one another i found it quite upsetting i think weve definitely crossed a line
6585890 heat magazine really makes me laugh i love circle of shame
6585891 its just hilariously funny i always feel so sorry for those people who spend hours and hours getting ready and then theyve got a funny toe its ridiculous its ridiculous its just crazy
6585892 i love television im a tv addict love it love it love it love it love it absolutely love it
6585893 theres a bit too much hand wringing about that i think

6585895 ive always been very careful to say that as a mother we have a huge responsibility to our children we must not be on diets or counting calories or jumping on and off scales saying does my arse look big in this
6585896 and i find this whole thing of celebrities having their babies by elective caesarean and having a tummy tuck at the same time really very damaging i just think its just oooh it makes other women feel inadequate and thats not right its really bad that women feel theyve got to look like that
6585897 having said that i suppose youve got to take your hat off to somebody who lives off two raisins and a banana although it is mad it is mad
6585898 not once has anybody ever said to me this is what you have to wear or how you have to look
6585899 oh well i know exactly what you mean but i hope im the little voice in the wilderness saying this is mad
6585900 i always remember when we were doing the whole thing about paris hilton coming out of jail and we were buying into it because we were covering it as well and i always remember saying to our correspondent do you know what i would love is if all you guys put your cameras on the ground when she came out and all the paparazzi did as well wouldnt it be great wouldnt that be fabulous

6585924 its sad and disheartening to watch prepubescent girls dressed up like women as part of a state sponsored program by the chinese to blatantly cheat and break the rules
6585925 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6585926 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6585927 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6585928 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6585929 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6585930 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6585931 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6585932 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6585933 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6585934 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6585935 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

6585944 resisting hegemonies race and sexual politics in nation region empire
6585945 because of the special need in cincinnati to address racial sexual and gender inequalities
6585946 the historic democratic presidential campaign also made it important to focus on race and gender politics
6585947 i recall the excitement of second wave feminism even as a high school student who started a womens liberation club and went to my first feminist conference at temple university when i was in high school
6585948 as someone who created and or grew three womens studies programs and a campus womens center since the 90s i would say we have come a long way in a relatively short time in terms of the institutionalization of the field and such centers
6585949 even as feminist scholarship in most disciplines has ballooned and become a central and considered cutting edge mode of inquiry
6585950 so much volunteer struggle bearing so much high level scholarship program development and interdisciplinary legitimization
6585951 it is important to note that womens studies is also recognized for cutting edge feminist pedagogy that was the mother of what is called today participatory learning service learning and interdisciplinary learning
6585952 it is also the case that there is still a ways to go in terms of institutional support within the academy commensurate with the importance of the field to transforming so many other disciplines and education and support services more generally
6585953 in fact we are finding that prospective graduate students are seeking us out on the basis of these strengths even though we do not offer the phd but only the ma
6585954 the recent nwsa conference here in cincinnati gave us a real opportunity to showcase our faculty and students academically and also to recruit future students to the ma program it also allowed people to experience what cincinnati has to offer the city and the university are now significantly improved over the boycott days of six or seven years ago
6585955 it is the primary reason i have stayed in cincinnati rather than moving on
6585956 not only does muse perform choral music of high quality but the choir functions as a kind of objective correlative for progressive folks in cincinnati
6585957 in a relentlessly corporate run republican city muse represents the left at its best it is also a place where a diverse group of lesbians and straight women and others who do not choose to identify either way coalesce around music and social justice and friendship muse strives to create an intimate direct connection with our audiences we have our loyal longtime supporters and are always working to expand our audience base through different repertoire choices our music director catherine roma is a person of unlimited vision and muses 25 year success has hinged largely upon her creativity and intensity

6585967 there are quite a few jewish people in the neighborhood like us theyre opposed to it too
6585968 to leave it up there is inflammatory scary it doesnt belong in the neighborhood
6585969 this is an aberration but its also a lesson to the kids theres still hatred out there

6585971 kingston gwen and gavin rossdale welcomed the newest member of their family
6585972 i believe the club has to diversify if we dont it wont survive in the cbd central business district
6585973 were trapped in a dead end street and i dont think ill ever see the mall re opened to traffic
6585974 combined with the state government tax on poker machine profits we simply wont survive another 10 years
6585975 were anticipating having a bottle shop and a tab on the ground floor if possible as well as space for arnolds lawyers and the conveyancers to replace the buildings that would be demolished
6585976 theres been extensive discussion with the council about the design and how it would respond to the streetscape
6585977 its the type of development we would want to encourage in central maitland
6585978 we would have a tour bus to take people out to the vineyards to morpeth to maitland gaol and pick them up again in the afternoon
6585979 we decided to do it and it just grew and grew
6585980 they came here to set up a school and thats exactly what they did within a day
6585981 it was that simple they arrived they had a room and they started to teach
6585982 the reason for their existence was to address needs in the community that were not being met
6585983 there was no school in lochinvar it was a small community on the edge of civilisation so the nuns were sent to address that need
6585984 they rolled up their sleeves and worked among the people
6585985 kevin heard about it and i liked the idea so we all decided to get involved
6585986 we want to raise as much money as we can for oxfam
6585987 weve had a lot of donations from friends family and businesses
6585988 overall they made their usual statements that they arent going to do any harm
6585989 they didnt answer any specific questions other than to say were going to drill a well
6585990 they said they didnt think there was going to be any impact on the water table or the brook according to their scientific studies and they didnt tell us anything we didnt already know
6585991 the crowd was angry because they felt they were pretty much being ignored
6585992 were confident about it not damaging the water supply but they arent yet
6585993 we want to work with them to get that confidence and thats why well use an independent expert
6585994 its recognition of the hard work and commitment that went into it by everyone involved
6585995 to be the winner theres great exposure that goes with that
6585996 it would be great to use that in the marketing to say that weve been the best in the hunter
6585997 i think all round despite the controversy from a community perspective a marketing perspective and an exhibitor perspective it was a fantastic event

6586003 we need to discuss why casinos are necessary and provide answers to citizens
6586004 the pattern was people in certain long term care facilities
6586005 what were going to do is a comprehensive sanitization and in fact dismantle the two production lines in question with external supervision to ensure that we can determine the source do some testing if in fact it is there
6586006 its essentially an unavoidable risk that people are taking and probably dont realize theyre taking whenever you have that much stuff going through one facility

6586025 the same people who are responsible for what happened in walkerton
6586026 if you download responsibilities to industry itself so that they would be self policing themselves that it would lead to greater problems within our food system
6586027 what were striving to do is actually do a more proactive role within the plant situation
6586028 as opposed to having our inspectors standing line by line theyll have a more oversight role within the plant itself
6586029 if that same mistake had been made in a small local abattoir or bakery or canning plant at worst youre going to kill off a few neighbours
6586030 not the be all and end all of food safety knowledge

6586034 my dads really pleased he started crying when i told him
6586035 most of us felt that we were under more public scrutiny in the 1980s and that increased during the 1990s but it wasnt until labour came into power that education and health became the big political issues
6586036 from my perspective and this is very much my own perspective i would say that labour have lived up to their promises in that they have put significant amounts of money into education particularly into areas of the country where there are high levels of disadvantage
6586037 we worked out that if we could change the school ethos all the energy that teachers were putting in would be much more productive
6586038 i could take you to three schools within 10 minutes walk of here which are not some schools are awful
6586039 if i was to criticise labour policy my biggest criticism would be their obsession with individual schools and a competitive model
6586040 there comes a point at which you have to say ok we have now got a much better system professionals who are much better at their jobs lets pull back a bit from it lets see perhaps if we can get the same attainment with slightly less of relentless testing throughout their career but what politician would be brave enough to do that

6586062 if you watch the film you will see a train wreck coming
6586063 he was a young man he did not know how to play that corporate game
6586064 the smothers brothers comedy hour the best of season 3
6586065 when i deal with tommy lying its easy to bring things around to the social or political level
6586066 the values like truth and honesty that i hold tommy accountable to are the same things we want to hold our leaders to that never goes out of date
6586067 theres a place for the one liners you hear on late night tv theres a place for political humorists like bill maher theres even a place for the dirty stuff on hbo or the sophomoric humor of howard stern though i personally cant stand that
6586068 but we have always preferred a gentle form of subversion we think comedy should have serious content and a social context but if something needs to be said dont hit people over the head with it
6586069 i always say that today would be a great day to die because im still alive
6586070 one of the unique factors is that it is the only one negotiated between the two parties as opposed to the employer imposing it
6586071 they do that in other provincial jurisdictions but the unions havent agreed to it its been imposed
6586072 if they refuse at the first job site they would be tested at every job site they go to
6586073 a huge sweep that has nothing to do with intoxication or impairment and is nothing but a fishing expedition into workers lifestyles
6586074 we know of no drug test that will actually test for impairment
6586075 you can consume drugs hours or days prior to a drug test and still test positive
6586076 theyve been pre access testing for 10 years for major industrial projects in alberta
6586077 i think it would be a little naive to think that all the workers came to the door and demanded this something was conceded in order for the employer to achieve this result
6586078 write it off on the basis that it was mutually agreed to
6586079 you signed the contract youll just have to deal with it
6586080 oh by the way well just drop you off in town have fun come back in 9 hours and well pick you up

6586084 so there are drafts and there have been drafts for the last few weeks
6586085 you have so many other preoccupations but thank you for making the time to visit us
6586086 secretary rice was scheduled to lead a delegation to the closing ceremonies of the olympics in beijing this coming weekend because of ongoing events around the world she is no longer going to be leading that delegation
6586087 through your political and national security committee your parliament and ramadan falls early this year what will you do if you cant get this done by december 31st
6586088 the main sticking points in fact are also the most delicate setting a timeline for american troops to leave and declaring whether american forces would be granted immunity from iraqi prosecution
6586089 discussions are ongoing we have made some progress in the recent days on an agreement with the iraqis but there is no final agreement yet we will continue to have these discussions with the iraqis
6586090 so its not a treaty so it would not require senate ratification or anything like that
6586091 its very premature at this point to say that we have an agreement
6586092 a flying visit to baghdad by dr rice which drew a scathing reaction from the anti us cleric hojatoleslam moqtada al sadr he accused washington of trying to pressure the iraqi authorities to bend to its will
6586093 we advise the arab leaders that iraq should return to the arab group the return of iraq is an essential goal
6586094 saad hariri the leader of lebanons parliamentary majority visited iraq last month lebanon named an ambassador to iraq two years ago but he died and a replacement has not yet been chosen there is an iraqi embassy in beirut the capital of lebanon
6586095 we call for opening up the debates the scope of discussion must be as broad and deep as the serious challenges we face as a nation we agree that vibrant debate is the heart beat of our democracy and our first amendment especially during an election year we recognize that smaller third parties and independents have traditionally played a vital role in our democracy including leading the charge for the abolition of slavery the womens right to vote and economic justice for workers and farmers we support opening up the debates beyond the two parties and the so called commission on presidential debates which is a private corporation co chaired by former chairman of the republican and democratic parties its time for our presidential debates to once again be hosted by truly non partisan civic minded associations
6586096 this highlights the serious error of judgment made by the government in may when it announced the national challenge creating such unnecessary damage to the reputation of many schools pupils and staff in national challenge schools have been placed under serious pressure and this must be matched by support
6586097 schools moving above and below the arbitrary threshold of 30 each year highlights the stupidity of putting a schools reputation at risk on the basis of a single years results
6586098 tarred by that brush that says you are a failing school
6586099 we have to live with it and get on with the job in hand were in the second most deprived ward in the country and we are being described as failures theres academic success but also other success in engaging kids that might not be engaged otherwise
6586100 as we said at the launch of national challenge many national challenge schools are improving fast with strong leadership and high aspirations national challenge schools will still be receiving extra funding help and support to help them continue to improve and sustain those improvements for the long term
6586101 its really important to link healthy engagement with environmental issues with promoting wellbeing in children
6586102 walking or cycling to school doesnt take as long as people think
6586103 however theres an awful lot more we have to do to make roads safer understandably parents have real concerns about traffic both the volume and the speed of traffic need to be reduced and were pressing the government to implement 20mph schemes in residential areas
6586104 we have to do something dramatic to address obesity climate change and the lack of freedom that children are suffering from children are becoming cotton wool kids and unless they have freedom they wont have the levels of fitness they need
6586105 in america just 12 of children walk to school here the figure is around 50
6586106 the day i drove them in i remember feeling as sick as a parrot and they were all sitting there chatting away not minding a bit my youngest was only five and i agreed with the school that it would be better to break him in slowly so i said id be back for him at lunchtime for the first few days but when i arrived the first day he was enjoying it so much he sent me home without him and it was all plain sailing from there
6586107 for my daughter there was almost a honeymoon period wed been expecting it to be difficult but when it happened it was all plain sailing at first
6586108 we were lulled into a sense of false security because the second half of the first term was a much rougher ride than the first and in many ways i would say even now a year on shes still settling down
6586109 more students were taking gcses early in november especially in english and maths and this meant fewer entries in this summers results students are focusing their efforts more tightly on a smaller range of subjects
6586110 ive spoken to a number of schools who are talking about a more flexible approach to years nine 10 and 11 about targeting different pupils with different levels of ability to move at different paces in different subjects its not uncommon now for some schools to be starting some pupils in some gcses in year nine to create more headroom in the last years of school to move on to a level
6586111 its driven by league tables because 31 is happiness to a school and 29 is abject misery
6586112 schools are focusing on quality rather than quantity it makes sense for students to concentrate on eight or nine gcses rather than 11 or 12 and to do them well
6586113 i particularly welcome the record results in english and maths and the sharp rise in entries in biology physics and chemistry the overall increase in pass rates and top grades is built firmly on improvements in the key subjects of english and maths
6586114 he started doing simple maths questions and puzzles at two
6586115 we are utterly resolute in our determination to support this new democracy of afghanistan
6586116 we wont relax our efforts to support and reconstruct afghanistan because we understand that what happens in afghanistan affects the rest of the world we are determined to work with the government and coalition forces to defeat the forces of terrorism
6586117 we have succeeded in winning back territory the longer term solution is that more power will be given to the afghanistan people
6586118 you are the heroes of our country you are the frontline against the taliban what you are doing here prevents terrorism coming to the streets of britain
6586119 this week we are celebrating the olympics where we have had great success people have been winning medals in areas where we have been breaking ground but this week also i believe that our olympic athletes and everybody else in our country will remember that you have showed exactly the same courage professionalism and dedication you make our country proud every day of the week every week of the year
6586120 it shows we do have support for what we are doing it gives us a sense of pride
6586121 plotting in the cabinet is not new it happens in afghanistan too
6586122 parents or pupils can google and with a series of mouse clicks open up their school work from any location in the world
6586123 its a real time system which has changed the dynamics at school pupils know that nothing is being hidden from their parents now
6586124 this allows parents to keep in touch and it means parents now come in much more informed at the annual parent teacher evening which has improved the quality of the consultation
6586125 things have moved on although there are meetings maybe one a term or more if there is a big event coming up we all communicate with each other by email so if you cant get a babysitter or youre a working parent you can still get involved
6586126 parental engagement did bring significant improvements in achievement but you have to make the distinction between parental involvement and parental engagement
6586127 supporting parents in their childrens learning that is what makes the difference in academic achievement
6586128 his theme is bahia its life its people its drama its struggle its mystery its poetry its loves the morena dark haired girls of itapo and the roses of april iemanj the sea goddess and the wind from the ocean the sailboat and the schooner the world of bahia
6586129 caymmis songs seem to exist of their own accord but the perfection of their simplicity attained through precision in the choice of words and notes is the mark of an exacting author
6586130 were all now discussing the best date for the release of the album
6586131 fuck you fuck you very very much cause we hate what you do and we hate your whole crew so please dont stay in touch

6586134 esa es toda la informaci n que van a obtener de m
6586135 quien me acompa e en el fortalecimiento de la econom a para la clase media y las familias obreras
6586136 quiero a alguien independiente alguien que pueda combatirme en mis ideas preconcebidas y desafiarme para lograr un debate enriquecedor en la casa blanca
6586137 el piloto les dijo que fallaba el motor izquierdo y que no
6586138 i wrote to the woman producer that no real film maker would allow himself to squeeze the madeleine as though it were a lemon
6586139 this is the age of gene hackman and barbra streisand there are no roles for them here
6586140 this small utility simply allows you to easily disable enable the messenger
6586141 that depends on how big fannie and freddie blow up
6586142 the problem is weve got questions we dont have answers
6586143 theres not protection for shareholders of common or preferred shares
6586144 even if any rescue effort gives a priority to the federal government that still makes fannie and freddie more solvent
6586145 while some companies will probably have some writedowns i dont think theres a widespread effect on the whole industry
6586146 it is up to our former wwe stars to do whats best for them as long as it does not effect our fans sales or wrestling we do not mind what goes on in their personal life
6586147 hmm i only wish that i could procure this beer for one sixth of its current price
6586148 what the hell are you doing were supposed to be leaving right now
6586149 i give unto thee a barful of shirtless canadian men
6586150 we will not serve you because the color of your jersey
6586151 how do you like it linda ya i thought so that hurts doesnt it
6586152 i didnt say i liked it i just meant that im never going to forget it
6586153 how bad can it be at 10 30am on a wednesday
6586154 giiiiiiirrrrrrllllllll where this at my man gotta get me one o these
6586155 our flight is late they say we are leaving at 8 30 but there is no airplane at the gate do you want to just go and well take a cab home
6586156 if the plane doesnt get there in 10 minutes ill go home but if its there then i will wait
6586157 but the plane isnt even here no way we are leaving 8 30
6586158 southwest turns planes in 20 mins if the plane is there in 10 you will be leaving at 8 30 promise ill wait text me if the plane arrives
6586159 what they wanted to do with me was take away my livelihood and everything else
6586160 and i dont think that is constructive for someone who is struggling to take away their passion away from them i feel very strongly about that
6586161 what i feel is the biggest lesson to be learned is that everybody does deserve a second chance or a third chance if you believe that they can actually come back and do some good
6586162 i promise that i will make it up to you so that i can proudly represent my country again as an equestrian rider
6586163 there was a time when i mean i was so far away from even dreaming this that this has happened that it was possible for me it involved so many other people than just me people that have supported me and stood by me and encouraged me to move on and be the best that i can be to show such great support in a time where it was so easy not to support me so i do think of them and thats where the tears come from
6586164 when you give people chances and allow them to come back from their mistake great things happen and im a perfect example you shouldnt give up on people and people can still do great things in their lives it doesnt matter whats happened
6586165 i really dont want to elaborate on that if you dont mind
6586166 i just won a gold medal the moments gone sorry
6586167 the reunion with dave was the greatest thing they could have done but why didnt they just keep mike one more time they just cant do the right thing by the fans i dont know why that band theres just something quirky to where they its almost like they wanna just push em the fans as far as they can and see if theyll still come back
6586168 being at school is not just about what you do between 9am and 3 15pm its about acquiring the skills to go into society its about widening horizons and showing children they can be a chorist or a scientist
6586169 we want happy self confident children because they are motivated and can achieve more
6586170 by offering after school activities our children get the chance to succeed in a different area then they can take success and use it to overcome barriers in the subjects they find difficult
6586171 it was commented that we have children with high self esteem and who are confident because of our extra activities
6586172 clubs keep the children busy and active and healthy after school the children are safe they are engaged in learning and they are being supervised
6586173 they save parents worrying about children going home to an empty house or having to make alternative arrangements
6586174 we found she achieves a better quality of homework if she does it at study club rather than if she does it at home
6586175 at one point we were finding we spent all sunday doing her homework and it wasnt enjoyable for her or us now she does her research on the school computers and if she has a query she can ask the relevant teacher
6586176 they work together as a team develop friendships in other year groups and they will be competing in slovakia for britain
6586177 we offer a healthy breakfast and a wake up and shake up mini exercise circuit in the school hall with music and the children have a fantastic time
6586178 because the children want to go to the club and then they are here on time to start school
6586179 decent toaster dishwasher and board games with a capital grant
6586180 because parents wanted to start even earlier to be able to get to work on time
6586181 weve spent a lot of time setting up a little oasis where the children have healthy food and a calm start to the day and as a result they can concentrate harder work better and they are in school on time
6586182 im not going to lie we do not get along as soon as start talking to each other we dont get along
6586183 she made me look like a pervert on national television fucking bitch
6586184 this has happened since my name was announced this week
6586185 today hes been picking on me and i saw him picking on you its just been nasty comment after nasty comment
6586186 he was jealous of stuart maybe ive got it wrong but he liked you when you came in hes took it the wrong way and hes got a soft spot for you
6586187 its not my fault i had a crush on stu thats darnells problem
6586188 he was with a group of friends on the 13th floor when they became concerned about another group cycling towards the tower block they tried to leave the area and the victim became separated from his friends he climbed out of the tower block via an open balcony and reached the seventh floor where he couldnt carry on and fell to his death
6586189 i was in the bathroom and i saw the body falling through the air i live on the third floor and i saw the shadow of the body falling i didnt see him hit the ground but i went to look outside because i heard the crash and looked out and saw the body lying there he was facing towards the sky but his eyes were closed there was another boy standing over him saying oh my god hes dead hes dead
6586190 he ran away from the group and he went up the stairs and he got to the 12th floor and was climbing down a man who was looking out of his window said the boy got to the eighth floor and then they were banging on his hands they banged his hands to make him fall to make sure he lost his grip
6586191 there was a boy lying on the ground and a group of boys were crying one of them was on the phone saying theyve pushed him off the 13th floor the paramedics were trying and trying to resuscitate him they really tried
6586192 ive spoken to his family and they are most proud of the fact that he got a c in maths and a c in science he also got two other c grades
6586193 he was just a boy he was loving and caring and he got along with everybody it didnt matter who you were he would talk to anyone
6586194 he was so excited to get his results and he spoke about them all the time and how he was going to college in september
6586195 we dont know where he was going but we assume he was there at the wrong time at the wrong place he fell but thats all we know
6586196 he was like my brother i was at my house with a mate when he gets a call and said ahmed just got dashed off the block
6586197 i came down and i saw him lying on the floor it was horrible he was a good guy he didnt smoke at all or anything like that he took life seriously hes even scared of heights one time we couldnt even get him to climb over the second floor
6586198 the government should open up the youth club and get kids doing activities we used to get people coming from the other estates to go on trips and do things together that doesnt happen anymore none of us are interested in smoking and getting in trouble but weve got nothing else to do dont judge a book by its cover
6586199 just because we have had high immigration over the last 10 years doesnt mean that the next 10 years will be the same
6586200 as eastern europeans arrive asylum numbers fall and there is reduced demand for migrant workers we would expect the nature of migration flows to change
6586201 a lot of people come from the north chichester is a city of human scale you can walk about and its not so huge that youre just a face in the crowd plus there arent any nightclubs
6586202 of course they bring benefits but the cost of housing has gone up with so many people coming here who have made money from selling their properties
6586203 there are some places where people migrate to rather than retire from
6586204 the climate is excellent we have a wonderful coastal area its incredibly picturesque
6586205 we have come up with a scheme that will allow people a much longer period to plan and pay for their tickets
6586206 the increased risk of serious diseases is now well established
6586207 the drummer will be in a totally soundproof box as with other silent disco events the sound is amplified 100 through the headphones and not speakers meaning guitars and vocals wont be audible to the crowd
6586208 leuk verhaal alleen kloppen je bronnen niet over exacte getallen doe ik geen mededelingen maar ik kan je vertellen dat met een ros van 40 het een lachertje zou zijn wanneer we de resterende aandelen voor het door jou gesuggereerde bedrag zouden hebben verkocht bovendien gaat de multiplier niet alleen over 2007 maar eveneens over het boekjaar 2008
6586209 the days of assuming that older people are dependants must come to an end
6586210 the government must face up to the reality of an ageing population and make a firm commitment to improve health services like mental health and foot care which enable people to stay healthy and independent for longer

6586217 he was so good at giving the audience all the information they needed about welsh sport in such a short space of time
6586218 christmas eve was always a dangerous time with bob with the festivities starting around noon he was great fun to be around and we often met up for a drink at his favourite pub the dynefor arms
6586219 in my life id had just one puff of a cigarette when i was 10 and spent all of the following day throwing up punishment enough it seemed but no lung cancer was meant to affect those whod smoked cigarettes next to me in pubs all my adult life id always been in favour of the smoking ban in pubs a pity it was all a little late
6586220 basses are not usually designed to do anything but hold the root in order to hold it all together theyre not really known for being soloists
6586221 so i said im going to come up with something for that guy and from the moment i gave him that part his whole personality changed hes known for that one thing but that one thing changed his life 12 45
6586222 la m sica es una gran parte de mi alma
6586223 para nosotros es un orgullo que este torneo de bochas lleve el nombre de nuestro distrito realmente el de reci n fue un partido muy emocionante y muy bien disputado pero si hay algo que caracteriza a este deporte es la caballerosidad de los jugadores en estos lugares nunca vamos a necesitar llamar a la polic a por alg n hecho de violencia ni nada parecido

6586226 cuando la mujer le pide a su marido que le golpee la nalga
6586227 we urge parents to encourage their children to try the new school meals all children deserve the opportunity to have a hot healthy meal at least once a day
6586228 the children who are happy healthy and participating in the school environment are also children who are learning
6586229 jj knows all about eating five fruit and veg a day the different food types and the importance of exercising and ive also been in to taste the school dinners and i think theyve improved dramatically
6586230 we now have big square tables with pretty table cloths and all the children sit and chat and then clear their stuff away there is a very nice atmosphere and they behave fantastically well
6586231 good food supports performance and progress in terms of student development students can concentrate better and work harder in the afternoon if they have had a healthy dinner and we really see how nutrition underpins learning
6586232 we started out growing potatoes and now we grow carrots onions cabbages celeriac and soft fruit such as strawberries raspberries blueberries and gooseberries
6586233 i had students before who didnt know the difference between a pumpkin and a pineapple and now not only do they want to grow all their own food they want to cook it and eat it as well
6586234 truly fresh produce such as peas has a really different flavour to the canned or frozen variety
6586235 some of our students are so enthusiastic they are now growing strawberries on their bedroom windows
6586236 the behaviour of our students has improved at lunchtime they are more polite and show more respect for the school meal staff there has been a knock on effect across the whole school
6586237 and we need to keep looking at the wider picture to keep the motivation going
6586238 the conduct of the security service facilitated interviews by or on behalf of the united states when mohamed was being detained by the united states incommunicado and without access to a lawyer
6586239 all security service staff have an awareness of the human rights act 1998 and are fully committed to complying with the requirements of the law when working in the uk and overseas
6586240 do not participate in solicit encourage or condone the use of torture or inhumane or degrading treatment
6586241 to the extent of making it clear to mohamed that the united kingdom government would not help him unless he cooperated fully with the united states authorities
6586242 the relationship of the united kingdom government to the united states authorities in connection with mohamed was far beyond that of a bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing
6586243 as he will not be able to try to establish the only answer he has to the confessions namely that they were involuntary and abstracted from him by wrongful treatment
6586244 however unfortunately when faced with the choice between the rule of law and upsetting its allies the americans it waivers in this commitment
6586245 for strong reasons of national security to which the court accepted we were entitled to give the highest weight we could not agree to disclose this information voluntarily
6586246 the british government may have been accused of being bushs poodle but the british courts remain bulldogs when it comes to human rights
6586247 talking to people who could provide life saving intelligence is mi5s bread and butter
6586248 it endangered yourself and members of the public its maybe even worse however that you had your five year old child in the car
6586249 she appreciates that shes going to have to get some help for this because if not its going to kill her
6586250 were going to have about 90 plays scripted and its all going to be against our first opponent and it will try to entail every conceivable kicking situation that could could up in the course of a ballgame where players have to be alert on the sidelines davis said thursday
6586251 its something that we did last year and i think it kind of helps particularly when you have an inexperienced football team davis said i guess its maybe kind of somewhat the next best thing to an exhibition game in the nfl a preseason game
6586252 but ive been very pleased with the job that bryon bishop has done i think that alan pelc has done an excellent job youll probably see both of those guys play you may see alan go over and play a little bit on the right side hes elevated himself that you would say hes in the top six seven eight guys right now
6586253 right now the only real struggle that weve had has been with charlie brown he said
6586254 charlies had a really slow time getting over this ankle injury and as a corner you really have to be able to run 100 percent theres no way you can go out and play in a game and you cant really practice less than 80 90 percent so were a little bit slow there for the most part weve been happy with what jordan hemby has done with what kendric has done tavorris jolly has done a very nice job so i think were making some progress
6586255 whether its an onside kick a kickoff a short field goal an extra point whoever gives us the best chance to make that play work thats whos going in the game davis said
6586256 we could use more than two kickers in a game whatever it takes because each one of them now has something that they do well
6586257 the one thing that no one can answer is how will they will react when there are 65 000 people in the stands and mom and dad are there and if they miss the kick we lose the game theres no way to project that
6586258 we were able to escape any serious injuries he said
6586259 we are so thin as a football program from the standpoint that weve got some guys who are experienced coming back from last year but as far as the depth that you really need to withstand a lot of major injuries were not there as a football program yet
6586260 aggressive and intelligent cops whose sole purpose is to take down the player quickly and by any means necessary
6586261 your article on zillow com completely ignores the fact that you simply can not estimate a propertys market value given the limited public information available such as the age of the home location number of bedrooms or bathrooms or square footage many factors such as whether it has been remodeled the desirability of the floor plan proximity to schools street appeal etc have a huge impact on market value only an experienced real estate agent or appraiser taking all factors into consideration can provide a property owner with an accurate estimate of a propertys value i have seen many instances where zillow coms valuations are 50 or more inaccurate with many of their valuations appearing to be almost random
6586262 actually i think youre ignoring the third section of the article where i discuss this

6586292 this album provides a connection and an escape and its guaranteed to make your booty shake and your head bang its greasy slimy and soupy yet still very slick and shiny at the same time
6586293 the last record was a straight up party but we always said the second would be sweaty rock n roll music
6586294 the album title and imagery transport the listener into a dire life or death situation each song unites that urgency with a danceable beat so get to steppin or youll be extinct
6586295 we encourage fans to dress up in costumes whether it be a killer whale a big chicken or a skeletor outfit
6586296 family force 5 realizes that most people think rock n roll is about trying to be cool but to us theres nothing cooler than when people let go and end up stealing the show by break dancing in helmets or body slamming each other in lucha libre masks

6586301 we can confirm billy joe saunders has received a letter from the amateur boxing association suspending him pending a hearing
6586302 my focus over the next 48 hours is to prepare my three boxers for their semi final bouts tomorrow the allegations made in the media about the conduct of athletes on the british boxing programme are on the whole unfounded
6586303 i feel extremely disillusioned that i have learnt of the suspension of one of my boxers from the media i have three boxers who are fighting to win gold medals and i will not allow anything to distract my lads from what they need to do in the ring
6586304 the amateur boxing association choosing to yesterday issue billy joe saunders with a suspension relating to an incident which happened months before the beijing olympic games is extremely disappointing
6586305 the release of these allegations at this time could prove detrimental to the critical preparations of the other three boxers who will be contesting to reach the final of the boxing competition
6586306 we are frustrated that our athletes and the boxing coaching team will have to deal with this distraction at this point in the games nobody involved with boxing should be distracting the team at this time
6586307 i hope this matter does not overshadow what has been a fantastic games for the british olympic boxing team it is our best olympics for more than 30 years since 1972 and could be even better if one of our boxers win gold

6586309 the evidence we have heard during this inquiry can lead to only one conclusion that whatever short term fluctuations occur and whatever regulatory action is taken in the uk to improve the functioning of the energy markets as the minister of state for energy malcolm wicks recently stated the era of cheap energy is surely over
6586310 once we were informed of the positive finding our first reaction was to work out how it had come about
6586311 we established it was contained in a product called equiblock which denis uses commonly his preparations have been no different to anything he has done in any previous competitions it seems to be an extremely severe punishment that he is not allowed to jump given that he has been tested before without any problems

6586316 im really looking forward to london were going to use this experience and hopefully be challenging for the medals in 2012
6586317 i was pleased with my last dive and i was pleased with my first dive as well because it was an armstand and youre always a bit more nervous on your first dive than the other dives you can be a bit wobbly but my handstand was fine and it was the best i did in all three rounds so i was pleased with that
6586318 im really pleased with myself i was in the semi which i was proud of and then i made it to the final i was 12th in qualifying so i just came out here and enjoyed myself and thats what ive done im not just an olympian im an olympic finalist

6586321 its the only way to find out whats really going on
6586322 it was not like that i didnt lose my motivation today quite the opposite i knew i had done all i could and that i could win if i played better than i have ever done before
6586323 in the early games i wasnt so sure about myself or our chances of progressing and when you are not so certain of what you can do you do shout more maybe you are trying to convince yourself
6586324 but today i felt very calm and i knew that there was only one thing i could do it was to play the best i could and i can assure you that was what i did
6586325 we are quite new to this game and the americans we faced are great players they have a great legacy and we are catching up but i think we will be better in the next olympics in sport all you can do is fight as hard as you can we just had to accept that we were against the better players but that was only after the game was over
6586326 that it was impossible to believe they have been playing the game for just a few years in london in four years time i know they will give anyone in the world as much as if not more than they can handle they are coming on so fast

6586328 this negative campaign ad is clearly express advocacy and under a federal law passed in 2003 the bi partisan campaign reform act known colloquially as mccain feingold it cannot legally be paid for with corporate money including those of a non profit
6586329 the ad indisputably concerns an election takes a position on the character and fitness for office of a candidate and raises no legislative issue even this highly skeptical supreme court would turn up its noses at the foul odor emitted by this clear abuse of federal election law
6586330 susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate
6586331 the ads focus on a legislative issue take a position on the issue exhort the public to adopt that position and urge the public to contact public officials with respect to the matter second their content lacks indicia of express advocacy the ads do not mention an election candidacy political party or challenger and they do not take a position on a candidates character qualifications or fitness for office
6586332 clearly theres a question of whether its reportable as election communication
6586333 beyond that theres a question about how its funded if its corporately funded but the fec doesnt have the ability to immediately go into court as a practical matter

6586372 infant mortality is a manifestation of the accumulated social inadequacies that we have tolerated historically

6586491 i suppose the conmen thought they would be an easy touch but it was such a crass attempt at fraud anyone could see there was something a bit odd as far as we know no one fell for it
6586492 this has happened because lists of company shareholders are easily available these days
6586493 first time buyers are the people who have been hit hard
6586494 we would say whatever the government can do do it for first time buyers if the government can find a way to underwrite the securitised loans that banks are having difficulty refinancing then that could ease the situation
6586495 trading conditions have been the most challenging in persimmons recent history our results for the period reflect this difficult market

6586509 more students were taking gcses early in november especially in english and maths and this meant fewer entries in this summers results students are focusing their efforts more tightly on a smaller range of subjects
6586510 ive spoken to a number of schools who are talking about a more flexible approach to years nine 10 and 11 about targeting different pupils with different levels of ability to move at different paces in different subjects its not uncommon now for some schools to be starting some pupils in some gcses in year nine to create more headroom in the last years of school to move on to a level
6586511 its driven by league tables because 31 is happiness to a school and 29 is abject misery
6586512 schools are focusing on quality rather than quantity it makes sense for students to concentrate on eight or nine gcses rather than 11 or 12 and to do them well
6586513 i particularly welcome the record results in english and maths and the sharp rise in entries in biology physics and chemistry the overall increase in pass rates and top grades is built firmly on improvements in the key subjects of english and maths
6586514 he started doing simple maths questions and puzzles at two
6586515 my dad is a loving man and he didnt deserve this
6586516 my dad opened his arms up to this guy let him in his life and then i feel like he was betrayed
6586517 my family and i are experiencing grief that is indescribable and at times unbearable every time i close my eyes the images in my head are of my dad in flames screaming hollering and running for his life while on fire in excruciating and traumatizing pain
6586518 they said the first 24 hours were critical he made it through the first 24 hours with no complications he made that first hurdle the doctor informed me today that his body is fighting hes a fighter
6586519 we are trying to make the carnival a hostile environment for anyone who wants to go to commit crimes and disorder
6586520 as well as the warrants weve issued we have sent 200 letters to known people advising them not to come to carnival there are 750 000 people coming to carnival this weekend the vast majority will have a good safe time its just the minority we want to deter
6586521 sending a very clear message dont bring weapons because we could be anywhere
6586522 there is no excuse for anyone to take a weapon to the carnival
6586523 all i needed was 5 cs to get into college
6586524 my dads really pleased he started crying when i told him
6586525 most of us felt that we were under more public scrutiny in the 1980s and that increased during the 1990s but it wasnt until labour came into power that education and health became the big political issues
6586526 from my perspective and this is very much my own perspective i would say that labour have lived up to their promises in that they have put significant amounts of money into education particularly into areas of the country where there are high levels of disadvantage
6586527 we worked out that if we could change the school ethos all the energy that teachers were putting in would be much more productive
6586528 i could take you to three schools within 10 minutes walk of here which are not some schools are awful
6586529 if i was to criticise labour policy my biggest criticism would be their obsession with individual schools and a competitive model
6586530 there comes a point at which you have to say ok we have now got a much better system professionals who are much better at their jobs lets pull back a bit from it lets see perhaps if we can get the same attainment with slightly less of relentless testing throughout their career but what politician would be brave enough to do that
6586531 one in five appeals are successful this clearly shows that appeals provide a vital safety net
6586532 we must ensure that the process is of the highest quality and that it is subject to effective judicial scrutiny
6586533 if the low numbers of asylum seekers to the uk were the result of the world becoming a safer more peaceful place then we would have something to celebrate
6586534 as it is we have real concerns that people who need our help and protection are not able to get here to access it we need to ensure that our borders remain open to refugees who are in fear for their lives
6586535 we are utterly resolute in our determination to support this new democracy of afghanistan
6586536 we wont relax our efforts to support and reconstruct afghanistan because we understand that what happens in afghanistan affects the rest of the world we are determined to work with the government and coalition forces to defeat the forces of terrorism
6586537 we have succeeded in winning back territory the longer term solution is that more power will be given to the afghanistan people
6586538 you are the heroes of our country you are the frontline against the taliban what you are doing here prevents terrorism coming to the streets of britain
6586539 this week we are celebrating the olympics where we have had great success people have been winning medals in areas where we have been breaking ground but this week also i believe that our olympic athletes and everybody else in our country will remember that you have showed exactly the same courage professionalism and dedication you make our country proud every day of the week every week of the year
6586540 it shows we do have support for what we are doing it gives us a sense of pride
6586541 plotting in the cabinet is not new it happens in afghanistan too
6586542 the fall in business investment was worse than anticipated it confirms that businesses are being forced to retrench in the face of the economic slowdown
6586543 todays figures support the results of the bccs quarterly economic survey the worsening economic pressures emphasise the need for the mpc and the government to take the correct measures to counter the threat of recession
6586544 it is not only households who are struggling businesses are also finding it difficult to acquire external sources of finance as credit conditions remain tight the environment for investing is deteriorating
6586545 this highlights the serious error of judgment made by the government in may when it announced the national challenge creating such unnecessary damage to the reputation of many schools pupils and staff in national challenge schools have been placed under serious pressure and this must be matched by support
6586546 schools moving above and below the arbitrary threshold of 30 each year highlights the stupidity of putting a schools reputation at risk on the basis of a single years results
6586547 tarred by that brush that says you are a failing school
6586548 we have to live with it and get on with the job in hand were in the second most deprived ward in the country and we are being described as failures theres academic success but also other success in engaging kids that might not be engaged otherwise
6586549 as we said at the launch of national challenge many national challenge schools are improving fast with strong leadership and high aspirations national challenge schools will still be receiving extra funding help and support to help them continue to improve and sustain those improvements for the long term
6586550 you cannot treat every area of government as if it provides the same amount of value to the taxpayers of this state
6586551 you dont say were going to cut it all equally by 3 percent the mortgage the movies the going out to dinner
6586552 you say no no no were going to protect the mortgage were going to make sure we pay that thing and were going to slow down over here
6586553 it means that some critical response time could be impacted wherein a loved one of yours is on the side of i 95 in a wreck and thered be a trooper a little bit further away than otherwise would have been the case

6586555 sure theyll tighten belts but thats what we need to do in tough times thats what i do at my house and your house
6586556 my real concern if we get back in session theres no limit to what can be taken up
6586557 we will not just deal with the budget we could take up anything and thats dangerous that is really dangerous we could wind up there all summer long at 103 000 a week im not going to do that

6586609 men are being portrayed negatively by exaggerated statistics on dowry harassment or domestic violence cases women often use the act to separate from their husbands and get an attractive alimony
6586610 women often call me up just to ask if they can use the act to bring their husbands around or separate them from their parents they do not understand the seriousness of the law this is predominantly an urban phenomenon
6586611 the dva is a weapon of family destruction unleashed by vested interests to demolish the institution of family in india
6586612 the sole testimony of the woman is relied upon and the husband is put behind bars isnt this unique when compared to any country in the world
6586613 it was hell from the beginning she asked me not to send money to my parents and began threatening me she returned to india on the pretext of visiting her parents and then began the trauma for our family false cases were foisted against me under the anti dowry act and domestic violence act

6586627 after recently being asked by the england management to reassess my retirement from international one day cricket ive decided to join englands squad for the natwest series after careful consideration
6586628 its something i have been thinking about for a period of time and due to recent injuries in the england camp the opportunity has arisen for me to play a role in this series
6586629 i decided to retire from englands odi team for a number reasons one being the amount of time i was spending away from my family
6586630 now that my family is settled and my bowling is settled i feel i have something to offer englands odi side and am looking forward to playing a part in the natwest series against south africa
6586631 having missed out on selection at various times this year i am well aware of the disappointment that comes from not being a part of the england dressing room
6586632 with that in mind i want to be a part of the team and if that means bringing myself out of retirement to play a role in this upcoming natwest series then im happy to do just that

6586914 in the decade before the measles vaccination program began an estimated 3 to 4 million persons in the united states were infected each year of these 400 to 500 died 48 000 were hospitalized and another 1 000 developed chronic disability from measles encephalitis
6586915 of the 95 patients eligible for vaccination 63 were unvaccinated because of their or their parents philosophical or religious beliefs
6586916 increases in the proportion of the population declining vaccination for themselves or their children might lead to large scale outbreaks in the united states
6586917 measles knows no borders but can be prevented for less than one dollar per child in a developing country we must be steadfast in our efforts to reduce measles cases globally

6586919 evacuate in our moment of triumph i think you overestimate their chances
6586920 have you no fear of god youre getting the same as him we deserve this but not him he did nothing to deserve this
6586921 go up and build an altar to the lord on the threshing floor of araunah the jebusite
6586922 why has my lord the king come to his servant
6586923 so i can build an altar to the lord that the plague on the people may be stopped
6586924 let my lord the king take whatever pleases him and offer it up here are oxen for the burnt offering and here are threshing sledges and ox yokes for the wood o king araunah gives all this to the king
6586925 no i insist on paying you for it i will not sacrifice to the lord my god burnt offerings that cost me nothing
6586926 for a people like us trained in a culture of getting things done and taking care of ourselves sacrifice doesnt seem at all obvious neither does it seem attractive
6586927 there is only one gospel way to participate in jesus work live a sacrificial life in jesus name
6586928 you do not delight in sacrifice or i would bring it you do not take pleasure in burnt offerings the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit a broken and contrite heart o god you will not despise
6586929 he who has clean hands and a pure heart who does not lift up his soul to an idol or swear by what is false
6586930 true worship is radically countercultural being directed not towards self but god
6586931 the celebration we call worship has less to do with the satisfaction or the pursuit of happiness than with the abandonment of the pursuit of happiness
6586932 these people honor me with their lips but their hearts are far from me they worship me in vain their teachings are but rules taught by men
6586933 that day the lord saved israel from the hands of the egyptians and israel saw the egyptians lying dead on the shore
6586934 then moses and the israelites sang this song to the lord
6586935 what is true for israel is true for us a people immersed in salvation determined history in which we maintain a believing participating involvement by worship the god of history
6586936 then david got up from the ground after he had washed put on lotions and changed his clothes he went into the house of the lord and worshiped
6586937 holy holy holy is the lord god almighty who was and is and is to come
6586938 praise the lord o my soul all my inmost being praise his holy name praise the lord o my soul and forget not all his benefits
6586939 worship starts with seeing you our hearts respond to your revelation
6586940 in the year that king uzziah died i saw the lord seated on a throne high and exalted and the train of his robes filled the temple
6586941 in the year i gave up drinking i saw the lord
6586942 worship always begins with a vision of god and until we see god worship doesnt happen if we want to improve public worship this is where we start we must have people who see god more clearly and therefore love him more dearly
6586943 yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and truth for they are the kind of worshipers the father seeks god is spirit and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth
6586944 any approach to salvation that does not eventually become worship and the sooner the better distorts and reduces salvation to a concept or a program or a technique that we can master and therefore control
6586945 therefore i urge you brothers in view of gods mercy to offer your bodies as living sacrifices holy and pleasing to god this is your spiritual act of worship
6586946 nonetheless when congregations gather to praise god and learn from him they express their enduring belief that worship whether set in prayers or spontaneous utterances in venerable hymns or contemporary choruses is integral to their lives
6586947 somewhere along the line it is important not only to explain that genuine worship is nothing more than loving god with heart soul strength and mind and loving our neighbors as ourselves but also to show what a statement like that means in the concrete decisions of life
6586948 for the spirits of the prophets are subject to the control of the prophets for god is not a god of disorder but of peace therefore my brothers be eager to prophesy and do not forbid speaking in tongues but everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way
6586949 but if any unbeliever or someone who does not understand comes in while everybody is prophesying he will be convinced by all that he is a sinner and will be judged by all and the secrets of his heart will be laid bare
6586950 you are worthy our lord and god to receive glory and honor and power for you created all things and by your will they were created and have their being
6586951 then i saw a lamb looking as if it had been slain standing in the center of the throne encircled by the four living creatures and elders
6586952 you are worthy to take the scroll and open its seals because you were slain and with your blood you purchased men for god from every tribe and language and people and nation you made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our god and they will reign on the earth
6586953 worthy is the lamb who was slain to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and praise
6586954 to him to sits on the throne and to the lamb be praise and honor and glory and power for ever and ever
6586955 is not by talking about worship but by talking about jesus when you start to see jesus he wins your heart and worship happens
6586956 through jesus therefore let us continually offer to god a sacrifice of praise the fruit of lips that confess his name
6586957 throw away the gods your forefathers worshiped but as for me and my household we will serve the lord
6586958 my soul glorifies the lord and my spirit rejoices in god my savior
6586959 holy holy holy is the lord god almighty who was and is and is to come
6586960 we are seeing large growth in the volume of people coming on holiday but the spend on site is lower than it has been in previous years
6586961 you see people arriving and theyre taking the lidl and the aldi bags out of the boot of the car you can see them with half bottles of gin that are going into handbags when they go into the bars
6586962 ill keep something of the name for the old guy because i have great affection for him
6586963 at the end of the season they used to plant a big bronze statue of course it wasnt real bronze of joe maplin they would turn up and stick plastic roses in the ground because all the roses had gone by that time and they would film all the episodes in about two weeks
6586964 it is and it isnt the brand awareness is amazing if you go out on the street and you mention the words butlins and pontins to any english person they will say holiday camps so at least they know what it is and that is something
6586965 i think the most disappointing thing is the way that the british holiday experience resort call it what you like has deteriorated and luckily at the very last moment investment is starting to come back in and it is getting better if you take blackpool as an example i mean it really did get into some dire dire straits in terms of its marketing the level of violence and drunkenness and it is not just blackpool but all over
6586966 from about the early 90s we used to build into the budget about 500 a week for people kicking the glass in and wed invariably spend it because every night somewhere or other some drunken yob would take a swing with his boot at a pane of glass
6586967 but i really do see a resurgence and an improvement if we invest properly people respect that and if we are careful in the way that we manage the leisure assets it will stop the yob element we almost were in danger of giving in to it but i think people have just had enough
6586968 i was in greens restaurant in duke street st jamess which is owned by simon parker bowles and he said i see pontins are in the field the magazine for country sports
6586969 so i get home open it up and obviously this journo was short of something to do in july because there is not a lot of shooting going on but she was obviously a fan of jive dancing and we do jive dancing weekends at pontins and sure enough she had gone down to camber sands and there was a whole article in the field i mean how on earth do you get pontins in the field i was completely oblivious to the whole bloody thing they didnt ask it was a very good article but im not sure if it is our target market i have to say

6587096 i may not be politically connected but i read the local papers i talk to people and ive grown up here some people feel the city is going in the wrong direction while some are very happy there is room to have that mix of opinions
6587097 where people go after high school to get an education is likely where they will stay to begin their careers because businesses have gravitated to those environments and the potential work force
6587098 i think we have more than enough restaurant workers and sign twirlers in temecula
6587099 we need more job opportunities that will offer at a minimum 45 000 a year and which will allow people to afford to live here
6587100 every morning hundreds of thousands of people are getting on our freeways heading to their jobs in san diego l a and orange county

6587117 the risks of bidding without russian approval were obvious of course the indians took precautions before embarking on this
6587118 we believe intensifying media coverage reports of state level negotiations and ongcs readiness to face competition suggest a strong possibility of a positive outcome
6587119 in particular the military conflict has resulted in a rise in investor risk aversion and russias political risk premium which has helped push the rouble to its lowest level this year
6587120 in addition the forex reserves decline is also likely to have reflected the impact of the euros depreciation against the us dollar on international exchanges
6587121 our statisticians have uncovered a number of inconsistencies in these new property transaction statistics going back to april 2005 we have not been able to identify the cause of these differences and this raises doubts about the accuracy of the statistics
6587122 few retailers will recognise this positive picture its hard to see what could produce the sales growth boost ons is reporting or its finding that smaller retailers are outperforming larger ones
6587123 as if there wasnt enough uncertainty surrounding the outlook for the uk economy
6587124 the hmrc statistics withdrawal adds to ongoing concerns about the reliability of other ons data releases
6587125 we want to present the best value we can to consumers and to our retail and food service partners but we need to be ultimately able to cover the cost were confronted with
6587126 we are taking aggressive action in food service that included reduced expectations in our full year forecast
6587127 its a good global strategy and a good example of what a u s based food company ought to be doing in order to maintain balance growth in this pretty turbulent food economy
6587128 if there is an opportunity to invest we will look at it
6587129 either in recession or face significant recession in the months ahead
6587130 given its importance to world growth in recent years a world recession would in all likelihood involve a hard landing in china
6587131 we are pessimistic about the outlook for the economy particularly as households continue to be squeezed by high inflation and the credit crisis
6587132 there has never been a better time to be in insulation

6587144 we narrowly missed our guidance primarily due to the performance of our wvas business which was impacted by temporary suspensions of certain wvas marketing campaigns since may due to the sichuan earthquake our music business has also been impacted in q2 as many charity activities and donations to the relief efforts were organized overall we have further stabilized our wvas business and continue to generate positive operating cash flow

6587161 the whole department right now is in shock and its going to take us some time to get over this because he was a young officer who was very well known and liked
6587162 people are finally realizing that this russian situation has the potential to be bad for a very long time
6587163 the russians have shown evidence that theyre willing to cut off energy supplies to advance their aims there is concern that they are now going to be much more assertive in that area
6587164 if military activity heats up again pipeline flows into europe could be disrupted and that would affect the united states as well
6587165 this is probably about it in terms of a retail gas drop we may be a few cents away from the august bottom

6587179 why is it that joe biden is the first in his family ever to go to a university why is it that my wife who is sitting out there in the audience is the first in her family ever to go to college
6587180 the only thing we have to fear is fear itself
6587181 i would have read much more if my elder brother in a fit of savonarolan destruction hadnt burned all my beloved blyton books when i was eight
6587182 all i needed was 5 cs to get into college
6587183 my dads really pleased he started crying when i told him
6587184 most of us felt that we were under more public scrutiny in the 1980s and that increased during the 1990s but it wasnt until labour came into power that education and health became the big political issues
6587185 from my perspective and this is very much my own perspective i would say that labour have lived up to their promises in that they have put significant amounts of money into education particularly into areas of the country where there are high levels of disadvantage
6587186 we worked out that if we could change the school ethos all the energy that teachers were putting in would be much more productive
6587187 i could take you to three schools within 10 minutes walk of here which are not some schools are awful
6587188 if i was to criticise labour policy my biggest criticism would be their obsession with individual schools and a competitive model
6587189 there comes a point at which you have to say ok we have now got a much better system professionals who are much better at their jobs lets pull back a bit from it lets see perhaps if we can get the same attainment with slightly less of relentless testing throughout their career but what politician would be brave enough to do that
6587190 this highlights the serious error of judgment made by the government in may when it announced the national challenge creating such unnecessary damage to the reputation of many schools pupils and staff in national challenge schools have been placed under serious pressure and this must be matched by support
6587191 schools moving above and below the arbitrary threshold of 30 each year highlights the stupidity of putting a schools reputation at risk on the basis of a single years results
6587192 tarred by that brush that says you are a failing school
6587193 we have to live with it and get on with the job in hand were in the second most deprived ward in the country and we are being described as failures theres academic success but also other success in engaging kids that might not be engaged otherwise
6587194 as we said at the launch of national challenge many national challenge schools are improving fast with strong leadership and high aspirations national challenge schools will still be receiving extra funding help and support to help them continue to improve and sustain those improvements for the long term
6587195 they are fighting and dying while at home they are talking about slashing and cutting
6587196 far too big a mismatch between our aspirations and what we actually deliver
6587197 it seems the taliban the insurgency are prepared to carry out more frontal kinds of operations
6587198 the military alone has always been insufficient to counter an insurgency which remains essentially a political activity
6587199 a military coalition is a cumbersome weapon to use in a transnational counter insurgency campaign and rudderless without a unified political coalition
6587200 kingston gwen and gavin rossdale welcomed the newest member of their family
6587201 more students were taking gcses early in november especially in english and maths and this meant fewer entries in this summers results students are focusing their efforts more tightly on a smaller range of subjects
6587202 ive spoken to a number of schools who are talking about a more flexible approach to years nine 10 and 11 about targeting different pupils with different levels of ability to move at different paces in different subjects its not uncommon now for some schools to be starting some pupils in some gcses in year nine to create more headroom in the last years of school to move on to a level
6587203 its driven by league tables because 31 is happiness to a school and 29 is abject misery
6587204 schools are focusing on quality rather than quantity it makes sense for students to concentrate on eight or nine gcses rather than 11 or 12 and to do them well
6587205 i particularly welcome the record results in english and maths and the sharp rise in entries in biology physics and chemistry the overall increase in pass rates and top grades is built firmly on improvements in the key subjects of english and maths
6587206 he started doing simple maths questions and puzzles at two
6587207 it was a huge act of aggression on the part of the georgian army

6587210 to you the living and the dead to you south ossetia

6587214 only here thanks to this music i feel the fear leaving

6587223 dalam rapat muspida hari ini diketahui keluarga besar presiden sudah mengajukan surat permohonan untuk pindah tempat pencoblosan karena beliau sangat menghargai pesta demokrasi tetapi sedang berada di cipanas maka pencoblosan akan dilakukan di daerah cisarua tepatnya di kelurahan tugu utara tapi kami belum tahu di desa mana

6587225 though there were plenty of good days it really damaged my family there were times when mentally i had to create my own world
6587226 i wanted to create my own world i didnt like that whole typecasting thing
6587227 i had an intuition about atlanta i knew that really creative people like outkast had come from here so my subconscious was telling me that i should stay i felt like this could be a place where i could start my own movement
6587228 it was almost like we were connected from another land and god sent us all to work together

6587234 with regards to the way that i dress to the things that come out of my mouth im really trying to give a different perspective

6587243 youre probably thinking a normal teenager doesnt do this well ask dick
6587244 when the inspection period would get beyond lets say a year and a half i think thats really going beyond what regulatory oversight should be
6587245 i gotta tell you something i dont have a great deal of confidence right now that i am actually getting what i am paying for
6587246 when theres a lack of oversight theres a potential a greater potential for abuse
6587247 it would be beneficial to have a national coordination of efforts
6587248 i really do believe that promoting brown fat growth is a plausible approach to weight control
6587249 to me it is attractive because of its simplicity if more of our fat were brown fat the mouse studies suggest that we would be leaner and better able to resist obesity
6587250 we showed that brown fat and white fat have completely different origins
6587251 brown fat is derived from muscle that was a huge surprise
6587252 the hope is that this research will lead to better ways to treat obesity especially for people who are overweight because of their genes
6587253 right now there are not many good options for these people
6587254 answers to these questions would take us a step closer to the ultimate goal of promoting the brown fat lineage as a potential way of counteracting obesity
6587255 we know that we can stimulate the production of brown fat in mice
6587256 it is not unreasonable to think that we can also do this in humans
6587257 the plane was rocking back and forth until i suspected it was going to fall
6587258 i saw people smoke explosions i think that is what woke me up because i had lost consciousness
6587259 i thought that if help did not arrive soon i would die
6587260 the plane would not fail to the point of causing a tragedy
6587261 most likely whatever the malfunction of the probe was it is probably not related to what happened
6587262 youre probably thinking a normal teenager doesnt do this well ask dick
6587263 people should not be forced to say or do things they believe are morally wrong
6587264 health care workers should not be forced to provide services that violate their violates their own conscience
6587265 the bush administrations proposed regulation poses a serious threat to womens health care by limiting the rights of patients to receive complete and accurate health information and services
6587266 womens ability to manage their own health care is at risk of being compromised by politics and ideology
6587267 people should not be forced to say or do things that they find morally wrong
6587268 words in that draft led some to misconstrue the departments intent
6587269 this regulation is consistent with my intent to focus squarely on the issue of conscience rights this specifically goes to the issue of abortion and conscience

6587285 this report from wisdom is reassuring that there are real benefits for some women electing to use hrt while it has been well established that quality of life measures are improved in younger symptomatic women this paper adds some information that even older women may benefit while some of this information was reported from the whi which used the same hormonal regimen more sensitive instruments were used in wisdom which was able to show improvements in other measures such as sexual function while this is important information and is reassuring regarding the benefits of hrt these findings in isolation are not an indication to initiate hormones in asymptomatic older women for the first time
6587286 this is a significant study which supports our views on hrt it shows that hrt can offer real benefits to most women experiencing menopausal symptoms our advice remains the same each woman is an individual and she needs to discuss whats right for her with her doctor in the light of her medical history this study reinforces the benefits of appropriate use

6587295 for all practical purposes military to military cooperation had really already been ended with the russians

6587297 we still have some very important issues that we need to work with russia on

6587307 our results show that hot flushes night sweats sleeplessness and joint pains were less common in women on hrt in this age group sexuality was also improved
6587308 overall quality of life measures improved even when women did not have hot flushes and were well past menopause there was a small but measurable improvement in quality of life and a noted improvement in sleep sexuality and joint pains hrt users also had more breast tenderness and discharge compared to those on a placebo
6587309 these new data should be added to the risk benefit equation for hrt the quality of life benefits of hrt may be greater in women with more severe symptoms near menopause new research suggests that hrt taken from near menopause avoids the cardiovascular risks seen when hrt is initiated many years after menopause
6587310 enable the risks of hrt to be reduced and its benefits maximized when the treatment is individualized to each woman
6587311 early start up side effects can usually be alleviated by adjusting the treatment
6587312 for most women with significant menopause symptoms the benefits of hrt outweigh the risks
6587313 if a woman feels that hrt is needed for quality of life then doctors can find the safest regimen for her she can try going off hrt every 4 5 years and can then make an informed choice about whether she takes and continues hrt

6587326 often when companies make products that are comfortable and easy to use by the public interesting applications on the medical side
6587327 anything like that would require approval from the food and drug administration which takes years

6587374 so they asked his staff and he said at least four at least four now think about that i guess if you think that being rich means you gotta make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy is fundamentally strong but if youre like me and youve got one house or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so that they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective

6587425 this is the first report to conclude that tobacco advertising and promotion increases tobacco use
6587426 its the first report to make the conclusion that there is a causal relationship between exposure to depiction of smoking in the movies and youth beginning to smoke
6587427 cigarettes are one of the most heavily marketed products in the united states
6587428 now it is up to the government to consider the evidence and think about what it needs to do in terms of advertising and promotion
6587429 this report sends an unmistakable message to our elected officials that they can dramatically reduce tobacco use by children and by adults by passing legislation that would authorize the food and drug administration to regulate tobacco products and by adequately funding their state prevention and cessation programs
6587430 it appears that many of the conclusions in the report are based on marketing practices that are more than 30 or 40 years old
6587431 we think its important to focus on the marketing practices that we have in place today
6587432 this report from wisdom is reassuring that there are real benefits for some women electing to use hrt while it has been well established that quality of life measures are improved in younger symptomatic women this paper adds some information that even older women may benefit while some of this information was reported from the whi which used the same hormonal regimen more sensitive instruments were used in wisdom which was able to show improvements in other measures such as sexual function while this is important information and is reassuring regarding the benefits of hrt these findings in isolation are not an indication to initiate hormones in asymptomatic older women for the first time
6587433 this is a significant study which supports our views on hrt it shows that hrt can offer real benefits to most women experiencing menopausal symptoms our advice remains the same each woman is an individual and she needs to discuss whats right for her with her doctor in the light of her medical history this study reinforces the benefits of appropriate use
6587434 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
6587435 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or mild to moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
6587436 the mechanism in which the central nervous hormonal and immune systems interact and how behaviour and external events modulate these three systems is not fully understood
6587437 the relationship between happiness and health should be examined in future studies and relevant preventative initiatives should be developed
6587438 a total of 15 556 subjects answered the questions on snoring
6587439 these factors may enhance inflammatory processes and thereby alter upper airway anatomy early in life causing an increased susceptibility for adult snoring
6587440 people who snore run an increased risk of early death and cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks or strokes
6587441 these new findings suggest that further knowledge about the early life environment may contribute to the primary prevention of snoring
6587442 our results show that hot flushes night sweats sleeplessness and joint pains were less common in women on hrt in this age group sexuality was also improved
6587443 overall quality of life measures improved even when women did not have hot flushes and were well past menopause there was a small but measurable improvement in quality of life and a noted improvement in sleep sexuality and joint pains hrt users also had more breast tenderness and discharge compared to those on a placebo
6587444 these new data should be added to the risk benefit equation for hrt the quality of life benefits of hrt may be greater in women with more severe symptoms near menopause new research suggests that hrt taken from near menopause avoids the cardiovascular risks seen when hrt is initiated many years after menopause
6587445 enable the risks of hrt to be reduced and its benefits maximized when the treatment is individualized to each woman
6587446 early start up side effects can usually be alleviated by adjusting the treatment
6587447 for most women with significant menopause symptoms the benefits of hrt outweigh the risks
6587448 if a woman feels that hrt is needed for quality of life then doctors can find the safest regimen for her she can try going off hrt every 4 5 years and can then make an informed choice about whether she takes and continues hrt
6587449 she loves her husband and she has five children by him and consequently hes an integral part of the family unit
6587450 perhaps she was upset about the initial allegations and shes gotten over that and their love is strong
6587451 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6587452 this agreement determines the principal provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of u s forces
6587453 i have to say if i could just make the point the reason we are where we are going talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger
6587454 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6587455 im finished making sense done pleading ignorance that whole defense
6587456 the more people on board with our line of thinking the happier we are
6587457 the meters are old and beat up and need to be re done and secondly the meter readers may make mistakes

6587472 most assuredly i say to you you seek me not because you saw the signs but because you ate of the loaves and were filled
6587473 therefore many of his disciples when they heard this said
6587474 does this offend you what then if you should see the son of man ascend where he was before it is the spirit who gives life the flesh profits nothing the words that i speak to you are spirit and they are life but there are some of you who do not believe
6587475 therefore i have said to you that no one can come to me unless it has been granted to him by my father
6587476 grace which amounts to justification of sin without the justification of the repentant sinner who departs from sin and from whom sin departs
6587477 almost christians yet not fully christians they seem near the kingdom of heaven but they cannot enter there almost but not wholly saved means to be not almost but wholly lost
6587478 for if we willfully persist in sin after having received the knowledge of the truth there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins but a fearful prospect of judgment and a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries
6587479 then peter took him aside and began to rebuke him saying
6587480 get behind me satan you are an offense to me for you are not mindful of the things of god but the things of men

6587482 oh but this is too high of a price to pay
6587483 a sin polluted heart for jesus to purify to cleanse by his own blood and to save by his matchless love and yet men think it hard to give up all
6587484 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in christ
6587485 a full surrender is to obey as well as to trust to trust as well as to obey
6587486 only he who believes is obedient and only he who is obedient believes
6587487 no servant can serve two masters either he will hate the one and love the other or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other you cannot serve both god and mammon
6587488 come near to god and he will come near to you wash your hands you sinners and purify your hearts you double minded grieve mourn and wail change your laughter to mourning and your joy to gloom humble yourselves before the lord and he will lift you up
6587489 but put on the lord jesus christ and make no provision for the flesh to fulfill its lusts

6587559 you cant possibly allow him to think that there was anything remotely the same about the greeks and the romans not to mention dismissing one of the greatest cultures in western civilization well on earth anyway by boiling it down to centurions and gladiators
6587560 do you mind im trying to have breakfast here can you two twelve year olds possibly hold your discussion of roman history at a more appropriate time
6587561 it took place in the city of rome hence the title
6587562 it was you know that when that movie came out probably half the women who saw it ran out and had all their hair whacked off whether it suited them or not and let me tell you not many women can get away with that gamine look
6587563 a slender young girl usually described as waiflike or elfin in nature
6587564 it would be more appropriate to use the term elfin to describe a persons appearance and elfish to describe something being elven in origin like weapons or armor
6587565 you do know there arent really any elves right mckay
6587566 the movie was about someone who chose duty over love it was ultimately very sad
6587567 anything youd like to tell us unofficially about the people were meeting today the whosits the beltans
6587568 you were charged with the important duty of acting as a guide to our new friends and leading them to the ruins that dr mckay wished to inspect it was rude of you to abandon them before your duty was complete
6587569 and dr mckay kept nagging me about keeping up with my studies
6587570 when i said i wanted to learn how to use weapons and fight the colonel agreed with dr mckay
6587571 what til i tell sheppard he lost major cool points by taking mckays side
6587572 you must forgive me for my sons thoughtlessness i will make him apologize to the colonel and dr mckay on their return
6587573 you did warn them against trying to come back across the shadowlands didnt you
6587574 well i mean everyone knows not to cross the shadowlands in the spring
6587575 glare before turning back to teyla and ronon with a stiff smile on his face
6587576 theyll be fine im sure after all how much trouble can two grown men get into yes
6587577 nekko has returned here without you timor informs me that there are some local conditions of which you might not be aware and should know about before you make the return journey to the village
6587578 timor suggests that you avoid crossing the shadowlands on your return
6587579 the ground itself is treacherous at this time of year with many deadly bogs the weather too is unpredictable with highly variable extremes in temperature and unexpected storms as well as heavy fogs
6587580 timor suggests that you pick up something to use as a walking stick and test the ground in front of you as you move he also says to avoid walking across any ground where the vegetation is excessively bright green in color that often indicates a bog underneath
6587581 he says that the fog can roll in without warning and in addition to making it impossible to safely see your way it can cause death through hypothermia if you see a weather front coming in you should seek shelter right away he has also suggested that the two of you wait at your current location and he will send someone to guide you in
6587582 well be fine well check in every fifteen though sheppard out
6587583 well lets not stand around waiting for it to get colder
6587584 hello deadly bogs remember or did you sleep through the part when we discovered we were actually standing in the middle of the local equivalent of the fire swamp
6587585 ah cmon rodney theyre probably all scared off by the bogs
6587586 but when i was a child i was taken to see lawrence of arabia did you ever see it i dont remember much about it aside from the fact that it was incredibly long except for the scene where the little arab boy gets sucked into the quicksand it happened so fast and lawrence tried to save him and he couldnt and the look on peter otooles face when the boy goes under was just awful
6587587 did you ever see a movie or read a book that didnt traumatize you as a child
6587588 if you can still see the ridge timor suggests following that to where a hunters hut is located you can seek shelter from the storm there it should be stocked with food and wood to make a fire
6587589 food and warmth are good things how long do these storms usually last
6587590 timor says that the weather is very unpredictable in the early spring here sometimes a few hours sometimes a few days he says at the very least you will probably be stranded overnight which is why it is imperative that you locate shelter as soon as possible i will notify elizabeth of the delay in our return colonel
6587591 of all the possible ways in which we could bite the dust here in pegasus dying from exposure didnt even make the top twenty five
6587592 enough wood and peat moss for fuel to last us a few days dried meat and fruit some containers of water a couple of pots and pans a covered hole in the ground for a privy definitely not the ritz but it will do
6587593 first things first a fire and then out of these wet clothes right and then something to eat to keep our strength up
6587594 well god knows weve been through it often enough crap its really cold in here
6587595 and some power bars that should help with the food situation
6587596 with two sticks and a piece of string and several hours and lots of determination however i would like to get warm and have something hot to eat sometime this evening so if you could just step aside
6587597 hello canadian man offering to start a fire for you here
6587598 what are you still doing wearing those wet things you need to take those off right now do you want hypothermia
6587599 i have another jacket in the pack if you like
6587600 you certainly packed enough crap no wonder your back hurts all the time all this and the equip
6587601 thats the one theres probably another pair of socks as well though next time it would seem i need to bring an entire change of clothing
6587602 i hate wet feet and the blisters that go with them
6587603 the cot disintegrated on me and dont you say a fucking word you hear me sheppard not one word
6587604 if you dont need any help uh extricating yourself theres plenty of room here on the floor
6587605 no im freezing to death over here youre blocking all the heat can we just i dont know rotate or something
6587606 you put out heat like a nuclear reactor you probably burn something like 300 calories an hour just sitting still no wonder everyone wants to sleep next to you
6587607 i mean that is to say off world you know when its really cold
6587608 sorry sorry i was just cold thats all it wont happen again sorry
6587609 youre going to make me eat not porridge arent you
6587610 im not going to make you do anything youre not comfortable with
6587611 i just thought hot cereal would stick with us longer on the way back this morning
6587612 the weathers lifted eat up and get dressed we should head out soon
6587613 i am never going off world again without at least a packet of instant coffee on me
6587614 im not that far from the edge i just need to turn around here
6587615 ronon teyla this is rodney we have an emergency sheppards in a bog and going down fast i need you
6587616 timor is bringing assistance it is only necessary that you keep the colonels head above the surface until we get there do you understand me rodney do not attempt to pull him out on your own
6587617 were not all that far from the tree line i mean we can see it from here just hurry okay only be careful because this bog stuff could be anywhere
6587618 well keep the channel open teyla so you can track our signal
6587619 you need to be as still as possible everything will be fine
6587620 just for like two seconds i would like to live in teylas world
6587621 im not saying i dont want her to say these things ive come to depend on her saying them just like ive come to depend on ronon to provide brute force or some lightening fast lethality just like i need you to look at me when were in a terrible situation and assure me that no matter how bleak things look we will get out of it okay
6587622 just like you guys need me to point out all the really obviously bad things in any given situation because im right of course as usual but this gives you all the opportunity to pull some sort of crazy heroic stunt and dont think i dont know that youre making it up as you go along colonel just to prove me wrong
6587623 look be careful okay you dont want to get too close here
6587624 look you need to lie back maximize your surface area here ive got you itll be okay
6587625 ive lost too many people on this expedition to stupid senseless stuff
6587626 killer viruses suicide being in the wrong place at the wrong time not picking the short straw for gods sake you you i expect to lose almost every day know it deep down that some day it will happen and ill be powerless to prevent it but not because of a stupid fucking bog
6587627 i prayed for the strength of ten grinches plus two
6587628 admit it its not like you havent thought it before
6587629 i just suddenly have this mental image of radek wearing an antler tied to his head
6587630 we believe we have a visual on your position we should be there within minutes is everything alright
6587631 were good teyla take your time rodney got me out of the bog were just taking a little breather thats all
6587632 we thought perhaps it is good to know that the two of you are alright
6587633 i wouldnt touch that one with a thirty nine and a half foot pole
6587634 yes yes do come in by all means make yourself at home
6587635 thats my fault i havent exactly been clear have i
6587636 um no a guy could get whiplash trying to keep up here
6587637 look im sorry okay i just had second thoughts alright
6587638 it didnt have anything to do with you well not directly anyway i mean it wasnt a rejection of the idea of you if you follow what im saying it was just me thinking that yeah right not to mention the whole surprise factor when i realized that it was even a remote possibility and then not wanting to screw up what was probably the best relationship ive ever had i mean in a working sense and besides
6587639 i just couldnt see me giving you what you wanted i mean look at you
6587640 you are like hotness personified and could have your pick of anyone and i mean anyone here in atlantis or even pegasus for that matter so it was a stretch to presume that you could well want me
6587641 so what youre saying rodney is that you made an offer but chickened out because of my looks
6587642 my looks yeah lets talk about that people have been telling me my whole life that im a good looking guy and ill admit ive taken advantage of that fact whenever i could but im well aware of how impermanent a trait that is being good looking is an accident of genetics like the ata gene it has nothing to do with me as a person and let me tell you being attractive
6587643 hasnt stopped people from leaving me hanging out to dry my entire life
6587644 no matter what else is or is not happening between us you cant stand there and tell me that we havent had your back every single time since weve been here even when you were stuck in the time dilation field you might have thought wed abandoned you but we hadnt as you well know and not just us as in your team but this whole entire expedition were behind you 100
6587645 where do you want it to leave us that is what exactly do you mrmph

6587650 i stephanie tubbs jones a representative from ohio and ms boxer a senator from california object to the counting of the electoral votes of the state of ohio on the ground that they were not under all of the known circumstances regularly given
6587651 i thank god that i have a senator joining me in this objection
6587652 while some have called our cause foolish i can assure you that my parents mary and andrew tubbs did not raise any fools and as a lawyer former judge and prosecutor i am duty bound to follow the law and apply the law to the facts as i find them
6587653 it is on behalf of those millions of americans who believe in and value our democratic process and the right to vote that i put forth this objection today
6587654 this objection does not have at its root the hope or even the hint of overturning or challenging the victory of the president but it is a necessary timely and appropriate opportunity to review and remedy the most precious process in our democracy
6587655 i raise this objection neither to put the nation in the turmoil of a proposed overturned election nor to provide cannon fodder or partisan demagoguery for my fellow republican members of congress
6587656 i raise this objection because i am convinced that we as a body must conduct a formal and legitimate debate about election irregularities i raise this objection to debate the process and protect the integrity of the true will of the people
6587657 again i thank senator boxer for joining me in this objection to the counting of ohios electoral votes due to the considerable number of voting irregularities that transpired in my home state
6587658 there are serious allegations in two lawsuits pending in ohio that debate the constitutionality of the denial of provisional ballots to voters the sandusky county democratic party v
6587659 moreover as you are aware advancing legislative initiatives is more challenging when you are in the minority party in congress however this challenge is multiplied when you are in the minority in the house of representatives because of house rules compared to senate rules
6587660 voting irregularities were an issue after the 2000 presidential election when democratic house initiatives relating to election reform were not considered
6587661 therefore in order to prevent our voices from being kept silent it is imperative that we object to the counting of ohios electoral votes and debate the issue of ohios voting improprieties
6587662 there are just over 1 million registered voters in cuyahoga county which of course includes the greater cleveland area and the 11th congressional district which i represent registration increased approximately 10 percent
6587663 the beauty of the 2004 election was that more people were fully prepared to exercise their right to vote however on election day hundreds and even thousands of individuals went to the voting polls and were denied the opportunity to have their vote count
6587664 in my own county where citizen volunteers put forth a herculean effort to register educate mobilize and protect the vote there were people who experienced irregularities
6587665 poor and minority communities had disproportionately long waits 4 to 5 hours waits were widespread
6587666 came from columbus and cleveland where a huge proportion of the states democratic voters live
6587667 cuyahoga county had an overall provisional ballot rejection rate of 32 percent rejection rates for provisional ballots in african american precincts wards in cleveland ohio averaged 37 percent and ranged as high as 51 percent
6587668 thousands of partisan challengers concentrated in cuyahoga countys minority and democratic communities effectively served to intimidate voters and confuse poll workers there were both inconsistent and illegal requests for photo identification
6587669 there were problems with absentee ballots including incorrect information provided to voters by the secretary of state and consequently the cuyahoga county board of elections telling voters they could not vote in their precinct effectively disenfranchising hundreds and more likely thousands of voters
6587670 this objection points out the inadequacy of a great election system which permits 50 secretarys of state to administer a federal election and impose so many different state laws regulating the election
6587671 in ohio the secretary of state kenneth blackwell who served as co chair of the bush re election campaign issued a bizarre series of directives in the days preceding the 2004 presidential election that created tremendous confusion among voters in cuyahoga county and across the state of ohio
6587672 for example on september 7 2004 secretary blackwell issued a directive to local boards of elections mandating rejection of voter registration forms based on their paperweight 80lb text weight
6587673 my objection points to the need to implement across this nation standards that apply to all states we need to enact legislation that will
6587674 what happened in ohio may well have been repeated in counties across this country
6587675 estamos comprometidos a aplicar este acuerdo lo mismo que la otra parte por el inter s p blico
6587676 hay dos borradores de resoluciones sobre la mesa y mi lectura es que el consejo no est en disposici n de respaldar a ninguno de los dos
6587677 los seis puntos sin clarificaciones nos hacen temer que se ponga al consejo en la posici n de respaldar algo que no se respeta
6587678 pr cticamente toda la cooperaci n militar con los rusos ha sido suspendida
6587679 la retirada no est teniendo lugar y tiene que tener lugar ahora mismo
6587680 lo m s escandaloso es que no es la primera vez que el gobierno demuestra ser completamente incapaz de proteger la integridad de informaci n altamente sensible lo que le incapacita para encomendarle la protecci n de nuestra seguridad
6587681 what im missing here is why are we doing this
6587682 the more important role is to maintain the sense of community and this is missing the tie to the neighborhood
6587683 any time you create a plan its basically to encourage development over a certain area and if were increasing density of development then that has a neighborhood impact
6587684 where i see the commission lacking is a unified vision on things of that nature where do you strike the balance of resurging development and complementing the residents concerns
6587685 theres absolutely no buffer in the area it goes from multi story commercial to single family residence
6587686 weve seen this four times we need to balance what weve got with the need to go forward

6587721 its not just all about what conference or how much money youre making

6587730 painting your front door is an easy way to give your house a new look and it neednt cost more than 20
6587731 people are railing against the doom and gloom and moving towards strong warm colours
6587732 we are finding that since fewer people are moving house customers are becoming more adventurous and experimental with their choice of paint colours
6587733 rather than feeling obliged to play it safe with neutral colours that wont deter prospective buyers home owners are more inclined to personalise their space
6587734 people seem to have got fed up with greys and pastels
6587735 pastels are still popular but stronger glossy tones are definitely coming back
6587736 people are choosing colours that have been around for centuries they are moving back to colours that make them feel comfortable while the financial world is crashing around us
6587737 we are seeing this trend reflected in the sales of our new colours pitch black and incarnadine rich crimson red

6587759 the combination of rapidly declining consumer confidence pressure on household incomes fuel price increases and emission regulations has resulted in the second hand car market being hit extremely hard in the first half of the year
6587760 highlighting the large gap between the expectations of vendors and buyers in the current market
6587761 the overall market was down 6 5 per cent or 33 000 units compared to 2007 levels this is the lowest number of second hand cars sold in a 6 month period since 2002
6587762 sales of repossessed vehicles on behalf of finance companies have been strong up 106 per cent year to date and the commercial business has undertaken more insolvency work
6587763 an extensive review of the property requirement for the group has been carried out resulting in some short term savings through amalgamation of branches or subletting properties
6587764 this has enabled the company to keep property costs in line with 2007 which is pleasing given the upward trend in commercial rents staff expenses are higher compared to last year due to the impact of legislative changes affecting holiday pay and the minimum wage
6587765 as indicated at the agm in april the company committed to investing in a repositioning of the turners brand with a large advertising and public relations campaign completed over the may to july period which has resulted in a significant increase in awareness levels

6587781 because he has been assessed to be a threat to the security of iraq and coalition forces
6587782 while i am pleased at ali release i am extremely concerned that this was the third time he was detained without explanation
6587783 if there are legitimate issues about him or any other journalist lets have them aired openly and tested if there are none let them pursue their profession free from intimidation and fear
6587784 having the young alumni step up and sell out of their ticket allotment is tremendous
6587785 this will be an area that we will continue to grow and develop with our friends in the alumni office and make this section of bulldog stadium very special
6587786 this is a great partnership between athletics and the alumni association
6587787 we appreciate the opportunity given to our newest graduates to stay connected to the university through bulldog football

6587792 im just so over it when youre posing on the red carpet and the paparazzi shout turn around turn around it gets a little offensive
6587793 they are carrying hygiene kits and items like paper plates toilet paper uht milk diapers baby formula and blankets
6587794 three us ships the sizes of which are in line with the rules of the montreux convention will pass friday through the dardanelles and bosporus straits to convey humanitarian assistance to the georgians
6587795 as has been the case for around seven decades we havent made any exception to the 1936 montreux convention and we will never make such an exception turkey is extremely sensitive on this issue moreover maintaining appropriate implementation of montreux is in everyones interest
6587796 they have nothing to do with the georgia russia conflict those spanish ships are there for a nato task mission that had been planned before the regional developments took place in line with the montreux convention they finished the eight day waiting period and they were free to pass through the turkish straits to the black sea as of thursday
6587797 our assessment is that the explosion was caused by plastic explosives detonated by remote control
6587798 a colonel was among the three soldiers hurt in the blast when a parked car exploded as a minibus carrying police officers passed by
6587799 this nation condemns these attacks our nation will resist by uniting even more strongly
6587800 our security forces will do the necessary work and capture the perpetrators
6587801 turkish police have been very helpful on the first night when oneill was formally reported missing search and rescue teams searched every place they could including up in the hills unfortunately there have been no possible sightings up to date
6587802 the pullback of russian forces is taking place at such a tempo that by the end of aug 22 they will be in the zones of responsibility of russian peacekeepers
6587803 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states
6587804 so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6587805 the tm506 not only signifies sony ericssons expanding u s portfolio of handsets but more importantly that we have forged a strong and promising relationship with t mobile
6587806 with the launch of the tm506 with t mobile sony ericsson is positioned to offer more choice of mobile handsets for a broader range of u s consumer segments at a variety of price points
6587807 t mobile continues its 3g network deployment across the country and were pleased to leverage sony ericssons 3g handset experience to help deliver the benefits of our next generation network to our customers
6587808 the sony ericsson tm506 is a compelling feature rich phone with a vibrant display that our customers will enjoy using to connect with the important people in their lives
6587809 he is still alive and hes in very poor condition
6587810 we had expert advice that the animal probably would not make it through the night
6587811 we are trying to get individuals to become more aware of their health
6587812 im big and beautiful and doing my best to keep my stress levels down so i can stay healthy
6587813 thats big not lazy not a glutton and certainly not deserving of the pompous poisonous disrespect served up daily to those of us with more bounce to the ounce
6587814 the state will feel good about itself for offering something and the person of size will end up paying 300 a year for the bad luck of having a chronic disease his her state sponsored insurance program failed to cover in an appropriate and meaningful fashion
6587815 the majority of the party thinks that asif zardari should be president
6587816 i believe that what we called in the past left and right is something that belongs to the past
6587817 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6587818 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6587819 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the us forces
6587820 the negotiators have taken this very very far but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6587821 i was j tem president for the next eight years
6587822 at that time she received a scholarship from businessman ayhan the owner of d holding
6587823 i never sent my daughter 1 million i have never seen this amount of money
6587824 the items found in the depot belonged to me and some officers who worked for j tem such as cem ersever
6587825 this gun was given to me by late gen hulusi say n the other one might have belonged to cem ersever i really dont know to whom the second kalashnikov belongs
6587826 in later years after he became a general we had meetings and spoke both on the phone and face to face about the duty and the gendarmerie organization
6587827 barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6587828 turkey will soon approve the rome statute and will become part of the international criminal court coalition
6587829 we demanded that terrorism crimes should be under the jurisdiction of the court but the eu opposed this according to the icc treaty commanders who fought against terrorism in afghanistan or in turkeys southeast can be tried but leaders of terrorist organizations cannot this is nonsense
6587830 i dont understand why we are rushing to ratify it we will discuss the issue when it comes to parliament
6587831 developments that began in the south ossetia region of georgia and turned into a large scale armed conflict with the intervention of the russian federation along with initiatives taken to end the conflict have also been discussed in detail
6587832 the establishment of structural cooperation can turn into a platform to expand our bilateral relations with iraq in every sphere
6587833 in the future we will put more resources into the training and mentoring of the afghan army
6587834 there are now 60 000 in the afghan army i believe the figures will go up from 60 000 to 80 000 and then 120 000
6587835 i believe that in time the figure for the afghan army given the size of this country may need to be even higher than 120 000
6587836 despite the fact that the cease fire agreement was signed and that it took these responsibilities vis vis the european union russian invader forces are still in georgia
6587837 we are always ready for both bilateral and regional cooperation either with turkey or with our other allies however as long as this invasion continues and as long as even one russian soldier remains on georgian soil we will not be involved in any cooperation mechanism that will involve an invader power
6587838 people using the park and erosion from the shoreline into the lake as well as animal breeding and grazing are filling the lake with sediment and are transforming its shape in brief the lake is in crisis as long as the nature park continues to see uncontrolled use by hikers and picnickers juniper pine and fir trees will have difficulty growing there in the near future after about 10 years there will be nothing but sediment and stones in abant lake soil from the hillsides close to the lake is also eroding unless the necessary measures are taken as soon as possible the abant nature park will soon become a series of bald hillsides and the lake will disappear
6587839 in fact with operation black sea harmony initiated by turkey the security of the black sea has been enhanced
6587840 the us will always seek the maximum in its demands so it can get as much as possible in the end its attempt to threaten russia militarily by trying to send large military hospital vessels through the turkish straits to georgia has backfired and it agreed to send smaller ships through the same route for humanitarian aid to georgia this time the us intended to exert pressure over russia but it didnt have any intention of violating the montreux convention
6587841 since the start of operation black sea harmony no major incidents have threatened the black sea thus we can say that operation black sea harmony has been a success so this has proven that there was no need for nato led naval exercises in the black sea
6587842 creo que es lo estaba pasando bien y probablemente tom demasiada comida con especias
6587843 este triunfo le da mucha confianza para afrontar lo que viene de su carrera ya que en lo que va del a o ha superado sus actuaciones del a o pasado lo que indica la madurez y mejor a que he alcanzado en mi juego
6587844 eh orcs trolls pots of gold blah blah blah who cares you were a fucking beatle
6587845 our efforts to investigate the matter are still ongoing by un military police who are in the field
6587846 we have been told that he was on the plane but his name is not among the wounded
6587847 we could not reach him after the crash we havent been able to receive any confirmation from spanish authorities whether he is alive or dead
6587848 we are waiting for good news we hold on to hope and everybody is praying for good news
6587849 i talked to his family they are anxiously awaiting news that he is ok
6587850 we were told he went to spain to look for ships as he is in the ship dismantling business it is certain that he boarded the plane but we dont know what happened to him
6587851 we cannot accept condolences as we are still hoping he is alright
6587852 erdil who is also deputy chairman of the ggdsd is a mechanical engineer he is also a great community activist who once organized the planting of 10 000 trees in his hometown
6587853 erdil was planning to go on a pilgrimage to the holy city of mecca we are still holding on to hope
6587854 knowing the plane was bad they took off with my 7 year old niece
6587855 we hope the very difficult and delicate task of identification can be done with the utmost efficiency
6587856 the plane was 15 years old and passed its annual inspection last year
6587857 a plane doesnt crash due to engine failure or a fire on take off
6587858 officials are acting like all the deaths were cause by flaws in the infertility system
6587859 structural problems and a lack of infrastructure were among the root causes of those deaths we dont have enough doctors and support personnel let alone a sufficient number of incubators for premature babies
6587860 limiting the number of embryo transfers to two will not solve the problem
6587861 in 2003 the fertility rate for women aged 35 39 and over 40 both increased by more than 7 percent
6587862 technology is now out there that can boost running noise of these electric cars and we would encourage its use in all new electric models
6587863 there are going to be more and more electric cars of different types on our roads in years to come so we need to be considering these issues now
6587864 the car is not completely silent when it is running as it does generate some road noise
6587865 drivers of cars such as ours have a responsibility to take care when they are driving and be aware that they do not put pedestrians at risk i have been driving this car for two years and have never had an accident with it
6587866 parents should think twice before sending their teens to these colleges or any others that have waved the white flag on underage and binge drinking policies
6587867 by signing onto this initiative these presidents have made the 21 law nearly unenforceable on their campuses in fact i call into question whether or not these campuses are bothering to enforce the 21 drinking age
6587868 drinking binge drinking drinking and driving and other alcohol related problems continue to be a major health and safety problem on college campuses
6587869 unfortunately the campaign map is still being finalized and we didnt get a chance to check it out
6587870 no lo conozco pero escuch que rudy ulloa el choferata de kirchner anda con 100 palos verdes y lo quiere comprar
6587871 charlie chaplin could do a better job running the home office than this labour government
6587872 we can confirm that mr gadd has left bangkok and is heading to the uk
6587873 the legal system has to accept the reality of the situation they are not trusted at all by the victims
6587874 they are held in contempt by the vast majority of the victims
6587875 the calf was in much worse condition than we originally thought and the injuries were a lot worse as well probably from a shark attack
6587876 we have taken the hard decision to put it down unfortunately
6587877 our hearts are breaking with whats happening with baby colin
6587878 you said youd give us a 24 hour stay of execution
6587879 our goal is for the chevrolet cruze to lead in fuel economy in this very competitive car segment
6587880 our dealers are asking for many more cobalts than we can build
6587881 nothing in this section shall be construed to affirm deny expand or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point prior to being born alive as defined in this section
6587882 a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
6587883 forget that human life is the supreme good in this world never forget that human dignity is not an expendable commodity but belongs to everyone without exception
6587884 a contractor working for the home office has lost a computer memory stick containing personal details about tens of thousands of criminals
6587885 the fbi appears to have adopted an invasive internet surveillance technique that collects far more data on innocent americans than previously has been disclosed
6587886 such a technique is broader and potentially more intrusive than the fbis carnivore surveillance system later renamed dcs1000
6587887 it raises concerns similar to those stirred by widespread internet monitoring that the national security agency is said to have done according to documents that have surfaced in one federal lawsuit and may stretch the bounds of whats legally permissible
6587888 but if we think of him in the biblical way as a divine person our thought will rather be
6587889 the conception of the holy spirit as a divine influence or power that somehow we are to get hold of and use leads to self exaltation and self sufficiency
6587890 here knowledge is ascribed to the holy spirit we are clearly taught that the holy spirit is not merely an influence that illuminates our minds to comprehend the truth but a being who himself knows the truth
6587891 here will is ascribed to the spirit and we are taught that the holy spirit is not a power that we get hold of and use according to our will but a person of sovereign majesty who uses us according to his will
6587892 in this passage mind is ascribed to the holy spirit
6587893 is a comprehensive word including the ideas of thought feeling and purpose
6587894 so then in this passage we have all the distinctive marks of personality ascribed to the holy spirit
6587895 we dwell often on the love of god the father it is the subject of our daily and constant thought
6587896 each day of our lives we also look up into the face of our lord and saviour jesus christ and say
6587897 here both intelligence and goodness are ascribed to the holy spirit
6587898 to sink into our hearts and become the motto of our lives they will keep us from many a sin
6587899 this passage sets before us the holy spirit not merely as an illumination whereby we are enabled to grasp the deep things of god but a person who himself searches the deep things of god and then reveals to us the precious discoveries which he has made
6587900 here the holy spirit is set before us not merely as an impersonal enlightenment that comes to our mind but as a person who speaks and out of the depths of his own wisdom whispers into the ear of his listening servant the precious truth of god
6587901 here the holy spirit is represented as crying out in the heart of the individual believer
6587902 it is plain from this passage that the holy spirit is not merely an influence that moves us to pray not merely an illumination that teaches us how to pray but a person who himself prays in and through us
6587903 here the holy spirit is set before us as a person who gives his testimony to jesus christ not merely as an illumination that enables the believer to testify of christ but as a person who himself testifies and a clear distinction is drawn in this and the following verse between the testimony of the holy spirit and the testimony of the believer to whom he has borne his witness for we read in the next verse
6587904 so there are two witnesses the holy spirit bearing witness to the believer and the believer bearing witness to the world
6587905 and in a similar way we read in john 16 12 14
6587906 he is not merely an influence that enables us to see the way that god would have us go nor merely a power that gives us strength to go that way but a person who takes us by the hand and gently leads us on in the paths in which god would have us walk
6587907 here it is a person who takes the direction of the conduct of paul and his companions and a person whose authority they recognize and to whom they instantly submit
6587908 there can be no doubt to a candid seeker after truth that it is a person and a person of divine majesty and sovereignty who is here set before us
6587909 our lord had announced to the disciples that he was about to leave them
6587910 if this comforter whom he was to send was simply an impersonal influence or power
6587911 here we are told that the holy spirit is rebelled against and grieved cf
6587912 here we have the holy spirit represented as one who can be lied to one cannot lie to anything but a person
6587913 here we are told that the holy spirit is blasphemed against
6587914 2 corinthians 13 14 and while you hear it do you take in the significance of it
6587915 we asked a gaggle of writers from the web from print from books even a tv guy or two to tell us in as many or as little words as they need why my team is better than your team
6587916 whys my team is better than your team heres 50 reasons
6587917 blue collar steelers playing like the steelworkers that watch them
6587918 nature appears uniform a worldview without a god cannot explain why this would be the case therefore it is rational to believe that a god exists
6587919 lightning keeps occuring a worldview without an angry god casting down thunderbolts from mount olympus cannot explain why this would be the case therefore it is rational to believe that zeus exists
6587920 nope i think that the existence of the universe and the constancy of the natural laws do imply that there is some sort of divinity out there which at least set things in motion even if i dont conclude from this that its likely to be any kind of a personal god
6587921 vast primordial void that existed prior to the creation of the manifest universe
6587922 clearly referring to setting the laws of motion in play and the physical underpinnings of the universe that allow all the celestial bodies to maintain the orbits they do islam has totally got the uniformity of nature covered
6587923 this is what im gonna do when my dog dies
6587924 the infrastructure work for the russian pilgrimage house the roman catholic church on the east bank of the jordan river as well as the greek orthodox monastery have been completed and others are on track as planned
6587925 once the churches are built and monks and priests settle in the entire concept of the site will be transformed from a historically important site to a leading destination for christian pilgrimage
6587926 seigneur jaimerais savoir comment est le paradis et comment est lenfer
6587927 if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours
6587928 peculiar to christs sacrifice are the infinite value of victim which give the sacrifice an infinite value of expiation and as merit

6587943 we spelen om te winnen maar tegelijkertijd willen we laten zien ook met dit elftal een goede wedstrijd op het hoogste niveau te kunnen spelen
6587944 ik weet het wel maar de spelers krijgen het eerst te horen
6587945 twelve 14 max and theyre telling the world they are 16 what arrogance
6587946 the girls are so little so young they say they are 16 but i dont know
6587947 more information has come to light that did point to discrepancies
6587948 we have asked the gymnastics federation to look into it further with the national chinese federation if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into as to why there is a discrepancy
6587949 these documents existed on a state wide website and now they dont exist and this change has taken place recently i was interested because these were documents that no one could find if theres information to be found on the internet im a citizen journalist it was a challenge
6587950 the listing in there quite clearly is he kexins birth date january 1 1994
6587951 the ioc relies on the international federations who are exclusively responsible for the eligibility of athletes
6587952 much of the coverage regarding kexins age has only mentioned allegations of fraud and the ioc has ignored the matter completely i believe that these primary documents issued by the chinese state rise to a level of evidence higher than allegation how official are these documents pretty dang official they were issued by the general administration of sport of china
6587953 my real age is 16 i dont care what other people say i want other people to know that 16 is my real age
6587954 the road i walk is paved in gold to glorify my platinum soul
6587955 this is one of the most flamboyant flaming relapses ive ever seen
6587956 i think your honour would struggle to find a more egregious breach
6587957 i want to reward you for the efforts youve made
6587958 als ik zie hoe ajax toch de club van de opleiding in een jaar tijd zon acht dertigers heeft gekocht dan is dat een veeg teken
6587959 een signaal dat er blijkbaar onvoldoende kwaliteit vanuit de opleiding wordt afgeleverd waarvan jongens die zelfs het nederlands elftal halen niet weten hoe ze aan de binnen kant moeten dekken
6587960 dat gat wordt intussen gedicht door allemaal spelers van boven de dertig te halen
6587961 een paar is natuurlijk geen probleem maar van de huidige situatie word ik niet bepaald vrolijk
6587962 ja ik was heel dicht bij een overgang naar arsenal
6587963 ars ne wenger probeerde me aan te trekken op het moment dat ze mijn vriend eduardo een contract lieten tekenen het was een eer dat een manager als wenger die bewezen heeft goed samen te werken met jonge talenten interesse in me had maar ik besloot te wachten

6587966 the board and i selected jim for this role because he is a highly experienced retail turnaround executive
6587967 i believe he will be a great partner to me and the rest of the management team as we focus on ways to improve our business todays announcement shows that the management team remains fully committed to delivering value to shareholders in the near term through the successful execution of our turnaround plan meanwhile the board continues to pursue strategic alternatives for the company that offer the best possible results for our shareholders in the long term
6587968 we zijn heel blij dat we weer een speler van dit kaliber aan onze selectie kunnen toevoegen
6587969 denny is in onze ogen het type speler waar dit elftal momenteel behoefte aan heeft
6587970 millions of dollars from the military to write op eds and be quoted in newspapers
6587971 the cda must place the department of national defence directorate of public policy on its distribution list for upcoming events conferences and receive this information at the same time as members
6587972 the department of national defence directorate of public policy reserves the right to attend events for assessment purposes and to visit the cda throughout the funding cycle
6587973 transactional managers people in authority who have the power and influence to keep the status quo afloat into the future in times of change we want transformational leaders rather than transactional managers
6587974 transformational leaders such as paul challenge people to change and grow to look at the world in new ways this is rarely a smooth journey since the status quo tends to have a stronger hold on the imagination and heart than any exciting vision of the future
6587975 that is why leaders who talk about new ways of seeing being and doing must adopt an encouraging leadership style if they care about their followers the alternative is to manipulate people based on their fears and anxieties transformational leaders do not offer inducements or manipulative tokens rather they seek to energize and inspire others through passion vision personal values and reciprocal commitments in short they seek to transform others this sounds a lot like paul
6587976 in de zomer zal marco van basten daar wel trainer worden toch lijkt me een prima keuze hij is een echte ajax man die zonder overdreven goed voetbal resultaat heeft geboekt met oranje

6588057 our results show that hot flushes night sweats sleeplessness and joint pains were less common in women on hrt in this age group sexuality was also improved
6588058 overall quality of life measures improved even when women did not have hot flushes and were well past menopause there was a small but measurable improvement in quality of life and a noted improvement in sleep sexuality and joint pains hrt users also had more breast tenderness and discharge compared to those on a placebo
6588059 these new data should be added to the risk benefit equation for hrt the quality of life benefits of hrt may be greater in women with more severe symptoms near menopause new research suggests that hrt taken from near menopause avoids the cardiovascular risks seen when hrt is initiated many years after menopause
6588060 enable the risks of hrt to be reduced and its benefits maximized when the treatment is individualized to each woman
6588061 early start up side effects can usually be alleviated by adjusting the treatment
6588062 for most women with significant menopause symptoms the benefits of hrt outweigh the risks
6588063 if a woman feels that hrt is needed for quality of life then doctors can find the safest regimen for her she can try going off hrt every 4 5 years and can then make an informed choice about whether she takes and continues hrt

6588075 this report from wisdom is reassuring that there are real benefits for some women electing to use hrt while it has been well established that quality of life measures are improved in younger symptomatic women this paper adds some information that even older women may benefit while some of this information was reported from the whi which used the same hormonal regimen more sensitive instruments were used in wisdom which was able to show improvements in other measures such as sexual function while this is important information and is reassuring regarding the benefits of hrt these findings in isolation are not an indication to initiate hormones in asymptomatic older women for the first time
6588076 this is a significant study which supports our views on hrt it shows that hrt can offer real benefits to most women experiencing menopausal symptoms our advice remains the same each woman is an individual and she needs to discuss whats right for her with her doctor in the light of her medical history this study reinforces the benefits of appropriate use

6588083 it is very encouraging to see the isle of wight maintain the upward momentum we saw last year when we broke the 50 percent barrier for the first time in particular carisbrooke and medina have shown high increases in the all important five or more a c grades we are on the right road and that needs to continue over the next year
6588084 i send my congratulations to all students and staff who have returned these encouraging results it is pleasing to see the isle of wight has improved from last year and our aim now must be to continue this trend onto 2009 and beyond
6588085 we thank taittinger enormously for their support and hope that you will all enjoy our regatta both on and off the water make new friends and enjoy good courses and competitive racing
6588086 because the event was compact and there werent thousands and thousands of bodies you actually got to meet people and have a good time
6588087 the courses with the long reaches were perfect for classic boats you get the chance to settle in and really enjoy the racing im only a bit sad the final shorter race on sunday didnt go on for longer it was so enjoyable i didnt want it to end
6588088 i couldnt have done better if id have organised it myself there was always a launch ready to offer us a tow and the organisers were a great help as for the racing heading west from yarmouth along the shoreline close in on sunday was spectacular although i think we upset quite a few fishermen on the beach
6588089 the party at the towers ive never been to anything quite like it
6588090 i dont know who thought of inviting the 6 metres to the regatta but it was a masterstroke and all the boats competing this year will certainly be back next year along with some more entries im sure
6588091 we had a lot of tough competition from desperado and le quatre juillet we were far from perfect but we got some things right
6588092 the courses were great fun and there was a wonderful social side we have every intention of coming back next year
6588093 theres been a fantastic reception overall to the taittinger royal solent yacht club regatta and a very positive reaction all round
6588094 the whole event had three vital key components onshore and afloat good racing good organisation and most importantly a lot of good fun

6588120 this campaign will focus on motorcyclists and young drivers these are the two groups of road users who tend to drive too fast for the road conditions
6588121 we have had success in reducing the number of children killed seriously injured or injured on our country roads during the past number of years and overall road casualty numbers are falling
6588122 but when you look closely at the statistics for young drivers and motorcyclists in their 30s and 40s the numbers killed and injured are going up
6588123 some of the lads will have been out on the ground for 30 hours when they get back they want to have a shower and go to bed instead they will have a shower and get ready for the visit

6588125 we have put on notice city councils school boards and other bodies throughout the state that conduct at large elections that we will sue them if their voting is characterized by racially polarized voting voting is perhaps our most cherished liberty and any attempt to dilute that vote will be challenged
6588126 from 1996 to 2004 as a result of racially polarized voting four latino candidates failed to win school board positions these candidates would all have been elected based on latino votes but were defeated by bloc voting from non latino voters
6588127 the cases we are bringing under the california voting rights act will prove to be important in helping to empower voters who have been excluded from the electoral process for many years school districts throughout the state who use at large election systems should seriously consider whether they should immediately begin the process of converting to district based election systems

6588140 and i must confess my jaw was wide open during the whole first listen
6588141 wilco production wise an alt country masterpiece and as far as songs are concerned a very solid and challenging collection that makes me proud to say
6588142 which by title alone brings up issues many will be uncomfortable with and asks questions which society as a whole often shy away from
6588143 an alt country performance that oddly enough rings with shades of mid 80s tears for fears police and duran duran
6588144 ive written about before in this blog there was a time a few years back when matthew amp i used to occasionally play out together in the athens atlanta area at places like eddies attic amp the beanry and hes the fellow who introduced me to indelible graces music he appears on most if not all of their cds
6588145 and though the whole c d has not yet grabbed me it holds promise and a few singles which have already probably made it into my favorite new music of 08 list
6588146 which has already enjoyed some popularity as an itunes single after appearing in a number of popular prime time television shows
6588147 which show cases a nice piano hook and great lyrics that seem to explore the future of a significant intimate relationship with its anthemic chorus its hard not to note u2s influence on matthews otherwise southern acoustic folk style

6588151 wholesale includes large operation storage selling in bulk and no frills those kinds of things
6588152 the issue that has been raised is what is costco is costco a different kind of operation than fred meyer a different kind of operation than target whats the line between wholesale and retail in this particular case because of the way they put their merchandise together the way they store their merchandise what they provide in the store their sales generally are presumed to be wholesale
6588153 is there a distinction or a legal nuance that you can be a retail operation and a wholesale and a warehouse under the same roof
6588154 do you have to be one or the other it seems to me that costco is a combination of those things and does that cause a problem in interpreting the ordinance from a legal perspective if there was a challenge to come down the road
6588155 i dont see anything in the ordinance at all that requires them to be one or the other as opposed to some kind of amalgamation of them
6588156 so theyre clearly a retail operation that also does warehousing and wholesale and thats ok you dont have to be one or the other
6588157 we know stephens will have some congestion on it but no worse than we already thought was going to be out there
6588158 a lot of that is because of development thats happening in winchester quite a few housing subdivisions are happening out in the winchester area
6588159 i think twitter is more prone easier less commited than blogs to express tacit know how and to offer help which also shares tacit know how actually conversation is where its at and an internal twitter marketed the right way will be the optimal example of what we want out of km 2 0 conversation exchange

6588161 i was afraid id never get em before that truck turned around and came back but then this young whippersnapper came out of nowhere and picked em all up for me
6588162 he left right away but i had the notes in my wallet by the truck came back they asked me if id seen the money so i said this guy picked em all up gave them a pretty good description of him too
6588163 its just another day as far as something new in getting back
6588164 its just different being on a mound rather than just playing catch
6588165 its a different feeling it will be good to see everything has felt good to this point
6588166 obviously if he comes out of saturday fairly well i think theres a good chance that hell take the next step thatd either be on monday or tuesday
6588167 we liked the way pavano was throwing the ball and we felt that hughes needed some more work
6588168 hes pitched in big games before hes pitched in the playoffs youre not talking about a kid coming up that is a rookie and doesnt have a ton of innings under his belt in the big leagues were expecting him to throw well and keep us in the game and give us an opportunity if he can go six innings it would be great
6588169 obviously hes very excited to be back in the big leagues and to pitch for the club
6588170 his plan and his focus was to make it back this year and obviously he worked extremely hard to put himself in this position
6588171 obviously his command wasnt there his breaking ball wasnt sharp
6588172 i let a couple of them go and it felt good
6588173 when one guy is out there playing the game despite whatever is going on and somebody else is not thats how teammates get bad tastes in their mouths
6588174 i think hell be welcomed with open arms im not asking him to make amends im just asking him to come and compete
6588175 i just saw it as somebody who kept getting hurt
6588176 this is a big month and a half for him he knows he needs to prove not only to us but to the rest of baseball that hes still healthy and that he can pitch in the big leagues
6588177 security forces arrested him when he tried to enter nouadhibou and turned him over to the police who are bringing him to the capital now

6588180 i learned a few years ago i was born in the year of the snake
6588181 when i realized it i became at peace with myself snakes they slide around on their bellies you know they feel themselves around and they live in the moment this is how i find my best ideas i feel most comfortable when i react in the moment like a snake
6588182 the snake often thinks hes more clever than he really is not everything i do is perfect
6588183 europe is always wonderful i love europe i could live there or i think i could i love the caf society watching the world go by when im in berlin with my guitar and i have a show that night im most happy im not overly euro
6588184 i recognize i am culturally american but theres an old world relaxation there which is refreshing and if youre an urban fellow like i am this is the way its supposed to be its civilized ive had similar kinds of feelings on evenings in greece and sweden where i think wowy why cant it be this good when im in cleveland in the states theres this urban industrial bla ness or ennui this existential reality of bleak ongoing hallways and lonely hotel bars
6588185 its overt and full of itself theres not a lot of soul its not very fun people refer to s later records as dark and haunting intense and theatrical but his recordings are so playful i think theyre a delight i dont hear that on modern radio
6588186 soon ill tune into my favorite station between san francisco and los angeles
6588187 it comes in better on the 5 than on the 101 its king of county radio its around 100 and they play early 50s music there arent a lot of commercials and they make interesting playlists that are off the top 50
6588188 they are fighting and dying while at home they are talking about slashing and cutting
6588189 far too big a mismatch between our aspirations and what we actually deliver
6588190 it seems the taliban the insurgency are prepared to carry out more frontal kinds of operations
6588191 the military alone has always been insufficient to counter an insurgency which remains essentially a political activity
6588192 a military coalition is a cumbersome weapon to use in a transnational counter insurgency campaign and rudderless without a unified political coalition

6588198 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
6588199 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
6588200 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic

6588250 being at the low end of the totem pole coming in ive just got to keep grinding
6588251 each year that i come in i feel like ive got to prove myself and play like its my last year its always an uphill climb for the free agent guy coming in youve just got to work your butt off and show what you can do

6588426 i havent seen him in a long time but basically baseball shape baseball ready
6588427 just kind of talk to him and see where he is also mentally
6588428 i strongly believe that eddie lewis will be an outstanding addition to the galaxy
6588429 he brings great experience to the club and will be a wonderful addition to our locker room and is a player that the fans are sure to support
6588430 unfortunately the sport of soccer is also a business and in order to bring eddie to the galaxy we were required to make salary budget space available and our only available option was to move carlos

6588434 ekphrasis or ecphrasis is the graphic often dramatic description of a visual work of art in ancient times it referred to a description of any thing person or experience the word comes from the greek ek and phrasis out and speak respectively verb ekphrazein to proclaim or call an inanimate object by name
6588435 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6588436 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6588437 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
6588438 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6588439 oh by the way you need to do this too which i realise totally throws off everything you were already doing
6588440 as a precautionary measure we have closed the office and staff are being examined by medical personnel
6588441 i dont believe in vengeance vengeance is a personal thing for personal gain to aim for victory is to aim to win a situation but to do so with the best intentions in mind not for power or personal gain justice is seeing people do right and making sure they do right to others vengeance is more an emotional reaction they just want payback its a negative emotion that can fester in most cases youll never find peace
6588442 its not rocket science the set up of the team was wrong if you are asking why then it has to be the coach doesnt it
6588443 it got to pickering he should not have been on that leg
6588444 its all my fault i have let myself down the team down the country down everyone
6588445 i cant believe im standing here with an olympic silver medal and im really pissed
6588446 it the silver is not what i wanted but ill take it
6588447 if you dont mind me asking what happened to his hand

6588450 why because ip is all about the very first time the aha moment the creative spark that gives rise to previously undreamed imaginings
6588451 sealed the romantic view of youth as beset by storms and stresses so much so that premature death by suicide or accident was symptomatic
6588452 celebrated him as a misunderstood genius whose youth made permanent by death would never fade
6588453 robert johnson to whom we all owed our existence in some way
6588454 im mostly influenced by pythagoras bach and ray charles in that order
6588455 but if theres such a thing as karma he could be poster boy for it
6588456 when you mention vic godard everybody still goes who only the real cognoscenti know who he is i first met him when i was stood outside the lyceum in edinburgh he was playing with subway sect along with the slits and the jam but subway sect were my favourites i asked if i could carry his gear in i didnt meet him again until 1991 or 1992 geoff travis put us together and i produced vics album end of the surrey people paul cook was his drummer by then and he was a bit cagy a bit protective he thought i was taking the piss
6588457 i was on the same episode of later as they were but i missed them because i was too nervous i heard their album a little while later and loved it the way theyre hairy rough looking middle americans but they sing nobodys gonna love you more they could do well on american country stations but their sound doesnt really slot in there either i saw them at shepherds bush empire they played three encores and people went shhhh in the quiet bits i think that qualifies them as a cult band
6588458 he is the cult heros cult hero especially for the big star albums the third is his masterpiece there are no rules on it none at all most albums have some kind of theme but this is as disjointed as music gets and somehow its sublime hes gone on to influence other cult heroes like the cocteau twins and jeff buckley would i like to meet him yeah we could have a chat over a bottle of white wine but id like to know what kind of mood hed be in first
6588459 skip spence was the drummer for jefferson airplane before he became the singer guitarist and leading light of moby grape his contributions to their first three albums were marked by a wild logic rare even in those extreme times just listen to omaha indifference motorcycle irene or seeing the last is just like syd barretts scream thy last scream being a tone poem of madness and despair institutionalised in new yorks bellevue hospital after a violent episode he travelled to nashville at the end of 1968 to record his masterpiece oar he looked brilliant the cover is one of the most iconic pictures of the period spence died in 1999 leaving a 90 minute or so legacy of some of the most extreme psychedelic music ever made
6588460 i spent a lot of time and energy on it the harp isnt something that you just pick up and it was fucking cut out it really hurts
6588461 he thinks i was demanding and a real handful but i think i went along almost 90 of the time without questioning his vision
6588462 im very lucky to have the career ive had when i think of the piece of nothing roles that i could be playing in which your character is just a romantic plot device your body is your only stock in trade and you effectively have nothing to contribute artistically to the process i feel very lucky indeed
6588463 there was a period of time when i felt i had to be ashamed of it
6588464 i know its not a piece of art but its a film im really proud of it has a good story and the central character is very bright i would be happy to watch it with one of my cousins and say actually this is a good message for young women
6588465 i think i managed to convince my parents into this by putting up the image of being a very serious and responsible teenager
6588466 i spent a lot of time in my room reading she puts a heavy ironic stress on the word i think that persuaded my parents it would be a good experience for me and it was but it taught me very quickly that i was nowhere near as grown up as i thought i was
6588467 for a long time i wanted to be a writer but i think i thought more about the act of writing than about writing itself i imagined myself sitting at a desk in a flowing dressing gown with my head in my hands so theres probably a reason that didnt blossom into a career
6588468 it isnt just work its peoples lives and passions and you think this isnt something i can do just to pass the time
6588469 i thought there is nothing i would rather do for a living i love my job in a very limited way i feel im reasonably good at it and morally its not a bad choice for my life as long as you do good things that you really believe in that you feel have some kind of purpose what more could any human being want from their job
6588470 in what i do theres a huge reliance on your emotions and your emotional life so quite frankly i need to sit down for eight hours a week and make notes and study and have an awareness of how much i dont know
6588471 you know that it has a direct connection of some sort with the automatic weapon pointing at your back
6588472 my six year old nephew was saved but we dont know what happened to his sister
6588473 roberto is in hospital they say he is injured but not seriously he has been sedated and is unconscious he is alive at least we dont know anything of his sister
6588474 i grabbed the arm of my partner jos and looked at gema my sister in law then the plane came to a sharp stop i heard a horrible noise i was thrown forward
6588475 i reached for jos put out my hand to touch him i saw what looked like a doll which fell on the ground i realised this person was dead i knew it wasnt jos
6588476 the days of assuming that older people are dependants must come to an end
6588477 the government must face up to the reality of an ageing population and make a firm commitment to improve health services like mental health and foot care which enable people to stay healthy and independent for longer
6588478 the oral health of the nation has improved dramatically over the last 10 years thanks to fluoride toothpaste fluoridated water and greater awareness of the importance of oral hygiene
6588479 since labour introduced its botched untested new contract well over one million people more than the entire population of birmingham have lost access to an nhs dentist
6588480 at the moment my focus is on doing well in the odis against south africa and im not looking beyond that at this stage
6588481 its something i have been thinking about for a period of time and due to recent injuries in the england camp the opportunity has arisen for me to play a role in this series
6588482 having missed out on selection at various times this year i am well aware of the disappointment that comes from not being a part of the england dressing room with that in mind i want to be a part of the team and if that means bringing myself out of retirement to play a role in this series then im happy to do just that
6588483 concentrating solely on test cricket is the best way forward for me during the next phase of what will hopefully be a long england career
6588484 the last week has been slow and mentally draining and the bad weather has played a role in all of that
6588485 it is not easy to pick yourself up when you have been on tour a long time we have been away a lot this year and the guys are thinking about home hopefully the rain is not englands secret weapon
6588486 he was with a group of friends on the 13th floor when they became concerned about another group cycling towards the tower block they tried to leave the area and the victim became separated from his friends he climbed out of the tower block via an open balcony and reached the seventh floor where he couldnt carry on and fell to his death
6588487 i was in the bathroom and i saw the body falling through the air i live on the third floor and i saw the shadow of the body falling i didnt see him hit the ground but i went to look outside because i heard the crash and looked out and saw the body lying there he was facing towards the sky but his eyes were closed there was another boy standing over him saying oh my god hes dead hes dead
6588488 he ran away from the group and he went up the stairs and he got to the 12th floor and was climbing down a man who was looking out of his window said the boy got to the eighth floor and then they were banging on his hands they banged his hands to make him fall to make sure he lost his grip
6588489 there was a boy lying on the ground and a group of boys were crying one of them was on the phone saying theyve pushed him off the 13th floor the paramedics were trying and trying to resuscitate him they really tried
6588490 ive spoken to his family and they are most proud of the fact that he got a c in maths and a c in science he also got two other c grades
6588491 he was just a boy he was loving and caring and he got along with everybody it didnt matter who you were he would talk to anyone
6588492 he was so excited to get his results and he spoke about them all the time and how he was going to college in september
6588493 we dont know where he was going but we assume he was there at the wrong time at the wrong place he fell but thats all we know
6588494 he was like my brother i was at my house with a mate when he gets a call and said ahmed just got dashed off the block
6588495 i came down and i saw him lying on the floor it was horrible he was a good guy he didnt smoke at all or anything like that he took life seriously hes even scared of heights one time we couldnt even get him to climb over the second floor
6588496 the government should open up the youth club and get kids doing activities we used to get people coming from the other estates to go on trips and do things together that doesnt happen anymore none of us are interested in smoking and getting in trouble but weve got nothing else to do dont judge a book by its cover
6588497 more students were taking gcses early in november especially in english and maths and this meant fewer entries in this summers results students are focusing their efforts more tightly on a smaller range of subjects
6588498 ive spoken to a number of schools who are talking about a more flexible approach to years nine 10 and 11 about targeting different pupils with different levels of ability to move at different paces in different subjects its not uncommon now for some schools to be starting some pupils in some gcses in year nine to create more headroom in the last years of school to move on to a level
6588499 its driven by league tables because 31 is happiness to a school and 29 is abject misery
6588500 schools are focusing on quality rather than quantity it makes sense for students to concentrate on eight or nine gcses rather than 11 or 12 and to do them well
6588501 i particularly welcome the record results in english and maths and the sharp rise in entries in biology physics and chemistry the overall increase in pass rates and top grades is built firmly on improvements in the key subjects of english and maths
6588502 he started doing simple maths questions and puzzles at two
6588503 there is no evidence that fundamental conditions are improving for customers or retail businesses consumer confidence remains low unemployment is rising and the housing market weakening
6588504 its hard to see what could produce the sales growth boost ons are reporting or their finding that smaller retailers are outperforming larger ones
6588505 should be taken with a pinch of salt given that the official sales data have been unusually volatile over the past few months
6588506 todays data adds little to the monetary policy debate the mpc has discussed the official data in great detail and it has found it inconsistent with the surveys and the fundamentals much like the mpc we recommend that the data be treated with extreme caution
6588507 in our view the committee is unlikely to cut policy rates if inflation outturns continue to surprise on the upside especially if the strength is driven from core components
6588508 in the minutes to the august mpc meeting the committee had noted official numbers somewhat at variance with the weak survey results for the second quarter of the year to june and we suspect that the mpc will maintain the assessment for july
6588509 this clearly illustrates why its so important to have binding agreements between countries which will prevent sex offenders hopping from one place to another this case is important because it highlights how easy it is for uk offenders to move around freely when overseas
6588510 the conduct of the security service facilitated interviews by or on behalf of the united states when mohamed was being detained by the united states incommunicado and without access to a lawyer
6588511 all security service staff have an awareness of the human rights act 1998 and are fully committed to complying with the requirements of the law when working in the uk and overseas
6588512 do not participate in solicit encourage or condone the use of torture or inhumane or degrading treatment
6588513 to the extent of making it clear to mohamed that the united kingdom government would not help him unless he cooperated fully with the united states authorities
6588514 the relationship of the united kingdom government to the united states authorities in connection with mohamed was far beyond that of a bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing
6588515 as he will not be able to try to establish the only answer he has to the confessions namely that they were involuntary and abstracted from him by wrongful treatment
6588516 however unfortunately when faced with the choice between the rule of law and upsetting its allies the americans it waivers in this commitment
6588517 for strong reasons of national security to which the court accepted we were entitled to give the highest weight we could not agree to disclose this information voluntarily
6588518 the british government may have been accused of being bushs poodle but the british courts remain bulldogs when it comes to human rights
6588519 talking to people who could provide life saving intelligence is mi5s bread and butter
6588520 these days there are fewer jobs due to stricter building regulations and the rising cost of materials
6588521 there have always been peaks and troughs in the construction industry but the peaks are much lower than they used to be and the troughs much deeper
6588522 we are trying to create a sense of community here its not all bad news
6588523 its a mans world all they have to look forward to is an evening meal of cheap grilled meat and plenty to drink and the freedom to sleep it off where they drop
6588524 i dont drink or smoke and the clothes im standing in cost less than 800 yen
6588525 ive never had a pair of shoes worth more than 1 000 yen
6588526 some people are working out of town but a lot have decided to sleep rough tonight
6588527 we dont allow any alcohol here so on a hot evening like this they prefer to drink outside and sleep in the park
6588528 we have a freedom that other japanese dont have we get three meals a day and its easy to make friends ive made lots of friends here over the years and ive seen lots of them die
6588529 in all topics mr obama displays a similar worried serious looking facial pattern even when talking about more positive subjects his facial expressions do not signal positive affective states
6588530 there is an element of the fact that he is on the edges of his comfort zone here
6588531 going into a presidential campaign is not something he has done before and you could say it is written all over his face
6588532 the dominating attitude as transmitted by his vocal style is that of concern and sincere involvement
6588533 his smile is often not fully developed ie his cheek raising muscles do not participate enough in the expression of positive affect to be perceived as genuine
6588534 such an important player to go at a knock down price
6588535 until the transfer market closes we do not give this matter up as closed the president ram n calder n has promised robinho that if the club is presented with an offer of 40m he will be allowed to leave
6588536 milan had wanted to take the player on loan with the right to buy him but chelsea said no because they wanted us to buy him outright
6588537 there were bodies lying everywhere and wounded people soaked in blood were screaming for help
6588538 only innocent people die when the pakistan army carries out air strikes in bajaur or swat
6588539 if the army is really fond of fighting it should send ground forces to see how we fight
6588540 this is just barbaric we have to devise a policy which is national which protects and serves our own interests
6588541 i dont believe that from a usda standpoint we need to increase the number of inspectors or change the testing requirements
6588542 you start mandating things and that incentive to improve goes away

6588547 do the rights of religious freedom and free speech as guaranteed in both the federal and the california constitutions exempt a medical clinics physicians from complying with the california unruh civil rights acts prohibition against discrimination based on a persons sexual orientation our answer is no
6588548 i am a car driver but for now the bus look at me
6588549 did i transfer those downloads in my incoming folder to my c drive or did i just think about doing it
6588550 no you moron you only thought about it and never spent the 3 minutes it wouldve taken to do it because you were in to much of a fuckin hurry to get to l gare and get pissed
6588551 all of my friends are getting married and im getting drunk
6588552 two of your towels were pulled into willies cage theyre not tore up but we got a weird one
6588553 did you know that if you play prince at just the right moment you can get somebody to have sex with you even if they dont want to
6588554 yeah thats an old trick they hear that shit and they just need to fuck they dont know why and you just happen to be there
6588555 but youve got to come correct its got to be old prince im talking
6588556 yeah like so many of us prince is not what he once was
6588557 so tell me about this girl gwen if thats her real name
6588558 i just know you is all give you some long blonde hair and a set of double ds and youre a happy guy even if shes a fucking psycho

6588560 promote better understanding of the countrys recent political social and economic developments
6588561 out of unity comes security i dont think you can impose security from on top just look at yugoslavia for years it seemed as if everything was quiescent so i think we want to put unity first out of real unity which can only be based on understanding and mutual respect will come the kind of security that we really want and the people really want
6588562 terpujilah allah bapa tuhan kita yesus kristus bapa yang penuh belas kasihan dan allah sumber segala penghiburan yang menghibur kami dalam segala penderitaan kami sehingga kami sanggup menghibur mereka yang berada dalam bermacam macam penderitaan dengan penghiburan yang kami terima sendiri dari allah

6588565 we have been absolutely overwhelmed by demand and have turned photosynth com into a special static read only mode for the moment
6588566 we are nearly there and will be back up shortly

6588568 there is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or one day
6588569 to be able to wean down the dosage of the medication in small amounts and relatively quickly that is encouraging
6588570 this crack is moving and moving closer and closer to the front its just a matter of time till a much larger piece is going to break off it is imminent
6588571 as we see this phenomenon occurring further and further north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern
6588572 its a signal but we dont know what it means
6588573 the crack is not alarming i would say it is normal
6588574 negative or positive the challenge isnt just to tell the truth its to tell truth that resonates
6588575 we also came away impressed by the dish network vip622s downconversion capability which is important for tv2 watchers and dvd archiving we recorded a few episodes of the sopranos from hbo hd to dvd and the downconverted standard def picture didnt have the issues weve noticed on some dvrs in fact it looked pretty good significantly better than the same episode on the standard def hbo2 channel in our experience the scientific atlanta 8300hd a common high def cable box does an inferior job downconverting hd shows to standard def

6588579 without question the situation was not handled very well by officer stephens but the characterization of the story has led to death threats against the officer and his family
6588580 its just a dog you can buy another one relax
6588581 i dont feel a person like that should be working in law enforcement
6588582 according to neighbors city authorities were alerted eight or nine times regarding those dogs that is eight or nine missed opportunities to prevent mr piotrowskis death we question why the city failed to respond to complaints of loose and threatening dogs and reiterate our call for a full and complete investigation
6588583 it is critical that we educate our entire community especially our children and the elderly about safety around dogs and the importance of responsible humane restraint and containment
6588584 furthermore scientific evidence more definitive than articles discussing the dogs breeding history is necessary before it is established that pit bulls merely by virtue of their genetic inheritance are inherently vicious or unsuited for domestic living no statistical analysis is offered to demonstrate that a high percentage of the total number of pit bulls has engaged in violent incidents
6588585 children and dogs are as necessary to the welfare of the country as wall street and the railroads
6588586 failed messiah follows the controversy closely with links to related press articles and judicial records
6588587 there is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or liver transplants one day
6588588 to be able to wean down the dosage of the medication in small amounts and relatively quickly that is encouraging
6588589 when kidney transplants first began people were reluctant to donate because there were a lot of cultural social and religious issues
6588590 everyone says they would accept a face transplant if they were disfigured
6588591 the real question is would you be a donor or would you allow your family member to donate their face that is the answer we need to change
6588592 this crack is moving and moving closer and closer to the front its just a matter of time till a much larger piece is going to break off it is imminent
6588593 as we see this phenomenon occurring further and further north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern
6588594 its a signal but we dont know what it means
6588595 the crack is not alarming i would say it is normal
6588596 it could go back for miles and miles and theres no real mechanism to stop it
6588597 we had been discussing a viral campaign for three or four months now placing some stuff on the net so some of this was just wacky timing
6588598 this ensures that the legendary neumann sound is captured unchanged on the users hard disk with optimal quality
6588599 more information has come to light that did point to discrepancies
6588600 we have asked the gymnastics federation to look into it further with the national chinese federation if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into as to why there is a discrepancy
6588601 much of the coverage regarding kexins age has only mentioned allegations of fraud and the ioc has ignored the matter completely
6588602 i believe these primary documents issued by the chinese state rise to a level of evidence higher than allegation
6588603 i take it personally as a rematch because they beat us in 2006 and hopefully we can beat them
6588604 i was thinking im going to get a base hit all the way
6588605 we were pretty average it was a disappointing opening to the season and we were well beaten

6588635 the most serious threat to the united states is not someone hiding in a cave in pakistan but our own fiscal irresponsibility
6588636 when im out there i would hope that our teams a lot more confident that we can make big plays and when its nut cutting time they know the balls coming to me and i can make a play for us
6588637 hes always one of the top receivers in the league possibly the best receiver in the league
6588638 but he doesnt start out with the ball in his hands so its up to us to make sure he doesnt see the ball too often
6588639 it should be a very intense game and hopefully not too high scoring
6588640 hes one of those big play guys that you need to have on your team
6588641 hes the mvp of the league hes the best player on our team and just having him on the field just brings more attention to him and gets receivers jason clermont myself and clarence coleman more time to do things with the ball
6588642 its going to take the pressure off me and the double teams i feel that geroy and myself are the best two short side wide receivers together on the field so having him out is just going to make my job a lot easier and hopefully i can make his job easier
6588643 just knowing that hes going to be out there on the field you know hes going to draw a lot of attention defensively so whether or not hes getting the ball or other receivers it just opens up things more for your team
6588644 its just being a manager of the game taking care of the ball making good decisions eating popcorn and watching guys like ken yon rambo the top receiver in the west make plays on the other side
6588645 they pin their ears back early on and they try to get after the quarterback make big plays and cause turnovers
6588646 we were physical and we were able to chop down some of those guys up front were a physical team that plays hard
6588647 they bring this mindset that they think theyre tougher than us so we have to bring that mindset too
6588648 guys were picking themselves up off the ground left and right and if you dont have a bad taste in your mouth from that game you shouldnt be playing football

6588678 it is a good way to play against just about every side other than geelong but it does make you predictable
6588679 it gives opposition sides the chance to zone up against it and deny hawthorns midfielders space
6588680 in the period you are talking about their kicking efficiency would be down significantly part of that is to do with too many players kicking on their less dominant side
6588681 sam mitchell luke hodge they are two who do that if you have a chance at afl level to get on to your dominant foot then it shouldnt be a matter of choice
6588682 but the hawks are still a bloody good side and they will work through it
6588683 it will be pretty special to have daniel out there with me for my first game
6588684 when choco coach mark williams rang me on wednesday night and said i was in it was pretty exciting
6588685 when i found out that daniel was playing as well it made it even more exciting he didnt play last week because of an adductor strain and i was looking forward to making my debut with him
6588686 ive watched daniel play all my life and im just glad its turned out this way i think well have a good understanding together
6588687 its big for both of us and its big for the family
6588688 i go around to his house and hell come over to mine about three or four times a week
6588689 we hang out together and go to see a movie every now and then were pretty tight
6588690 its going to be a big jump but choco said they are confident in my ability to be able to do that
6588691 they said my running in the reserves is up to afl standard the pace will be a lot different but the physical side of the game will be pretty similar weve watched nick salter and matty westhoff do it in the past couple of weeks and im confident i can adjust to that level as well
6588692 they the power dont expect anything big of me this week
6588693 choco just said to go out and do what i do best to give it my best and bring some excitement and enthusiasm to the side hopefully i can kick a goal and set some up
6588694 whilst the result was extremely pleasing the club continues to encounter impediments unique to the sydney market that challenge our long term profitability
6588695 accordingly we continue to investigate ways of broadening our revenue base and reducing our reliance on on field performance
6588696 our result will reflect that the corporate market is under pressure and that household income is under pressure
6588697 it underlies the challenge we and the code have in growing the market the afl is committed to a team in western sydney in 2012 so this is a dose of reality it signals the challenge is enormous
6588698 weve built a foundation but we need a whole lot more before 2012
6588699 we are not opposed to the afls mandate but there are a lot of challenges before we prime the market for a second team
6588700 im really disappointed that he didnt actually go on and play 400
6588701 i feel that the modern day player even though a lot of people suggest otherwise has got a wonderful opportunity to do things like that
6588702 in our day pre season training was long and hard one in all in these days theyre looked after as individuals
6588703 theyre nursed through and the interchange is a fantastic tool you dont have to play the whole 100 minutes training during the week is tailored to the individual
6588704 i was hoping he would get to 400 games because i really do think more players should set their sights on longer careers
6588705 id say he could play on yeah but the thing is it depends on what he wants to do
6588706 its probably just a number i hadnt been taking much notice before simon madden st kildas ruck coach came up to me at training before the perth game and congratulated me
6588707 weve been so headlong into our campaign that i havent really taken much notice being here today with these guys tuck and bartlett brings it home a bit
6588708 i saw a lot of tucky because i was a mad bombers supporter barracking against him and hawthorn during the 80s
6588709 its a bit weird with simon involved here they were the blokes i loved madden and former st kilda coach tim watson plus neale daniher they were my three idols
6588710 hes been such a quiet individual bit like michael tuck so as a result hes not always in the paper or hes not writing columns or hes not appearing on television shows or on the radio so we tend to gravitate towards those who are
6588711 players who run hard all day show mental strength mental courage
6588712 he doesnt run into blokes and knock em down because thats not his style but the amount of running he does in a game and his short sharp bursts thats what makes him what he is
6588713 ive got no regrets what happened but i would have liked to play another year but the club thought it was best to go out on a good note
6588714 it takes a player of a certain quality to turn up week after week and still be arguably the best player in the game playing in a side that doesnt give you the support that a lot of other players get
6588715 i thought there was nothing to say he couldnt continue but as each year goes by it does get harder going out there
6588716 hes one of these players where the game stops around him and he sorts it out
6588717 thats very rare i liken him to a chess player rather than checkers because a chess player has to think three or four moves in front
6588718 he thinks about these three or four moves while hes in action that to me makes a very very talented player
6588719 i was on the right path to play us college basketball and try out for the nba but i lost the passion for it
6588720 i was impressed enough to think he was a good footballer but you dont see most of the other teams so you dont know how he compares
6588721 your recruiting staff has carte blanche he reminded me of a combination of league players im not going to say who but there was just enough about him
6588722 we have 125 security guards and about 40 police if it gets close some will come from other areas to the ground so if he gets to 98 or 99 goals we will have more security on hand on the ground to make sure everyone is safe
6588723 we are telling people not to run out but if they do in large numbers we have procedures in place to ensure everyone is safe everyone knows where to go and what to do if it happens
6588724 it depends if its safer to leave him there or take him off he will be surrounded by his teammates and then police and security
6588725 west coast have been briefed and they know where to mingle if he kicks it the umpires and some of the hawthorn players and the eagles down the other end will have their own separate security guards
6588726 i look forward to challenges when you come across guys who beat you in the past
6588727 its a bit of a spur to have a crack back and get one back on them its just a little thing a little game within a game
6588728 he just came to me at the start of the final and really played tight if i played forward he went with me and if i went on to the ball he stayed with me there
6588729 he worked the other way and got a little bit of support from his teammates which helps on that day he just played all over me and beat me pretty easily
6588730 hopefully we can get over the line but there are also a lot of little things going on within the game
6588731 the guys who have beat me in the past i really enjoy coming up against them again mentally physically hes got the whole lot
6588732 i played on him this year at telstra dome and then he went on to simmo adam simpson in the second half it will be interesting to see if i do get ling
6588733 corey enright has done pretty well on me in the past and me being the smaller forward and moving up on to the ball i could get ling or enright or even max rooke its interesting to see
6588734 i dont know if they tag super hard any more
6588735 a lot of players play on you and try to negate you but he is one player that you have to work just as hard when you havent got the footy
6588736 most guys you play on you can relax a bit and dont have to run too hard the other way but when you play on lingy he tests you and he goes forward and is a great mark and a great kick and hes just a real good player

6588747 sudah neraca atau balance sheet nya merah profit and loss merah dan cash flow merah jadi sebetulnya secara finansial sebenarnya sudah bangkrut tapi bisa bertahan karena secara operasional kita punya orang orang yang hebat pilot pilot kita hebat kemudian engineer kita hebat itu yang membuat kuat tenaga tenaga lapangan hebat kan sayang cuma karena jumlah pesawatnya dari tahun ke tahun turun terus
6588748 sisanya dari rp 300 miliar untuk memperbaiki profit and loss dengan cara memperbaiki revenue dengan cara memperbaiki pesawat pesawat yang sementara ini diparkir karena tidak punya uang kalau biaya perawatan sih ada dari 18 pesawat yang beroperasi kalau bisa kita tingkatkan menjadi 25 pesawat sehingga bisa perbaiki bisnis

6588770 most teachers hold themselves accountable they didnt go into teaching to make money they dont have seven houses
6588771 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6588772 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
6588773 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6588774 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
6588775 conduct of the security service facilitated interviews by or on behalf of the us when binyam mohamed was being detained by the us incommunicado
6588776 compelling the british government to release information that can prove mr mohameds innocence is one obvious step towards making up for the years of torture that he has suffered the next step is for the british government to demand an end to the charade against him in guantanamo bay and return him home to britain
6588777 reflects the abhorrence of decent society at the methods employed by the us government in the supposed war on terror we can only hope the foreign secretary will reflect on this judgment and provide direct assistance to binyams defence team

6588780 this clearly illustrates why its so important to have binding agreements between countries which will prevent sex offenders hopping from one place to another and possibly going underground where they will pose a serious threat to children
6588781 offenders like glitter can and should be chaperoned while being deported back to the uk where they can be properly monitored it is disappointing this latest development was not anticipated and proper arrangements put in place to make this work
6588782 this case is important because it highlights how easy it is for uk offenders to move around freely when they are overseas even those who pose a high risk to children

6588787 the combination of rapidly declining consumer confidence pressure on household incomes fuel price increases and emission regulations has resulted in the second hand car market being hit extremely hard in the first half of the year
6588788 highlighting the large gap between the expectations of vendors and buyers in the current market
6588789 the overall market was down 6 5 per cent or 33 000 units compared to 2007 levels this is the lowest number of second hand cars sold in a 6 month period since 2002
6588790 sales of repossessed vehicles on behalf of finance companies have been strong up 106 per cent year to date and the commercial business has undertaken more insolvency work
6588791 an extensive review of the property requirement for the group has been carried out resulting in some short term savings through amalgamation of branches or subletting properties
6588792 this has enabled the company to keep property costs in line with 2007 which is pleasing given the upward trend in commercial rents staff expenses are higher compared to last year due to the impact of legislative changes affecting holiday pay and the minimum wage
6588793 as indicated at the agm in april the company committed to investing in a repositioning of the turners brand with a large advertising and public relations campaign completed over the may to july period which has resulted in a significant increase in awareness levels
6588794 we are probably still on a growth trajectory before we get to the stage when the uk presence can begin to thin out
6588795 one of the characteristics of counter insurgency unlike conventional war is the more successful you are in the short term the more troops you require
6588796 the more ground and the more people you become responsible for the more troops you need
6588797 i could use more helicopters any tactical operational commander could but there is no point in thinking that aviation is going to make a strategic difference
6588798 you make our country proud every day of the week and every week of the year
6588799 they the taliban fighters are recognised for what they are a brutal criminally orientated terrorist organisation with no interest in the afghan population
6588800 the local population is overwhelmingly hostile to the taliban the taliban is quite tactically resilient but it is not joined up at the strategic level
6588801 we are confident of a strong performance in the second half because despite the cost pressures we think the current record levels of pricing of ferroalloy and iron ore are set to continue for the foreseeable future
6588802 we have not received a formal request for a board seat
6588803 but in the event that we did the answer would be no for the simple reason that we are interested in the same types of opportunities for consolidation in the region and we are very busy at the moment
6588804 some young people are decreasing their subject entries and taking fewer gcses than in the past
6588805 students are focusing their efforts more tightly on a smaller range of subjects
6588806 i think schools are concentrating on quality rather than quantity they recognise it is of no benefit to a pupil to do 10 11 or 12 gcses better to do eight or nine good gcses and get grades
6588807 data like this should lead to a debate about rising standards if our sports people can do better in the olympics due to investment or training i dont think it is actually impossible that students in our schools can produce similar increases in performance
6588808 im really thrilled with my results and im thrilled for my sisters

6588810 if president mugabe goes ahead to convene parliament and appoint a new cabinet it means he is proceeding to violate the conditions of the memorandum of understanding which means he may have abandoned the basis for the talks but we dont know what his intentions are
6588811 a violation of the mou will have to be dealt with by the mediator
6588812 a presidents faith or lack thereof undoubtedly shapes the way he governs
6588813 thats been true since george washingtons day its certainly true now when george w bush named jesus christ as his favorite political philosopher at a republican debate in 1999 that told voters a lot about the man and his world view for better or for worse barack obamas remark to rick warren that deciding when an unborn child should have human rights was above his pay grade is similarly revealing
6588814 symbolically the first presidential debate of 2008 left secular americans out of the conversation
6588815 our politicians will never stop speaking and even pandering to the faithful but they shouldnt leave the rest of us out in the cold
6588816 its something i have been thinking about for a period of time
6588817 i decided to retire from englands one day team for a number of reasons one being the amount of time i was spending away from my family now that my family is settled and my bowling is settled i feel that i have something to offer englands one day side
6588818 it would be lovely to have steve as first change for us with the white ball but you dont get everything you want in life

6588828 this big push is making people crazy thinking theyre bad moms if they dont get their kids vaccinated
6588829 should give shareholders confidence that the current financial year will bring an improved performance
6588830 weve recently made some tough decisions to ensure we get the fundamentals right and set a clear course for the future
6588831 we are confident that our revised strategy and actions will improve shareholder value in fy09 and beyond
6588832 only she didnt know if she was going to get out
6588833 she knows it wouldnt have stopped he would have kept hitting her
6588834 all she could think about was she might not see her kids again
6588835 shes really all about her family i can picture that giving her strength
6588836 it just shows the mindset of the victim to not only stay calm and think on her feet to get out of the situation and to a safe place but to give us a good description
6588837 the evidence we have heard during this inquiry can lead to only one conclusion that whatever short term fluctuations occur and whatever regulatory action is taken in the uk to improve the functioning of the energy markets as the minister of state for energy malcolm wicks recently stated the era of cheap energy is surely over

6588840 tomorrow will likely bring sobering news of cuts to an already reduced state budget
6588841 as these proposed reductions are announced the governor should be straight with vermonters and acknowledge that we are realistically facing a 75 100 million dollar deficit in the fy 2010 budget
6588842 it is not credible to suggest we will be able to level fund next years budget given inflationary pressures and it is unrealistic to suggest we can cut our way out of this problem
6588843 vermonters deserve to hear from their governor what the full scope of our economic challenges are
6588844 we will look into it we have a formal complaint the possibility is we will take an enforcement action

6588857 i cant trust you to do even the simplest of tasks all you had to do was order fish for christs sake
6588858 i did order fish i was waiting for it to be delivered when this brainiac
6588859 came in waving a gun around like jesse fucking james what was i supposed to do let him take the money
6588860 yes for the love of god di he had a gun
6588861 take a look at the safety he was more likely to drop the cartridge out than shoot me
6588862 the big guy over there smashed a chair over this idiots skull one of the pieces caught me in the face

6588864 keep laughing and ill tell mom what happened to that bottle of rum your sophomore year

6588875 i have got to get some ice for this thing
6588876 are you serious of course not he was trying to do the right thing my face just got in the way
6588877 i couldnt believe it either but so far thats it how bout you anything interesting going on in the world of insurance fraud
6588878 im wrapping up one case now typical stuff guy gets in a bad spot financially decides to make a quick buck off his insurance this guy was smarter than most though he actually hid the merchandise and didnt involve the police
6588879 i thought no one could get paid without a police report
6588880 i didnt say he got paid but hes not in jail either you people respond to false police reports unlike false insurance claims
6588881 ah he dodged that bullet so hes only half stupid
6588882 on that note i should get back to the office see what other dastardly deeds i can uncover
6588883 i need you back at the office i have a new case for you
6588884 to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states and with the indian tribes
6588885 each state retains its sovereignty freedom and independence and every power jurisdiction and right which is not by this confederation expressly delegated to the united states in congress assembled
6588886 the powers delegated by the proposed constitution to the federal government are few and defined those which are to remain in the state governments are numerous and indefinite
6588887 if we were to accept the governments arguments we are hard pressed to posit any activity by an individual that congress is without power to regulate
6588888 its in that future that machines from intel will surpass human intelligence
6588889 and progress in next hundred years will be more like the progress of last 20 000 years of human history because of technology
6588890 well need new materials to improve transistor performance and new technologies like tri gate transistors trigate gives you more power lower leakage and better density
6588891 cmos will be the platform of the processor and then well have other things on top of that
6588892 wireless radios dont work together in fact they fight each other
6588893 it is not 100 dead in the water as yet
6588894 but if it is colin has other avenues to pursue and he will be turning to those in the next few days
6588895 i have agonised over this for over a week and taken a lot of advice
6588896 but i want to play for as long as i can at as high a level as i can and that means a return to the spl
6588897 today as the manager of gretna fc i attended fir park motherwell to do the job i am contracted to do
6588898 my representative kevin drinkell and my solicitor mr leo martin have made numerous and repeated attempts to clarify and resolve my situation currently with gretna fc without success
6588899 as a friendly suggestion from brooks mileson i took some time away from my role
6588900 throughout there has been nothing medically wrong with me however i have been requested by the club to stay away
6588901 we had a look at him on tuesday and asked him back on friday
6588902 we have not got to the stage of discussing a fee but we have to decide whether we want him and will give him a decision by the end of the week
6588903 but the harsh reality is that we didnt take our chances when they came along
6588904 the players are despondent because they have competed for most of the game but were let down in the vital areas
6588905 we will strive to teach them how to deal with better players because they havent been at this level before
6588906 i have been speaking to the players for weeks and weeks about the step up to this level
6588907 and at the back we didnt do enough to deal with falkirk especially for the first two goals
6588908 the potential is there but today we have been dealt a harsh lesson
6588909 well looking at that i dont think thats the actions of a sane man coming to an spl team at two oclock in the biggest game of their career and trying to do what
6588910 i think thats him trying to get a bit of attention for himself
6588911 david is taking the team now and that is it he has been taking pre season bringing players in and taking training so he is the manager
6588912 i would advise him rowan on my behalf to stay well away from the club because at this time we dont need these distractions
6588913 today leo martin called jim gemmell who in turn promised to speak with brooks mileson hopefully passing on the message that we would be happy to travel to gretna for a meeting on tuesday
6588914 mr gemmell did not respond so a fax was also sent requesting a meeting to clarify the clubs intentions regarding my position
6588915 again while the club have managed to issue a press statement we have not received a response from mr gemmell or the club as promised
6588916 as was previously stated if gretna would prefer my solicitor to be in contact directly with their solicitors then we are happy to proceed in that direction
6588917 rowan alexanders attendance was clearly intended to bring the name of the club into disrepute as demonstrated by his prepared press statement and was also in breach of an agreement between himself and the club that he refrain from attendance until his own situation at the club has been resolved
6588918 to that end and following a meeting with himself and his agent kevin drinkell on 25 june the club wrote to him on 26 june spoke to him on 29 june and wrote to him again on 11 july and 1 august
6588919 as at todays date we have still not been afforded the courtesy of a reply from him and therefore the club totally refutes any suggestion that delays in resolving his situation have been caused by the club
6588920 he is still registered with vancouver whitecaps in canada and it is a problem we are trying to overcome
6588921 their season ends after our transfer window closes and were trying to find a way round that
6588922 if we bring in zibi or vito it would be on a loan deal at least initially
6588923 in making our decision we have to balance our finances with whats best for the team
6588924 a sports fan could view a live football game in high definition while lying on the beach a teenager could catch the latest episode of her favorite drama while being driven to school and a business executive could watch live financial news while shopping for groceries at her local supermarket
6588925 we want to become a firm top three player by 2010 and become number one eventually
6588926 in fact a person is generating enough packets that theyre the ones creating that situation we will manage that consumer for the overall good of all of our consumers
6588927 not even capable of knowing when an individual segment of the network is congested
6588928 its not fun to crash but youre racing on the edge its either you or them kamakazi said
6588929 unless youre willing to go for it i dont think you should be doing it
6588930 i spelt it kamakazi rather than kamikaze because my motto is dare to be different
6588931 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw

6588935 we understand the essence of the russian position and its military response
6588936 including the day before georgian troops went into south ossetia we said dont do it dont be drawn into a military conflict its not in your interest
6588937 but the pressure on georgia was too great and they felt they had to act that gave russia the excuse they were looking for to launch a massive military operation with over 20 000 troops
6588938 to halt military co operation events between russia and nato countries until further instructions
6588939 if they knew the plane was faulty why did they let it fly
6588940 those responsible say it will take two days at most to finish identifying people by their fingerprints
6588941 what they really want we cant give and the longer it takes the worse it is
6588942 its been years since engine failure on take off or a fire has prevented a flight from continuing
6588943 golf is not bad but as prices are unstable and the economic situation is not getting better president lee thinks they need to consider public sentiment
6588944 if president mugabe goes ahead to convene parliament and appoint a new cabinet it means he is proceeding to violate the conditions of the memorandum of understanding which means he may have abandoned the basis for the talks but we dont know what his intentions are
6588945 a violation of the mou will have to be dealt with by the mediator
6588946 this concert is support for the people of south ossetia and for the justified military actions of russia
6588947 it is also against the cynical position of the united states everywhere they go there is war
6588948 it was brutal and criminal i have talked to about 20 or 30 people on the phone who were there and everybody tells me this one story
6588949 there was a massacre in which more than 2 000 ossetians died there are villages that no longer exist
6588950 intelligent people around the world should know the truth about what happened here especially on the first night
6588951 we are probably still on a growth trajectory before we get to the stage when the uk presence can begin to thin out
6588952 one of the characteristics of counter insurgency unlike conventional war is the more successful you are in the short term the more troops you require
6588953 the more ground and the more people you become responsible for the more troops you need
6588954 i could use more helicopters any tactical operational commander could but there is no point in thinking that aviation is going to make a strategic difference
6588955 you make our country proud every day of the week and every week of the year
6588956 they the taliban fighters are recognised for what they are a brutal criminally orientated terrorist organisation with no interest in the afghan population
6588957 the local population is overwhelmingly hostile to the taliban the taliban is quite tactically resilient but it is not joined up at the strategic level
6588958 some of the lads will have been out on the ground for 30 hours when they get back they want to have a shower and go to bed instead they will have a shower and get ready for the visit
6588959 we still dont know anything because they havent been identified
6588960 the girls grandparents identified the body they were devastated it was terribly painful
6588961 i have lost my nephew who had come from orlando and today was his 23rd birthday
6588962 i took a child into the truck and he thought he was in a film but he asked when will this film end and where is my dad he asked if it was real if he was in a film but he wanted the film to end
6588963 the plane was wobbling from one side to another then i began to suspect we would crash
6588964 i dont know what happened next i was in a sort of river and saw people smoke explosions which i think woke me up
6588965 when i woke up i saw bodies spread all around
6588966 my daughter has been reborn its a miracle granted by god four days before her birthday
6588967 i said i didnt mind paying extra to go first class whatever it took just get me on that plane
6588968 but there was no way it was completely full so we had to wait till the next flight that overbooking saved our lives
6588969 the plane was overbooked and i was offered two options to bump up to first class or wait for another flight which is what i decided to do then half an hour later my brother called me and told me what had happened
6588970 im not the youngest candidate but i am the most experienced
6588971 how wrong the washington conventional wisdom has been on this race
6588972 a full and complete explanation of what im doing and why im doing it
6588973 and you have to work with congress and they know the priorities as well as i do
6588974 the agreement was that londoners on income support received half price bus travel subsidised via cheap venezuelan oil in return for london providing transport planning and other expertise to venezuela
6588975 that is absolutely demonstrably incorrect londons bus fleet will not use subsidised oil from venezuela it is charity it is not subsided oil from venezuela
6588976 can i just come back to the first point you made which is the title of the agreement an energy funding contribution because i do again it is just for clarity query that this months edition of the londoner says that this deal means londons bus fleet will use subsidised oil from venezuela leading to a massive 20 reduction in the price of fuel well it seems to me that that is inaccurate it ends by saying that the arrangements will simply enable the existing quantity of oil to be bought more cheaply that does not seem to be accurate either and that the fuel bill discount which is not what it is it is a mechanism will be calculated on the prevailing world price of oil but it is the uk price
6588977 it just comes on again to this point about accuracy because i do hope chair that we will make a formal request for the false report in the londoner lets be blunt about it to be corrected because the use of the words londons bus fleet will use subsidised oil is not a misdescription it is wholly misleading can i also point out in the same context that murziline parchment you have referred to the subsidy and people on income support the londoner in that same issue said 130 000 carers on income support will benefit factual point before you move on chair in fact government figures which you obtained chair and which the mayor himself has quoted show there are only 10 000 so when there have been two serious misleading elements in the londoner that then seems to me that that ought to be corrected
6588978 i do think one thing that is very important to identify is that it is not yet agreed between tfl and the venezuelan side as to the exact nature of that technical assistance
6588979 we did know that number would rise and we very consciously made this announcement while it was on the rise to tell people in advance
6588980 they feel like they re making good progress they don t have a hard timeline to share on when that will be complete but it s important to bring it back up to operations as safely and quickly as we can
6588981 we were able to get through last weekend with some temporary runouts we ve decided that we re better off to temporarily close a small number of stations
6588982 we re not able to make up all the volumes that we would like to but the fact that we have these contracts in place has given us more flexibility than we would otherwise have if we were only dealing with petro canada
6588983 at this point we are counting on petro canada to have their processing unit back up within a reasonable time so that these closures will be temporary we have not made any decisions beyond that
6588984 you might see an impact if you had numerous refineries with an issue like this but so far i don t think that we ve noticed any effect on the price
6588985 it s great if you re a refinery because it blocks competition and helps you keep our prices up
6588986 but it s not good for consumers and at times like this it s not good for our operations either because we can t get any gas
6588987 i think what comcast and time warner cable are doing is a great first step
6588988 it gets isps out of the business of deciding which applications are important and which arent but there are enhancements to the peer to peer protocol in particular that can make it easier on all isps
6588989 this is a step in the right direction because isps are indeed making their networks more neutral without new legislation requiring them to do so
6588990 but make no mistake bandwidth caps and metered plans are bad for the internet and could stunt the adoption and growth of all broadband services
6588991 if it does then something has gone wrong with competition customers clearly dont want metered plans and bandwidth caps there might be some isps that experiment with these but i dont see it happening
6588992 junkies and drug pushers dont belong near children and families they should be in rehab or behind bars
6588993 we would love to be able to play our game in canberra on the same day as collingwood and essendon
6588994 having an afl team play in the capital on that day would be a good fit considering weve lost the most players in the wars it would be a real fitting tribute
6588995 it would bring the players to the heart of where its all at it is very much part of our heritage it would also be great for the local community
6588996 i thought it was a bit optimistic at the start of the month to look for 3 million but it now looks achievable
6588997 we were a premiership contender a couple of years ago and we were tipped to be in the top four
6588998 then we just got all these injuries to our core group and the window closed
6588999 i said the heck is that and there was an alligator floating by
6589000 i took my flashlight and was like youve got to be kidding me a big old alligator swimming around here
6589001 they are trying to find dry land someplace to hide
6589002 were pulling in our plants and porch furniture making sure we have our supplies and gas for the generator
6589003 i still think we all need to stay on our toes
6589004 im ready to get back to work this is insane itll drive you nuts being stuck like this
6589005 i love the fraternity brothers because theyre so young and such a contrasting team
6589006 one takes his time to think things out the other one loves to rush and go at a million miles an hour theres definitely tension between the two of them while theyre making decisions during the race
6589007 they are small we wanted to make sure that there wasnt anything to prevent us from putting that pack underneath the seat in front of us when we got on a plane we didnt want something to happen where we got delayed because of our luggage we thought that would help us go faster
6589008 we did extensive research on what to wear what was lightweight and would help us move the fastest
6589009 i think it was the longest i ever went without wearing a logo on my t shirt if you see me on the street im usually wearing a superman bizarro or batman t shirt on a constant basis but we had to utilize more multi use clothing for the amazing race
6589010 we both tried to do some training along the lines of going down to our little gym but that was pretty much it
6589011 we have an emerging farm so we do a lot of work out there splitting wood and taking care of the horses
6589012 people were a little afraid we were going to pull a borat on them i told them we werent doing borat but what happened there is very very funny its not easy to shoot in places like that because they practically have no television industry
6589013 the teams have no idea how to get from point a to point b there
6589014 they dont know the language its very difficult to get through this country they get so stuck but they find so many fascinating solutions of how to get through everything one of the things the teams do there is go to a real life floating village its insane
6589015 were just happy to continue making the show as it is
6589016 blackwater has a much better idea of what an effective peace keeping mission would look like than western governments
6589017 the important thing is not to win but to take part
6589018 ter o diabo no corpo n o s arder com a vontade de foder a vontade de sermos verdadeiros com aquilo que queremos para n s e dos outros
6589019 its a crime of impulse a crime by people who lack control
6589020 putting small children in front of them its a bad idea
6589021 most of them are on supervision for downloading child pornography on the internet and trading child pornography on the internet
6589022 if the board of education came out and said were gonna put a school in a building right under a probation office that handles hundreds of hardened criminals there would be an uproar this is the same thing
6589023 the last place that any of our offenders would commit any type of crime is near our office
6589024 its not in my backyard its not in my childrens playground thats what were saying
6589025 for a number of years we lived at moffett field naval air station which is also where the ames research center is
6589026 we used to see astronauts come out there to do some of their training

6589045 maintaining multiple agencies reflects heavily relationship based business culture priorities within asia increasingly however travel managers recognize that consolidation in their major markets in becoming a necessity
6589046 demand in singapore continues to be strong as this is where many regional functions sit other emerging markets like vietnam korea and taiwan are also adding to demand as companies look to these markets for business expansion opportunities we expect this growth to continue as most travel is intra regional and is only marginally affected by the us slowdown
6589047 the europcar business is the main contributor to consolidated revenues
6589048 the outstanding results for the first half of 2008 reflect on the one hand the organic growth of the business and on the other the positive financial impact of eurazeos acquisition of premierfirst in february 2007 betacar in the third quarter of 2007 and the europcar asia pacific franchise in may this year
6589049 europcar australasia is the third largest vehicle hire operator in australia and one of the largest in new zealand
6589050 the company has strong brand recognition and continues to aggressively grow its business throughout the region which made the acquisition of the europcar asia pacific franchise a well placed strategic move for europcar internationals organic growth

6589059 in a lot of cases we havent gone up take in the jetstar market where the last couple of surcharges werent sustainable in the market we ended up with those fare increases not sticking
6589060 in a market thats very competitive like the australian domestic market it limits the amount weve been able to increase it

6589073 i saw the plight of people using the trains to get to work every morning they were jostling to get on board every time a train arrived there appeared to be no system
6589074 im not happy with this because the people are not getting satisfaction from riding the trains this we must fix
6589075 i found the trains really packed with so many passengers some had waited for three trains and yet could not board
6589076 theres no queue people push their way in women with children and old people are pushed aside
6589077 there were many more suggestions given by passengers nurins father sues police and govt for defamation and negligence
6589078 the third party was even taken to the proposed site before he agreed to submit a proposal to develop the land

6589080 he was only 19 at the time of the offence and had joined the police as a constable to help support his parents and five younger siblings
6589081 it is a job hazard but nothing that a little ointment cant cure
6589082 of course my legs are full of scars now but its okay since i dont plan to be a model
6589083 at a price of 60 sen each i would dangle both my legs anytime because this is the best paying job ever
6589084 did they think i wasnt going to find the brick of pot underneath their seat
6589085 unfortunately all too common even though they each far exceed a police officers lawful authority under the fourth amendment
6589086 its important for citizens to know their constitutional rights and how to exercise them
6589087 so that the right to privacy is protected not only for themselves but for all citizens

6589089 he worked extremely hard to put himself in this position to get back and help the this club
6589090 hes really excited about the opportunity and hes up to the challenge
6589091 he worked extremely hard to put himself in this position to get back and help the this club
6589092 hes really excited about the opportunity and hes up to the challenge
6589093 he tried to have a tough exterior like a shield to fit in
6589094 he was a good kid who was dealt some bad cards in life
6589095 it was an individual directing his aggression toward another individual not the school or the students inside the school
6589096 i want to assure parents and others in this community that despite this tragic and isolated incident that our schools are safe
6589097 he got shot and started walking and he was holding his chest there was blood everywhere and then he fell and his arm hit me
6589098 i took off running and ran outside and called my mom
6589099 everybody started running out real fast saying he got shot
6589100 todos vivimos bajo el cielo pero algunos levantamos los ojos hacia las estrellas
6589101 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw

6589103 its like this year round despite trevors assurances that it was mid summer lindsey couldnt ignore the autumnal feel of the golden woods and she loved it sara was a fan of the summer school was out she got to stay up late and spend entire days at the beach or the mall
6589104 aside from the fact that its the biggest city in this part of journeys end
6589105 call it professional curiosity i mean he only built the asperion tower
6589106 in fact just about anything enzo builds is supposed to be impressive as he talked about enzo lindsey noticed an apprehension mixed with the eagerness a kind of nervousness that seemed to indicate that maybe the only thing that matched his desire to meet the boy was his desire not to
6589107 what if he turns out to be better than you
6589108 i think its good that you dont like that hes better than you at something that just means youll work harder at it until youre the famous builder
6589109 he has probably been doing it much longer than you have give it time maybe you can build the i dont know the everywhere town tower or something
6589110 but dont think im letting you name it whatever it is
6589111 are you saying you dont like the names i come up with for things now
6589112 i can see it now the everywhere town tower it serves no purpose and has a terrible name but its awesome anyway
6589113 lovely planning on putting that on a plaque right out front
6589114 has a kind of ring to it dont you think
6589115 sure change the subject you were going to lose that argument anyway

6589118 its companion fruit its just i dont know a thing if you share a companion fruit with a friend its supposed to be good luck
6589119 well if you believe in that sort of thing supposedly if you
6589120 look you want to know the story behind the companion fruit fine you can find out about it from anyone not named trevor and thats final
6589121 youve got some juice dribbling down your chin it sort of ruins the effect i think you were going for
6589122 ah see now whos trying to change the subject hmm
6589123 thats strange if youre sisters and youre opposites i would have thought you would fight all the time
6589124 its not very good im sorry its just too sweet i think
6589125 ah well i guess they wont be naming a recipe after me after all
6589126 she snapped her whispers now bordering on screams and the sheer urgency of her voice jolted him awake
6589127 youll need to sleep too were going to hit the road pretty hard tomorrow and if youre tired itll only slow us down i dont know about you but i dont want to spend another night in this place and if we push it we just might make it to port town by nightfall
6589128 i thought i would not live through the experience each of them took turns to hit kick and punch me i could do nothing
6589129 the money he allegedly received is not part of the over rm120 000 allegedly received by the others

6589132 we expect the river beatrice to be well received in her debut season in 2009 and we know she will offer an exceptional river cruise experience for our guests who want to enjoy the best sights in europe in world class comfort
6589133 with the addition of the river beatrice to the uniworld fleet we have been able to further expand our product offering with even more cruises through this popular and historically rich region
6589134 im trying to obviously take the confidence from last week into this week and trying not to let the expectations get too high
6589135 i feel pretty good about my game and im hoping to have another good finish this week
6589136 hoy m s dif cil que hace 3 a os
6589137 hoy m s dif cil que hace 3 a os
6589138 the south korean government is willing to invest in such scholarships and exchange programmes to show that we highly value our relations with malaysia
6589139 gerrard was not playing on the left im sorry we played 4 3 2 1 we played jermain defoe gerrard and wayne rooney and three midfielders behind them
6589140 the position he had to play was between the line of the backs and the midfielders mr redknapp has to say something but he didnt play on the left sorry with his movement he went on the left and to the middle he moved but he never played on the left
6589141 i think overall we expected more from the game but there are some positives and some negatives and we will sit down and analyse them
6589142 maybe we should have won the game with the team we had there and now there are two weeks to go to reassess the game before the qualifying game against andorra
6589143 this season shows that you should never give up there were some races where things didnt go well for one reason or another but i was able to collect some precious points
6589144 my position after hungary is better than it was before the race we havent lost anything but we need to get better results consistently
6589145 from now on every single race will be extremely important and every single point will have great value the fewer there are the more important they become
6589146 i think the championship will be very tight but i need to have at least one point more than my competitors after the last race this is the sole aim the rest are just details
6589147 we need to score a decent return of points whenever we can and be consistent and as competitive as we can
6589148 this year everybodys results have been more varied and every driver who has won a race has also failed to score on at least two other occasions
6589149 thats made getting strong results even more important so i think well see consistency becoming crucial as we head towards the end of the season
6589150 we still feel confident about our chances we know our rivals will be strong but weve worked hard to improve the car and were confident well be competitive this weekend
6589151 the most important thing is to finish consistently in the points
6589152 ive only seen the new track from an on board camera and it seems to be very fast for a street circuit
6589153 i always love to drive on new tracks and im always very quick to know them i cant wait to race at valencia
6589154 it will be more important than in other places to drive with continuity from friday on qualifying will be extremely important although i think there are some possibilities to overtake
6589155 if its hot that will help ferrari like at montreal you also need a bit of luck
6589156 we launched the vodafone mclaren mercedes team here at the start of 2007 and ive tested at the ricardo tormo circuit so the city isnt unfamiliar to me
6589157 going to a new circuit doesnt really change my preparations everybodys in the same situation so i dont treat things very differently
6589158 i still believe i am improving and learning more about the team and the car at each race
6589159 my aim for the last part of the season is to win more races and to perform regularly at the front
6589160 its something i was able to do from time to time in the first half of the year but i now feel more confident that i can be a consistent challenger in the remaining races
6589161 to shift the debate from ris recession and our foreclosure crisis
6589162 our world is shrinking and that has a lot to do with the airline industry

6589177 flexi hours is an approach that women want and we need to take into account their needs and aspirations we want more women in the workforce
6589178 we should understand the needs of women women look for a balance of work and life between being a worker and a mother and wife
6589179 in todays terms its not the number of hours that you spend in the workplace but how productive you are
6589180 most women i have come across have not disappointed me they are very diligent hardworking and focused
6589181 in malaysia some 60 000 women owned businesses are registered each year according to the companies commission of malaysia

6589258 we are having a gentlemanly debate here lets behave professionally and be civilised about it
6589259 what cover up when the aca said there was no evidence of fraud i was not happy
6589260 we formed a committee and re investigated the case internally we forwarded the case again to the aca for another probe
6589261 we believe that the damages are not worth rm40 million we believe we have a case thats why i did not reveal the issue because the legal process is not over yet
6589262 but did the opposition reveal this point no they just gave up and played up the claim that we have lost rm40 million this is his half truth
6589263 the penang government approves an average of 500 land transactions a year
6589264 meaning that in our bn 18 years there we approved more than 10 000 land deals
6589265 if the rm40 million case and a few others are all they can throw at us this means that we have a success rate of 99 9 per cent
6589266 but in less than 24 hours he started blasting me in the papers claiming the previous government and i had committed fraud
6589267 so i decided that a debate was the best place to reveal the whole truth as everyone could hear for themselves the facts
6589268 the doubles as an opening event will be difficult to predict and i believe the race for gold silver and bronze will be open

6589279 potential targets with dominant franchises in their respective markets or otherwise attractive assets
6589280 politics wont be the same no one can replace someone of that energy and devotion its not easy
6589281 i think right now the city needs patience and deliberativeness we dont need to make a rushed decision and get somebody just because theyre available
6589282 we need to maintain that image and reputation and so i hope the powers that be find the person thats going to carry the mantle just as she has done
6589283 well mourn it and well see it in the short term but as time goes on we will miss that little quality that you miss if you lose someone who cares about you that much

6589315 there are scores of oems original equipment manufacturers that have skin in the game
6589316 we trust the court can find a way to protect the companies trade secrets without blocking all information on the allegations in this case
6589317 wed also hope that in reviewing our motion the court decides that providing trade secret protection to evidence related to illegal business practices and behavior would be adverse to the public interest
6589318 20 20 was in the house filming it for a future story
6589319 warhammer age of reckoning has encountered a problem and needs to close we are sorry for the inconvenience
6589320 its fairly low margin but it can be decent returns
6589321 we looked at length of stay and unplanned readmissions and the number of people that returned to a hospital following a stay has decreased between the years 2004 and 2005
6589322 they supposedly fixed the problem which the pilot later said was with the air conditioning and 8then we took off
6589323 the plane was wobbling from one side to another then i began to suspect we would crash i dont know what happened next i was in a sort of river and saw people smoke explosions which i think woke me up
6589324 i took a child into the truck and he thought he was in a film but he asked when will this film end and where is my dad he asked if it was real if he was in a film but he wanted the film to end

6589327 god am i happy to be leaving vietnam and that jail i should never have been in there
6589328 its condominiums where ill have them get to you he said before quitting the campaign trail for three days to strategise with top aides as both the candidates finalise their choice of running mate
6589329 now think about that i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make us5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong he said
6589330 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their house you might have a different perspective
6589331 so theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccains world and what people are going through every single day here in america
6589332 we cant afford eight more years or four more years or one more year of the same failed economic policies that president george bush has put in place senator obama said
6589333 heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into
6589334 he couldnt count high enough to know how many houses he owns he said on cnn before introducing senator obama in chester by countering republican charges that the relatively inexperienced democrat is too
6589335 i reported the conspiracy to president reid for 15 or 20 consecutive days
6589336 the state department released a list of 58 communist agitators many of them graduates of red chinese and czechoslovakian political warfare schools who were leading the street fighting some of the leaders jaime dur n a cuban trained member of the dominican young communists party jos d issa a communist who received guerrilla training in cuba visited prague in 1963 moscow in 1964 fidelio despradel roques a peking lining communist
6589337 the chinese government has shown no reluctance to be active in the caribbean and officials in china would undoubtedly welcome the opportunity to map out a joint strategy for chinas involvement in the region as they have done in africa

6589339 weve got kids that can run and do some things they will hit you but were a little bit lacking on sheer size
6589340 just got to step it up this year dont have anybody to look up to this year weve got to be a role model to the rest of the team really
6589341 i like big games big crowds its why you come out here if you cant get excited coming out and playing high school football at meadow bridge or any place in west virginia you dont need to be out there
6589342 there is a distinct similarity in the commission of the crime which could have been perpetrated by only one person
6589343 the suspect is still on the loose waiting for another opportunity to strike
6589344 the withdrawal is not happening very quickly if it in fact has begun
6589345 the withdrawal needs to take place and needs to take place now
6589346 there will be no buffer zones we will never live with any buffer zones well never allow anything like this
6589347 we thought it may be good to come up with a more innovative and creative way of telling the people about the truth
6589348 somebody who wants to seek public office for a party whose philosophies and policies and interests are directly contrary to the interests of the unions members would obviously be foolish to say that that would not have a bearing on any application for approval
6589349 that a larger percentage of subjects treated with vytorin were diagnosed with and died from all types of cancer combined when compared to placebo during the five year study
6589350 we are concerned that a study has found a significant link between vytorin and cancer
6589351 now it appears that merck schering plough and its consultant are presenting two different data sets from this study to the public doctors and consumers should have better information on which to base their health care decisions
6589352 given that his clinical trials unit is conducting the study of heart and renal protection sharp trial of vytorin also funded by merck schering plough and or the joint venture
6589353 apparently submitted a copy of his full report directly to fda but has not made it public an action we deem questionable
6589354 it is important to note that the results of the seas trial were presented by the study investigator on july 21 not by merck schering plough
6589355 study investigator intends to make a full presentation of the seas data to the scientific community at the european society of cardiology annual meeting in the first week of september
6589356 the cancer finding in seas is likely to be an anomaly that taken in the light of all the available data does not support an association with vytorin
6589357 stand behind the safety and efficacy of vytorin and do not believe that changes in its clinical use are warranted
6589358 the relationship between happiness and health should be examined in future studies and possible relevant preventive initiatives should be developed
6589359 in other words we can carefully say that experiencing more than one meaningful life event severe and or mild to moderate is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women
6589360 general feelings of happiness and optimism can play a protective role against the disease
6589361 the mechanism in which the central nerve endocrine and immune systems interact and how behavior and or external events modulate these three complex systems is not fully understood

6589367 on the one side superstition and the sword the mitred hand and the sceptered arm combine on the other almighty truth alone pushes on the combat under these fearful odds the truth triumphs and shall the advocates of such a cause fear the context now yes my fellow citizens not a king nor a priest smiled upon our faith until it won the day it offered no lure to the ambitious no reward to the avaricious from greed coveting it offered no alliance with the lusts of the flesh the lusts of the eyes nor the pride of life it disdained such auxiliaries it aimed not so low it called for self denial humility patience and courage on the part of all its advocates and promised spiritual joys as an earnest promise of eternal bliss by the excellency of its doctrine the purity of its morals the rationality of its arguments the demonstration of the holy spirit and the good example of its subjects it triumphed on the ruins of judaism and idolatry the christian volunteers found the yoke of christ was easy and his burden light peace of mind a heaven born equanimity composure a good conscience a pure heart universal love a triumphant joy and a glorious hope of immortal bliss were its reward in hand an incorruptible undefiled and unfading inheritance in the presence of god with the society of angels principalities and powers of the loftiest intelligence and most comprehensive knowledge brighter than the sun in the glories of light and love eternal are its rewards in future but now let us ask what boon blessing what honor what reward have our opponents to offer for its renunciation yes this is the question which the sequel must develop to what would they convert us what heaven have they to propose what immorality to reveal what sublime views of creation and a creator what authentic record of the past what prophetic hope of the future what account of our origin what high ultimatum of our destiny what terrors have they to offer to stem the torrent violent rushing water of corruption what balm and consolation to the sons and daughters of anguish to these and a thousand kindred questions they must and they will answer none none at all they promise to him that disbelieveth the founder of the christian religion to him that neglects and the salvation of the gospel to him who tramples underfoot the blood of the new institution and insults the spirit of favor to him who traduces slanders moses daniel and job to him who vilifies slanders jesus paul peter james and john to him who devotes his soul to the lusts of the flesh who disdains heaven who defies his appetites who degrades himself to a mere animal and eulogizes philosophy to this man they promise eternal sleep and everlasting death this is the faith the hope and joy or which they labor with so much zeal and care and pain
6589368 the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life
6589369 for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul
6589370 the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life
6589371 what really is the alternative to christ what are the great things that one looks unto apart from christ
6589372 what boon blessing what honor what reward have our opponents to offer for its renunciation
6589373 no lure to the ambitious no reward to the avaricious from greed coveting it offered no alliance with the lusts of the flesh the lusts of the eyes nor the pride of life it disdained such auxiliaries by the excellency of its doctrine the purity of its morals the rationality of its arguments the demonstration of the holy spirit and the good example of its subjects it triumphed on the ruins of judaism and idolatry
6589374 now faith is the assurance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen
6589375 the boon of seeing the world free of artiface and take each step in ones life based upon logic and belief in the evidence provided it is a belief in evidential proof
6589376 and promised spiritual joys as an earnest promise of eternal bliss and a glorious hope of immortal bliss were its reward in hand they promise to him that disbelieveth the founder of the christian religion to this man they promise eternal sleep and everlasting death
6589377 what is the evidence that we draw upon unconscious principles when making moral decisions
6589378 at least the true skeptic is honest enough not to take a side the atheist arrogantly ignores the evidences for gods existence and the christ
6589379 how nature designed our universal sense of right and wrong
6589380 for when gentiles that have not the law do by nature the things of the law these not having the law are the law unto themselves in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience bearing witness therewith and their thoughts one with another accusing or else excusing them
6589381 this shows that despite religion age education and many other factors people answer moral quandries in the exact same way with very little variation
6589382 biological morality is not simply a standard which one chooses to follow
6589383 i will put my laws into their minds and write them on their hearts and i will be their god and they shall be my people
6589384 how nature designed our universal sense of right and wrong
6589385 evolution is design design through an iterative process of selection
6589386 you all have heard that it was said to them of old time you shall not murder and whosoever shall murder shall be in danger of the judgment 22 but i say unto you that every one who is angry with his brother shall be in danger of the judgment and whosoever shall say to his brother raca shall be in danger of the council and whosoever shall say you fool shall be in danger of the hell of fire
6589387 whosoever hates his brother is a murderer and you all know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him
6589388 for god did not send his son into the world to condemn the world but in order that the world might be saved through him whoever believes in him is not condemned but whoever does not believe is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only son of god
6589389 come to me all who labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn from me for i am gentle and lowly in heart and you will find rest for your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light
6589390 macro evolution and never has been evolution occurs over time with a progression of small changes
6589391 anger does not make one equal to a murderer hate is murder
6589392 whosoever hates his brother is a murderer and you all know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him

6589447 defendant intended for customers to believe its statements and representations about the defective iphone 3gs and to trust that the device was twice as fast at half the price
6589448 immediately after purchase plaintiff soon noticed that her internet connection receipt and sending of e mail text messages and other data transfers were slower than expected and advertised
6589449 the defective iphone 3g appeared to connect to the 3g standard and protocol less than 25 of the time additionally plaintiff experienced an inordinate amount of dropped calls
6589450 defendant expressly warranted that the defective iphone 3g would be twice as fast and would otherwise perform adequately on the 3g standard or protocol
6589451 the defective iphone 3gs do not conform to these express representations because they fail to connect and or adequately maintain a connection to the 3g standard and or protocol

6589456 there is evidence of market hardening in some sectors with premium rate increases particularly in personal lines and small to medium enterprises these representing the majority of our australian portfolio

6589462 biracial folk have always played significant leadership roles in the black community we need only think of frederick douglass
6589463 whether their increased participation in these roles signals something good or bad depends on the ways in which they relate to the black community do they see themselves as full fledged members of our community do they offer a politics that genuinely reflect the interests of our community these are the sorts of questions that will have to be asked
6589464 theyre going to focus on people looking for something to buy

6589494 a nota n o fazia jus ao nosso trabalho na escola
6589495 im assuming that as unemployment rises and inflation pressures subside australian financial conditions will need to be shifted from extremely restrictive to only mildly restrictive
6589496 if that is right the rba probably will be forced to return standard mortgage rates from 9 1 2 per cent today to 8 per cent
6589497 over the past two to three weeks there has been a substantial fall in the price of money in the australian marketplace
6589498 thats come about through the reserve indicating there is going to be an interest rate cut over the next few weeks
6589499 what were forecasting through to next year is that those sources of funds will continue to rise and continue to put upward pressure on the banks cost of funds
6589500 it was substantially above the reserves cash rate and its the banks cost of funds that determines the mortgage rate
6589501 when the state seat of port macquarie was vacated in 1995 by the former national party mp wendy machin this area had received a paltry 30 million in the annual budget
6589502 we have now grown this figure to 345 million in 2008 of which i am very proud
6589503 a recent macleay argus article shows the neighbouring seat held by the leader of the national party attracted 96 million to his area for the current year
6589504 i congratulate him for that as it is difficult to get any money while you are in opposition
6589505 however it should not be lost on anyone when we hear the independents cant deliver mantra from these same people that the voters in port macquarie have received three times more funding than the voters in the neighbouring electorate who have the party leader as their mp
6589506 the project commenced when i was the member for that area

6589536 the republicans biggest problem in this election is that they are viewed as lessable to fix the economy when the economy is defined as job loss mortgage foreclosures high health care costs thats democratic territory obama wants to play on that field
6589537 mccain wants to define it as being about energy because his being in favor of drilling is on the right side of the opinion poll numbers
6589538 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
6589539 senator mccain did not show up for the crucial vote on july 30 and the renewable energy bill which provides for renewable energy tax credits was defeated for the eighth time in fact john mccain has a perfect record on this renewable energy legislation he has missed all eight votes over the last year which effectively counts as a no vote each time once he was even in the senate and wouldnt leave his office to vote
6589540 given the recent history of the georgian situation it would be illogical to assume that russia had not at least outlined plans for a military action against georgia russian troops based in georgia pre conflict were described as peacekeepers peacekeepers would not be necessary were it not for the potential for open conflict and where there is potential there will most assuredly be a contingency plan but does this mean that russia purposely created an environment where such a contingency plan would be called into action
6589541 but a trip to the city on sunday without official escorts almost all of the buildings seen in an afternoon driving around tskhinvali were still standing russian backed leaders in south ossetia have said that 2 100 people died in fighting in tskhinvali and nearby villages but a doctor at the citys main hospital the only one open during the battles that began late on aug 7 said the facility recorded just 40 deaths

6589560 basically its for everyone we are in cambodia so we are targeting cambodian people of course but tourists can enjoy it as well
6589561 with local people we are not targeting only siem reaps middle to upper classes everybody is welcome this is the first complete shopping mall in siem reap
6589562 upper classes as opposed to the middle class we target
6589563 we are located quite far from each other we have a different market they are targeting more tourists and we are targeting more locals
6589564 world class one stop shopping centre a must visit hotspot
6589565 royal shopping galleries is thoughtfully divided into various theme zones there will be trendy and fashion beauty and pamper food and beverage cyber and lifestyle leisure and entertainment
6589566 but while we focus on the day to day tourist market we see our long term target market as being khmer due to the local population increase caused by people coming to do business in siem reap
6589567 the burns went well it was a little tricky trying to burn into the wind but other than that no problems
6589568 during these periods of hazard reduction activities there will be increased traffic movements in the park and adjacent roads and smoke may affect some properties
6589569 i spoke with some friends on the phone today they are large families living in russey keo in the same small block on road no 5 in phnom penh they all went to the polling stations and none were able to vote all of them have all their family members registered with the sangkat with their family books one family very pro srp despite the fact that the elderly father of the family is a driver for the cpp were not on the list at all the other family were on the list but someone had already voted under their names when they got there their friends on the other side of the no 5 road were not able to vote either they say but i have no details another friend who lives with his wife and two small children between norodom and monivong south of sihanouk he works at the s korean embassy told me his name was not on the list despite a prior visit to his block by officials checking electoral lists i have as yet not found any khmer person that i know in pp who was able to vote successfully

6589580 i said the heck is that and there was an alligator floating by
6589581 i took my flashlight and was like youve got to be kidding me a big old alligator swimming around here
6589582 they are trying to find dry land someplace to hide
6589583 were pulling in our plants and porch furniture making sure we have our supplies and gas for the generator
6589584 i still think we all need to stay on our toes
6589585 im ready to get back to work this is insane itll drive you nuts being stuck like this
6589586 i actually started thinking about it making europes ryder cup team around the open but then i wasnt playing great and its not good to think about that when you are not playing well i really want to make the team especially after how the last year and a half has gone
6589587 my life was sad before because i had to crawl on the ground
6589588 when someone loses a limb they immediately know what theyve lost
6589589 the goal is to restore the healthy self image again so that that person can see themselves whole
6589590 when i finally got into the field of orthotics and prosthetics i said ah ha
6589591 to deliver an artificial limb or brace without follow up doesnt help that person in the long run
6589592 we need to make sure that they have what they need to continue living successfully for years to come
6589593 someone might say i wanna bring 10 people with me next time you come the mixed blessing is theyll bring 50 or 100 people that have physical needs
6589594 the difficulty for me is how do i say no
6589595 it opens a whole other door for many of these folks to experience the world in a way in which theyve never even dreamt of
6589596 and the world has an opportunity to greet them accept them and welcome them back into society so its a double blessing
6589597 if we had a surgeon here we could see eight to 10 patients in a weekend and change their lives forever
6589598 its tough for people to make the choice to give up time with their families and a portion of their income to extend themselves in this way but take it from me the more we give the more we get
6589599 i said the heck is that and there was an alligator floating by
6589600 i took my flashlight and was like youve got to be kidding me a big old alligator swimming around here
6589601 they are trying to find dry land someplace to hide

6589607 he must hold firm to the sure word as taught so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it
6589608 i figured if i was reading a book that was almost 22 000 pages long that that feeling would take significantly longer to come around
6589609 wonderful words that are kind of hidden in the depths of the english vocabulary that we dont come across
6589610 we walked up kind of sort of close to it within about 8 or 9 feet up to that point it seemed excited but not really agitated
6589611 we had heard stories of these things because they are such a powerful bird such a big bird with big claws and stuff could possible hurt us so we were a little concerned about that
6589612 i think we had exhausted the fact that we werent going to be able to just corral it up on our own without harming it
6589613 my wife and i went to visit her in doggy jail this morning
6589614 we were very pleased theyre taking very good care of her

6589617 with an eye on the clock the white house continues to drag its feet and do everything possible to postpone public access to the records of this presidency
6589618 a backup system isnt designed to be a 100 percent complete inventory of all e mails

6589620 data is backed up on a daily weekly and monthly basis as part of a disaster recovery strategy to ensure to protect the organization from data loss
6589621 generally when the scope of the work is expected to fluctuate by a factor of nearly ten i can only take you so seriously
6589622 contractors cannot accurately plan for or staff based on such an estimate
6589623 we will continue to work with members of congress and the national archives and will communicate the results of our accounting effort at an appropriate time
6589624 the white house that wants to keep track of all your e mail and phone records cant even keep track of their own
6589625 gli uccelli del cielo non seminano non mietono e non raccolgono in granai eppure il padre vostro celeste li nutre non valete voi molto pi di loro

6589627 venite a me voi tutti che siete travagliati e aggravati ed io vi dar riposo
6589628 this is a cruel and callous policy approach from the iemma government this policy should be shredded
6589629 they say that he is progressing all of his bodily functions are returning to him
6589630 he looks really terrible because hes lost half his body weight of course he didnt eat for eight days
6589631 a lot of people moved out here from the district because they wanted to be in the burbs and raise their kids here
6589632 you find you can get a bigger house thats in pretty close and a yard but there were all these predatory loans thats all it was they didnt realize how the loans worked because when folks are lying to you you dont know any better then when they find out they are in trouble they start to panic and they end up losing their homes
6589633 we figured most of our cases would come from baltimore but the majority of the cases were are investigating are in prince georges county pg county is at the top of our list
6589634 they call three for four times a day and they leave something in my mailbox almost every day
6589635 sometimes i end up talking to them because they say florence how are you and i answer before i realize who they are theyve called on my cell phone it just doesnt stop
6589636 and its striking that despite all the news about this problem we still see people going out and using these high pressure and predatory tactics
6589637 we do have our share of foreclosure fraud in white neighborhoods but it doesnt seem to be the same frenzy we have in prince georges county
6589638 theres not too much you can really do about it
6589639 its a managers decision you have to ride with what he thinks do i like it no i dont like it but what can i do about it
6589640 i feel like i can work on my hitting better
6589641 the weight lifting i can take care of that myself i feel like my bodys strong enough to where i can maintain that on my own
6589642 i can make up for the time i missed last year and some of the time i missed this year i can do that well see what happens there are a lot of things up in the air for me im just trying to finish this season strong first
6589643 you just hope the astros still think you can play
6589644 thats all you can hope for other than that i just take my offseason how i take it every year prepare for the season and hopefully come back ready to play again well see what happens
6589645 we are very excited to let gamers get their hands on fallout 3 the latest chapter in this beloved and highly acclaimed franchise
6589646 to meet the huge demand for this title by our fans worldwide we are planning one of the biggest launches of any game released this year
6589647 you can definitely affect the market by what you put into it
6589648 i definitely think the way to improve americas impact on the environment is by having major companies like ford change the way they design cars because they know its a smart idea rather than under the duress of government regulations
6589649 facilitated interviews by or on behalf of the united states incommunicado and without access to a lawyer in pakistan
6589650 without that information bm mohamed will not be able to put forward a defence to the very serious charges he faces given the confessions made by him in bagram and guant namo bay in 2004
6589651 it is a longstanding principle of the common law that confessions obtained under torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment cannot be used in evidence in trial
6589652 by seeking to interview bm in the circumstances found in pakistan and supplying information and questions for his interviews the relationship between the united kingdom government and the united states authorities was far beyond that of bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing
6589653 subject to torture during his detention by or on behalf of the united states
6589654 the court finds on the basis that what was done was arguably wrongdoing the british security service facilitated it
6589655 todays judgment reflects the abhorrence of decent society at the methods employed by the united states government in the supposed war on terror
6589656 it has taken the courts of this country to intervene and reiterate the importance of upholding the rule of law we can only hope that the foreign secretary will now reflect on this judgment and provide direct assistance to binyams defence team
6589657 compelling the british government to release information that can prove mr mohameds innocence is one obvious step towards making up for the years of torture that he has suffered
6589658 the next step is for the british government to demand an end to the charade against him in guant namo bay and return him home to britain
6589659 for strong reasons of national security to which the court accepted we were entitled to give the highest weight we could not agree to disclose this information voluntarily
6589660 is to help them return to full productive lives through work
6589661 you want to know who theyre blaming for women voters breaking for hillary clinton over barack obama
6589662 theyre blaming chris matthews people are citing specifically chris not only for his own views but also as a symbol of what the mainstream media has done to hillary clinton
6589663 i didnt mean it in a mean way at all
6589664 but i knew that it was just going to blow his mind
6589665 trying to do it as if im keith isnt the best way to go
6589666 and i feel like ive got a learning curve thats like the matterhorn holy mackerel
6589667 you mean when i started working on aids in prisons was this where i thought it would end up yeah this is pretty much it phase forty seven of my master plan
6589668 i knew like two women total who were doing treatment activism and i didnt totally get it im not like barbie math is hard but it was a techie world and i didnt feel like i could be all that helpful
6589669 wicked expensive and wicked stupid and also mean so lets make the hospices get what they want and also do the right thing
6589670 and i have no interest in new england hate winter dont like the country not fond of animals
6589671 as it turned out it worked out for them i mean i hope it did i hope theyre happy
6589672 we hope and expect to have her continue hosting a radio show on air america for a long time
6589673 if oreilly hannity and beck can do that so can i
6589674 weve seen the potential for greatness in rachel for years
6589675 whats so remarkable is that now its coming so quickly this election cycle has propelled it forward in a meteoric fashion
6589676 but his war policy stuff now is bullshit its total bullshit and ive never been impressed by it one or two brigades a month you want your son to be in the last brigade
6589677 i have never and still dont think of myself as an obama supporter either professionally or actually
6589678 liberated by having a professional role in which its probably better for me not to take sides
6589679 she wants to talk about aids in prison and the constitution and the war in iraq policy is her main focus not winning elections
6589680 im fascinated by the evil child actor twins that run poland
6589681 how many bails of hundred dollar bills does it take to buy bread today in zimbabwe
6589682 thats the most satisfying thing about being able to do my own story selection
6589683 you get to pick that stuff and whoever is president or in control in congress is not going to affect that
6589684 i love the idea that i am the voice of woman
6589685 look at me its like really the one woman in the room is really mannish
6589686 the only reason i get these opportunities is because of my sensibility
6589687 im not being invited to do these things because of my looks or my facility with language what theyre after is the thing youre saying i have to trade off
6589688 my instinct sometimes is to trade it off like oh im in the big leagues now so i better dial it back but they dont want it dialed back they are booking me or asking me to host because they like what they see
6589689 old mines like the orphan were mined in the 1950s under no federal regulations whatsoever
6589690 most mines today are above the water table which makes chances of leakage practically nil what we have now is a well regulated industry
6589691 we already have the clean water act the national environmental policy act and others that require comprehensive analyses before any mining is done so there wont be impacts to the environment
6589692 at this time were still evaluating plans on an individual basis but a regional study is not something i can rule out
6589693 we hear from the industry and federal government that today we can do it safely
6589694 but thats not the way we do things today we understand and know a lot more about uranium radium and radon and the impacts of those so to say some things that happened in the 1950s and 1960s will happen again today is not a good comparison
6589695 when you take uranium and the other trace elements out of their resting places in nature and expose them to the environment
6589696 you expose them in higher concentrations to the environment and intensify their effects people dont appreciate the cumulative impact of mining in a consolidated area theres a very real threat
6589697 they would continue to be mobile through the aquifer and eventually discharge in springs impacting the human uses of water of these springs
6589698 statements that the historic operations at the orphan mine have been polluting horn creek are false
6589699 approached or exceeded the us environmental protection agencys drinking water standard
6589700 protection of water quality in the colorado river is vital to the long term health and safety of humans and other species we cant afford to simply issue permits and decades from now simply dismiss the consequences as unintended
6589701 were going out onto the corner this is huge huge
6589702 it takes a minute youre gonna be here while your mothers filling it out anyway
6589703 is to change the face of the electorate because its not about getting barack obama elected its about whether were gonna have a progressive majority
6589704 im 72 years old and i certainly hope i live long enough
6589705 this young man is going to be president and i wanna be around to vote for him
6589706 i didnt make any bones about the fact that this was sixty hour a week work and we paid a pittance
6589707 what weve learned is you have to develop a whole system to understand what the laws are
6589708 then you manage people to those laws it becomes a very difficult process
6589709 if all that was going on was the game of party competition then the democrats should want to resist obstacles put in the way of black or low income voters
6589710 theres a great deal of uncertainty and unease about these potential voter groups they will push for policies that the party as a whole doesnt want democrats dont really want this constituency except in emergencies
6589711 i think in general most progressive politicians would like to see more poor and minority voters registered they just dont know how to do it
6589712 empowerment requires creating structure that allows all members of the team to make this campaign his or her own we must go beyond simply assigning volunteers tasks to allowing well trained and supported volunteers to have real ownership within the campaign
6589713 we didnt run a primary campaign where we said come and volunteer but we want you to stay as a volunteer with a tangential connection to the campaign
6589714 it was very much the inclusion piece that allowed us to get to this point we have volunteer leaders that are managing other volunteers
6589715 you never rsvp and i never get you on my sheet im like an anal teacher you need to be on my attendance sheet
6589716 ive got a question for you do you think obama is strong enough to deal with the illuminati
6589717 ga 400 has gotten 365 in a day before most importantly both will be at it again tomorrow
6589718 while sales taxes were increased on the poorest among us shifting the burden to those least able to afford it
6589719 everyone said steve thats nice the obama campaign was nice but you probably shouldnt try to unseat a thirteen year incumbent
6589720 as a result of lower prices for zinc metal continued high operating costs associated with the geology of the balmat mine and general inflationary pressures hudbay has determined that its balmat operation is not economically viable given current market conditions
6589721 i remember getting the ball playing it in to amy rodriguez she laid it back and i just knew that i had to keep it low strike it hard and it went in it was just an unbelievable feeling
6589722 the hottest coolest most famous bimbo in the whole world
6589723 this is a prime example of a long term goal
6589724 this is only a short term goal but see how it can lead up to a long term goal of making enough money off of a blog to pay for a mortgage
6589725 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6589726 a very popular error having the courage of ones convictions rather it is a matter of having the courage for an attack on ones convictions
6589727 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6589728 we did know that number would rise and we very consciously made this announcement while it was on the rise to tell people in advance
6589729 they feel like theyre making good progress they dont have a hard timeline to share on when that will be complete but its important to bring it back up to operations as safely and quickly as we can
6589730 we were able to get through last weekend with some temporary runouts weve decided that were better off to temporarily close a small number of stations
6589731 were not able to make up all the volumes that we would like to but the fact that we have these contracts in place has given us more flexibility than we would otherwise have if we were only dealing with petro canada
6589732 at this point we are counting on petro canada to have their processing unit back up within a reasonable time so that these closures will be temporary we have not made any decisions beyond that
6589733 you might see an impact if you had numerous refineries with an issue like this but so far i dont think that weve noticed any effect on the price
6589734 its great if youre a refinery because it blocks competition and helps you keep our prices up
6589735 but its not good for consumers and at times like this its not good for our operations either because we cant get any gas
6589736 i talked him on the phone last friday and he didnt tell me he was sick or anything
6589737 he was a fantastic leader who didnt back down to anybody players owners or reporters
6589738 i saw him in discussions with owners where he was super tough and didnt back down as a player you had to respect that
6589739 i remember the first player rep meeting i went to in 1990
6589740 i was as green as i could possibly be in terms of the union and union matters after listening to him speak for 45 minutes i knew i was in good hands
6589741 career successes as a professional football player and a union leader are unparalleled
6589742 had the clarity of vision to understand that the true best interests of players was not in strikes and picket lines but in partnership with the board rooms of wealthy owners
6589743 we are giving a structure and a formalization to our executive engagement program
6589744 in the last 12 months mark hurd has met face to face with over 100 partners
6589745 the attendees will be a mixture of our good loyal hp customers and customers that we both hp and sta want to break into
6589746 for me in regard to breaking into new accounts i can use this as a weapon to say to my prospects is ibm or dell bringing in their ceo to meet with you this is a really powerful message
6589747 we want to continue to put partners in front of our executives and we want to give them a way to come into this program
6589748 the best way to destroy your enemy is to make him your friend
6589749 the stage is set for a hostile bid to take over the whole company
6589750 fucking bitch why dont you turn that thing off before you run over some old lady or kid

6589760 hes pitched in big games before hes pitched in the playoffs youre not talking about a kid coming up that is a rookie and doesnt have a ton of innings under his belt in the big leagues were expecting him to throw well and keep us in the game and give us an opportunity if he can go six innings it would be great
6589761 obviously hes very excited to be back in the big leagues and to pitch for the club
6589762 his plan and his focus was to make it back this year and obviously he worked extremely hard to put himself in this position
6589763 when i was a kid we had these two great cats trigger and mopsy mopsy thought she was a human hahaha she sat in chairs like a person trigger attacked shoes thats funny
6589764 um i dont remember then we got this kitten it had big blue eyes what was her name we had her for a few years she had a lot of kittens they were really pretty so everyone wanted them
6589765 well i think one went to a meth head and one went to some people who snuck it into their apartment so they didnt have to pay a pet deposit and one went to some people who left it outside with coyotes and two of them went to a lady who had two other cats
6589766 i dont know we had this other cat named tori and spot and freckles and remmy
6589767 hey if we didnt have kittens there wouldnt be any more cats you self righteous bitch
6589768 it took a lot to say goodbye to the place and id like to see that old stomping ground come back

6589779 they totally understand it was a robbery they totally understand what their son was involved in
6589780 he warned young people not to go down the wrong path
6589781 if they do they would have effectively ended up killing their own parents with their own hand because their loved ones go through all this pain and grief youre killing your own mother youre killing your own father before you end up killing yourself
6589782 i think the guards did exactly what they were trained to do

6589792 with a new laboratory that would be a component of a biodefense campus operated by several agencies
6589793 acquiring growing modifying storing packaging and dispersing classical emerging and genetically engineered pathogens
6589794 this is absolutely without any question what one would do to develop an offensive biological weapons capability
6589795 were going to develop new pathogens for various purposes were going to develop new ways of packaging them new ways of disseminating them were going to harden them to environmental degradation well be prepared to go offensive at the drop of a hat if we so desire
6589796 in essence creating new threats that were going to have to defend ourselves against
6589797 i cannot envision any imaginable justification for changing the antigenicity of anthrax as a defensive measure
6589798 if we saw others doing this kind of research fort detrick we would view it as an infringement of the bioweapons treaty you cant go around the world yelling about iranian and north korean programs about which we know very little when weve got all this going on

6589802 if a worker in one of these facilities removes a single viral particle or a single cell which cannot be detected or prevented that single particle or cell can form the basis of an outbreak
6589803 among our many initiatives we are continuing to develop more forward looking analyses to include red teaming efforts to understand new scientific trends that may be exploited by our adversaries to develop biological weapons and to help position intelligence collectors ahead of the problem
6589804 red teaming means that we actually have people out there on a red team plotting planning scheming and conspiring how to use biowarfare
6589805 advanced forms of biological warfare that can target specific genotypes may transform biological warfare from the realm of terror to a politically useful tool
6589806 it is widely acknowledged that it is virtually impossible to distinguish between defensive and offensive research in the field
6589807 with biological weapons the line between offense and defense is exceedingly difficult to draw in the end secrecy is the greatest enemy of safety
6589808 the u s is now massively expanding its biodefense program mostly in secretive facilities other countries are going to be suspicious this bodes badly for the future of biological weapons control
6589809 and i adore my life because if i die i will be ashamed of my mothers tears

6589814 since 1920 jordan has been preserving al aqsa mosque and the holy sites in jerusalem however jordan cannot single handedly stop the israeli bulldozer and stop israeli schemes to judaise the city
6589815 the idea behind the israeli scheme is to completely destroy the hill in the area remove islamic antiquities and expand the yard in front of al buraq wall for the prayers of the jews
6589816 nothing has happened though and israel is going ahead with its plans to erect the steel bridge
6589817 israel is planning to build the largest synagogue in the world over the sharia court in jerusalem and dig underground tunnels reaching to al aqsa mosque it has also plans to create a telefreek between jabal al zaitun and al rahmah graveyard and another one from ras al amoud to silwan
6589818 these projects were proposed for objection and no one objected to these projects in israel and they are ready to be implemented and the sole way to stop these plans is through building pressure on israel by the arabs and the muslims

6589850 the difference according to parkinson was that everyone had some experiences with projects of the bicycle shed variety in contrast to their experience with nuclear physics buildings
6589851 a few decades ago professor northcote parkinson published a series of essays on the science of public and business administration his law of triviality uses an example that describes the perfunctory discussion on an item concerning an expensive nuclear reactor and compares this with the fierce debate over the proposed new bicycle shed no self respecting committee member would confess to not understanding the construction and economics of a bicycle shed few better illustrations of the workings of the various laws enunciated by parkinson could be provided than the development of nuclear power

6589947 to find so many polar bears at sea at one time is extremely worrisome because it could be an indication that as the sea ice on which they live and hunt continues to melt many more bears may be out there facing similar risk
6589948 as climate change continues to dramatically disrupt the arctic polar bears and their cubs are being forced to swim longer distances to find food and habitat
6589949 while these bears are swimming around in an ice free coastal arctic ocean the only thing the state of alaska is doing is suing the federal government trying to overturn the listing of polar bears the bottom line here is that polar bears need sea ice sea ice is decaying and the bears are in very serious trouble for any people who are still non believers in global warming and the impacts it is having in the arctic this should answer their doubts once and for all

6589951 we zien duidelijk een stijgende lijn zegt sandra keuker van vvv dordrecht
6589952 steeds meer mensen boeken een stadswandeling of dagtocht door de dordtse binnenstad
6589953 we willen vooral veel van de antieke stad zien en de monumenten de deelnemers van de stadswandeling popelen van ongeduld
6589954 we maken ook actief promotie voor de stad we staan op beurzen en in brochures er is echt aan de naamsbekendheid van dordrecht gewerkt
6589955 elk jaar maken we een paar excursies naar interessante steden vertelt paul nuijten van de kring
6589956 dat zijn steden waar wij uit den bosch een soort verwantschap mee voelen
6589957 we hebben nu genoeg gidsen om de vraag aan te kunnen maar mensen met verstand van zaken zijn altijd welkom vooral mensen die meer talen spreken
6589958 toen was het echt zaak om meer mensen bij het gidsenteam te krijgen aan de vooravond van het nieuwe seizoen zegt keuker
6589959 dat lukte maar er zijn ook weer wat mensen weggegaan nu is het toeristenseizoen bijna over en redden we het met de mensen die we hebben
6589960 toen ik begon wist ik al veel van de stad eigenlijk kwam het idee om gids te worden bij me op omdat ik een manier wilde vinden om bezig te blijven met spaans ik kende de taal goed en wilde ermee blijven oefenen
6589961 vaker geef ik groepen uit andere steden een rondleiding door de stad er komen wel meer engelsen en soms wat fransen ook de belgen zijn in opkomst in dordrecht volgens de vvv komt dat door de intensieve contacten die met belgische organisaties zijn gelegd
6589962 dordrecht spreekt tot de verbeelding het is niet voor niets dat films als kuifje en pietje bell hier beelden hebben opgenomen ook een cameraploeg van zwartboek is in de binnenstad komen filmen in dordrecht kun je echt de sfeer van vroeger terughalen dat heb je nergens anders
6589963 dat is juist leuk je maakt zoveel verschillende mensen mee voor de rondleiding vraag ik ook altijd even aan mensen wat ze willen zien een schoolklas wil toch iets anders dan een groep advocaten daar pas ik dan de route op aan
6589964 we letten wel op wat voor groep het is en zoeken daar de beste gids bij zegt keuker

6589967 governor jindal is proposing an unacceptable step backwards for louisiana
6589968 our states proud history of union justice confidence is undermined when our public leaders strip our families of basic protections we should all enjoy there is nothing pro family about rolling back protections for some families
6589969 allowing louisianas anti discrimination order to expire would mean the end of any legal protection for gay citizens in the state
6589970 by not renewing this critically important measure governor jindal would remove the welcome mat from louisianas front door it is imperative and urgent that the governor not allow the states commitment to non discrimination to expire
6589971 i just did that without my hands thats a feet
6589972 years from now what do you want people to remember about maroon 5
6589973 if you could be any beatle who would you be
6589974 paul id definitely be paul id be the shallow one
6589975 weve been away for awhile now were going to travel around america playing rock and roll
6589976 we concluded at the end of the day that based on the psychiatric evidence that ms kangs responsibility was diminished to the point where it more properly met the charge of infanticide but did not absolve her from all responsibility
6589977 this is a tremendous event which demonstrates the skill and determination of firefighters to deliver the best possible service to the public
6589978 the fact that they train in their own time and travel from all over the country to take part proves the dedication firefighters have to saving lives
6589979 our own team has in the past been world champions and i wish them all the best in this challenge
6589980 the court has given the governor and department of pesticide regulation dpr a green light to do away with these rules
6589981 our top priority now is to urge them to do so immediately
6589982 winning in federal court represents a clear and total vindication for our claim that the voc regulations were unnecessary and without any merit
6589983 this sets the stage for the state to repeal its now irrelevant pesticide regulations
6589984 we look forward to working with dpr to discuss ways agriculture can continue to do its part to improve air quality
6589985 but we need to do so in a reasonable common sense way that doesnt obliterate tens of thousands of acres of farmland and results in environmental and economic disaster
6589986 hope in the face of difficulty hope in the face of uncertainty the audacity of hope in the end that is gods greatest gift to us the bedrock of this nation a belief in things not seen a belief that there are better days ahead
6589987 i f we truly hope to speak to people where theyre at to communicate our hopes and values in a way thats relevant to their own then as progressives we cannot abandon the field of religious discourse because when we ignore the debate about what it means to be a good christian or muslim or jew when we discuss religion only in the negative sense of where or how it should not be practiced rather than in the positive sense of what it tells us about our obligations towards one another others will fill the vacuum those with the most insular views of faith or those who cynically use religion to justify partisan ends
6589988 our failure as progressives to tap into the moral underpinnings of the nation is not just rhetorical though
6589989 the final thing that i think the moses generation teaches us is to remind ourselves that we do what we do because god is with us you know when moses was first called to lead people out to the promised land the lord said i will be with you throw down that rod pick it back up ill show you what to do the same thing happened with the joshua generation joshua said you know im scared im not sure that i am up to the challenge the lord said to him every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon i have given you be strong and have courage for i am with you wherever you go be strong and have courage its a prayer for a journey a prayer that kept a woman in her seat when the bus driver told her to get up a prayer that led nine children through the doors of that little rock school a prayer that carried our brothers and sisters over a bridge right here in selma alabama be strong and have courage
6589990 we think of faith as a source of comfort and understanding but find our expressions of faith sowing division we believe ourselves to be a tolerant people even as racial religious and cultural tensions roil the landscape and instead of resolving these tensions or mediating these conflicts our politics fans them exploits them and drives us further apart
6589991 well i say to them tonight theres not a liberal america and a conservative america theres the united states of america theres not a black america and white america and latino america and asian america theres the united states of america the pundits like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue states red states for republicans blue states for democrats but ive got news for them too we worship an awesome god in the blue states and we dont like federal agents poking around our libraries in the red states we coach little league in the blue states and have gay friends in the red states there are patriots who opposed the war in iraq and patriots who supported it we are one people all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes all of us defending the united states of america
6589992 conservative leaders need to understand the critical role that the separation of church and state has played in preserving not only our democracy but the robustness of our religious practice
6589993 given the increasing diversity of americas population the dangers of sectarianism have never been greater whatever we once were we are no longer just a christian nation we are also a jewish nation a muslim nation a buddhist nation a hindu nation and a nation of nonbelievers
6589994 we should never forget that god granted us the power to reason so that we would do his work here on earth so that we would use science to cure disease and heal the sick and save lives
6589995 pastors friends of mine like rick warren and t d jakes are wielding their enormous influences to confront aids third world debt relief and the genocide in darfur religious thinkers and activists like our good friend jim wallis and tony campolo are lifting up the biblical injunction to help the poor as a means of mobilizing christians against budget cuts to social programs and growing inequality across the country individual churches like my own and your own are sponsoring day care programs building senior centers helping ex offenders reclaim their lives and rebuilding our gulf coast in the aftermath of hurricane katrina
6589996 and although government will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes we need more money and programs alone will not get us where we need to go each of us in our own lives will have to accept responsibility for instilling an ethic of achievement in our children for adapting to a more competitive economy for strengthening our communities and sharing some measure of sacrifice so let us begin let us begin this hard work together let us transform this nation
6589997 this project is commendable for its very simple and sculptural forms responding to the site and adjacent building
6589998 the solid concrete masonry block forms are pulled away from each other then linked lightly with a glass box to create clear circulation and to bring an abundance of natural light into the interior spaces the jury loved the perforated concrete masonry wall of the gym and how it causes the wall to change through the day and night
6589999 the addition of a neighborhood gymnasium in east anaheim adds to the spirit of community
