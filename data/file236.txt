2360093 six decades for our people and three decades for the people of eastern europe during that time we have been through a spiritual training far in advance of western experience lifes complexity and mortal weight have produced stronger deeper and more interesting characters than those produced by standardized western well being it is true no doubt that a society cannot remain in an abyss of lawlessness as is the case in our country but it is also demeaning for it to elect such mechanical legalistic smoothness as you have after the suffering of decades of violence and oppression the human soul longs for things higher warmer and purer than those offered by todays mass living habits introduced by the revolting invasion of publicity by tv stupor and by intolerable music

2360097 its extremely possible one could say highly likely that the same people responsible for perpetrating the attacks were the ones who fed the false reports to the public through abc news that saddam was behind them what we know for certain as a result of the letters accompanying the anthrax is that whoever perpetrated the attacks wanted the public to believe they were sent by foreign muslims seven years later its difficult for many people to recall but as ive amply documented those abc news reports linking saddam and anthrax penetrated very deeply by design into our public discourse and into the public consciousness those reports were absolutely vital in creating the impression during that very volatile time that islamic terrorists generally and iraq and saddam hussein specifically were grave existential threats to this country

2360121 madrid now know they are dealing with a different animal and cristiano will settle down and enjoy his career here he has got four years left on his contract and at some point hopefully we would like to extend it
2360122 you would not like to think that one of the biggest players in the world can just walk out and does not respect his contract
2360123 the specialist he saw yesterday is delighted with the progress
2360124 well now take him to the next stage and for a month he will be in rehabilitation and then he should be in full training by that time

2360132 a very aggressive play if that ball gets through its a different story but it was obviously a huge play
2360133 its a little odd to play against a group of individuals that ive been so close to for so long its like playing in the backyard with your family so its different that way
2360134 but you know you got to separate and move on
2360135 thats what its all about having fun the guy thats pitching over there is a great friend of mine
2360136 hes been a good player his whole career he had a good day today i didnt notice anything and nobody said anything to me about it
2360137 if you look around everybody gets excited when they do great thats just the way the game is today
2360138 thats why we call it a team at some point in the season all 25 count
2360139 i know what my job is i just got to stay ready when they need me
2360140 he didnt leave me a whole lot of plate but i thought i might have snuck my hand in there when he called me out he had a pretty good view of it
2360141 when a team is on a bad roll as were the as you want to keep them down
2360142 not sure my role long term is as a closer
2360143 but ill come in from the bullpen pitch a couple of innings and anything i can do to help the team i will
2360144 he got us to hit the ball on the ground
2360145 when you dont throw a million mph youve got to be able to hit your spots and just let them know that youre going to control that part of the plate

2360151 he did a good job coming back at us and pitching seven strong innings we didnt do much to him
2360152 he doesnt bother me as much as some of the other guys
2360153 when i pitch i try to think the other team is the best in baseball
2360154 can feel the difference see a little more life on the ball
2360155 we need to do a better job getting to the relievers with a good lead
2360156 learn that there are things that are very valuable and are not taught in school
2360157 dont get caught up in what other people want you to do
2360158 everything you just learned means nothing in the real world
2360159 no matter how prepared you are for real life youre not its hard stressful and sometimes cruel when your parents said college was the best time of their lives they werent kidding
2360160 get to know something abut each of your co workers even or especially the quiet or odd ones
2360161 dont be afraid to look stupid ive met plenty of people i didnt like but i have yet to meet anyone who didnt have something they could teach me about
2360162 real life isnt like high school but some workplaces are

2360164 people you went to high school with wont matter in 2 3 years quit worrying about them

2360174 i threw the ball a lot better than the linescore said
2360175 i just really got outpitched theres nothing really more to say
2360176 that last start i was trying to get out alive
2360177 i didnt care if i gave up 100 runs that game i was so beat out there i was so exhausted out there
2360178 he was attacking the zone with like nine pitches it seemed like
2360179 i think a j was not hustling on the play
2360180 he hit the ball and pretty much thought it was out of play
2360181 when i hit it and drew caught it i didnt know where it went
2360182 i thought it kicked away from him just trying to make something positive here hoping we can get a run to score o c did a good job reading the throws
2360183 im like his mini me when hes out there i just get excited
2360184 since hes come over here hes been awesome you get a pitcher like that you want to give him everything youve got so you can make sure he gets the win hes doing his part
2360185 i dont sit there in my office and dream hes going to go 7 0 or 6 0 whatever hes just been almost unhittable or unscorable since hes been here
2360186 thats usually what i try to do go out and throw strikes they were swinging early and that helped me out
2360187 the first couple innings i was trying to do too much and you cant pitch that way
2360188 if theres a guy thats got every pitching going like that theres really not anything you can do as a hitter
2360189 you just have to pick a pitch and hope he makes a mistake
2360190 its a lot easier to catch cc than it is to hit against him
2360191 im not competitive with them actresses i root for all of them because we definitely dont have equality with men in this business

2360196 it was in a container in my safe and it hadnt been touched there was no reason to touch it
2360197 he was dying thats what they told me he was basically living on charity the church had paid for his living situation my concern was just to help everybody else
2360198 i was escorted out of las vegas and i havent been back
2360199 which certainly is going to make the identification process easier
2360200 we havent been able to speak with him and the u s attorneys office would have a role to play in charging anyone

2360207 if you watched the texans in their first five seasons it became easy to forget the importance of qb play thats a ridiculous statement but when you dont have something when youre accustomed to coaches trying to work around the weakness trying to pretend it doesnt exist its easy to lose sight of the big picture nfl quarterbacks are in a unique position unlike any other in sports their job description begins with being productive on the field but leadership and public relations are important to theyre almost always the face of the franchise

2360212 ive seen accusations made that jews control the us government media economy and so on
2360213 im palestinian and for some reason every freakin tom dick amp harry i meet thinks he can bitch to me about the jews
2360214 the virulence with which critics have attacked this workshop illustrates how needed it is
2360215 has to come from a perspective of justice for all people
2360216 the number of leftists with real anti jewish beliefs is tiny
2360217 because the point of anti jewish oppression is to keep a jewish face in front so that jews instead of ruling classes become the target for peoples rage it works even more smoothly when jews are allowed some success and can be perceived as the ones in charge by other oppressed groups
2360218 in some of the most famous examples of anti jewish expulsion and mass murder ie medieval spain or modern germany just prior to the attacks jews appeared to be one of societys most successful comfortable well integrated minorities
2360219 judeophobia never served as an ordering principle for american society and politics in the way that racism against black americans has for hundreds of years
2360220 in an issue where some jews do have real power it can get hard to tell whats an accurate observation of unjust actions they have done and whats antisemitic thinking

2360283 offering 4 billion more in tax breaks to the biggest oil companies in america including 1 2 billion to exxon mobil a company that last quarter made the same amount of money in 30 seconds that a typical ohio worker makes in a year
2360284 is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon and senator mccain not only wants them to keep every dime of that money he wants to give them more so make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on senator mccain
2360285 through june exxon employees have given obama 42 100 to mccains 35 166 chevron favors obama 35 157 to 28 500 and obama edges out mccain with bp 16 046 vs 11 500

2360287 i think senator obama might be a little bit confused yesterday he accused me of having president bushs policies on energy thats odd because he voted for the presidents energy bill and i voted against it i voted against it had 2 8 billion in corporate welfare to big oil companies and theyre already making record profits as you know senator obama voted for that bill and its big oil giveaways i know he hasnt been in the senate that long but even in the real world voting for something means you support it and voting against something means you oppose it

2360306 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around the banks will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs

2360348 by elevating single motherhood from an unfortunate consequence of poor planning to a sophisticated act of self fulfilment weve helped to fashion a world in which fathers are not just scarce but in which men are superfluous
2360349 at the same time that men have been ridiculed in the public sphere the importance of fatherhood has been diminished along with other traditionally male roles of father protector and provider which are incredibly viewed as regressive manifestations of an outmoded patriarchy
2360350 when we take away a mans central purpose in life and marginalise him from

2360442 sus promesas de libertad de prensa para los periodistas chinos y extranjeros ya que la censura es omnipresente y los chinos que se la saltan se arriesgan a ser encarcelados
2360443 estas manifestaciones tienen como objetivo pedir la libertad de los periodistas y defensores de los derechos humanos chinos que han sido detenidos acosados u obligados a marcharse de beijing

2360445 sierra conservation center and mule creek state prison are the first california institutions to integrate and there are plans for integration to spread statewise by january it is anticipated that all 30 of california s prisons will make the transition by 2010
2360446 california will surely benefit when its prisons are de segregated in short all sound penalogic policies will be advanced by getting california out of the practice of racially segregating its prisoners

2360450 were it otherwise any action the federal government were to take including action on its own land would be subject to the personalized oversight of millions of citizens each citizen would hold an individual veto to prohibit the government action solely because it offends his religious beliefs sensibilities or tastes or fails to satisfy his religious desires further giving one religious sect a veto over the use of public park land would deprive others of the right to use what is by definition land that belongs to everyone
2360451 we are very excited the court ruled in favor for snowbowl and the usage of public land this ensures the future for skiing in arizona

2360462 microsoft is quadrupling the number of sites it searches for new information and overhauled the core technology that decides which results to display
2360463 genes and hormones may predispose a person to one sexuality rather than another but thats all predisposition and determination are two different things
2360464 if heterosexuality and homosexuality are indeed genetically predetermined how do we explain bisexuality or people who suddenly in mid life switch from heterosexuality to homosexuality or vice versa we cant
2360465 far more ambiguous blurred and overlapping than any theory of genetic causality can allow
2360466 examples of sexual flexibility dont square with genetic theories of rigid erotic predestination
2360467 to deny choice to make it appear that homosexuals cannot help it and to argue that any criticism of the gay lifestyle is as silly as criticism of being left handed or red haired
2360468 and this has been a deliberate strategy by homosexual activists they have done a very good job to convince a gullible public that homosexuals are born that way and cannot change
2360469 i love the clothes everyone is good looking the plot line is a riot
2360470 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2360471 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2360472 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2360473 a car flipped over its upside down i dont see any police here
2360474 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2360475 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2360476 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2360477 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2360478 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2360479 my god daughter just turned 16 and lives on the coast
2360480 the 2007 season had some great moments and great success we hope to continue that momentum with our program and in particular in the 2008 season
2360481 andrew wiedeman and davis paul had very good freshmen seasons scot van buskirk gave us quality minutes as well were looking forward to getting jacob wilson back after his medical redshirt year
2360482 our midfield has always been the strength of our team particularly the depth
2360483 we have plenty of players who can contribute this year pat marion and servando carrasco both had good seasons for us last year were looking forward to getting hector jimenez back after his redshirt year anthony avalos ian ebert michael nieraeth and demitrius omphroy all made great strides last year and could have breakout seasons in 2008
2360484 the adjustments we have made this past spring in our backline have turned out to be great ones
2360485 with the presence of tyler barry a j soares evan sassano and kyle rice our back four hasnt missed a beat josh brown chris deal imaan kerchgani and josh leon also look to make a significant contribution to the back four
2360486 jordan bethke and patrick fry add depth and experience all four of our goalkeepers have great qualities in their games this position has the most competition for playing time out of any other on the field
2360487 so far we have no idea how it is possible that someone officially reported missing so long ago was not found before in the same apartment she used to live in
2360488 when officers went there they said it was like stepping into a place frozen in time
2360489 the cup she had been drinking tea from was still on a table next to the chair she had been sitting in and the house was full of things no one had seen for decades nothing had been disturbed for decades even though there were more than a few cobwebs in there
2360490 the club can confirm al bangura returned home early from the recent tour of austria for disciplinary reasons these have since been dealt with internally
2360491 im still devastated by what happened at leicester and the fact im no longer there
2360492 but i want to get back in the game as soon as possible this is the first time in 30 years ive not had a pre season as a player or as a manager
2360493 but im waiting for someone else to fail arent i
2360494 thats the nature of football management and in the meantime im left to re educate myself
2360495 im looking to exploit as many media opportunities as possible and am taking my a licence qualification
2360496 im going to watch as many games as possible and hopefully the call will come
2360497 you have got two great big sides in league one this season in leicester and leeds
2360498 hopefully he will develop a strong relationship with the chairman and the players should certainly find it easier than in the championship
2360499 leicester are down at the moment but i look at one of the greatest stories in footballing history
2360500 when bill shankly took over at liverpool they were a second division side in the doldrums
2360501 people said he was crazy when he said they were going to win promotion and be champions of europe
2360502 its like a warzone and everyone needs to be pulling together in the trenches and thats what id say to leicester
2360503 if you back a manager then as an owner you are entitled to expect a return on your investment
2360504 qpr is another fantastic club i had five years as a player and five as manager and id love to see them back in the premier league

2360508 i think he just has a better rhythm when he breathes every stroke
2360509 hes getting more air and thats a good thing when he picks his head up every stroke he balances better
2360510 he gets better distance per stroke holds onto more water per stroke
2360511 hes also a little flatter in the water than he used to be and hes stronger
2360512 what we worked on is coordinating his arms and his kick and activating his core muscles in every way
2360513 we worked on trying to do some drills like alex riding the stroke he was always a very good kicker what weve worked on most is distance per stroke maximum amount of water pulled
2360514 i think michael has this incredible feel for the water that i do not think is taught
2360515 its natural his hands are so synchronized underneath the water with almost no bubbles that is so rare you either have it or you dont but it cannot be ignored how the guy works his butt off

2360540 i threw the ball a lot better than the linescore said
2360541 i just really got outpitched theres nothing really more to say
2360542 that last start i was trying to get out alive
2360543 i didnt care if i gave up 100 runs that game i was so beat out there i was so exhausted out there
2360544 he was attacking the zone with like nine pitches it seemed like
2360545 i think a j was not hustling on the play
2360546 he hit the ball and pretty much thought it was out of play
2360547 when i hit it and drew caught it i didnt know where it went
2360548 i thought it kicked away from him just trying to make something positive here hoping we can get a run to score o c did a good job reading the throws
2360549 to me phelps is way above that level because the sport is so much more competitive now like in other sports hes the kind of athlete who comes along once in a century
2360550 hes definitely on the verge of something special i think eight golds is very feasible for him
2360551 he really does a wonderful job at taking one day at a time and attacking whatevers in front of him for that day
2360552 i like to see him challenged because that really brings out his best
2360553 if they gave black belts for handling pressure hes about a sixth degree black belt
2360554 we thank you and the chinese people and we applaud you for the hard work that has gone into these preparations
2360555 it is an honor to be able to witness first hand the memorable and wonderful preparations china has made and the spectacular facilities and exciting games that are connected with olympic events

2360567 sergius gambals pride in his alma mater was apparent in so many ways including using the moniker of gws athletic teams as the name of his parking company

2360569 ebp is based on the idea that nurses can contribute to the development of a scientific base for nursing practice by critiquing and questioning standard guidelines treatments and outcomes it empowers nurses on the front lines to fix problems
2360570 this focus of this grant will help distinguish our doctor of nursing practice program from the others and the skills of cultural competence and evidence based practice are what employers tell us they are looking for
2360571 our students will be challenged to learn how to design deliver and lead interdisciplinary primary health care teams in developing and implementing culturally competent best practices we expect our graduates to make significant contributions to the overall health of our nation which will include addressing national health disparities
2360572 they dont know when or if to begin treatment if neurologists knew which patients were at high risk for rapid progression to ms they could treat them with disease modifying therapy that appears to be beneficial in early ms
2360573 remarkably 100 percent of the patients in subgroup 1 converted to ms within nine months
2360574 in contrast only 20 percent of patients from the other groups converted in the same period of time and even after 30 months only 50 percent of them converted
2360575 the fact that the gene is less active in these cells suggests that cis patients at high risk of conversion have impaired regulation of cd4 t cell quiescence possibly resulting in earlier activation of pathogenic cd4 t cells
2360576 were not sure if what were seeing is a cause or earlier molecular effect already going on in these patients regardless we believe tob1 is part of a signature that together with other cell cycle genes suggests a pathway for therapeutically targeting patients with cis
2360577 riverview apartments is an important step in creating a college town across the river from campus that will strengthen the partnership between the university and its neighbors
2360578 this is the first of many upcoming projects that will create a neighborhood thriving with economic and social activity
2360579 this project owes its success to the cooperation and support of many players including the city of rochester matrix development corp and both the plymouth exchange and 19th ward neighborhoods from the university i want to particularly thank ronald paprocki our chief financial officer for his leadership in this collaboration
2360580 we are very proud of this development because it not only improves the neighborhood and waterfront it complements other developments in the area including brooks landing the olean kennedy project and kennedy towers
2360581 i applaud the university of rochester for their leadership on this and numerous other efforts to make rochester a greater place to live work and do business
2360582 the university is working with the neighbors to design programs that will connect our students to the community
2360583 student response to riverview has been stronger than we expected
2360584 the complex filled to capacity and has generated a lengthy waiting list
2360585 my thoughts and the thoughts of everyone at the university are with sam his family friends and coworkers
2360586 sam is a valuable and well liked member of our team at the laboratory with over nine years of service and our hopes and prayers are with him
2360587 safety is the most important priority of the laboratory and we will continue to work closely with federal and university officials
2360588 in previous simulations this region came out smooth but now we have enough detail to see clumps of dark matter
2360589 some of those clumps are so dense they will emit a lot of gamma rays if there is dark matter annihilation and it might easily be detected by glast
2360590 there are several candidate particles for cold dark matter and our predictions for glast depend on the assumed particle type and its properties
2360591 for typical wimps anywhere from a handful to a few dozen clear signals should stand out from the gamma ray background after two years of observations that would be a big discovery for glast
2360592 it simulates the dark matter distribution from near the time of the big bang until the present epoch so practically the entire age of the universe and focuses on resolving the halo around a galaxy like the milky way
2360593 we see a lot of substructure even in the inner part of the halo where the solar system is
2360594 every substructure has its own sub substructure and so on there are lumps on all scales
2360595 we can make comparisons with the dwarf galaxies and stellar streams associated with the milky way the appearance of these stellar systems is closely linked to the substructure of the dark matter halo
2360596 there is every reason to now believe that the broadcast networks will rely more on quality canadian programming in the future

2360599 the food value of nori lies in its high protein content 25 35 of dry weight vitamins and mineral salts especially iodine its vitamin c content is about 1 5 times that of oranges and 75 of the protein and carbohydrates are digestible by humans which is very high for seaweeds

2360601 the smog hanging over beijing as the olympic games open has bemused athletes and onlookers particularly those from australia who find anything other than clear blue skies unsettling the thick haze comes from many sources from cooking fires to cars and coal fired power stations
2360602 the chinese authorities have done what they can to mitigate it but so far at least it has proved unstoppable
2360603 the olympic games in beijing may well mark the start of chinas global ascendancy in the 21st century the array of national leaders who have made their way to the olympic city many more than have attended previous games shows they sense a new era is dawning
2360604 within two decades according to some projections chinas economy will pass the united states to be the largest on the planet with money comes power and this century may also see china become the leading superpower
2360605 however things turn out the rise of china will continue to have consequences for world and regional security a world in which china is the leading player will look rather different from the one we are accustomed to
2360606 there is a need instead to push the governments of myanmars neighbors to unite against the regime
2360607 in this anniversary year the generals have to be shown that their behavior is not acceptable asean is finally doing its bit china must now also use its influence to push the agenda india and russia have to follow suit it is in everyones interest that myanmar be lifted from its sorry circumstances and be allowed to prosper

2360630 in previous seasons it was sometimes said that my end product wasnt good enough
2360631 i worked hard on that and i managed to set up a few goals
2360632 i maybe answered my critics by doing that and thats the aim again to set up goals and score more goals
2360633 eight goals isnt a bad return and i dont think im the worst finisher at the club but i know i could have scored more goals
2360634 last season my target was to hit double figures i managed to get eight and that was okay but i think i can score more
2360635 i hit the woodwork a few times last season and ill be looking to improve my finishing
2360636 my main aim is to maintain the consistency i had last season but i know its going to be harder
2360637 the mark of a good player is if you kick on improve and be more consistent
2360638 having a good season was pleasing but i want to progress and improve again
2360639 it was important to start the campaign with a win

2360651 i will rest players on saturday many players will not play
2360652 we wanted an intense game and i think ajax gave us more than we wanted they fought for every ball and played well
2360653 in the whole game we were always dangerous going forward but they took advantage of two lapses of concentration and scored two fantastic goals
2360654 some players are still a bit short physically but i am not really concerned
2360655 i dont know if our midfield was ideal but its certainly not far from the midfield well play wednesday night
2360656 we missed nasri and diaby song is away at the olympics so we have plenty of candidates there
2360657 what a joke i got up this morning to watch the ceremony assuming that it would be on
2360658 they thought people could pretend to ignore such an important event was happening on the other side of the globe its impossible
2360659 i cant understand how in 2008 in the era of instant access with multiple media outlets nbc behaves as if we are in 1950 and has the guts to make audiences wait for a live coverage that many other countries in the world can see as they are taking place
2360660 richest country in the world and we cant watch the olympic opening ceremony live its being shown live all over the world nbc is pathetic
2360661 nbc is an acronym for not airing before making big cash the chinese may censor their people over politics our corporate overlords sensor sic us over profits
2360662 men who can only find pleasure in life by galloping about the countryside without a thought in their heads
2360663 i will participate in debate how many and where i participate in a debate will be determined later
2360664 what hes learned in the last year since hes been back is he can perform all the things he needs to do to be an effective senator
2360665 certainly his record is something we would like to discuss with him and i hoped wed have that opportunity in a public forum
2360666 someone could misconstrue or play games with his speech and i dont want that to happen
2360667 its unusual for any candidate to deprive the voters of every opportunity to see them in action
2360668 it is a tribute it is honoring our past honoring our families honoring all those descendants there of
2360669 this time last year we got the word around and in two months time we had enough money to buy the sculpture
2360670 this just adds a little bit more to that same kind of idea that sioux falls is getting better every year
2360671 and i never saw a train at that time of day ever
2360672 i was definitely at the wrong place at the wrong time
2360673 i just basically had to hit it i really didnt have a choice
2360674 i thought i was going to die on the helicopter ride to mckennan because i couldnt breath all my ribs were broken on my left side
2360675 for the cost of the lights for the railroad to put them up is immaterial compared to what a human life is worth
2360676 and were seeing now that the numbers are decreasing or stable the boom is done in soccer with tennis i think were going to see more of a consistency with growth because its a sport you can play your whole life
2360677 it is the only traditional sport that actually has grown in participation in the united states for the last 12 years
2360678 were up probably 300 from what we had last year
2360679 and the only thing i can contribute that to is just tennis is general in america right now is on the upswing again
2360680 i thought maybe we would get 75 or 100 kids
2360681 and when we got 225 we were just floored we had no idea that the interest would be that high
2360682 and one of the things we were told when we first brought this idea to harrisburg was well we need to know how much support there is with the kids and i think weve demonstrated that
2360683 hes like oh this is so cool this is so much fun
2360684 were all going to be huddled around the computer watching at about four in the morning
2360685 he wants to know hows the wheat doing is it looking good or has it been raining
2360686 my response is always oh its great dont worry about it everything is taken care of
2360687 hope that he does well and were very proud of him and let him continue his dream
2360688 i dont have an answer for it were trying if anything were trying too hard
2360689 it wouldnt surprise me to see the campaign stay on the air between now and november just to remind voters that he is one running for re election and two doing his job in the senate
2360690 i think the debates would have been hard for the senator they require speaking in an allotted period of time sometimes its a minute sometimes its 30 seconds
2360691 hes certainly not going to leave voters with an impression that perhaps hes not up to the job
2360692 many times were there before the ambulance gets there for a heart attack or something like that those first few minutes are very important
2360693 this adds to confidence of the officer were cpr certified every 2 years two years is a long period of time and on tends to forget if youre not going the procedure on a regular basis or practicing thats where the pocket cpr really comes in handy
2360694 it tells you what to do and if youre doing it correctly and we want to do it correctly
2360695 a defibrillator approximately 1500 dollars compared to 200 dollars if departments dont have the defibrillator i would definitely encourage them to invest in the pocket cpr and even if they do have a defibrillator the pocket cpr is an excellent companion
2360696 will miss not only analysts consensus estimates of its fourth quarter and full year 2006 revenues but its own estimates as well
2360697 buy a house where the monthly payment is no more than 25 of your take home pay on a 15 year fix mortgage
2360698 if you want to be wealthy buy a home no more than twice your annual income
2360699 traditional big company approach featuring elaborate software installations at the clients office wont work
2360700 if anything what we achieved last year should inspire you as a player because you want days like that
2360701 thats why i came to celtic and i want to lift that trophy again this season
2360702 id be happy if we even won it on the final day this year as long as we win it i dont care how we win it although i am sure that the celtic fans and us as players would be happy if we won it with a few games to spare
2360703 after four weeks off a lot of us miss it you can see that in a lot of the lads they keep fit over the summer and are itching to get back and you could see that in the way they were flying in the first few days of the training
2360704 i just cant wait to get back playing competitive matches especially in front of the fans at celtic park
2360705 st mirren will be a really tough start for us and well have to hit the ground running
2360706 theyve added a few good players and there are a few others like craig dargo who are coming back from long term injuries
2360707 the ceremony that opened the 29th olympic games last night outdid all of its predecessors in numbers color noise and expense demonstrating to the world that the new china intends to make its presence felt
2360708 one olympic ideal the separation of sport and politics died in the chinese night
2360709 this was the choreographed demonstration of might the like of which the olympics has never seen a rebuke to george w bush and nicolas sarkozy vocal critics of chinese foreign and domestic policy sitting in the audience
2360710 the age of chinese power dawned in a spellbinding and futuristic curtain lifter which featured 15 000 different types of costume and 14 000 performers 9 000 of them on loan from the peoples liberation army
2360711 to say these games would be a landmark in world politics was no idle claim last night proved it
2360712 will study the dvd for years to come and plunder beijings visual tricks
2360713 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2360714 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly i only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby
2360715 music should be a little more free we shouldnt be criticizing as much as we do
2360716 the artist and the radio are just as much at fault but here is a piece of music that you can like theres a lot of collaborations where as desire was more just me holding it down this is going to have some special appearances
2360717 i grew up on both so this project is like a double ep with a rock influenced side and a disco influenced side im gonna have t shirts that say rock vs disco which do you love
2360718 im playing a killer im not going to give anything else away
2360719 its a bank robbing movie so its one of those action packed films you get a little different side of me in that movie
2360720 its a new age young hip hop version of heat
2360721 these are young cool well dressed articulate bank robbers chris be the little homey
2360722 at the end of the day im going to focus on my music first
2360723 but me being onstage enhances me being in the movie and then me being in the movie acting catching characters gives me time to transform into a different character onstage
2360724 of course i mean for a lot of americans including the family that i grew up with i mean its fundamental to how you judge people and human character whether you keep your word whether you keep what is your ultimate word which is that you love your spouse and youll stay with them i think the most important qualities in a president in todays world are trustworthiness sincerity honesty strength of leadership and and certainly that goes to a part of that
2360725 said shama 22 a marine corps veteran who served in ramadi iraq and is now an intern at the jerusalem funds palestine center in washington d c hes working toward a degree in international relations with the dream of working in the u s state department office of middle eastern affairs
2360726 when it comes to the quran im sure it says youre not supposed to wage war against others of the same religion
2360727 in ramadi iraq we were fighting al qaeda and al qaeda every day in the news at the time they were blowing up a mosque killing muslims and women and children to me i wasnt fighting against muslims i was fighting against extremists who had taken the religion
2360728 there were times we were going in places where instead of it having to be an ugly situation where marines dont speak arabic telling them to move from room to room instead i could speak to them
2360729 by the end of the day we were sitting there sipping tea with the iraqis in the house everybody is relaxing talking
2360730 i can never complain about being arabic and being in the military
2360731 because of the way my leaders have treated me i have nothing to complain about if anything being arab and being muslim in the military right now benefits a unit so much if anything it helps your career
2360732 pentahos projects are downloaded more than 100 000 times a month representing more users than the installed bases of proprietary bi stalwarts business objects cognos and hyperion combined
2360733 from carnegie to rockefeller it was never how much they made at work that made them wealthy it was their investments
2360734 spending 100 of ones income isnt reasonable saving every single penny while living like a pauper is not either
2360735 beige is everything in life that is bland mediocre average and boring
2360736 the biggest suggestion i have is to avoid credit cards interest rates are very high on credit cards sometimes they are 18 percent sometimes they are 20 percent if i borrowed money at 18 or 20 percent id be broke so if i had one piece of advice for young people generally it would be to just avoid credit cards
2360737 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2360738 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly i only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby
2360739 justice obviously was a huge record for us we took the ride the lightning and master of puppets concept as far as we could take it
2360740 there was no place else to go with the progressive nutty sideways side of metallica and im so proud of the fact that in some way that album is kind of the epitome of that progressive side of us up through the 80s
2360741 theres a certain kind of specific sound to that record peculiar sound whichever adverb you want to choose thats given it a kind of life of its own and a little bit of a vibe all its own there have been a lot of great musicians we admire whove come up and talked about what a great inspiration that album has been to them and to their sound its obviously awesome to be part of that that album also sent us on this whole other merry way because when we came back from touring on that record in 1989 we were like we have nothing more to offer on this side of metallica and that set us off on some other adventures when i think of the nine records weve put out its impossible for me to think of the music without thinking of the experience and when i think of the experience i have warm and fuzzy feelings but i also have questions obviously justice is well revered especially among a lot of our peers
2360742 that album songwriting wise it was just us really showing off and trying to show what we could do
2360743 weve jammed six riffs into one song lets make it eight lets go crazy with it i listen to some of that stuff and its pretty progressive sonically it has its shortcomings but that is the one where we were able to step forward from
2360744 we mixed that record while we were on the road
2360745 thats not an excuse for the way that it sounds but our ears were beat anywhere i go whenever i ask someone what their favorite record is someones bound to say justice its pretty great that across the line someone can jump into your history and feel comfortable
2360746 id have to go song by song i was just listening to 1997s reload and there are a couple of songs on there that i think are absolutely brilliant but as an album itself and as a time justice just isnt a good memory for me but those songs are good i have to try and erase the memory of that experience somehow and let the songs take me
2360747 its always the next one i think the forthcoming is great but theres always a better something the holy grail of guitar sounds i havent got there yet but i will on the next one ill write the ultimate song on the next one the hunger is always there to do it better
2360748 i dont have an excuse i just need a little help
2360749 due to various reasons it wasnt working out with us and him
2360750 we felt his heart was no longer in it after expressing his want to leave on numerous occasions this year which showed when he played live
2360751 surprise n a it was bound to happen sooner or later
2360752 yeah i went green and 26s on the hybrid smoke so much green that i cant open up my eyelids
2360753 wake up in london go to sleep on atlanta time still my paint got more candy than your valentine
2360754 trouble i dont shy away from it i annihilate suckas in their driveway in church on sunday morning praying bout what happened friday
2360755 basically were naming everything girls like in a song so when you hear it youll understand exactly what im talking about if you dont know what girls like then im going to tell you in this song im going to let you know exactly what they like just give you a couple points its going to help you with the entire rest of your life thats what its going to help you with for sure
2360756 were in the works of doing a whole lot of very creative stuff
2360757 the whole album every song is a movie thats basically how it comes down i dont even have features on the album the first single is not even featuring chris brown and sean garrett its co starring chris brown and sean garrett thats what i have on this album its all stars basically its co starring people because its a movie every song is a movie creatively and conceptually i think people are definitely going to understand that this is something that was very creatively put together it took a minute but every song is very serious
2360758 im playing a killer im not going to give anything else away
2360759 its a bank robbing movie so its one of those action packed films you get a little different side of me in that movie
2360760 its a new age young hip hop version of heat
2360761 these are young cool well dressed articulate bank robbers chris be the little homey
2360762 at the end of the day im going to focus on my music first
2360763 but me being onstage enhances me being in the movie and then me being in the movie acting catching characters gives me time to transform into a different character onstage
2360764 i think manny is in danger i think de la hoya is too big for him he might be able to handle mannys punches but manny might not be able to handle de la hoyas punch
2360765 when they go up the ring de la hoya would weigh at least 160 lbs while manny is 148 lbs at the heaviest and he would then be bloated
2360766 justice obviously was a huge record for us we took the ride the lightning and master of puppets concept as far as we could take it

2360777 we felt his heart was no longer in it after expressing his want to leave on numerous occasions this year which showed when he played live
2360778 without having to go through the hard work of saving and investing like most rich people do
2360779 we saw a similar pattern in a study of how businesspeople perceived past choices between work and pleasure over time those who had indulged felt less and less guilty about their choices whereas those who had been dutiful experienced a growing sense of having missed out on the pleasures of life
2360780 if only i had that kind of money id be setting myself up for a lifetime of leisure instead of throwing it away

2360783 were at the lowest level in oil prices in months and there is a real feeling that the trend has turned
2360784 lower oil prices are good for businesses and good for consumers for the inflation picture and they will improve growth somewhere down the line
2360785 driven notably by its evolving economics iphone now unlocked greater subsidies leading to lower retail price and no geographic exclusivity
2360786 just want to personally say how sorry i am to have to do this i never take postponing a show lightly and if there were any possible way i could pull this off i would this is a very frustrating and maddening situation for me and i appreciate your understanding ill make it up to you
2360787 we have to say we re mighty frustrated to see evidence that the olympics is happening all around us but when we turn on nbc we get today show hosts yapping about chinese breakfast foods
2360788 for me to play against milan it is very important because of the time i spent playing in italy

2360808 he will get better this season which is great for liverpool and has got to be a worry for the rest of the division

2360843 eu n o posso falar diretamente sobre esse caso mas sobre o m todo que seria o acesso a cadastro de pessoas investigadas n o de pessoas n o investigadas e um hist rico de chamadas dessas pessoas at porque facilita a autoridade policial essa a forma legal que precede uma autoriza o judicial
2360844 por isso que a autoridade policial se vale da autoriza o judicial
2360845 eficaz esse tipo de instrumento no combate ao crime organizado n o estamos muito atrasados a cada dia que passa temos que adotar m todos mais eficazes porque estamos atrasados
2360846 eu investiguei o hildebrando pascoal em 1999 onde confesso que a intercepta o telef nica na investiga o n o houve porque n o havia necessidade naquela ocasi o contra aquela organiza o criminosa mas com pessoas ligadas a ela tivemos que nos valer desses instrumentos que n o eram t o modernos como hoje

2360852 i will name in everyday language the most common hindrances for you
2360853 these are the evils that block the moving of the spirit through you when the flow stops you usually fall back on your own resources and make do instead of cleaning out the obstructions child you must learn to repent often confess and overcome your besetting faults ask forgiveness frequently of others only the cleansing blood of jesus can remove the barriers of your soul
2360854 lord have mercy on my son for he is a lunatic and is very ill for he often falls into the fire and often into the water i brought him to your disciples but they could not cure him
2360855 o faithless and perverse generation how long shall i be with you how long shall i put up with you bring him here to me
2360856 because of your little faith for truly i say to you if you have faith the size of a mustard seed you will say to this mountain move from here to there and it will move and nothing will be impossible to you
2360857 now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see
2360858 therefore my dear brothers stand firm let nothing move you always give yourselves fully to the work of the lord because you know that your labor in the lord is not in vain
2360859 when she wasnt out at nightclubs she was taking acting classes
2360860 we dated for only a few months but in that period i spent a lot of time with her and her friends whose behavior intrigued and appalled me to such an extent that i ended up basing a novel on the experience
2360861 shes an idiot a fool a moron a faux guru but not mean spirited
2360862 it was amazing what he confided to her very inappropriate stuff and not provable

2360868 i hate it its obviously disappointing hes a good man with a good heart but men have weaknesses and foibles i think republicans democrats and everybody else in between have sexual urges and desires its always been a part of history its just too bad
2360869 probably not i think it just gives meat to the other side i still think a candidates sex life is not as important as what they plan to do for the country
2360870 of course its disappointing but it doesnt change the fact that his heart is in a good place

2360874 being held in the el paso county jail near colorado springs colorado awaiting a military court martial for resisting the unjust and illegal war against and occupation of iraq robin will be court martialed for desertion with intent to remain away permanently article 85 of the uniform code of military justice in early september the maximum allowable penalty for a guilty verdict on this charge is three years confinement forfeiture of pay and a dishonorably discharge from the army in order to expedite robins trial it appears that his unit command the fourth brigade combat team fourth infantry division is option to not charge robin with speech related violations of military discipline opting to try and convict robin as fast as possible
2360875 robin long did what he did because of his conscience and because he believed that the war was wrong that he was simply running away or hiding out i think most americans now realize that the war in iraq is a complete mistake
2360876 so they had a hearing late at night robin was put into jail and since that point he has been held here in colarado springs in the criminal justice center in el paso county basically just a regular old county jail with all kinds of people dangerous criminals many of them and its a difficult place to be but robins in good spirits and were now dealing with the consequences of his action in the military courts here
2360877 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
2360878 if i tell the iraqi police or the sons of iraq they will tell the wrong people and i will be killed i dont trust them if i tell the americans theyll tell no one how they found about the grenades
2360879 when the sois sons of iraq stood up we were basically hiring terrorists
2360880 why dont you ask the iraqis to pay the entire costs of that program
2360881 the u s military was supposed to be out of the employment business by now when it introduced the sons of iraq initiative last year senior commanders expected the local security personnel to be hired gradually into the ranks of the iraqi army and police but iraqs shiite dominated central government has balked at the idea of bringing so many young sunni men including many onetime militants into the countrys fledging security forces less than 20 of the roughly 103 000 sons of iraq had been given government jobs as of early june that has left u s forces responsible for employing and paying the iraqis
2360882 the national front and other onetime insurgent groups will join a bitter struggle for power between established sunni politicians of the iraqi islamic party and upstart leaders of the sahwa or awakening council a u s backed tribal alliance whose popularity has grown following its success in combating the group al qaeda in iraq entering the elections is to change the current reality in our area the domination of the sunni spectrum by the iraqi islamic party said effan al issawi the top awakening commander in falluja they are unworthy of leading the sunnis
2360883 i believe i have something okay we continue to urge the council of representatives to seek a compromise that can be adopted promptly we regret that the iraqi parliament adjourned yesterday without finishing its work on a local elections law the parliamentarians have made great strides towards finishing the closing agreement on most of the more difficult issues we recognize that the election law brought to the floor important questions regarding the status of kirkuk the status of kirkuk is indeed a sensitive issue that needs to be addressed in a serious fashion but it is an issue that cannot be solved through the legislative mechanism of the eleciton law the election law should not be held hostage to that problem
2360884 my understanding is that theyre continuing i dont have anything particular to say about the process right now we havent discussed those publicly before im not going to here as we said well provide you with details when we get through with this
2360885 i would not be prepared to provide a timeline for that
2360886 shiite militia leader muqtada al sadr stepped back into iraqs political fray friday with an offer that if genuine washington would be hard pressed to refuse set a timetable for withdrawal of u s troops from iraq and the mahdi army will begin to disband the main reason for the armed resistance is the american miltiary presence said sadr emissary salah al ubaidi who spoke to reporters in najaf friday if the american military begins to withdrawal there will be no need for these armed groups
2360887 was one of the main reasons that violence in iraq has dropped to the lowest levels in four years for both civilians and trooops
2360888 i was pleasantly surprised when i learned that libertarian party presidential candidate bob barr would be testifying he didnt disappoint he made a great opening statement about preserving constitutional liberty through checks and balances and the separation of powers but the best part of his testimony was in the second round before questioning what we are facing now is a constitutional clock and it is countind own what remains of the constitution of this great land i might ask then to introduce for the record the disappearing bill of rights this is the bill of rights that we as members of the judiciary committee know he holds up a copy of the bill of rights as adopted in 1791 he flips it over to reveal a copy of the bill of rights that is largely redacted this is what it is fast becoming you know its a sad day when a former congressman has to submit the bill of rights for the record in a congressional hearing
2360889 seemed to be really trying to make case for their won partys reelection they failed as petulant and petty as the republicans were throughout the hearing representative lamar smith of texas the ranking republican hit the nail on the head it seems that we are hosting an anger management class this hearing will not cause us to impeach the president it will only serve to impeach congresss credibility the democrats have become a sorry excuse for an opposition party i dont think any of the many potentially deserving members of the bush administration will ever be impeached for the same reason that we didnt have impeachment hearings today or even months ago the democrats are just as corrupt and complicit spineless democrats are neocon appeasers and the blood is on their hands too
2360890 well wait a second who should be apologizing whos voted for this war who voted for the patriot act who supports all these appropriations who supports the fisa bill
2360891 you like to invoke the name ralph nader but you never invoke the name ross perot who won 19 of the vote and elected bill clinton president in 1992 with 43 or less of the vote clinton got less percentage of the vote than our current president did in 2000 but you never hear about
2360892 come on we can have a better country we can change this around
2360893 well if i were president the home morgate crisis wouldnt have happened and the oil prices wouldnt be what they are
2360894 dont vote for eugene debbs youre throwing your vote away
2360895 i cant get hurt if he loves me and i dont love him
2360896 when we got there i saw him down the hole and in pain
2360897 it was really dim down there but i knew we had to hurry
2360898 so i started to scale down trying not to touch all the pipes that were in there
2360899 i do remember we were a very confident team and that essendon hadnt won a premiership in 19 years which is a long time and that by winning one in 1984 it took a lot of pressure off everybody and everybody gained a lot of confidence
2360900 i can see a similar thing happening to our boys in our club
2360901 no matter who we are playing or the score we just want to play a brand of footy and just stick to it
2360902 this is the business end of the season and you just want to be in really consistent form with your decision making and how you play

2360908 we have a heck of a lot of trailwork to do

2360913 its about america its values we are a freedom loving nation that is right now under attack
2360914 now our peacekeepers are waging a fierce battle with regular forces from the georgian army in the southern region of tskhinvali
2360915 if this is not war then i wonder what it is
2360916 we are receiving reports that a policy of ethnic cleansing was being conducted in villages in south ossetia the number of refugees is climbing the panic is growing people are trying to save their lives
2360917 the united states calls for an immediate ceasefire to the armed conflict in georgias region of south ossetia
2360918 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2360919 we repeat our message to all parties to immediately stop the violence

2360923 roos told us just play with confidence and take the game on which we are probably not doing
2360924 and have that consistent four quarter effort which is the main reason we have been losing
2360925 last week in the first quarter seeing how good we were and then in the second quarter we went back to playing safe football and we cant do that
2360926 i think more importantly its a huge game for the team to really consolidate a spot in the top four
2360927 definitely with four games left we will certainly see this weekend where were at
2360928 we dont want to just make the finals to make up the numbers
2360929 so we are really looking forward to this week and continuing on
2360930 hes out of contract this year so if he signs with essendon again id say hed be finished after that so i dont think it will happen
2360931 terus terang saja dalam hal ini saya banyak dipengaruhi oleh ucapan imam jafar ash shadiq
2360932 barangsiapa menyembah allah sebagai nama maka ia tidak menyembah apa apa barangsiapa menyembah allah sebagai nama sekaligus sebagai makna maka ia telah syirik yang benar adalah sembahlah allah sebagai makna
2360933 o hisham the proper noun allah is derived from ilah the creator requires the existence of creation to testify to his being its creator this is a noun not an adjective anyone who worships a name without worshipping what the name stands for is actually committing kufr apostasy in reality he does not worship anything at all one who worships the name and the meaning is also committing kufr for he will be worshipping two only one who worships the meaning without the name is in line with the concept of tawhid unity of god have you understood all of this o hisham
2360934 there are ninety nine attributes of allah had each attribute been the same as it describes each one of them would have been a god by itself but allah is the meaning one deducts once he becomes familiar with all these attributes they all o hisham in their collective sense are not the same as he himself bread is something you eat water is something you drink a garment is something you put on and fire is something that burns do you understand all of this o hisham fully enough so that you would promote it and fight the enemies of allah for its sake
2360935 may allah grant you thereby benefits and may he keep your feet firm thereupon o hisham

2360959 were keeping a careful watch on how the conkers are developing but theyre very small for this time of year
2360960 its a bit like having the football league with no footballs
2360961 we are the world conker championship so why not take the conkers from elsewhere in the world
2360962 we know they play a lot of conkers in france in germany and in holland and a number of these countries run their own championships there is the possibility of getting conkers from those sources

2360971 our family has been through a lot some caused by nature some caused by human weakness and some most recently caused by the desire for sensationalism and profit without any regard for the human consequences none of these has been easy but we have stood with one another through them all although john believes he should stand alone and take the consequences of his action now when the door closes behind him he has his family waiting for him john made a terrible mistake in 2006 the fact that it is a mistake that many others have made before him did not make it any easier for me to hear when he told me what he had done but he did tell me and we began a long and painful process in 2006 a process oddly made somewhat easier with my diagnosis in march of 2007 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private the pain of the long journey since 2006 was about to be renewed john has spoken in a long on camera interview i hope you watch admitting ones mistakes is a hard thing for anyone to do and i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame the toll on our family of news helicopters over our house and reporters in our driveway is yet unknown but now the truth is out and the repair work that began in 2006 will continue i ask that the public who expressed concern about the harm johns conduct has done to us think also about the real harm that the present voyeurism does and give me and my family the privacy we need at this time

2360982 so im walking into the office this morning and i stop by panera for coffee and an orange scone
2360983 to be honest i havent thought about that at all
2360984 im just playing every game on its merits and just keep playing consistent football and if that comes it comes
2360985 im not really worried about how many goals i kick as long as we kick enough
2360986 being in the middle of thousands of people surrounded by my teammates has been my best individual moment in football
2360987 kicking your 100th goal is an amazing feeling and is also a big relief because you have the crowd ready to run on when you get it and if you miss it they have to run back i was lucky to kick them with my first attempt in 2000 and 2001 which was a huge relief
2360988 there is no doubt you would prefer to kick your 100th goal in the home and away season
2360989 for me it took place in the first week of the finals in 2000 and 2001 i really wanted to get it out of the way before the preliminary final because it would have been too much of a distraction for myself and the team especially with the crowd running onto the oval
2360990 well i havent really thought about it too much it was just on my mind
2360991 now im starting to embrace it and it makes life easier
2360992 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public when a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story i used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it but being 99 honest is no longer enough
2360993 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly but that misconduct took place for a short period in 2006 it ended then i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established i only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2360994 i have given a complete interview on this matter and having done so will have nothing more to say
2360995 the tributes have been flowing thick and fast and rightly so
2360996 hes a very decorated player at our footy club and itll draw some recognition especially from the 21 blokes that are fortunate to run out on the ground with him tomorrow saturday
2360997 the guys are professional enough to know that theres a game of footy to win and theres 21 guys im sure that are going to be really keen to make it a special day for crawf
2360998 brent guerra also plays his 150th tomorrow hes been a really handy acquisition for us over the last three years together those guys sharing their milestone on the same day should hopefully mean its a pretty special day for our club
2360999 i heard him talk earlier in the week about how at the start of his career youd go out on the ground and it was more than likely you had the same opponent for the whole day
2361000 it was just survival of the fittest its still survival of the fittest in this game but just a different type of survival because its just so much more demanding for guys like he and robert harvey to have survived and evolved with the game in that period of time is quite outstanding
2361001 both those guys have probably been the pioneers for the modern game theyve taken training and professionalism to a completely new level theres a lot of guys in the competition who can thank shane crawford and robert harvey for the way that the midfield plays are handled now
2361002 weve got enormous regard for the way brisbane go about it
2361003 ninguna infracci n al reglamento antidopaje ha sido cometida por el corredor espa ol iban mayo el examen complementario por irms m todo que diferencia entre las sustancias que genera el organismo humano y las suministradas ha permitido excluir toda administraci n de testosterona
2361004 el accidente lo vi en el auto eso me basta
2361005 no hay simplemente ninguna explicaci n juiciosa de que no me haya roto ni siquiera un dedo
2361006 este es el mejor camino para volver a la realidad
2361007 la primera vez que me di cuenta que dejar a el madrid fue hace seis meses en enero cuando me dijeron que no me iban a renovar
2361008 entonces fue cuando supe que ten a que decidir mi futuro dejar el real madrid es muy dif cil pero creo que mi futuro es brillante y es algo que me apetece mucho ahora
2361009 no he tenido contacto con el presidente sobre nada el contrato se firm hace pocos meses todo el mundo sabe cuando lo firm mi ltimo partido ser el domingo
2361010 acept sumarme a la direcci n con la esperanza de poder hacer algunos cambios pero entiendo que eso no es posible
2361011 si la informaci n que tenemos es verdadera ser muy triste porque el cuadro directivo siempre apreci las contribuciones de marco

2361034 you are children who have to change the world you have come on this earth for a very great purpose and thats why you have to be brought up like that
2361035 and then the disciplining also comes in children when they understand that they are they themselves discipline so the first thing is to instill in them the sense of security and a sense of self respect i think this is the most important thing we have to do
2361036 the first sign of shri ganesha in a child is wisdom if the child is not wise if he is troublesome if he does not know how to behave then that shows that the shri ganesha is being attacked by him
2361037 bukan manusia yang harus mematuhi hukum tetapi justru hukum lah yang harus disesuaikan dengan kemanusiaan
2361038 tapi coba kita lihat cendekiawan seperti anda kalau anda memiliki pilihan kekayaan atau kebijaksanaan mana yang akan dipilih
2361039 memalukan anda adalah cendekiawan yang diakui masyarakat dan anda memilih kekayaan daripada kebijaksanaan

2361044 weve lined the pockets of a lot of the newsagencies and media tycoons in general because its one of the few times ive been able to look through the paper and see eight to 10 pages dedicated to two or three players i dont think the end of world war ii copped as much
2361045 its been a difficult week but i reckon the boys have handled it pretty well
2361046 i thought chief executive gary pert and football manager geoff walsh were terrific on tuesday and lets all go forward
2361047 its one of those weeks it happens in football its only how big its been because of the press lets not kid ourselves
2361048 its only how big it is outside the club inside it has been one that we would prefer behind us which it is and we move forward theyve the players done very well ive been delighted with the way theyve been able to handle it
2361049 we dont want to lose sight of what were here for were here to play football which we are doing tomorrow evening and the playing group got themselves very much focused on that earlier in the week

2361053 with cloud computer looming on the horizon it is important for us all to think of the privacy threats there as well
2361054 the tool resides with someone else and the data is stored somewhere else generally that is a bad idea
2361055 when information is in the public domain it is game over
2361056 information on your computer may get protection under the law but on someone elses it gets less protection
2361057 the information we are all giving to online companies is massive and dangerous and its going to get worse before it gets better
2361058 giving them our data is a clear and present risk
2361059 how hard would it be to target someone as a political activist or a person with aids
2361060 now that facebook despite trying hard has not been successful in the german market the company seeks to obstruct studivz through court action
2361061 the idea is to take a more sophisticated approach by not pandering to the audience
2361062 were not trying to reach everybody who could possibly be interested we will make it for fans of this type of music
2361063 music programming was never a big driver for vh1 it was about relationships cool content and doing a lot for brand
2361064 were looking at ratings as a longer term goal its more about the vibe and branding

2361108 tidak ada perbedaan antara salafiyah dan wahabiyah kedua istilah itu ibarat dua sisi pada sekeping mata uang mereka kaum salafi dan wahabi satu dari sisi keyakinan dan pemikiran sewaktu di jazirah arab mereka lebih dikenal dengan al wahhabiyah al hambaliyah namun sewaktu diekspor keluar saudi mereka mengatasnamakan dirinya sebagai salafy
2361109 maka kelompok salafi adalah kelompok yang mengikuti ibnu taimiyah dan mengikuti ulama mazhab hambali mereka semua telah menjadikan ibnu taimiyah sebagai imam tempat rujukan marja dan ketua ia ibnu taimiyah tergolong ulama mazhab hambali sewaktu mazhab ini berada di luar jazirah arab maka tidak disebut dengan wahabi karena sebutan itu terkesan celaan
2361110 pada hakekatnya wahabiyah terlahir dari salafiyah muhammad bin abdul wahab adalah seorang yang menyeru untuk mengikuti ajaran ibnu taimiyah dan para pendahulunya dari mazhab hambali yang mereka kemudian mengaku sebagai kelompok salafiyah
2361111 al wahabiyah atau as salafiyah adalah pengikut mazhab hambali walaupun dari beberapa hal pendapat mereka tidak sesuai lagi dan bahkan bertentangan dengan pendapat mazhab hambali sendiri mereka sesuai dengan mazhab hambali dari sisi keyakinan tentang at tasybih menyamakan allah dengan makhluk nya at tajsim allah berbentuk mirip manusia dan an nashb yaitu membenci keluarga rasul saw ahlul bait dan tiada menghormati mereka
2361112 kita telah meriwayatkan hadis sebagaimana adanya dan hal sebagaimana adanya itu pula yang kita yakini
2361113 kita meyakini semua hadis hadis tersebut kita membenarkan semua hadis tadi tanpa perlu terhadap proses pentakwilan
2361114 berbagai individu dari salaf telah menetapkan sifat azali tuhan semisal sifat ilmu kemampuan qudrat dan mereka tidak membedakan antara sifat dzati dan fili sebagaimana mereka juga telah menetapkan sifat khabariyah buat tuhan seperti dua tangan dan wajah tuhan mereka tidak bersedia mentakwilnya dan mengatakan itu semua adalah sifat sifat yang terdapat dalam teks teks agama semua itu kita sebut sebagai sifat khabariyah
2361115 kelompok salafi kontemporer meyakini lebih dari para kelompok salaf itu sendiri mereka menyatakan sifat sifat khabari bukan hanya tidak boleh ditakwil namun harus dimaknai secara zahir oleh karenanya dari sisi ini mereka telah terjerumus kedalam murni keyakinan tasybih tentu permasalahan semacam ini bertentangan dengan apa yang diyakini oleh para salaf itu sendiri
2361116 dikatakan bahwa penyebab utama untuk memegang erat metode itu yang sangat nampak pada pribadi ahmad bin hambal adalah dikarenakan pada zamannya banyak sekali dijumpai fitnah fitnah pertikaian dan perdebatan teologis dari sisi lain berbagai pemikiran aneh keyakinan keyakinan yang bermacam macam dan beraneka ragam budaya mulai bermunculan bagaimana mungkin semua itu bisa muncul di khasanah kelimuan islam oleh karenanya untuk menyelamatkan keyakinan keyakinan islam maka ia menggunakan metode kembali kepemikiran salaf
2361117 merubah dan menghapus hadis hadis merupakan kebiasaan buruk kelompok wahabi sebagai contoh nukman al alusi telah merubah tafsir yang ditulis oleh ayahnya syeikh mahmud al alusi yang berjudul ruh semua pembahasan yang membahayakan kelompok wahabi telah dihapus jika tidak ada perubahan niscaya tafsir beliau menjadi contoh buat kitab kitab tafsir lainnya contoh lain dalam kitab al mughni karya ibnu qodamah al hambali pembahasan tentang istighotsah telah dihapus karena hal itu mereka anggap sebagai bagian dari perbuatan syirik setelah melakukan perubahan tersebut baru mereka mencetaknya kembali kitab syarah shohih muslim pun telah dirubah dengan membuang hadis hadis yang berkaitan dengan sifat sifat allah kemudian baru mereka mencetaknya kembali
2361118 siapakah diantara kalian yang mau menjadi wazir dan membantuku dalam perkara ini risalah maka akan menjadi saudaraku kadza wa kadza

2361120 mereka menggunakan ayat ayat yang diturunkan bagi orang orang kafir lantas mereka terapkan untuk menyerang orang orang beriman
2361121 mereka membunuh pemeluk islam sedang para penyembah berhala mereka biarkan
2361122 beberapa orang akan muncul dari belahan bumi sebelah timur mereka membaca al quran tetapi bacaan tadi tidak melebihi batas temggorokan mereka telah keluar dari agama islam sebagaimana terkeluarnya lepas anak panah dari busurnya tanda tanda mereka suka mencukur habis rambut kepala

2361126 the jamie leigh jones halliburton rape case was horrific but what happened to pfc lavena johnson in iraq in 2005 was many orders of magnitudes worse the parents of the young missouri woman were told that she died of self inflicted gunshot wounds and her death was ruled a suicide but her physician father became suspicious after looking at injuries to the body after two years of requesting documents one set of papers provided by the army included a xerox copy of a cd wondering why the xerox copy was in the documents dr johnson requested the cd itself with help from his local congressional representative the us army finally complied when dr johnson viewed the cd he was shocked to see photographs taken by army investigators of his daughters body as it lay where her body had been found as well as other photographs of her disrobed body taken during the investigation the photographs revealed that lavena a small woman barely 5 feet tall and weighing less than 100 pounds had been struck in the face with a blunt instrument perhaps a weapon stock her nose was broken and her teeth knocked backwards one elbow was distended the back of her clothes had debris on them indicating she had been dragged from one location to another the photographs of her disrobed body showed bruises scratch marks and teeth imprints on the upper part of her body the right side of her back as well as her right hand had been burned apparently from a flammable liquid poured on her and then lighted the photographs of her genital area revealed massive bruising and lacerations a corrosive liquid had been poured into her genital area probably to destroy dna evidence of sexual assault despite the bruises scratches teeth imprints and burns on her body lavena was found completely dressed in the burning tent there was a blood trail from outside a contractors tent to inside the tent she apparently had been dressed after the attack and her attacker placed her body into the tent and set it on fire
2361127 higher education act reauthorized with new loan forgiveness included last week congress gave final approval to legislation to reauthorize the higher education act the bill s 1642 is the first reauthorization of higher education since 1998 most significantly for child welfare it includes a new program to allow loan forgiveness for social workers who work for public or private child welfare agencies the provision must be funded now but its inclusion in the law is the first significant step in child welfare workforce development in many years the provision actually addresses several areas of workforce need including certain teaching specialties head start and child care teachers and social workers in child welfare once enacted it would allow up to 2 000 in loan forgiveness for each year a social worker remains with an agency to a maximum of five years and 10 000 several more steps are necessary before the program is in effect including regulations and appropriating funds cwla will continue to monitor its development look for additional information in coming weeks
2361128 senate finance committee postpones adoption of child welfare bill the scheduled senate finance committee action on a major child welfare financing bill was abruptly postponed august 1 when senators agreed to wrap up their summer session thursday night july 31 although they remained in formal session last friday there were no votes and few members around the senate finance committee was set to adopt s 3038 the improved adoption incentives and relative guardianship support act of 2008 at the mark up session the legislation which represents the work of chief sponsors senators max baucus d mt and charles grassley r ia takes the original grassley bill introduced last may and adds several provisions similar to the house companion bill the fostering connections to success act h r 6307 sponsored by representatives jim mcdermott d wa and jerry weller r il both bills include significant improvements in child welfare they are crafted with bipartisan support and are both paid for each of the bills would reauthorize the adoption incentives program provide for title iv e funding of kinship placements and require states to have agreements in place that will allow foster children to remain in school or if that is not possible get immediate enrollment in a new school the baucus grassley bill includes a phased in delink for adoption assistance by 2011 all special needs adoptions would be eligible for federal support currently eligibility is linked to the now defunct afdc cash assistance program eligibility as it existed 12 years ago the phase in covers older children in special needs adoption in the first years the mcdermott weller bill does not include an adoption delink the baucus grassley bill would allow states to extend foster care to age 21 at state option but this provision would not take effect until fiscal year 2011 october 1 2010 the mcdermott weller bill would allow states the option in the first year the baucus grassley bill would allow tribal governments to apply for direct access to federal foster care adoption and kinship funding but the requirements are more stringent than the provisions in the mcdermott weller bill the baucus grassley bill includes a few other provisions not in the house bill such as creation of a new resource center for tribes some limited funding for state tribal collaborations a kinship incentive program and a 10 state demonstration grant allowing states to suspend foster care licensing requirements in regard to bedrooms bathrooms and square footage for kinship families the demonstrations would last for three years with the u s department of health and human services required to report back within one year on the effect of state efforts two items not included in the senate bill but in the mcdermott weller bill are the expansion of title iv e training to private agencies a cwla legislative agenda item and an important workforce improvement strategy and health planning requirements for children in care the senate finance committee could take up the bill on september 10 when it returns for the fall session depending on the pace of senate action the goal would be to negotiate the differences in language and programs between the house and senate versions and come up with a final bill that could pass through the politically charged atmosphere in september if congress can do it this would be a significant accomplishment not just for congress and cwla members but for thousands of children and families
2361129 the new law is a good start for the changes we need to bolster the security of the child protection system
2361130 the measures i signed into law today will protect both social services staff and the families particularly the children they serve
2361131 one of the best aspects of this law is that social services workers will see a difference almost immediately
2361132 their office security will be tightened and with faster access to criminal records of families being served they will know sooner when something is amiss
2361133 passage of the boni bill is just the beginning of a safety net for our social workers and we plan to do more in the near future
2361134 from the tragedy of ms fredericks death has emerged much needed support for improving the safety of our social services staff as well as an awareness of the valuable work they perform each and every day
2361135 a lot of kids would like to start their own business of one kind or another but they dont know how most schools dont teach it
2361136 i got a first hand knowledge of writing a business plan and it opened me up to the idea that it wasnt necessarily a college get a job market
2361137 there might be opportunities outside of just getting to college and working for somebody ive always wanted to be able to work for myself and be my own boss but i wasnt sure exactly how i could do that
2361138 this class was a good introduction for me to realize that its not so complicated in some respects to start your own business
2361139 the old thinking figured kids were too young to learn about entrepreneurship the new thinking sees entrepreneurship as a healthy remedy for classroom boredom restless energies and high dropout rates
2361140 i think its very important to start as young as possible
2361141 we start at the age of 11 and we are thinking about even moving down to the age of seven the sooner a young person starts to train their mind to think entrepreneurially to look for business opportunities to think about budgeting and planning to think about marketing and sales and so that its incorporated into ones very intellectual being i think its very very positive
2361142 entrepreneurship projects are first and foremost experiential education they fill a vacuum that many young people feel that they need
2361143 and theyre voting with their feet theyre leaving school in droves if you look at the dropout rate and the principal reason for the dropout rate according to research we and others have done is that kids just dont like the regimentation of school and theyre crying out for experiential learning opportunities
2361144 what we are trying to do with youth entrepreneurship is bridge the gap teach students life long skills understanding the business concepts and economic processes so that they can create as opposed to be part of a work force
2361145 so were not really training students to become consumers or employees were training them to be employers and economic creators
2361146 the rationale behind having young people begin to develop those experiences is the high motivation we see as a result of being involved in those programs
2361147 to find out that you have opportunities is a whole new message to so many young people and to actually experience the process for doing it so that you feel empowered to go out there and do it sometime in your life
2361148 were realizing that miami public schools is the centerpiece of the economy for this entire region
2361149 and to that extent entrepreneurship has to be a part of the curriculum we really do believe that how students make sense out of their world how they actualize and realize their own dreams and goals by being participants in that world at an early age all have a lot to do with their ability to be very successful later in life
2361150 even if these ambitious young entrepreneurs dont launch their own company right away they walk away with skills values and experiences that can help them in other ways for the rest of their lives

2361186 shes lucky she has a second song to prove herself
2361187 when an artist signs on to the store they allocate a certain portion of the revenue generated by their songs to go back to their fans this money is then distributed according to how early each user purchased a song the earlier you buy the more you make for example the band my first earthquake has decided to pay out 30 of its revenues to its fans the earliest adopters say the first dozen people to buy the song will break even after the song has been purchased by around 25 other people fans buying the song later on will still earn credit but it will be earned at a much slower rate the site will tell you how quickly youll be earning credit before you buy a song

2361194 well the very first time her mother met me her green eyed girl had been a mother to be for two weeks i was out of a job and she was in school and life was fast and the world was cruel we were young and wild we decided not to have the child so we did what we did and we tried to forget and we swore up and down there would be no regrets
2361195 well you do what you do and you pay for your sins but theres no such thing as what might have been thats a waste of time drive you out of your mind
2361196 young girl wakes up in the middle of the night makes her way to the kicthen carrying a brand new life inside woke her up kickin she decided the day she walked away from that clinic her baby might not have a daddy but at least hell be livin thats love
2361197 i was young so was she life didnt stay a mystery for very long we could do no wrong then she called said she was late so we took a little drive upstate yeah just took care of it but now im looking back on some of my decisions now that its much too late to change how a father could have held his son if i could undo whats been done but i guess everyone is living with water and bridges
2361198 she took the test and failed it we blamed each other for a while all our big plans had no little ones in it we just werent ready for a child so we set the alarm for 7 theres a place right down the street it was a night like any other night but when i fell asleep
2361199 i saw his face he had my eyes i swear he had your smile chasin a butterfly he laughed and skipped and caught it softly placed it in my hands he said please dont kill the butterfly
2361200 you cant go wrong if you play a little bit of that creedence song
2361201 as previously addressed their anger seemed to override any ability to testify credibly or to be reasonable
2361202 the public has no notion of the extent of the pain that my daughter my family and i have suffered privately over the last four years
2361203 will ultimately result in increasing our dependence on foreign oil and hinder investment in domestic exploration
2361204 if i am president i will immediately direct the full resources of the federal government and the full energy of the private sector to a single overarching goal in 10 years we will eliminate the need for oil from the entire middle east and venezuela
2361205 the development of a battery package that has the size capacity cost and power to leapfrog the commercially available plug in hybrids or electric cars
2361206 we should explore nuclear power as part of the energy mix
2361207 simplify the tax code reward activity in the u s and make us more competitive with other countries
2361208 people will get their money and get it back in the immediate future
2361209 our leading position in supporting the market and providing liquidity is clear and now were the first firm to give all clients private corporate and institutional the opportunity to be made whole
2361210 there is a view that institutional clients ought to be sophisticated investors who knew what they were buying
2361211 i cant see why ubs would want to settle with institutional investors now that citigroup and merrill lynch have set the precedent
2361212 it would certainly be a concern as we did not expect them to repurchase all of those auction rate securities however it will also mean that the problem will be sorted out and the uncertainty wont drag on
2361213 consistently working with regulators toward a comprehensive solution for all auction rate securities people shares fell 1
2361214 security positions that have been held for less than 12 months
2361215 berkshire has the ability and intent to hold these securities until fair value recovers
2361216 black lung black lung oh youre just biding your time soon all of this sufferin ill leave behind but i cant help but wonder what god had in mind to send such a devil to claim this old mine he went to th boss man but he closed the door well it seems youre not wanted when youre sick and youre poor you aint even covered in their medical plan and your life depends on the favors of man
2361217 it didnt take long for his drinkin ways to start showing up on mommas face mightve been blood but they never saw it just a little mud on the living room carpet after what he did no there aint no wonder cant remember how long i held him under
2361218 despite lower home prices relatively low interest rates and a large choice of available homes potential homebuyers remain reluctant due to eroding consumer confidence amid concerns about employment growth higher energy costs and the overall economy
2361219 there can be no assurance that impairment charges will not be required in the future and any such amounts may be material
2361220 i want to reiterate on his behalf that the united states supports georgias territorial integrity we urge all parties georgians south ossetians and russians to de escalate the tension and avoid conflict
2361221 its gotta be really exciting thinking about marching in that stadium and representing our country
2361222 we appreciate all the hard work youve put in to get to this spot
2361223 we want you to win as many golds as you possibly can
2361224 somebody was laying on my legs a lady next to me she had her arm crushed up the lady who was on my left a man was on top of her
2361225 i think im the luckiest one out of most people
2361226 if there is a loss of pressure or the tire becomes delaminated its much more difficult to control the vehicle
2361227 we have requested law enforcement agencies to be alert for any buses being operated by angel tours or iguala busmex since they are not authorized to operate legally
2361228 if found on the road we want law enforcement to immediately stop and place the vehicles out of service
2361229 this happened like katrina like challenger what we can do is pray
2361230 god will comfort them tell people to keep trusting in god do not blame anybody do not ask why now we just help each other to get through this
2361231 we cannot think of a better day to celebrate the beginning of a happy new family and the happiest moment for our country these two things should go hand in hand
2361232 the charges against the mayor are very serious and the state of affairs is clearly hurting the business of our community
2361233 i sincerely hope that the mayors legal issues are dealt with quickly so these ongoing sagas no longer interfere with the important work before the leaders in detroit wayne county and the state
2361234 lets take it step by step i want my day in court
2361235 were not looking at numbers were trying to keep our kids out of jail
2361236 do we continue responding quickly to 911 calls for burglaries in progress
2361237 but we dont just want to change something we want to make it better
2361238 sgt gary gross often gets cards and letters asking him to attend a graduation and he gets stopped in the store all the time
2361239 the whole offseason i was up here for almost the entire year working out and working hard
2361240 i will continue to do the things im supposed to do to become a better linebacker and hopefully it will pay off
2361241 one of our hardest working kids i think he has improved every year
2361242 i was nervous my first game it is the nfl not college anymore in college you have a little bit more fun and time on your hands and here its work work work you got to do your job and know what youre supposed to do and pay attention to detail
2361243 hes a great player one of the best in the last couple decades hes got just about every record you could have at the position he plays
2361244 his resume speaks for itself its always a big challenge playing the jets even more so now
2361245 theyve got a lot of talent im sure well have our hands full every time we face them but right now thats not at the forefront of our concerns we have a lot of things before we even come to that and thats what well focus on but hes a great player theres no question about that
2361246 despite the economy our business achieved growth during the quarter in the number of concerts ticket sales and the per fan revenue spend
2361247 this year has been a strong concert season and it looks like 2009 is going to shape up to be another good season
2361248 theres no question that fannie and freddie are going to buy or guarantee a plus credit and that means anything a minus and below is going to go to the federal housing administration and the veterans administration
2361249 its safe to say that the fha wont be getting the cream of the crop and taxpayers will be on the hook
2361250 when you add in the fact that these are borrowers less than perfect credit which will lead to a rise in defaults we just dont know how big and how bad with this huge influx of business in this kind of environment
2361251 just a little softer than expectations but we like to look at these on a four quarter basis it for that it was darn good
2361252 productivity is calculated by dividing output by the aggregate of hours worked in a specific period as such if employers are quick to lay off workers when activity slows productivity can still look solid even though the economy is sputtering
2361253 while these numbers are good theyre also fairly typical for the early stages of a recession
2361254 we are concerned about the sustainability of margins given the weak admissions growth especially as we do not believe the company can continue to see bad debt improvement given the overall macroenvironment
2361255 but theres something john mccains not telling you it was mccain who used his influence in the senate to help foreign owned dhl buy a u s company and gain control over the jobs that are now on the chopping block in ohio
2361256 and thats not all mccains campaign manager was the top lobbyist for the dhl deal helped push it through his firm was paid 185 000 to lobby mccain and other senators
2361257 the most important development of the entire campaign this week
2361258 he was there a month ago in this community and was asked a question about this dhl issue and did not say one word about his role in this or the role of his campaign manager that is the furthest thing from straight talk that we can imagine
2361259 john mccain can become an emblem for people about what is wrong with washington he released an ad this week about how washington is broken and how he will strive to fix it he didnt mention that he has been enmeshed in a broken washington culture for 26 years or that his campaign is run by the most powerful now former lobbyist in washington
2361260 shame shame on barack obama for making us and putting us in this sort of position to look like the sad little wilmington people
2361261 he should be helping us not harming us he makes us look foolish its not right
2361262 how dare you exploit for political gain the fact that i cost these workers their jobs
2361263 while rbs does face the threat of further write downs and or a u k recession our view is that the company has taken a conservative stance on write downs and has the benefit of diversification away from the u k
2361264 the study shows how dopamine shapes the two main circuits of the brain that control how we choose to act and what happens in these disease states
2361265 dopamine released by drugs leads to abnormal strengthening of the cortical synapses driving the striatal go circuits while weakening synapses at opposing stop circuits as a result when events associated with drug taking where you took the drug what you were feeling occur there is an uncontrollable drive to go and seek drugs
2361266 all of our actions in a healthy brain are balanced by the urge to do something and the urge to stop
2361267 our work suggests that it is not just the strengthening of the brain circuits helping select actions that is critical to dopamines effects it is the weakening of the connections that enable us to stop as well
2361268 the study illuminates why parkinsons patients have trouble performing everyday tasks like reaching across a table to pick up a glass of water when they are thirsty
2361269 our study suggests that the inability to move in parkinsons disease is not a passive process like a car running out of gas
2361270 rather the car doesnt move because your foot is jammed down on the brake dopamine normally helps you adjust the pressure on the brake and gas pedals it helps you learn that when you see a red light at an intersection you brake and when the green light comes on you take your foot off the brake and depress the gas pedal to go parkinsons disease patients who have lost the neurons that release dopamine have their foot perpetually stuck on the brake
2361271 you should they will rule the world in 50 years and it was the united states who built them up as a superpower
2361272 in colombia we can make a party out of anything
2361273 if the soccer team wins we go out and party and get drunk if the soccer team loses we go out and party and get drunk
2361274 ninety percent of the colombians who come think were going to be fluent in chinese in four months and millionaires in five
2361275 i have been teaching for 15 years and never before had i encountered so much respect and generosity
2361276 for him it was so stupid i was asking for a public phone when he had one
2361277 i can relate because in my city were also very proud of where we are and we also want people to feel comfortable
2361278 its in the little things or things as big as the earthquake
2361279 i got the chills when i saw people in beijing who didnt even have family there in sichuan and the way they really felt the tragedy
2361280 are conscious of our problems but adopt a very happy attitude towards life
2361281 sometimes it is the little things that make life interesting
2361282 many of the kids had never seen a foreigner before and wanted to take pictures i felt like soccer star david beckham
2361283 i dont want to come back one day and see china is just the same as every other place in the world
2361284 but definitely from now on i will be connected to china
2361285 if you took this class at the beginning of your trip and then used your spanish you would have learned so much
2361286 youre so easy to teach i tell you and you get it
2361287 we were always dangerous going forward but we had two lapses of concentration and they scored two fantastic goals
2361288 ajax were sharp and incisive and they took advantage of every mistake we made in the first half we were not right tactically we were not well positioned i am not too concerned though we played against a good attack as long as we score more than the opposition i am ok
2361289 its true to say that i have had a meeting with wenger and we had a very positive discussion
2361290 a size tag is more than a number it relates to how people see themselves
2361291 i was told that the letter was given to him by mr bainimarama before the government team left for for the olympic games and the letter states that he has until august 22 to clear himself from public office and that will be in the next two weeks this means he wont attend the next cabinet meeting on august 22 and i challenge mahen to tell the people that his job is on the line
2361292 if you study to remember you will forget but if you study to understand you will remember
2361293 we have not been able to bring in barry but it is not a question of money i dont know what it is
2361294 we need to improve if we can and i think we need another player because clearly we have problems on the left i have sold john arne riise harry kewell has gone fabio aurelio is injured and sebasti n leto didnt get a work permit so we need another left sided player i cannot say now who that will be but barry can fill that position and play in others too the rules will say we need four english and four associated players and barry is english who can play in three different positions but i cannot say any more all i can say is i will try my best but i dont know too much why we havent signed barry
2361295 at the end of last season i was promised that if there was a good offer i could leave
2361296 this offer exists it comes from everton who want to buy me for more than eight million euros i want to leave rennes everton are offering me 1 5m euros a year rennes could never offer me that much everton are a very established club in the premier league managed by david moyes a coach who puts trust in youngsters i have spoken to him on the phone he wanted to invite me to visit the club i hadnt the time to do it
2361297 collaborative academic effort where medical device security researchers have figured out how to turn off someones pacemaker via remote control
2361298 i dont expect alex to be happy if he loses ever
2361299 i saw him after that game and he swore at me but he said well done but if you beat united then youd better bloody win it
2361300 i loved going to old trafford as a player or a coach and something inside me always wanted to beat them i hope they give us a good game work us hard pass the ball and make us run because we have a tough game the week after against chelsea in the league
2361301 i like to see the players enjoying themselves and celebrating wins it gives you a kick watching them celebrate winning trophies i like coaching and being with players at the end of last season i didnt want to explain anything i just wanted to get away there was nothing sinister to it i just wanted to enjoy it on my own now we have to win again
2361302 that doesnt come into my psyche or the way i work
2361303 if you look at rangers for example they have signed 3m players from the championship
2361304 that is a bit of a gamble if i wanted a better striker than jan vennegoor of hesselink it could cost me 20m so i cant do that
2361305 if you do want to push the boat out the players you want would rather go to england italy spain or russia there is a clamber for top players but the top players are not clambering to come here
2361306 we have had no offer for carlos we do not want one are not seeking one and we dont need to sell the player or any player at this stage
2361307 we are finding a difficulty in getting a level of player that we want to bring in but there is money there for us
2361308 cristiano will now settle down and enjoy his career here he has four years left on his contract and hopefully at some point we would like to extend it thats where we are
2361309 it was an important issue to keep him here there are very few players who have left me against my will and it is unusual for anybody to want to leave united
2361310 i think thats finished now when we had the meeting in portugal last month the lad quickly agreed with me hell be a great player next season because hes still improving hell be absolutely fantastic for us
2361311 the important thing is that we have ended all the stuff about real madrid and as he gets older he will appreciate being here more that happens with players the longer they stay here and they dont want to leave if you look at rio ferdinand he joined us as a young man from leeds but he has now become a real manchester united person who loves the club they come north to a colder wetter climate but they come to a real football city which not many cities can say
2361312 real know they are dealing with a different animal now
2361313 we are looking at three or four options in the striking department which we hope will come to a happy conclusion i hope something will happen before the start of the season
2361314 quieren criminalizar y dejar sin voz a la izquierda abertzale

2361319 el en simo intento de criminalizar a la izquierda independentista y dejarla sin voz sin actividad y sin representantes legales
2361320 detr s de estas decisiones y de estos juicios pol ticos hay evidentes impulsos pol ticos en su momento del pp y ahora del psoe el objetivo del gal jur dico del psoe es claro impedir a euskal herria que lleve a cabo el cambio en la direcci n de un marco democr tico y la independencia

2361328 if you plug into any wired network out there you can basically capture what is happening on that network
2361329 in most corporate networks all you have to find is an open port to plug into
2361330 me and my partner cleared the house and thats all we did he said
2361331 we are asking people to please purchase their firewood locally if we are able to slow down the spread of the ash borer it gives us time to develop better control methods
2361332 the best thing to do is buy firewood locally and use it all up on your camping trip
2361333 war is the work of man war is destruction of human life war is death to remember the past is to commit oneself to the future to remember hiroshima is to abhor nuclear war to remember hiroshima is to commit oneself to peace
2361334 the quaternary period of geologic time extends from the end of the tertiary period to the present
2361335 of the 29 parking tickets 23 were issued to the food cart within 12 months
2361336 the other six were issued to the vendors truck in the 400 block of north frances in an area where the vendor vends vendors need to obey the posted parking requirements of the city
2361337 according to dot records okafos wisconsin drivers license has been revoked since approximately early 2004 would have been revoked on the date of the police altercation may 25 and during all time of the parking tickets therefore it appears okafo has been driving to and from the vending site with a revoked drivers license
2361338 the set up here is lousy its not enjoyable to play they have taken an ok golf course and turned it into a lot of crap thats my opinion and im sticking to it
2361339 its a strange year when the us open traditionally the toughest of the majors is the most fun of the four
2361340 none of this makes any sense at all i mean the pga of america spend millions of dollars on advertisements then they go and make the game look ridiculous the whole thing is nothing but a struggle for all concerned
2361341 i think the hole im at 16 is the most difficult its the courses signature hole
2361342 this week the pga had a guy clipping the last blades of grass near the pond on 16
2361343 they fluff it up and comb it away from the hole
2361344 i think there should be some tough holes but i dont think it should be i hit a perfect shot and made double bogey
2361345 youve got long rough on every hole is the frustrating part when its completely unfair on some holes no a major shouldnt be like that
2361346 you are just trying not to bleed to death out there
2361347 its like the pga has sliced your throat on the first tee and you have to try and make it round to the 18th without dying
2361348 it is pretty frustrating when you stand on a par 3 with a 5 iron and are aiming for a bunker because you know thats the only way you can make par thats pretty sad i am very disappointed we are having to do that on such a great golf course
2361349 the difference is oakland hills is hard its one of the most recent classic courses thats been set up for todays modern player and not just todays equipment
2361350 man i really thought i had it all figured out then now
2361351 your little ipods loaded down with hoobastank dont be a tape player hater girl were groovin to hank
2361352 its a shame we aint lovers we coulda been somethin so big and great just kissin for hours underneath that sweet magnolia beggin for answers tryin to make a stand
2361353 im just a backwoods barbie too much makeup too much hair dont be fooled by thinkin that the goods are not all there dont let these false eyelashes lead you to believe that im as shallow as i look cause i run true and deep
2361354 so i made up my mind girl if its your time to go they can dig two graves just carve one stone cause without you here i wont last long your loves the blood running through these veins so if he calls you home they can dig two graves
2361355 baby i still love you dont mean nothin when theres whiskey on your breath thats the only love i get so if youre callin i bet youre in a bar listenin to a cheatin song glass of johnny walker red with no one to take you home theyre probably closing down saying no more alcohol
2361356 yep just cleaning the fridge i feel the need to purge i found red curry paste how long is this stuff good this may have been used last when i cooked for lets have one and a half nights of lousy sex before i move to south america jacob last year yes im asparagus it shouldnt have really really shouldnt have
2361357 i think theres a code in the book of women that you arent allowed to keep food for men youve cooked for and slept with
2361358 its just food and the use by date is only oh okay ill throw it out
2361359 when tottenham made their offer i was sceptical at first
2361360 but after ramos called me personally and told me that they were selling robbie keane and that he wanted me in his side the situation changed when a coach shows an interest in you especially such a renowned and strong coach then that is already half of the success of any move i also like the way tottenham play so i agreed in principle to join
2361361 its a real shame that our men and women have been prevented from enjoying a friendly game which its sole purpose was to raise money for ex players and staff members who have financial or health difficulties
2361362 the players know they will be there to be shot at and it has to be a measure of their character and their confidence and their belief and their attitude
2361363 they cant think they can play the beautiful game and soar straight back up to the premier league they have to get through the battles thats what comes with being one of the favourites but they should take it as a compliment they should get confidence from that thats why i am trying to build the team with players that can make a difference but also players with character and a bit of steel because we will need that
2361364 to be the captain of birmingham and take them back into the premier league would mean so much to me i grew up 10 minutes from the ground and i know what it means to birmingham fans it would be the sweetest moment of my career i want to get promoted and win medals and i want to stabilise the club in the premier league my family and friends are all blues fans and i want to make them all proud
2361365 we have a lot of players with premier league experience it is good that we have that and that should be a big help to us but its about application and not doing anything different just because they are in a different division theyve just got to play at the level that they are capable of
2361366 its true to say that i have had a meeting with wenger and we had a very positive discussion
2361367 al bangura returned home early from the recent tour of austria for disciplinary reasons these have since been dealt with internally
2361368 al bangura remains an important part of the watford squad
2361369 leicester were a big club but right now were as good as our standing
2361370 you dont go for caviar and champagne in the boardroom in league one but there is nothing wrong with fish and chips
2361371 im a very normal guy i didnt start with a silver spoon whether that was business or football i have respect for league one clubs and look forward to meeting them the premier league is the most powerful league in the world but the premier league would be nowhere if you didnt have smaller clubs so there is nothing wrong with being there and earning your way up we have to show we are the team who we think we are
2361372 if it did happen it would be a horrible situation
2361373 im always on the edge doing this im going to be the greatest chairman in the world like at portsmouth where fans cheered my name until the last minute or i will be a loser and i know im not a loser after relegation people said why do you need it but im not a guy who leaves people in trouble if i was part of it i want to be there to correct it also 11 000 season ticket holders feel the same way theyre not running away from this club
2361374 but if you look back he brought in too many players
2361375 i have never ever told any one of my managers and ive had a lot of them during my time in england france belgium and america i want you to take this player
2361376 i might tell him this agent called me about this player what do you think about him
2361377 if youre asking what is my most disappointing moment it was that one because i thought i was a good honest chairman when i was at portsmouth i have never in my life been involved in any wrongdoing
2361378 when you are part of high profile businesses worldwide its certainly hard to explain to my associates that i have nothing to do with this here i think im extremely unlucky i got mentioned they said were after an agent who was giving money to the player what has that got to do with the club the contract was given to the fa and we sent the money to the agent what he is going to do with the money is not our business
2361379 in 12 months there will be light at the end of the tunnel
2361380 and this time the light will not be a train coming
2361381 hrmm that ponzi scheme thing they have going on over there seems to be working pretty well how can i do that for my campaign and not break the law
2361382 creo que tenemos un debate importante sobre el modo en el que mantendr amos el pa s en seguridad
2361383 hab a razones para tener dudas sobre la escalada el propio presidente tuvo todas esas duras dudas sus asesores tuvieron esas duras dudas
2361384 habr as dicho oh vamos s lo son buenas intenciones
2361385 creo que los iraqu es reconocen que todav a hay cosas que necesitan que haga la coalici n
2361386 pero el simple hecho de que tengamos estas discusiones con los iraqu es sobre la transferencia de responsabilidades supone un d a feliz para eeuu
2361387 no estoy interesada en conseguir otro trabajo en el gobierno con nadie
2361388 no es verdad la impresi n que tiene la poblaci n de que los delincuentes no van a prisi n

2361390 it was kind of surprising because i havent really played it as my position for the last eight years
2361391 im just trying to learn every day literally coach is always stressing the more you can do the better so im going to work on special teams keep helping out on offense and defense and go from there
2361392 everybody was kind of surprised but they knew i had played offense in high school so they knew i could potentially do it i know my dad was pretty excited he was happy that i was getting an opportunity to do something different he was happy that they thought i was capable of doing something like that

2361394 the comets are one of the original teams and have been one of the most successful
2361395 they are really a part of that city now and we want to see them remain there
2361396 the comets have a very loyal fan base there and they are a team that has had consistency with fans over the years
2361397 hilton has helped drive a lot of business into the team and whoever takes over it will have a lot to work with that is already in place coach thompson has done a great job and the front office is doing well as well

2361415 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry
2361416 if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2361417 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2361418 the money was purely and simply to get them out of north carolina and to get them into a stable place
2361419 they were unable to afford a second home it was to give them the ability to live somewhere where they wouldnt be harassed
2361420 i decided independently to help two friends and former colleagues rebuild their lives when harassment by supermarket tabloids made it impossible for them to conduct a normal life
2361421 john edwards was not aware that assistance was provided to anyone involved in this matter i did it of my own voilition sic and without the knowledge instruction or suggestion of john edwards or anyone else the assistance was offered and accepted without condition
2361422 the bishop of durham and 18 other signatories have also sent the following letter to the times
2361423 we find it very frustrating knowing others families in identical situations have had their bilateral operations
2361424 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2361425 we deplore the russian military action in georgia which is a violation of georgian sovereignty and territorial integrity
2361426 the deputy secretary said that we deplore todays russian attacks by strategic bombers and missiles which are threatening civilian lives
2361427 these attacks mark a dangerous and disproportionate escalation of tension
2361428 one of the issues around looking at the impact of seizures is that were not quite sure what impact they have because the issue of stockpiling
2361429 we know with a range of other substances like heroin and amphetamines that theres a high level of stockpiling that goes on so when there is a seizure it doesnt necessarily translate to reduced access to the drug on the street
2361430 our sense is that yes this is a big seizure we need to watch it very carefully in terms of the impact but our past history would tell us that the impact at the street level will be minimal if anything
2361431 people would not be sending this quantity of product to australia without a realistic expectation that they stand to be able to move all of this product
2361432 so what youre looking at is a truly phenomenal demand in australia for these sorts of drugs in the modern era
2361433 that resolution also recognises the need for continuing study and discussion on the matter in the past as a professional theologian i have made some contributions to such study as archbishop i understand my responsibility to be to the declared teaching of the church i serve and thus to discourage any developments that might imply that the position and convictions of the worldwide communion have changed
2361434 discourage any developments that might imply that the position and convictions of the worldwide communion have changed
2361435 prejudice against gay people in the church is as unacceptable as racism or prejudice against women
2361436 excluded your client as a subject or target of the investigation
2361437 i get incredible paranoid delusional thoughts at times and theres nothing i can do until they go away either by themselves or with drugs
2361438 the thinking now by the psychiatrist and counselor is that my symptoms

2361441 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
2361442 what is most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces
2361443 im all in favor of inflating our tires dont get me wrong
2361444 but thats a public service announcement its not an energy policy
2361445 he talked about energy independence yet he voted against ethanol subsidies and he is opposed to the farm bill
2361446 he talks about things that he doesnt back up that hes never backed up in his time in congress
2361447 throw the legitimacy of the election into question because it is so one sided
2361448 the clp ran a sort of one trick pony campaign
2361449 the only grab opposition leader terry mills seemed to get up during the campaign was the 83 per cent rise in violent crime and we all know that the underlying reason for that rise is the counting of domestic violence in those figures
2361450 i am struggling to see what seats that labor will lose
2361451 i know that the pundits are saying theyre going to lose some seats but i dont see that and i will have to wait like everyone else for tonight to see whether my views actually come to fruition
2361452 its a bit hard to know whether there will be a really good correlation between the territory wide vote and what happens in terms of seats
2361453 if they do badly at this election there may well be an outbreak of a central australian party and that would threaten the clp
2361454 what weve seen in the last three territory elections is that there can be massive swings out there
2361455 it has happened in the northern territory a handful of votes in a handful of seats will determine the outcome of this election and im fighting very hard to hold each and every of the 19 seats we have
2361456 i dont count chickens before theyve hatched i just focus on crossing that line
2361457 my focus has been on delivering good honest leadership and making sure that weve presented a clear alternative to territorians and i believe weve done that
2361458 ambulances are not able to move to evacuate wounded people
2361459 we are hearing reports of residents hiding in their basements and of hospitals being overwhelmed with the number of wounded having to conduct surgeries in corridors
2361460 we are receiving reports that a policy of ethnic cleansing was being conducted in villages in south ossetia the number of refugees is climbing the panic is growing people are trying to save their lives
2361461 about 1 400 died we will check these figures but the order of the numbers is around this we have this on the basis of reports from relatives
2361462 he is in big danger of losing the cachet he built up for himself in being pro western and the restraint he has often shown in the face of provocation by russia
2361463 i am deeply concerned over the dramatic situation in georgia and i deplore the loss of human lives and the suffering inflicted on the civilian population
2361464 if nothing else with four children i should probably play the lottery
2361465 the bishop of durham and 18 other signatories have also sent the following letter to the times
2361466 yes i wrote those letters and while im not going to say ive changed my mind i want to stress that i accept the meaning of a resolution ive worked for the last 5 years to neuter
2361467 the bishop of durham and 18 other signatories have also sent the following letter to the times
2361468 i am trying to strengthen the link between mps and their constituents
2361469 by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone
2361470 in certain areas like malia on crete bombes are a real problem
2361471 we may talk a lot about the attitude of tourists and their excessive drinking but often its the alcohol thats at fault if we dont solve this problem and get rid of bombes greeces image will be tainted
2361472 until now officials have only been able to conduct such checks until 2pm which is a bit of a paradox when its clearly such a big issue
2361473 with these new rules theyll be able to go into bars at any time of the night and day
2361474 its all part of our effort to discourage the wild behaviour that sadly is often encouraged by tour operators in britain
2361475 were not interested in quantity but the quality of tourism in greece
2361476 this clearly shows that the motion is none other than hunger for power
2361477 rudy is a family pet he doesnt go anywhere but hes part of the family
2361478 its not unusual that perpetrators or suspects try to hide stuff in the cruisers before they go to booking where they know theyll be searched
2361479 one of the critical factors of maintenance being performed is the number of licensed engineers and in australia that ratio is approximately one to one or two to one
2361480 we havent heard from him in more than 20 years
2361481 i dont know if im awake or even breathing right now
2361482 if this site were just discovered today it would make worldwide news
2361483 we need to instill again the idea that this is something spectacular
2361484 we were rather irked by the large number of indian mounds we had to plow down there must have been at least 25 on our land some were shaped like animals and some like birds and all were from three to five feet high i suppose we should not have destroyed them but they were then regarded merely as obstacles to cultivation and everybody plowed them down
2361485 het kamerlid wijnand duyvendak heeft groenlinks schade berokkend door de manier waarop hij bekend heeft gemaakt dat hij in 1985 betrokken was bij een inbraak in het ministerie van economische zaken
2361486 de indruk laten ontstaan dat groenlinks dit soort acties vergoeilijkt
2361487 en waar komt nu eigenlijk de gehele aanhang van groen links vandaan
2361488 not until i get to 19 if i get there
2361489 that ive been going out there when im supposed to go out there havent had any major problems and getting deep enough into games the innings add up when you get to start over 500 games you get a chance to put up some numbers like that
2361490 because i had to go on richard amp judy yesterday
2361491 in cracking shape thank you getting better every day more and more shipshape and generally ready for action
2361492 its bigger than id expected much much bigger but also better its a very big job bigger more challenging more intellectually challenging than anything ive ever done i didnt really know what it would be like but i could tell it was a wonderful job i remember years ago when michael heseltine first started rabbiting on about it thinking golly that would be a fantastic thing to do
2361493 happy green clean safe yeah and pioneering on the whole environmental agenda taking that stuff seriously making london the centre of the new global green revolution you know if you want to flog a new green idea then london should be the place where it happens
2361494 because were going to appoint a superb environmental adviser very shortly
2361495 we will be building up a a strategy and you know revising a lot of the targets over the er next few months but im sticking to our general desire to reduce co2 by 60 by 2025 and you know youre going to see some really fantastic things on cycling i would say to people add that adjective i mean no cyclings not an adjective its a participle add that participle ok its going to be clean green safe and cycling
2361496 but i think his comments were capable of perpetual misconstruction which was not going to be helpful
2361497 i just think it would have made things very difficult for him it would have sent out a wrong signal to a large erm you know chunk of the london population that we werent here to work for all of them
2361498 and were here to work for everybody in london ok
2361499 well er im not quite sure its true i dispute your premise
2361500 nothing would make me happier than to be able to boast a top team that was more diverse
2361501 im a great believer in organisations that are run by women the spectator under me was a feminocracy
2361502 well id have to look at the numbers but my impression is that we are a completely equal opportunities employer and im absolutely determined to remain so
2361503 i think meetings can sometimes its a bit like running in a dream you get that heavy feeling in your legs and you feel you can hardly move its just like treacle and weve got some things done quickly but some things youve got to bang at and then youve got to bang again and keep banging so when you do come into government and im in government now you know im running this thing you find actually how much energy it needs to push things along and you need good people around you to help you push it along
2361504 its perfectly true that when i came in just as a short term measure i mean you know what plannings like its mega stuff youve got to look at big balsa wood models of new developments and youve got to get your head around the arguments so i said listen ive got a lot to do in the next couple of months so i did temporarily delegate my powers but ill be taking them back soon planning is central to my vision for london if youre going to build a wonderful site in the middle of london and youve got this epic opportunity to build something thats going to last for 100 years then for gods sake put something on it thats going to be worth looking at
2361505 a kind of garble that preserves intonation pitch and rhythm but erases content
2361506 were scarcely ever off the phone in fact im going to ring him now lets ring cameron
2361507 using the resources of the mayors fund for london and the london development agency to start to you know encourage a boom in er institutions of all kinds people who are providing um um
2361508 i think it was the hardest i have ever shot
2361509 we didnt have much time after the qualifying match and before the final
2361510 im seriously happy it is over and i hold gold
2361511 everything i have ever seen in a contract is in this deal
2361512 he can do it all from that position whether it is running catching the football or blocking
2361513 weve got to try to be patient with him and hope he becomes one of our every five day starters
2361514 but hes a pretty resilient kid obviously hes quite disappointed himself but hes got a lot of good options out there
2361515 bens a good friend of mine and weve been through a lot of stuff together
2361516 i came to the decision to go to rutgers because i thought it was a place that would make me the best player and give me the best chance to win a national championship
2361517 i know kirk ciarrocca sees him as a possible center or guard i can see him as a kid who can play anywhere on the ol because of his athletic ability and ability to pass protect i think he could be one of those kids where there is a lot of flexibility
2361518 although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public when a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story i used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it
2361519 i did not know everybody was supposed to know especially when it was not a done deal and it would not go down
2361520 it is kind of between myself and my agent and boston and the padres
2361521 i do not think really anything needs to be said other than i made a commitment to play for this team for three or four years and at the end that is where i still stand
2361522 if next year does not work out with the option i will be a free agent and i can choose where i go i dont know how many years i have left
2361523 i know i have a few years left hopefully it is with san diego
2361524 i thought we did a nice job tonight of battling back
2361525 batesy got the big hit he battled back and drove the ball
2361526 we got a couple of big hits and took advantage of an error
2361527 we lost two games coming in it doesnt do any good to win one here and one there we go sweep trenton and then we go home and get swept by them
2361528 the young guys are going to play theyre here to develop and are going to have good nights and bad nights other guys have to keep rolling and pick guys up
2361529 its amazing how many club officials read fire brand of the american league
2361530 i really didnt know that until just a little while ago
2361531 i heard some people mention something about an exemption but i didnt really pay any attention to it thats really exciting
2361532 i was just thrilled to be in a tournament like this it only makes you better its a character builder and it only makes you want to come back
2361533 it might be dangerous for drivers to take their eyes off the road to consult a route map to read out the names
2361534 lean forward to use a microphone for the announcements meaning drivers would leave their optimal viewing position and could put stress on their backs
2361535 were putting motion lights up at some of the elderly peoples houses because theyre afraid that whoever is doing it is going to be hiding underneath the ramps
2361536 and theyre afraid theyll get attacked or something so were doing what we can do
2361537 im looking at this as an opportunity to try something else im just going to look at this as a positive thing and not let it get me down
2361538 were hopeful we can breathe new life into what was once an american retail icon
2361539 these are ongoing businesses that ran into cost issues in how they were managed
2361540 we feel that with our marketing database platform we can ramp these up a little bit more
2361541 well concentrate on finding the right products in those categories that fit the wards image
2361542 it is impossible to keep the graves marked for many years
2361543 the shingles and numbers are lost in a few years and there is no trace of the graves left excepting the recording at the office of the city clerk
2361544 it really bothered my mother and it bothered me just as much
2361545 yes we always knew there were a brother and sister who died as infants but that was as far as it went
2361546 then suddenly theyre gone and its too late to ask
2361547 norway was the poorest country in the europe for a while and there wasnt space for the dead
2361548 my grandfather used three last names during his life eritzland pederson and ersland
2361549 some of them thought it was frivolous that money should be used for the living
2361550 i wonder if they were destroyed because they brought up unhappy memories
2361551 i once found a picture of a relatives former wife in norway and her face was just cut out of the picture
2361552 burn this is a deeply engrossing look at four individuals and their interactions both verbally and physically and their ability and inability to share and communicate their dreams and frustrations
2361553 se ha tratado como nunca antes el problema del estigma y la discriminaci n hacia las poblaciones vulnerables y salimos con el firme compromiso de cambiar la situaci n

2361560 the good thing with new jersey starting time so late we dont have to rush into anything he has a test score hes able to make his visits we can get the process started theres no real rush
2361561 i just know that ill be taking a visit to kansas in september and october
2361562 id say all the coursework is completed the grades will be turned into the eligibility center its kind of a waiting game now
2361563 what can i say i havent got the focus this week obviously im still just having a hangover after winning the open
2361564 ive been fighting with my swing ive got the double miss going missing left and right
2361565 dont have an illegal alien problem we have an illegal employment problem
2361566 first she loses a child then she has cancer and now her
2361567 his mom carlita is going in circles trying to keep up with him
2361568 first she loses a child then she has cancer and now her
2361569 of course were incredibly pleased delighted would probably be a better adjective that nintendo approached us but its not an exclusive relationship
2361570 i cant get into details about other folks that are interested in this technology but as you might imagine of course there is more interest out there
2361571 oh absolutely yeah absolutely and the reason we say that is the type of capabilities they have
2361572 with six degrees of freedom you can basically make any movement at all and be able to track that in combination with the sensor bar and other sensors included in the wii remote add the gyroscope capability and you have the ability to work in all three dimensions of space
2361573 what youre looking at are golf swings tennis rackets where you can put top spin on balls bowling where you can bowl curves sword motions with forward thrusts and in wii sports resort the throttle ability
2361574 i really think weve just begun to scratch the surface gaming is a huge application but if you think of where motions and where motion sensing can be applied then there are so many applications this is a great time to be in the business
2361575 what we hopefully have done is provide our partner with new increased capability and what were so excited to see and await with bated breath is how that will be used
2361576 of course in wii sports resort is one application but whats the future in gaming i dont know we provided some great capability and well see what happens
2361577 we had persons of interest but we didnt have any evidence to link them to the crimes
2361578 reneau the only person inside the store and who carried a weapon alone made the decision to take keerans life
2361579 mr woods culpability for kriss keerans death lies somewhere between daniel reneaus and bill bunkers
2361580 he is a party to the murder in every sense of the word
2361581 we take issue with the prosecution calling him a mastermind i dont think he is capable of being a mastermind
2361582 having worked with him the last nine years i know he cant put things together he is not capable of that
2361583 i think it is important that we honor the verdict of the jury who heard all of the evidence under oath they were a very conscientious jury
2361584 what the parole board has before it on a petition is not under oath
2361585 the pool of votes available to democrats during tough times gets bigger in the south
2361586 first she loses a child then she has cancer and now her
2361587 there was a child who had been airlifted out of bandera county to university hospital in san antonio
2361588 doctors diagnosed him with extreme subdural hemorrhage about two days later the child died
2361589 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
2361590 first she loses a child then she has cancer and now her
2361591 i cant say that theres evidence that you are manipulating the price but i believe that you probably are
2361592 barack obama has found his people but unfortunately for his election prospects theyre german not american
2361593 i believe with all my heart that god knows what he is doing
2361594 i cant get over the timing of what i preached last sunday morning
2361595 i used the text in 1 corinthians that tells us we are the lords temple that his temple is his people not a building how could i have known at 10 in the morning what those words would mean at 3 in the afternoon
2361596 i was talking about this church being 192 years old how its been on this same corner all that time serving so many different people in so many different situations and how its work is not yet done then i went home and thats where i was when i got the call telling me what had happened
2361597 i dont think i had a tear left in me and i am not a crier
2361598 but my very next thought was to remind myself that even though the lightning struck our church it did not strike the temple of the lord because thats who we are we are his temple
2361599 i dont want to see any long faces in that room
2361600 oh i know its not going to be easy but i also know my lord will give us the strength we need physically mentally and spiritually and all will be well you see he can do anything the only thing he cant do is fail
2361601 so im going to tell them what ive told them so many times before i will look up not down i will look out not in i will look forward not backward doesnt that make sense
2361602 i had to learn to sit down i had to learn just about everything all over again but here i am people think the days of miracles are over but thats not true its just that we dont have enough faith to believe they can still happen look at me im a miracle
2361603 the good news is we caught it before contact started
2361604 with an enlarged spleen that obviously would have put him in tremendous danger
2361605 he wont be doing anything for about a week except resting then well re evaluate his condition and see if he can start working out and learning again
2361606 its very disappointing because i know he had high expectations and we were looking forward to working with him but its too early to determine whether this will be a redshirt year or not until we get him back on the field and find out where his level is but obviously this will impact his conditioning and his ability to learn and get acclimated to the system
2361607 i still feel good about whats going on out there very good about it
2361608 we just have to ratchet it up a little bit and see whos going to continue to learn and not bog down with more and more of the playbook
2361609 its probably the most talented group collectively that ive ever been around
2361610 we have guys with size we have guys with speed actually all of them run well im really excited about those guys in due time they will be the strength of our football team i dont know when that time will be but it will eventually be here
2361611 aarons the guy who has everything it takes to get us through this period
2361612 rmt members have shown the company how they feel by delivering two weekends of rock solid strike action
2361613 bicycle owners young and old are leaving the bicycles unattended in front yards on sidewalks at store fronts and parks

2361617 if you study to remember you will forget but if you study to understand you will remember
2361618 shore wars 2008 summer series at our lady of perpetual help parish hall a light thursday night crowd of 100 who made up for their numbers with their enthusiasm witnessed another hot summer night of nws action
2361619 if you study to remember you will forget but if you study to understand you will remember
2361620 i decided on army because a west point grad achieves and realizes a very unique pedigree ill be pretty much set for life at the end of my time there thats a very comforting thought i was really impressed by the character of the staff there too to be short im really happy with my decision and cant wait to suit up for the black knights
2361621 the girls are really excited about this one they think its their best album yet
2361622 the last was their most successful so far and that has given them the drive to keep going
2361623 they have spent more time recording this one than they have in the past because they want to get it right
2361624 all sides must remember that attacks on civilians or acts intended to terrorize civilians clearly violate international humanitarian law and may constitute war crimes
2361625 this would be true even if they are carried out in reprisal for indiscriminate attacks by the adversary
2361626 the road which was intended for evacuation of the wounded has been bombed
2361627 hes talking about it but for them the only message that matters is that hes cut the funding
2361628 but at the end of the day theyre saying well if youre not willing to contribute and if youre cutting funds you can do the cleaning up at home in australia
2361629 i dont know if its just my personality or my game
2361630 its kind of like ive been given a clean piece of paper a clean slate
2361631 it was really neat just getting in the car at the hospital knowing i was going home
2361632 i would like to have him involved he is too good a resource not to
2361633 thats where we were struggling a little bit on qualifying
2361634 we kept improving were still a little bit off but any day youre mixed up there with the ganassis it has to be a good day since theyre on a role here
2361635 dan was struggling earlier today and i was certainly hoping he good be a bit better maybe one spot better but not faster than me
2361636 its a good starting position for team target to be 1 and 3 i have to thank the team a lot they have certainly prepared great cars especially in qualifying
2361637 our race car is very similar to our qualifying setup hopefully we can lead a lot of laps gain a lot of points and close in on that championship
2361638 the formula dream car has been very consistent and easy to handle this weekend so i am very happy with the car
2361639 i wish my time was little faster but i hope i will be able to stay close to the front
2361640 my engineer made the decision right before qualifying to make some changes to the car that seemed to work for us and we ran our fastest lap of the day
2361641 were pretty happy with our starting position and our race car works really well in traffic so well do our best to stay out of trouble and bring home another good result in hopes of keeping the championship battle alive
2361642 we really tried to focus on a good car for the race tomorrow night instead of qualifying
2361643 were excited to be here with dollar general who brought us back to the racetrack after our long month of may our entire team is just really happy to be back i think for our second race together as a team we arent doing too badly
2361644 gt further proof this blog languishes in the zombie would have
2361645 prevention is straightforward prevent bites and vaccinate those at risk of bites
2361646 the waraos told us it was because there were too many bats that were biting the children
2361647 this study is significant because previous findings have been contradictory and the present investigation includes the largest number of heart attacks in an elderly group to date
2361648 our findings make a persuasive case that adiponectin is in fact associated with an increase in in older persons
2361649 due to damage from chronic stomach acid they are people who have a higher risk of developing esophagus cancer the goal of this therapy is to literally freeze the damage in its tracks and stop it before it turns to cancer
2361650 this is a disease we see in a lot of older patients with other illnesses so the decision to send them to surgery requires careful consideration cryoablation therapy is particularly attractive for older patients who may have complications or other medical issues such as accompanying heart or lung diseases that make traditional surgeries for barretts with dysplasia too risky
2361651 today when more children are overweight compared with previous generations it can be harder for parents to objectively identify if their child is overweight
2361652 research shows that most parents of overweight or obese children think that their child is a healthy weight some research showed that only 10 of parents with overweight or obese children described their child as overweight
2361653 preliminary findings of the survey suggest that many people who would be defined clinically as obese find the use of the term obese highly offensive and would stop listening to further advice
2361654 to shrink from using the word obesity is really ducking an issue
2361655 it does not have to be used in a judgmental or insulting way if a child is obese then the parents should know that its obese we must make parents know that the lifestyle of the family needs to be modified
2361656 risks and benefits of bmi reporting in the school setting
2361657 our feeling is that the information should be given to parents if there is a serious health concern much like any other health concern a child might have
2361658 this information should not be included on a report card or such medical information should be kept separate
2361659 obese men are more likely to be diagnosed with an aggressive form of the disease
2361660 our assumption is that these men have more blood volume so psa gets diluted he said
2361661 by the time obese men get to elevated levels the cancer is more advanced
2361662 im not sure that we should check obese men more often
2361663 but we should have a higher psa index of suspicion of what is not normal 3 4 rather than 4 for really obese men 3 2
2361664 the prostate is a narrow thing to operate on and when there is a big wad of fat in your way if the abdominal wall is thick it becomes a technical issue
2361665 the only thing we can think of is that when you operate on obese people you have to be more careful
2361666 we cant forget that when we use the term we are not just talking about very large men
2361667 a man who is 5 foot 9 and weighs 203 pounds would be considered obese
2361668 we are not screening these obese men effectively and are not doing as good a job surgically as could be done
2361669 many patients in india enter into clinical trials because they have no better option to receiving care
2361670 one of the major problems of clinical trials in india is that they are not publicized as clinical trials
2361671 physicians are attracted by inducements of foreign travel funds and fame of the four stakeholders the sponsor or drug company hospital investigator and patient three are on one side
2361672 why should we keep india behind everyone else why close our doors for business when we have the capabilities
2361673 since trials for foreign sponsors must follow international rules they actually help raise indian standards the experience with other outsourcing industries has also been that more business has brought better regulation and monitoring
2361674 companies spend resources to train people and bring in expensive equipment
2361675 over time as the overload from big institutes flows to smaller ones in second tier cities the benefits will spread farther
2361676 conducting clinical trials is not like landing a man on the moon
2361677 those who say it will enable india to develop cutting edge technology are talking nonsense
2361678 a little bit careful so as not to bring disrepute to the industry and country
2361679 its a bit hard to know whether there will be a really good correlation between the territory wide vote and what happens in terms of seats
2361680 if they do badly at this election there may well be an outbreak of a central australian party and that would threaten the clp
2361681 what weve seen in the last three territory elections is that there can be massive swings out there
2361682 it has happened in the northern territory a hand full of votes in a handful of seats will determine the outcome of this election and im fighting very hard to hold each and every of the 19 seats we have
2361683 i dont count chickens before theyve hatched i just focus on crossing that line
2361684 my focus has been on delivering good honest leadership and making sure that weve presented a clear alternative to territorians and i believe weve done that
2361685 it was an amazing experience it was my first time on the field it was an emotional feeling for me hes one japanese player on that team and im one japanese driver in the indycar series
2361686 after a welcome weekend off its time for the stretch run to the championship with four races in five weeks we kick it off at kentucky speedway another of the mile and a half oval that promotes the intense tire to tire racing for which the indycar series is known firestone is bringing a new tire to kentucky that is expected to increase grip and ratchet up the excitement another notch or two indycar series teams and drivers have relied on firestone to provide reliable and race worthy tires since the first event in 1996 we take great pride in that trust and take quite seriously the responsibility to continue developing those trustworthy race tires
2361687 over the years here at kentucky ive been fast i was on pole in 05 when i finished 16 th i had a gearbox problem i decided that i would take it apart and blow it up when i was getting ready for a pit stop but i was really quick the second year was my best finish which was probably when ive had the least chance of doing well here and then last year i think i was running third or fourth when i came in something like that and i spun coming out of pit lane and then the near collection of the safety truck i was pretty close because the tire blew out because i was running on a blistered tire so ive had some bad luck here but in the past ive been fast so i hope i can continue that and obviously have some good luck
2361688 edmonton was a weekend that i think wed all like to forget it was definitely a difficult one we were struggling all weekend and we just werent able to come through in the race either there were issues across the board i lost my radio pretty early in the race i lost it when tony kanaan was behind me they the team asked me how do you know when to stop i stopped because i saw i had 15 on my fuel meter and i can go to 20 weve gone through things enough in the briefing before the race so i felt prepared if this does happen because i could only imagine in my mind what a mess it would be if it did finally unfortunately happen which to me was disappointing its about keeping our heads down its about focusing harder when things are difficult its not a time to turn away its a time to jump in deeper and work even harder were all just going to need to work together as closely as possible and make progress thats been a big strength of the team over the years there were obviously some things that happened at edmonton outside of speed that were problems but its ok were through it
2361689 it was nice to have a break i think everyone recharged their batteries after the long six weeks i actually want to get going because we are very close to getting our first win of the season were trying everything we can but the good news is were still in the hunt for the championship a lot has started happening in the series which is great kentucky speedway is always a very difficult track because its a very fast oval were running 217 218 miles per hour and the banking is not high not like at some places such as homestead for example or texas or chicago but we are still able to go flat out but there are also some challenges there are some bumps which is great for us great for the drivers we have to work on balance in those circumstances im looking forward to this weekend and hopefully well be in good shape
2361690 i wouldnt change anything that weve done so far in this championship just because we havent won a race this season doesnt mean that we havent been competitive were second in the standings in the championship weve shown that were fast weve shown that were consistent and weve shown that we are right up there weve been using the right strategy and have done everything we can there are even sometimes that we take chances to win a race and im currently in second place the point is our team is fast im very confident with my guys now its just a matter of keep knocking on the door ive been saying that all season knock on the door and one day that door will open im going to push the door open break the door weve got to keep the same strategy were not going to change weve got four more races to go and weve got to not just chip away at the championship
2361691 i heard peyton is still in bed i worked really hard in rehab in the last week so i could be in car this weekend and have a chance to move up in the championship standings
2361692 it was no surprise for anybody it has been an eventful week with a lot of rumors and a lot of things that people come up with and i have no idea where it is coming from this defines where we are at and i am really excited about the opportunity that these guys gave me six years ago what can i say but i am very proud of this team for sure i am very excited about it and it obviously means a lot to me it means that what they have done in the past and what i have done in the past can happen again and make my dreams come true i have one more thing to do for this team and that is to win the indianapolis 500 and now i have five more tries so hopefully it can happen one of these years
2361693 were really excited to have this done we felt like we had a deal a long time ago with tony with a handshake for us that was basically him being a part of the family as long as he has that was as quick as it was the rest was just trying to get it on paper it was nice to get that finished and put an end to all the rumors tony is what we consider a franchise player and one of the foundations of the team hes part of the family there was never a question in our mind that tony was going to be with us for a long long time were very happy that weve finally put it to bed
2361694 this really started last fall we had a lot of discussions about not only spending his driving career here but what tony wants to do after hes finished driving those were the kind of discussions that we had with him tonys been with us since the start and we really consider him one of the founding parts of andretti green racing hes spent his career with us he gave us our first pole and our first win and our first championship thats the kind of relationship that weve had like most families once in awhile we have our squabbles but i promise you that the guy sitting up here theres nobody more motivated in the sport theres no one like tony on race day hes a team player and thats really what his contract recognizes
2361695 i am very excited with the partnership of lucas new line of racing oils and swe i was at the dyno test performed by xtrac gear and was impressed with the results of xfr forrest lucas not only showed up for the test but he took it upon himself to hand blend the oil that dyno tested with outstanding drag and temperature results creating xfr
2361696 its a very proud moment those are the things i never thought about when i was competing i guess when you get to the end of your driving career and are recognized for what youve done its a pretty proud moment and to be in there with my father who is the greatest of all time and who will be introducing me it will be a very special night
2361697 i was in the second lane just going around getting comfortable and i had speed for awhile and just all of sudden the front end just started lightly sliding up the track and i tried to turn and it wouldnt turn and that was it i wasnt able to put any steering in the front end of the car so i dont know
2361698 its very important to start up front at this track because its so difficult to pass we tested here a couple weeks ago and we had great speed it feels so good to put everything together and get the pole i was a little bit concerned because we went out so early but the entire afs andretti green team worked so hard all day it feels so good to bring the boys the pole
2361699 every point is important in this championship it could be decided by 10 points or just one point so you have to get every point you can its good to get the pole tomorrow i just want a clean race so i can get as many points as i can
2361700 today was great we just keep improving the car the healthy choice and sam schmidt crew we work great together and we are so confident in ovals and still improving it is really tight here in kentucky and we will have to see what is going to happen tomorrow we have put ourselves in a position that i think we can get a second win but we will have to improve the car before the race because the andretti green car is really fast i have to thank my sam schmidt team for teaching me all they know about ovals they are very experienced on ovals i am pleased to be starting on the front row because it is very hard to pass here i just need to find a way to get around raphael matos
2361701 starting in the second row isnt a bad place to be starting it is a little disappointing though we looked good on the first lap but just slowed a little on the second i will definitely be going for the win this race we havent finished the last few races but that wont stop me from going for the win we have been strong on ovals all year so i expect us to be extremely strong for tomorrow and contend for the win we are going to try to move forward hopefully we will have a setup that allows us to do that
2361702 it felt good we were lacking about a tenth of a second a lap the car felt good the speed just wasnt there i said going into qualifying that id be satisfied with a top five happy with a top three and over the moon with the pole at least im satisfied i dont know what more i could have done you cant win all of them
2361703 dan wheldon was struggling earlier today and i was certainly hoping he good be a bit better maybe one spot better but not faster than me its a good starting position for team target to be 1 and 3 i have to thank the team a lot they have certainly prepared great cars especially in qualifying we just have to worry about our line for the qualifying laps and it worked out our race car is very similar to our qualifying setup hopefully we can lead a lot of laps gain a lot of points and close in on that championship
2361704 i think we did really good thats where we were struggling a little bit on qualifying the delphi panther national guard car did really really good we kept improving were still a little bit off but any day youre mixed up there with the ganassis it has to be a good day since theyre on a role here im pleased and i hope that tomorrow goes as well as today did
2361705 it was a good run out there there are four races left and i want to finish for the team very strong and thats what im focused on they can expect a very strong effort from the no 10 car tomorrow night scott dixon has been very quick and thats what the benchmark is for tomorrow
2361706 the formula dream car has been very consistent and easy to handle this weekend so i am very with the car i wish my time was a little faster but i hope i will be able to stay close to the front i won the indy lights race here last year so i hope the race tomorrow will be a good one as last year
2361707 the team penske car feels really solid and it has a nice balance we probably couldve gotten a bit more speed out of it but im certainly happy with where we are i think we have a great car and we should be in good shape for the race tomorrow
2361708 today was rather difficult in the early going for the no 3 team penske crew the car felt really solid during the practice sessions but we didnt seem to have the speed of the leaders and we couldnt figure out why that was my engineer made the decision right before qualifying to make some changes to the car that seemed to work for us and we ran our fastest lap of the day were pretty happy with our starting position and our race car works really well in traffic so well do our best to stay out of trouble and bring home another good result in hopes of keeping the championship battle alive
2361709 i dont think our qualifying run was strong enough today but it is a long race so im not worried we had the misfortune of totaling a car here last week during a test with rafa raphael matos and that cost us a lot unfortunately this team 7 eleven car doesnt have all the nice pieces we need for a superspeedway so were just hanging in there right now
2361710 consistency is always good for a driver to have and those were some pretty consistent laps 0 0033 of a second variance per lap but i really need to thank my vision guys i wasnt really happy with my car in that last practice and thanks to my teammate a j foyt iv for his input and my crew guys for putting in some hard work to change the menards car completely for qualifying as a result we went faster in qualifying than ive been all day theres a lot of teamwork going on around here and hopefully well see it pay off
2361711 my run was quite easy because there wasnt a lot more to go from a downforce standpoint unfortunately we just didnt have the speed today in qualifying im confident that the meijer car will do the tow as it showed today in practice it will do a good time and we know we have a good race car
2361712 this track has always been good to us we had a great race here last year and this weekend weve had a really good car since we unloaded it so im expecting to have a great run in the no 2 lilly car tomorrow the first qualifying lap held us back a little or wed have run a bit faster i think
2361713 thats the quickest weve been all weekend its a good way for the roll coater dreyer amp reinbold team to come out and finally qualify and pick speed up like were supposed to for one of the teams that didnt test and just show up i think its pretty respectable we should have a good starting spot where we can keep up with the front guys i know we have a really good car right now in race trim so we should be happy with that
2361714 we just didnt have enough speed today for qualifying but the car was good in race trim during practice and i am confident tomorrow will be a better day for us
2361715 i guess the bad luck continued to follow us today we missed out on practice this morning because of the engine failure and in the end the lack of practice time cost us in qualifying its unfortunate but it will be different for the race tomorrow
2361716 that was all she had we had to replace the gearbox after the last session so our guys werent able to prep the abc supply car as much as usual for qualifying because they were still taping it up coming to the pit lane on these superspeedways the small things are critical because every little detail makes a difference when youre running flat all the way around well start mid pack and ill overtake 10 cars on the first lap and well be fine just kidding ive been pretty happy with the car since we unloaded so i think well have a good weekend
2361717 it wasnt too bad of a run it was better than i expected so i am quite happy considering the difficulties we have had with damaging our quick car last week we knew we would be slower in this one it just shows that the mcdonalds team keeps working hard and pushing sometime soon it will turn around and come our way
2361718 the car is good we are just struggling to get speed out of it we dont know exactly what it is but were going to keep working on it its got to be something because we dont think there is any more drag we can take out of it i was completely flat out from the time i left the pits but that is the best speed we can get we ran around this morning on full tanks and the car was really good in traffic and on my own so i think we will be much better in the race i think we can pull up on some guys and get some positions with the tow
2361719 i am actually very happy its the first time that kv racing technology was able to go faster in qualifying than in practice it shows that we are learning more about the car and keep improving little by little each session so i am just happy that we are progressing and hope that we have a good race tomorrow
2361720 we have a reasonable starting position for the race it will be long race with a lot of stops hopefully kvrt aussie vineyards will have a good clean race tomorrow and i will be able to earn enough points to move into the top 10 standings
2361721 it is really unfortunate that the motorola car is starting in the last row we were running well in both practice sessions and then something broke causing us to hit the wall we decided not to qualify its not ideal but it gives the guys more time to get the back up car ready for tomorrow it is going to be a challenge getting through traffic but im confident in my team and looking forward to the race

2361815 i just spoke to josh and he is happy to get the process behind him and move forward the bottom line was we wanted to make a quick decision once the offer came through to show josh that we want him to remain a hawk
2361816 the march symbolizes both the evil and hopeful sides of humanity the evil with the constant balancing act of power within government religion and our financial institutions there lies the chance of those most hungry for power to alter and restrict our freedoms for their gain the hopeful this represents the faith in mankind as the most powerful force on the planet if we come together and do not fight over religion class and borders then we hold the key to a peaceful world there are two possible futures in store either a march of power and greed or a march of a unified human race
2361817 ferret was the best choice for us because we felt that the label had enough resources to fulfill all of our needs as a band while still being an indie label which would give us the opportunity to have a personal relationship with everyone we work with we felt this balance was really important to the future and growth of our band
2361818 our goal for the music we write is to bring a pretty aggressive metal approach but giving our own feel to it without limiting ourselves to one particular genre of metal we also strive to write lyrics with a meaningful message about what we believe in a way that we feel everyone can relate to
2361819 how we got our name back then was when we first got in we wanted to be called the mercenaries
2361820 the olympics for china is a giant spectacle a game but for us its much more than that its a chance to call attention to what is happening in tibet
2361821 during the middle of a campaign you are always worried about taking some time off thats the nature of the job
2361822 its been about 19 months since i saw my grandmother and she is at an age where its really important for me to see her and those little girls need a little love as does michelle so we are going to take the time
2361823 senator clinton did very well in nevada in the primaries

2361828 russia will have to think real hard before delivering this system to iran which is possibly on the brink of conflict with either israel or the us since if the system is delivered an ew system will likely be developed to neutralize it and if that happens it would be catastrophic not only for iran but also for russia
2361829 no country will want to buy the system if it is proven to be ineffective
2361830 from the first day i was able to represent brian and the paper work was officially filed we worked aggressively with the team to try to make something work
2361831 we tried to get very creative and find a structure that would allow us to get something done while still dealing with the rules that were in place
2361832 i cant speak to why the deal didnt get done before but i know we kept hammering away in order to do something that made sense for the player
2361833 we set a timetable with the team so this would be dragged and for whatever reason we were able to get it done
2361834 moving the boxing link which is now at the bottom of the homepage near the top with some of the more popular sports i find it hard to believe that boxing compares in popularity to cfl cricket and rugby
2361835 i feel your pain about the boxing section the issue right now is how often the section gets updated typically we wont add a sport to the top navigate bar until it is getting updated with new articles several times per day so the best advice i can give is to keep writing and encourage your fellow boxing writers to do the same in due time boxing will make it up to the top
2361836 the video tribute was put together by my good friend
2361837 system of a down never had any walls or any borders that we didnt cross musically speaking we went almost in every direction i never felt like i couldnt express myself in any which way in system but im not gonna go ahead and do system on my own without the members of system so you know it turns out circumstances put me in a position that you know i had to start a new band
2361838 we have begun the long process of mixing this beast while continuing to brighten up some spots in several songs we are trying to get as much done with the small resources we have available to us at this time and as promised will have a song posted on our myspace page very soon

2361841 i have had no contact with my three girls for a year today they only live 300 metres from where i am stood you can imagine how painful that is
2361842 i have written to them and send them christmas and birthday presents but have heard nothing i want them to know that i love them and want to pay a meaningful role in their lives
2361843 im not a nutter other than a parking fine i have not been in court before i want things to change i want to see my girls fathers4justice is not a load of crackpots we are trying to make the government and family law courts to try and change a few things which are not only damaging fathers but children as well

2361848 best friend radical hard head and mince core noise diy militant when the earth trembes and shakes we know you are making noise in hell when thunder and lightning strikes us we know you are doing noise in heaven
2361849 what i did was i helped them out with living circumstances so they could live in another place
2361850 they shared a place together for a while then they each had separate places recently
2361851 never had a conversation with john edwards or anyone else about it
2361852 i just was terribly upset by the way they were being treated and particularly by the way their kids were being treated
2361853 these kids when they would go to school they could have three paparazzi taking pictures of them it was just really horrible
2361854 i decided independently to help two friends and former colleagues rebuild their lives when harassment by supermarket tabloids made it impossible for them to conduct a normal life
2361855 john edwards was not aware that assistance was provided to anyone involved in this matter i did this of my own volition and without the knowledge instruction or suggestion of john edwards or anyone else the assistance was offered and accepted without condition
2361856 this is now and shall always remain a private matter between these individuals and me
2361857 the jury handed down a big sentence but it was a just sentence
2361858 the jury apparently took this offense seriously and wanted to send a message that a multiple dwi offender was not going to be allowed back on the roads of wichita county
2361859 its like saying once you get into willy wonkas chocolate factory and youre in the garden where everythings edible you have it all
2361860 i was deeply impressed by the talent the enthusiasm and the creativity of the chinese university students i met that trip played a pivotal role in our decision to establish a fundamental research lab in beijing in 1998
2361861 the research lab in beijing exceeded even my own high expectation
2361862 by making significant contributions to our technical knowledge and products within its first few years of existence as a result we expanded the lab to include the top researchers from the entire asia pacific region and it is now known as microsoft research asia our largest research lab outside of the united states it has achieved remarkable things in the past 10 years
2361863 for microsoft research asia the year of 2008 marks the end of one historic journey with the start of another
2361864 our past decade of efforts on innovation and collaboration will encourage us and future generations of researchers to continue doing our best bringing microsoft and the world great things for a better future
2361865 and our success depends upon our ability to attract the best talent from around the world
2361866 the place was absolutely soaked with gasoline obviously the intent was to set the apartment on fire
2361867 the problem was we couldnt relate the name on the credit card receipt to anybody that we knew of in our case at that point
2361868 then we found out the card was used in louisiana about four hours later and it was used in alabama about four hours later
2361869 somebody was using fernandes credit card to leave the area

2361884 generations of the american people have surged through the preambles portal and widened its gate like constitutions amendments are not just words but deeds flesh and blood struggles to redeem americas promise while making amends for some of the sins of our fathers
2361885 our goal is to see a crowd of 75 000 people at obamas nomination speech holding their hands above their heads fingers laced together in support of a new direction for this country a renewed hope and acceptance of responsibility for our future
2361886 we thought lets try and start a movement where even while walking down the street people would hold up the o and you would know that they were for obama
2361887 a leading source of radical homosexual propaganda anti christian bigotry and radical transgender advocacy
2361888 i have been mocked over and over again by ungodly and unprincipled anti christian lesbians
2361889 six years in sodom from the journal of james hartline
2361890 racially charged democratic primary in memphis tn ended with an incumbent congressman trouncing the opponent who ran an ad linking him to the ku klux klan unofficial results showed democrat steve cohen with 79 percent of the vote to 19 percent for nikki tinker a black corporate lawyer who was his chief opponent in the district that covers memphis with all precincts reporting cohen is the first white congressman from memphis in more than three decades and one of only two white congressmen representing a majority black district
2361891 we were shocked to see the recent ads run by the nikki tinker for congress campaign we believe the ads are offensive and divisive emilys list does not condone or support these types of attacks
2361892 while he is in our churches clapping his hands and tapping his feet hes the only senator who thought our kids shouldnt be allowed to pray in school

2361895 launch and give people a taste of what weve been working so hard on
2361896 it seems that weve got a lot of selling based on the stronger dollar
2361897 energy demand destruction and the dollar return have formed a quiet alliance to bring the oil market down and today the louder of the two is the dollar
2361898 the market has been ignoring the tbilisi pipeline situation and now the problems with russia the move lower really now has a momentum of its own with the financial players coming out
2361899 jeremy guthrie i think is in a position now his due is coming hes getting recognized as a legitimate top of the order rotation guy for any team in the major leagues hes for real
2361900 those guys are experienced guys and go out there with a plan they really prepare i came in at 6 30 and every one of the video screens had somebody in front of it looking at texas starter luis mendoza
2361901 we want to stop the swift boating before it gets off the ground
2361902 acompanhar sistematicamente os testes em regime emergencial para garantir a execu o do cronograma de implementa o da portabilidade

2361904 do you who have so many friends so large a circle of acquaintance find it easy when you sit down to write to isolate yourself from all those ties and their sweet associations as to be quite your own woman uninfluenced unswayed by the consciousness of how your work may affect other minds what blame what sympathy it may call forth
2361905 living in the past instead of learning from it isnt progressive and keeping people angry about the past doesnt make for a better future
2361906 if this really is a war for oil than why dont you get out of the way and let us drill for our own oil if its really about war for oil than no one has more blood on his hands than you
2361907 somebody was laying on my legs a lady next to me she had her arm crushed up the lady who was on my left a man was on top of her
2361908 i think im the luckiest one out of most people
2361909 if there is a loss of pressure or the tire becomes delaminated its much more difficult to control the vehicle
2361910 we have requested law enforcement agencies to be alert for any buses being operated by angel tours or iguala busmex since they are not authorized to operate legally
2361911 if found on the road we want law enforcement to immediately stop and place the vehicles out of service
2361912 this happened like katrina like challenger what we can do is pray
2361913 god will comfort them tell people to keep trusting in god do not blame anybody do not ask why now we just help each other to get through this
2361914 the church is like one big family here were very close we stick together
2361915 we are here with them to pray for those who are lost and for gods consolation in this time of grief and loss
2361916 the vietnamese catholic culture is very strong a lot of those who have come here have been through a great deal just to get to this country theyve always preserved their catholic faith this is a trial this is a challenge
2361917 definitely he robinho is going to stay with us the coach bernd schuster has said he wants him in our team
2361918 we dont see any possibility of him leaving real madrid
2361919 when i hit my driver like i did today this is an easy sport
2361920 its the kind of round ive been looking for to get myself back on the leaderboard and feeling the good vibes
2361921 i called home and i said this is the hardest golf course ive ever played
2361922 if i were to play here every day i dont know if i would enjoy it
2361923 im not that aggressive if im not hitting my driver good
2361924 its not a home page unless it says welcome in large letters
2361925 you will take and eat a pile of dog poo each day
2361926 you will get stomach ulcer whenever you think about sex
2361927 yeah its definitely frustrating to look back and think with two kicks things could have been different we could have been the champions and not virgina tech
2361928 but theres no sense to dwell on it now we just have to try and get it done this year
2361929 were going to have an open competition and the guy thats going to be the most productive is the guy thats going to kick
2361930 i dont have any preconceived notions i want to make sure that those guys are going to compete im putting them in positions of pressure so ill just call up a field goal team or an extra point at any time during a practice and make a kick
2361931 ive been consistently putting it closer to the goal line and rarely out of bounds which im sure everyone will be very happy about it
2361932 im afraid hes got a lot to say to me right now
2361933 i lost a little bit in my footwork but im getting it back though and ive got to get the leg strength back
2361934 were just going to have be different use different schemes to help us punt the football
2361935 essential to move away from duelling referendums aimed at subduing the other side rather they said basic consensus was needed around several issues
2361936 ive found that most lenders have pulled back the alt a type products all ready
2361937 it feels good for people to paint it makes me to relax i like painting
2361938 i started painting many pictures christmas cards i painted a doll this year this year i painted a doll i sold that
2361939 with our art the art that our artists create we are invited in to corporate boardrooms corporate headquarters agencies gift shops where people can learn about the people we support
2361940 these people we license their art we sell it as originals prints and greeting cards so they get royalties
2361941 as they talk about what the art means to them theyre really breaking stereotypes out in the rest of the world that wow we didnt know
2361942 our mission is to provide income for our clients to give them a voice to break down stereotypes and add beauty to the world
2361943 i know what you must be thinking but i assure you julie and i are just roommates
2361944 ever since your mother came to dinner ive been unable to find the beautiful silver gravy ladle you dont suppose she took it do you
2361945 well i doubt it but ill write her a letter just to be sure
2361946 dear mother im not saying you did take a gravy ladle from my house and im not saying you did not take a gravy ladle but the fact remains that one has been missing ever since you were here for dinner
2361947 the bicycle is carrying the sack of potatoes i am glad that i do not have to carry them on my back
2361948 you are a smart boy when you grow old you will not walk hunched over like i do
2361949 i love to watch the trees and fields pass by as i roll down the path
2361950 when i ride my bicycle i am content to chant nam myoho renge kyo
2361951 your mind will roll with the ease of a newly trued wheel
2361952 riding my bicycle i live in harmony with all sentient beings
2361953 you are riding on the golden path of non harming
2361954 some of those darned bicyclers have no respect for the law
2361955 clinically ive seen a number of couples where a wife is diagnosed with a chronic illness that its not uncommon for men to have an affair
2361956 when men are under stress theyre more apt for doing something out there go and drink more spend more money do riskier things and including having affairs
2361957 i made a serious error in judgment if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare
2361958 men in married relationships tend to be more dependent emotionally on their wives than their wives are on them
2361959 this tends to be stressful for a lot of men and a proportion of those men are going to be more susceptible to another woman coming along
2361960 where we sat outside waiting the whole day it was crazy
2361961 its an extremely emotional trigger you can put a soundtrack to almost every memory you have i think
2361962 and the feelings that those songs conjure up are extremely strong
2361963 its always the beatles and i think it comes down to please please me
2361964 we associate music with every stage of being a young person
2361965 it seems like at every stage of being young music is there to provide the soundtrack im not thats true of adulthood im not sure what the soundtrack of adulthood is like i think we come to associate music itself with just being young and innocent
2361966 theres certainly accounts of adults with dementia who are able to recite songs perfectly but have lost the ability to speak
2361967 there are very interesting things like this the brain seems to store these things differently it seems to develop catalogs of music when it doesnt necessarily have a workable catalog of speech
2361968 i think its wonderful theres nothing that makes you feel like that anymore
2361969 creating a god like figure in a man who falls short in every way
2361970 no you cant get into my pants theres already an arse in there
2361971 it feels good but it would feel a lot better if i were in tibet where my motherland is
2361972 they kept me about 16 hours with no food or no communication i did ask them to speak to the embassy they said they cant
2361973 if you have this a picture of the dalai lama you will be killed right away thats why we are showing one here
2361974 we will be here as long as it takes as long as it takes thats all i can say
2361975 its always been my lucky number i guess or my favorite number three of them what better way to go
2361976 in cantonese eight is pronounced as fa which means become prosperous
2361977 when you have a succession of eights that becomes more important and significant than one eight in a number
2361978 this came in very useful in school when the pendulum swing told you if someone was a boy or girl and i could make it tells boys they were girls and vice versa
2361979 if you were to ask me a few years ago that i expect to be here the answer would have been no
2361980 i genuinely love what i was doing absolutely loved it
2361981 being a firefighter is unique i suppose its kind of like being a police officer not everybody can do what you do
2361982 that was the first large fire i that had ever seen in my life
2361983 i was thinking im in the wrong place at the wrong time that was a long cold very cold long long night
2361984 that part of it i havent really focused on because ive been more concerned with the performance and aspect of the job
2361985 im aware of it but it wasnt a driving factor
2361986 therell be some blind spots here and there but all of the traffic corridors and many of the areas around those buildings will be in plain view
2361987 its been an interest of downtown business folks the people who live downtown as well as the police department this was just a great opportunity to start that process
2361988 its very important that we have evidence showing police misconduct if it does happen
2361989 we hope that that wont take place here in st paul
2361990 if it does we want to be there to document it to make sure that peoples medical bills and things like that get paid for
2361991 its just another tool for our toolbox as were doing our work
2361992 my role is to be supportive of these two families
2361993 i wanna see my party lead on the great moral issues yes im a democrat moral issues of our day
2361994 somebody was laying on my legs a lady next to me she had her arm crushed up the lady who was on my left a man was on top of her
2361995 i think im the luckiest one out of most people
2361996 if there is a loss of pressure or the tire becomes delaminated its much more difficult to control the vehicle
2361997 we have requested law enforcement agencies to be alert for any buses being operated by angel tours or iguala busmex since they are not authorized to operate legally
2361998 if found on the road we want law enforcement to immediately stop and place the vehicles out of service
2361999 this happened like katrina like challenger what we can do is pray
2362000 god will comfort them tell people to keep trusting in god do not blame anybody do not ask why now we just help each other to get through this
2362001 the church is like one big family here were very close we stick together

2362004 wed like to thank our dedicated fans for their votes and unwavering support of our games wed also like to congratulate the other nominees in this category their existence improves the gaming landscape
2362005 the record breaking sales we saw with halo 3 at the games launch and the continued success on xbox live are testament to how many people really love this game as reinforced by the fans votes for game of the year
2362006 given that this was the most incredible year for games in memory i have to commend our fans for making some tough decisions but well deserved spreading of the love to all the great developers out there
2362007 some of those undecided middle class voters or even working class voters who didnt go for obama in places like and ohio wont like images of obama on the beaches of the ultimate luxury destination
2362008 instead of calling on his friends and allies in congress to return to put a much needed energy policy in place to fight sky high gas prices is joining them with a beach vacation of his own
2362009 during the middle of a campaign you are always worried about taking some time off thats the nature of the job
2362010 the united states and russia must take the lead in striving to abolish nuclear weapons
2362011 these two countries should begin implementing broad reductions of nuclear weapons instead of deepening their conflict over among others the introduction of a missile defence system in europe
2362012 i vow to lead the international community for permanent peace
2362013 there was pressure for all of us but for her it was even harder
2362014 im sorry but the chinese press is putting a lot of pressure on chinese athletes
2362015 she did a fantastic job im so proud of her
2362016 it was spectacular really unbelievable we liked it a lot
2362017 the heavy presence of chinese peoples liberation army officers throughout the proceedings left many wondering exactly what image the hosts were intending to project to the international community
2362018 this is the toughest course i have ever seen at a tournament event
2362019 another three died in overnight attacks altogether 15 peacekeepers have been killed
2362020 georgian forces are controlling the entire territory of south ossetia except java
2362021 this information will be checked but this is the approximate number based on information from relatives
2362022 the georgian side is right now firing on residential parts of tskhinvali
2362023 we responded to the last volley that hit tskhinvali and our peacekeepers positions with a counter strike from our artillery and tanks
2362024 they have in effect begun hostilities using tanks and artillery
2362025 ambulances cannot move hospitals are reported to be overflowing surgery is taking place in corridors
2362026 all copyrights to rodney dangerfields act are held by joan dangerfield who owns all of her late husbands intellectual property
2362027 we were with estelle when it mattered i didnt go to her funeral and paul her wonderful caretaker knew i wasnt going to her funeral
2362028 funerals are about the media who was there and who wasnt thats not about estelle we adored her to tell you the truth her passing is tough on us but its a blessing for her shes been so ill for so long shes in a better place now wherever she is
2362029 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2362030 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2362031 georgian military forces completely control all the territory of south ossetia
2362032 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
2362033 we wont allow the death of our compatriots go unpunished
2362034 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2362035 i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2362036 its a dramatic fall for the former vice presidential candidate who was widely seen as a potential cabinet member in the future or even a running mate for barack obama
2362037 of course i mean for a lot of americans including the family that i grew up with i mean its its fundamental to how you judge people and human character whether you keep your word whether you keep what is your ultimate word which is that you love your spouse and youll stay with them
2362038 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2362039 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2362040 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2362041 its more disappointing but again my biggest concerns the family right now
2362042 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2362043 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2362044 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
2362045 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2362046 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it
2362047 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2362048 remain close friends and their family is the priority and will continue to be
2362049 we have our full force out there looking for them
2362050 our main concern is to bring the girls back to safety
2362051 were pulling computer records right now to find out whats happened
2362052 if you dont take the kid from the home the only check you have is this the record of what you did or did not do
2362053 if you start playing with that and altering that you undermine the only check these kids have on failure to protect
2362054 if this is what happened in sacramento whoever did it and whoever ordered it should be fired immediately
2362055 its covering up the extent of whatever errors may have been and that endangers the next child
2362056 worked in isolation and did not follow established department procedures such as required contact with reporting party required contact with medical personnel required contact with persons who may have knowledge of the family and reviewing the case with the supervisor
2362057 we strongly believe there is credible evidence to show that
2362058 we are very disappointed by this and find it incredibly ironic that the same government that put the rifle in his hand is now seeking to up the ante because of his alleged use of that rifle
2362059 weve got to remember that everybody in fallujah had a rifle good guys and bad guys and to single out sgt nazario for the alleged use of that rifle in the charged offense really paints the picture of what the government seeks to do here

2362069 we are all disappointed with the outcome of last weeks game
2362070 but this is the last game of our season and we want to finish on a strong note
2362071 they are a very explosive offensive team that are good in transition
2362072 thats our game as well so its the kind of game where well need to get our offense flowing early

2362081 ive always been community minded and ive always wanted to make things better
2362082 i was shocked because of the amount of applicants who applied
2362083 i was very pleased with the turnout some places dont get a nice turnout
2362084 will brooks has served this city with distinction as a volunteer board member for 16 years
2362085 he now brings his enormous talent and enthusiasm to city council i am confident mr brooks will do an outstanding job on city council
2362086 the united states and russia must take the lead in striving to abolish nuclear weapons
2362087 these two countries should begin implementing broad reductions of nuclear weapons instead of deepening their conflict over among others the introduction of a missile defence system in europe
2362088 energy insights estimates the ghg emissions from it only account for 3 of the energy related carbon dioxide emissions in the u s commercial sector or 0 6 of the total
2362089 the other 97 is comprised of the following segments transportation 33 industrial which is dominated by manufacturing 28 and commercial and residential which is primarily related to buildings 36
2362090 if the whole world does not stop russia today then russian tanks will be able to reach any other european capital
2362091 i know what im capable of doing and i know what he is
2362092 i tested it i threw it in the pool and it didnt move at all
2362093 i used to have kids coming up to me asking for photos and autographs and now i have adults coming up to me at meets saying theyve been inspired
2362094 its been fun having an adult age group following me and i hope i represent them well
2362095 he has races from his own team he has races from other teams hes the one up there at the top of the pyramid and everyone wants to beat him
2362096 i didnt expect to be number one it was just the luck of the draw
2362097 im used as cannon fodder they said send the old bugger out there first and see what happens
2362098 it would be stupid for me to take a banned substance just before the games
2362099 i won the medal because i had the biggest cannonball
2362100 i dont know if they do that in the olympics but its fun
2362101 i used to do flips and stuff in the living room trying to do what they did on tv
2362102 ive thought about wanting to be in the olympics before i would do the gymnastics events
2362103 i was always into sports running track playing volleyball and basketball but i really loved track
2362104 i dont remember my fastest time im 67 now so its been a while
2362105 i think my greatest memory about the olympics would be when mark spitz won all his gold medals
2362106 i really liked him and his image he represented us well
2362107 i want to watch michael phelps and see how well he does
2362108 hes pretty impressive at the last olympics with the what eight medals he got he should do pretty well
2362109 in certain areas like malia on crete bombes are a real problem
2362110 we may talk a lot about the attitude of tourists and their excessive drinking but often its the alcohol thats at fault if we dont solve this problem and get rid of bombes greeces image will be tainted
2362111 until now officials have only been able to conduct such checks until 2pm which is a bit of a paradox when its clearly such a big issue
2362112 with these new rules theyll be able to go into bars at any time of the night and day
2362113 its all part of our effort to discourage the wild behaviour that sadly is often encouraged by tour operators in britain
2362114 were not interested in quantity but the quality of tourism in greece
2362115 the greatest surprise of all even for me after eight years spent working as a film critic has been the sustained level of intensely sadistic brutality throughout the film
2362116 the dark knight is a superhero movie and the violence it contains exists within that context
2362117 watching screen violence had changed the frontal lobe brain function of normal adolescents to be more like that of the children with disruptive brain disorders
2362118 as the governor said he will not sign any legislation until a budget is passed
2362119 the governors message was clear focus on the budget and the budget only
2362120 clearly the governor wants everybody to focus on the budget
2362121 in this case hes reviewed this bill already and im hoping that will make a difference
2362122 the governor himself told a national television audience that flip flopping is a great thing that it is a wonderful thing when someone has made a mistake and is able to be honest about it and change his mind
2362123 for most people who get cancer it occurs without warning seemingly out of the blue
2362124 as this cancer only involves breasts and ovaries it rarely affects men
2362125 if a woman has the cancer gene she will not necessarily develop cancer there is however about an 80 chance that she will do so at some stage in life unless she takes action to avoid it at what age the cancer appears can vary widely in our family no one has had it before they were 40
2362126 felicity and i had our ovaries removed once we knew we didnt want or couldnt have any more children
2362127 some people prefer not to find out whether they have the gene clearly such people will not want to have the test others think it helps to know
2362128 if for example the test proves negative you can feel reassured and neednt worry any more about it if you find you do carry the gene a number of things can be done to prevent any danger of the cancer becoming a serious problem
2362129 women can have frequent screenings of ovaries and breast by ultrasound to detect any cancer as early as possible ovaries are more difficult to screen than breasts so to be almost completely safe ovaries probably need to be removed by your early 40s
2362130 as both felicity and bunny carried the gene all four of you have a 50 50 chance of carrying it too you could all be negative and therefore in the clear but equally you could all have the bad luck of carrying it the most likely situation is that some of you will have it and others not
2362131 until this year there has been no hurry for you even to think about the chances even if you were found to be positive there was nothing that needed to be done or even considered until your late 30s
2362132 you can avoid having a child with the cancer gene by taking advantage of a new procedure preimplantation genetic diagnosis or pgd
2362133 he aprendido mucho a convertirme en mejor profesional y mejor hombre por mi experiencia y mi tiempo en new york
2362134 la parte m s dif cil para m es darme cuenta de que la organizaci n ya no me quer a all

2362138 its not as vulnerable now as windows is but it will be as it becomes more poplar
2362139 refers to the number of medals in events with oddly high medal counts canoeing kayaking for instance has 16 gold up for grabs in which china has traditionally performed poorly
2362140 i will ride this boat the entire way like kate winslet hell yes
2362141 holy shit your nose is dripping snot lets please for the love of all that is holy go inside
2362142 its not as vulnerable now as windows is but it will be as it becomes more poplar
2362143 its not as vulnerable now as windows is but it will be as it becomes more poplar
2362144 its one of the things which has been consistent since the 1870s tuhoes regard for their nationhood and their independence
2362145 this kind of puts the war games at urewera in a sinister new light doesnt it especially if youre going to talk about northern ireland in the same sentence
2362146 i doubt many in tuhoe would relish the idea of leaders like tame iti calling the shots
2362147 i wasnt aware that one group was able to simply opt out of our governmental system if this is the case then how and where do i do so
2362148 exactly the dreftr i think we should give them self rule it opens up the potential for other groups in nz to get self rule how about christchurch goes for self rule lower taxes lower benefits private health care itd be interesting if we could have competing systems of govt within nz and see which ones work best
2362149 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2362150 this is a glorious but also huge task for anyone
2362151 i should never let the dream of all the chinese people down that was why i was nervous
2362152 the goal of olympism is to place sport at the service of the harmonious development by associated press beijing a pro tibet group says three american activists have been detained in beijing 2000 gold medalist laura wilkinson wants to make her last olympics her best olympics
2362153 for all those reasons and the fact that georgia has demonstrated that it is a close ally we cannot simply sit by and say so be it what does south ossetia mean to us
2362154 these attacks mark a dangerous and disproportionate escalation of tension as they occur across georgia in regions far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia
2362155 we are asking our friends and the united states among them to somehow to try to mediate and try to persuade russia to stop this military aggression and invasion of georgia
2362156 its not as vulnerable now as windows is but it will be as it becomes more poplar
2362157 he thinks ralph is going to be on video and beheaded
2362158 whats more hams having problems with grace who as usual is distracted by a case and not focusing on their relationship
2362159 the murder of a highway patrolman 30 years ago so she brings the cars former owners in for questioning
2362160 were gonna be doing one thing and one thing only and thats killing nazis
2362161 this movie takes place the summer after graduation its about a girl facing love problems and living up to expectations
2362162 and she is opening a boutique for the thinnest richest people in town and she gets whatever she wants
2362163 that means gooey ballads pg rated pussycat dolls style jams self esteem raising pop anthems and splashy dance numbers
2362164 we use the food court escalators mannequins and everything else youd find in a mall as our stage
2362165 i always remember that scene in clueless when the only thing cher can do to cheer herself up is go shopping its sad but true theres nothing like finding a good deal on the right pair of shoes to make sad feelings go away
2362166 kids today buy everything and were not necessarily happier for it this movie reflects the materialism of our generation
2362167 it was mostly ad libbed with russell asking her for advice about hosting the show
2362168 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2362169 i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2362170 we wont allow the death of our compatriots to go unpunished
2362171 i tend to think if russia escalates the conflict the west wont step in militarily
2362172 but the west still has resources for increasing political and diplomatic pressure on russia
2362173 respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2362174 the conflict has potentially serious implications for russian u s relations and russian western relations
2362175 the russians are watching intently what the u s will do as an indication of how the u s will pursue its relationship with russia going forward
2362176 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2362177 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices
2362178 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2362179 and i think they need to work through that process of healing my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2362180 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2362181 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2362182 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2362183 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2362184 i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame
2362185 i ask that the public who expressed concern about the harm johns conduct has done to us think also about the real harm that the present voyeurism does and give me and my family the privacy we need at this time
2362186 to be fair the policy to release more land for building is commendable
2362187 to be fair the policy to release more land for building is commendable as is allowing kiwis to invest in soes
2362188 to be fair the policy to release more land for building is commendable
2362189 hear hear is this one of the nats key platforms too and if not why not i mean it would be nice to vote for a party offering this policy that has a hope of actually getting to put it into effect
2362190 how can the kiwi party determine new houses should cost 190 000 what an absurd statement
2362191 one of the incise wounds was associated with a skull fracture
2362192 the three areas of external injury corresponded to two internally one to the back of the head nicked and fractured the skull the knife went through leaving a knife tip inside the skull
2362193 thats usually associated with trauma to the chest or organs within the chest meaning the heart and lungs
2362194 but a penetrating trauma could enter the neck on one side and move through to the chest on the other
2362195 the swab from the computer chair had a mixture of two individuals
2362196 as i was explaining he cut me off and said he planned to plead guilty
2362197 more or less he believed he was justified through god in killing a homosexual man
2362198 it just happened to be the one i bumped into
2362199 he said killing him was my belief of god judging him
2362200 he did say more than once he was sacrificing the body
2362201 he made it a point to tell me he wasnt a homosexual
2362202 i asked him if killing him was like stomping on a bug
2362203 he looked at me kind of confused and i rephrased like swatting a mosquito
2362204 de eu schiet haar doel voorbij het eurotarief lijkt transparant maar in de praktijk blijven de werkelijke kosten onduidelijk voor de gebruiker
2362205 if nothing else with four children i should probably play the lottery
2362206 its not my job i didnt say it in an ugly tone of voice
2362207 i was already freaked out because she was accusing me of stuff i didnt do
2362208 you dont go to jail because you like different restaurants do you
2362209 i think it has fight of the year written all over it this thing could end up running away with a bunch of different awards i swear to god if you look at all of the fights weve had this year ive been talking about huerta florian for a long expletive time
2362210 i think its going to be a hell of a fight
2362211 two aggressive fighters are going to go at each other and im looking forward to it i think its going to be a great fight for the fans of course i think im going to come out victorious and im hoping for a tough fight
2362212 i needed to take time off of everything from the fight game from the ufc from doing all the pr from doing all the fights
2362213 i was nonstop training and i didnt have time for myself or family im only 25 years old and i just needed time to heal
2362214 im going to have to go in there with a game plan myself now
2362215 thats one of the things i was able to do stepping back ive just been sitting back and watching and learning from everybody ive been learning a lot from st pierre hes a good friend of mine and ive been watching him
2362216 my friends we live in the greatest nation in the history of the world i hope youll join with me as we try to change it
2362217 it is not how old you are but how you are old
2362218 counsel woven into the fabric of real life is wisdom
2362219 think wrongly if you please but in all cases think for yourself
2362220 dickinsons experience or what we know of it has been so thoroughly archived interpreted and reimagined in every genre that a contemporary scholar needs a good excuse to exhume the picked over bones in rehabilitating higginson dispatching the caricature of a tin eared pedant wineapple finds one and through him brings dickinson into focus for a new generation

2362222 let us give thanks for our state dessert boston cream pie
2362223 as soon as they get the idea theyre in for a soothing bubble bath
2362224 i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2362225 you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2362226 i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2362227 i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby
2362228 somebody asked the question is the playhouse going to go on
2362229 if its summer the playhouse is here we dont think about it too hard we just do
2362230 when one of us goes down we come together as a family
2362231 and theres a larger family of the community and the actors and helping hands
2362232 part of our strategic planning was holly would probably put butts in seats by starring in the fifth show
2362233 she is the face of the playhouse so it does bring people in when shes in a show
2362234 we were thinking we would have to have another actress come in for the show
2362235 it was touch and go for a while because of her illness
2362236 i was hoping the rigors of the show and life here what we do here wouldnt impact her too negatively because were out in the open in the heat and its a lot of work
2362237 i sent her an e mail saying please dont jeopardize your health well find someone else but she wanted to do it and now im glad she did
2362238 in my mind im not sure its the best thing for hollys health to be in this play
2362239 but i understand it was conceived for her to star in it and i think she feels its a good thing for her to be doing it
2362240 its been fun for me because i came in fresh since i havent been stressed all summer theres stress but now i just step back and let robby deal with it
2362241 even though we didnt have holly we sort of had a dream team of actors and directors and designers
2362242 everyone had been here before and knew what to do
2362243 dont feel sorry for me feel sorry for the cancer cells
2362244 i found out what cancer hates and i torture it it hates heat it hates oxygen it hates alkalinity it hates a great diet it hates happiness it hates all those things
2362245 as my diet improves my mood actually lifts i have never felt better
2362246 obviously we have a little bit of a lead on columbus but we were stacked up early in the season
2362247 we played quite a few games we knew that and had to get some points while we could
2362248 its not something were relying on we need to get back into the swing and get winning league games thats the bread and butter its the thing that gets you all the other benefits
2362249 obviously tuesday was a real high for everybody real excitement but saturday is back to your bread and butter we have to make sure we close on the ball in the right areas of the field if we stand off them and let them play then certainly theyll hurt us so we have to be smart
2362250 the bottom line is if you want a guy between the posts hes the guy you want
2362251 blanco has great passing ability to the open man and rolfe makes great runs going forward
2362252 they have a strong defense and busch is having an amazing year so top to bottom theyre a solid team

2362257 china thief leave our country stop killing in tibet stop the cultural genocide
2362258 the bottom line is its fun to be bad on screen
2362259 theres a kind of deliciousness to playing a character who is not bound by the same rules that the rest of us have to live with its fun to play and its certainly fun to write
2362260 a lot more gray in fact theyre sometimes more relatable than the heroes because everyones flawed really we live in a morally gray time so the whole idea of whos good and whos corrupt is really blending we can no longer see things as black and white
2362261 its not black and white anymore this movie flips the script instead of the pretty cheerleader being the victim shes the unexpected villain
2362262 television movies music and interactive games are powerful learning tools and highly influential media the average american child spends as much as 28 hours a week watching television and typically at least an hour a day playing video games or surfing the internet several more hours each week are spent watching movies and videos and listening to music these media can and often are used to instruct encourage and even inspire but when these entertainment media showcase violence particularly in a context which glamorizes or trivializes it the lessons learned can be destructive
2362263 children begin to notice and react to television very early
2362264 media function as a superpeer replacing the role once played by a social circle of friends and family modeling and encouraging ways of thinking and behaving
2362265 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2362266 we deplore the russian military action in georgia which is a violation of georgian sovereignty and territorial integrity
2362267 the build up of forces was more than expected and they moved earlier than we thought they would
2362268 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2362269 what is clear is that russia has invaded georgias sovereignty has encroached on georgias sovereignty and it is very important for us to resolve this issue as quickly as possible
2362270 homeschooling was initially expressly permitted in california when the compulsory education law was enacted in 1903
2362271 in 1929 however homeschool was amended out of the law and children who were not educated in public or private schools could be taught privately only by a credentialed tutor
2362272 subsequent developments in the law call this conclusion into question although the legislature did not amend the statutory scheme so as to expressly permit homeschooling more recent enactments demonstrate an apparent acceptance by the legislature of the proposition that homeschooling is taking place in california with homeschools allowed as private schools
2362273 recent statutes indicate that the legislature is aware that some parents in california homeschool their children by declaring their homes to be private schools moreover several statutory enactments indicate a legislative approval of homeschooling by exempting homeschools from requirements otherwise applicable to private schools
2362274 it is our view that the proper course of action is to interpret the earlier statutes in light of the later ones and to recognize as controlling the legislatures apparent acceptance of the proposition that homeschools are permissible in california when conducted as a private school
2362275 shall make a further order authorizing and directing that reasonable expenses medical or otherwise and including reimbursement to a parent guardian or conservator costs and attorneys fees as the court shall approve and allow therein shall be paid from the money or other property to be paid or delivered for the benefit of the minor
2362276 this limitation does not mean as attorney contends that an attorney is presumptively entitled to a 25 percent fee without a showing of good cause although the parties entered a contingency fee agreement providing that attorney was entitled to more than 25 percent the court was not bound by that agreement in determining the reasonable fees to be awarded
2362277 i n all cases the award of an attorneys fees remains in the sole discretion of the court
2362278 n othing in this section indicates that a trial court cannot calculate attorney fees as a percentage of the net amount to be paid to the minor after deductions have been made for expenses and costs
2362279 i get incredible paranoid delusional thoughts at times and theres nothing i can do until they go away either by themselves or with drugs
2362280 animals and birds are lucky they dont keep acquiring things the way men do you can teach a monkey to drive a motorcycle but i have never known a monkey to go out and buy a motorcycle

2362284 es que no tengo tiempo en todo el d a
2362285 why go on when we both know this isnt working out
2362286 for all those reasons and the fact that georgia has demonstrated that it is a close ally we cannot simply sit by and say so be it what does south ossetia mean to us
2362287 we are asking our friends and the united states among them to somehow to try to mediate and try to persuade russia to stop this military aggression and invasion of georgia
2362288 an apple is an excellent thing until you have tried a peach
2362289 of course she does but she also knows me and
2362290 looking at recent media coverage of sen barack obama its hard not to be a bit amused at the contortions reporters have gone through to portray the democratic presidential candidate in a negative light news organizations that know sen john mccains campaign is lying about obama adopt those lies as the framework for their coverage reports on campaign polling obsess over obamas inability to garner the support of more than 50 percent of the public all the while mccain struggles to stay above 40 and increasingly reporters and pundits have taken to describing obamas seemingly positive qualities as fraught with electoral peril
2362291 employs a team of stretchers and coaches and nutritionists who cost her tens of thousands of dollars but have played pivotal roles in getting her back to the olympics
2362292 im not saying its a racial issue but come on
2362293 im not saying its a racial issue but i am by concentrating the whole tone of the article on race
2362294 i think its just a matter of arithmetic unless theres some other source of funds from the commonwealth or the tooth fairy theres going to be a toll increase
2362295 as a part of that effort i have called a meeting of masshighway and the three transportation independent agencies the turnpike mbta and massport for monday
2362296 i plan to discuss how we can collectively tackle the challenges we are facing through cost savings efficiencies and reforms with the goal of preventing further burdens being placed on consumers
2362297 there is a direct correlation between how people perceive the economy and the importance they place on the environment when times are tough people resent paying more to salve their conscience
2362298 planes rockets cluster and phosphorus bombs for israel to use at will
2362299 many non militant arabs and muslims await some degree of fairness from you if you are elected
2362300 cannot comprehend how many jewish people can speak of the holocaust as well as stating that israel is the holy land and commit the atrocities they are committing against the palestinian people
2362301 shed ourselves from the racist zionists in america they control everything but they wont keep us down any longer throw the jews in the oven this november its the only way we can free america and make sure barack obama is elected
2362302 israel has destroyed its own image in the world and is taking america down with its zionist aggression
2362303 senator collins is one of the leading animal advocates in congress and has consistently fought for public policies to halt cruelty and abuse
2362304 in order to pass humane laws we need humane lawmakers like senator collins maine voters who care about animal welfare should support her reelection
2362305 well there is grain here she points to the grain bins and theres hay in the barns and theres access to water she points to the spickets so there is nothing we can do because there is an intent to feed these horses
2362306 pray tell how china amp russia can do this when there access to the internet is heavily censored
2362307 well if they have russian passports then they know where to move to georgia has every right to evict them out of their sovereign lands neil frankfurt germany 08 8 2008 11 54
2362308 that obama he thinks hes so cool with the millions of screaming fans the rock star status standing up there giving speeches like hes john kennedy and he has that funny name and big ears those popular kids have it so easy well ill show him ill make it big my mom says im special and i have this cool clubhouse that i built in moms basement
2362309 everybody has known about this forever with conventional locks like kwikset
2362310 but high security locks advertise that they have key control especially medeco
2362311 so weve demonstrated the ability to simply make keys for this particular high security lock
2362312 we didnt have to break the cylinder we were able to look at pictures that were e mailed to us and determine the angles on the key
2362313 the idea is to take a more sophisticated approach by not pandering to the audience
2362314 were not trying to reach everybody who could possibly be interested we will make it for fans of this type of music
2362315 music programming was never a big driver for vh1 it was about relationships cool content and doing a lot for brand
2362316 were looking at ratings as a longer term goal its more about the vibe and branding
2362317 what were after is the independent consumer and if they go to
2362318 evil be he or she who thinks evil of it
2362319 with cloud computer looming on the horizon it is important for us all to think of the privacy threats there as well
2362320 the tool resides with someone else and the data is stored somewhere else generally that is a bad idea
2362321 when information is in the public domain it is game over
2362322 information on your computer may get protection under the law but on someone elses it gets less protection
2362323 the information we are all giving to online companies is massive and dangerous and its going to get worse before it gets better
2362324 giving them our data is a clear and present risk
2362325 how hard would it be to target someone as a political activist or a person with aids
2362326 is pushing the north south relations to a graver stage
2362327 i didnt serve very well in the third set the balls are pretty slow so it was difficult for my game
2362328 it was perfect for him because he was playing very simple tennis
2362329 i made a couple of mistakes and he started to feel much more comfortable on the court my momentum was gone
2362330 its just great to keep winning im living a dream and im now in the top 20
2362331 i hope i can keep this up against mardy tomorrow
2362332 happiness off court translates to a clear mind on court and thats the case for me
2362333 now that facebook despite trying hard has not been successful in the german market the company seeks to obstruct studivz through court action
2362334 we know that in any of our programs theres always a potential for fraud
2362335 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the
2362336 this is a glorious but also huge task for anyone
2362337 i should never let the dream of all the chinese people down that was why i was nervous
2362338 every time i must balance myself in the air and hold the torch as close to the cauldron gas outlet but every time the wind blew in different directions
2362339 means china is standing side by side with the rest of the world
2362340 when i hit my driver like i did today this is an easy sport
2362341 its the kind of round ive been looking for to get myself back on the leaderboard and feeling the good vibes
2362342 when i got here on tuesday i called home and i said this is the hardest golf course ive ever played
2362343 if i were to play here every day i dont know if i would enjoy it its a very difficult golf course
2362344 im not that aggressive if im not hitting my driver good
2362345 if im hitting bad shots with it you dont hit it as much you hit it right where youve looked whale away
2362346 if youre hitting where youre aiming it every time youre hitting good
2362347 my senior year of high school i went out and watched tiger
2362348 a lot of the players they said hit the ball really long
2362349 its just a matter of taking care of the opportunities that im given theres weeks where you can play your best and not win and theres weeks where you can kind of stumble your way in and win
2362350 unfortunately things didnt happen for me on the back nine its very difficult and this is a major
2362351 theres a lot of golf left out here and the golf course is very difficult
2362352 so i think that it wont be overly difficult if you play well to make up some ground
2362353 ive learned a lot become a better professional and a better man because of my experience and my i dont regret or feel ashamed about anything that happened to me in my time in new york
2362354 the most difficult part is just the realization that the organization no longer wants you
2362355 you spend eight years there and in the blink of an eye youre no longer wanted there
2362356 junior guard patrick beverley will not compete for the razorbacks in the 2008 09 basketball season
2362357 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
2362358 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
2362359 i dont think too many people question that i think a lot of people question what happened this offseason
2362360 you see teams go out in free agency and spend on a lot of guys and everyone says oh theyre going to be great and go to the
2362361 i cannot tell you where the tree is going to be for obvious reasons because itll be stripped bare in about 30 seconds
2362362 if you had picked a number higher you wouldve gotten more money on your metrocard
2362363 you win the super bowl and i promise you will get a key
2362364 the future is now i dont have 17 more years to play i dont think i want to give the and the people of this city the best year possible believe me
2362365 he still has the utmost amount of respect from the guys in this locker room here and we wish him well wish him a good season and hope to see him in tampa
2362366 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2362367 it is good to have him here when you play with a legend you cant help but feed off of it i think hell fit right in with both the team and the city
2362368 we are happy to announce that we will match their offer sheet

2362375 what is going to happen here with these loving caring tender people will change the world
2362376 i have found especially in the young people i am working with an exuberance and joy that abounds in everything they do these are extremely happy individuals who love and treat one another and others with the utmost respect kindness and dignity i have to say it is very refreshing
2362377 unfortunately i think its going to be pushed off till early 2009
2362378 but the next two quarters are probably going to be weak
2362379 home prices have gone down more rapidly than people anticipated
2362380 armani jeans expresses my vision of a young independent casual lifestyle with a strong and cool fashion sensibility
2362381 solange epitomizes this style perfectly and brings to it that swing so evident in her new single i decided
2362382 they said i only have 15 minutes so im a rock out for 15 minutes
2362383 as the working and middle class families of upstate new york continue to be devastated by skyrocketing property taxes the increasingly burdensome cost of day to day living and a lack of sustainable good paying jobs republicans joe robach and jim alesi are participating while on the public dime in a special session of the state senate that has served as nothing more than a political public relations gimmick meant to bolster a fading republican senate majority
2362384 republicans robach and alesi have flip flopped on putting a stop to unfunded mandates have sidestepped a real solution to the property tax crisis facing new yorkers and have cut and run without addressing the need for a circuit breaker the time for excuses is over we need real leadership in albany that will get the job done
2362385 everyone knows that we need a solution to property taxes but governor patersons tax cap is not the answer in california massachusetts and illinois tax caps had a devastating impact on education many students were left with overcrowded classes less teachers and cuts in programs and governor patersons plan wont even cut our property taxes today most senate democrats voted no on hurting our schools and stood up in support of actual property tax reductions for homeowners
2362386 the senate made the wrong choice today in siding with governor paterson on his tax cap plan that will badly hurt school children without cutting taxes thankfully a majority of senate and assembly democrats and leaders like speaker sheldon silver are standing up for our public schools and for real property tax relief the assemblys supports full funding for our schools and providing real relief to middle class families and seniors who need it most

2362490 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years
2362491 gary ive continued to enjoy reading kvm throughout the campaign youd make a great reporter and please dont take that as an insult
2362492 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
2362493 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
2362494 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
2362495 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
2362496 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
2362497 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
2362498 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
2362499 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
2362500 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same
2362501 the most creative symbiosis of all was the broadway ballad played by jazz musicians

2362507 we try to interact with the kids teaching classes mentoring and helping families
2362508 the students here are the future of this city and we want to build relationships with them
2362509 but i will never get to the stage of wanting to lead the nation standing in front of the mirror each morning clipping the eyebrows here and clipping the eyebrows there with janette and the kids its like spot the eyebrows
2362510 what we have got is a dead carcass swinging in the breeze but nobody will cut it down to replace him
2362511 the thing about poor old costello is he is all tip and no iceberg he can throw a punch across the parliament but the bloke he should be throwing a punch to is howard but of course he doesnt have the ticker for it
2362512 he has now been treasurer for 11 years the old coconut is still there araldited to the seat the treasurer works on the smart quips but when it comes to staring down the prime minister in his office he always leaves disappointed he never gets the sword out
2362513 hes a guy without imagination and he is a guy without courage in national terms to have such a nong and he is in policy terms he is a mouse to have him back again speaks volumes about the liberal party
2362514 youre not getting 110 per cent you can forget it this is a f cking boulevard hotel special this is the trouble is we are dealing with a sports junkie here gesturing towards bob hawke i go out for a p ss and they pull this one on me well thats the last time i leave you two alone from now on im sticking to you two like sh t to a blanket
2362515 i suppose that the honourable gentlemans hair like his intellect will recede into the darkness
2362516 were not interested in the views of painted perfumed gigolos
2362517 the brain damaged honorable member for bruce made his first parliamentary contribution since being elected by calling a quorum to silence me for three minutes
2362518 that you jim paul keating here just because you swallowed a f cking dictionary when you were about 15 doesnt give you the right to pour a bucket of sh t over the rest of us
2362519 you richard carleton had an important place in australian society on the abc and you gave it up to be a pop star with a big cheque and now youre on to this sort of stuff that shows what a 24 carat pissant you are richard thats for sure

2362525 there is a lot of free land she said why do they have to build the tower in a residential area i will be here for a short time but there are locals living in the area
2362526 according to international guidelines these towers should be built 300 metres away from residential properties and it is not recommended that they erect it an area where there are young children i think its appalling that an international company like digicel would do it here in fiji
2362527 they might say that there is no proof that it affects health but it is the unknown
2362528 who knows maybe in ten years time they will say that it was a cause for cancer

2362530 im used as cannon fodder they said send the old bugger out there first and see what happens
2362531 it would be stupid for me to take a banned substance just before the games
2362532 the sportworld fun run in conjunction with flour mills of fiji began at 6am today
2362533 money collected will be given to the st john ambulance because they will provide medical assistance throughout the festival
2362534 with cloud computer looming on the horizon it is important for us all to think of the privacy threats there as well
2362535 the tool resides with someone else and the data is stored somewhere else generally that is a bad idea
2362536 when information is in the public domain it is game over
2362537 information on your computer may get protection under the law but on someone elses it gets less protection
2362538 the information we are all giving to online companies is massive and dangerous and its going to get worse before it gets better
2362539 giving them our data is a clear and present risk
2362540 how hard would it be to target someone as a political activist or a person with
2362541 this is heresy but one day google will die what happens to data when a company dies is a big question

2362568 loop squared around too soon and cesar broke too soon

2362580 thats as close as you can get to the playoffs
2362581 all of last year was so miserable that blowout losses happened a lot more than everyone thinks
2362582 just to go out there and playing the world champs and getting the first win is huge to get that confidence
2362583 so to shut this lineup down its different without the traded manny ramirez but its one of the best in the league
2362584 the bottom line is we have to take care of our own business and we have to win games
2362585 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen

2362665 m asturbation can be used to relieve tension and frustration studies have shown that the incidence of masturbation greatly increases among college students just before final exams
2362666 sexual expression can be taken out of the context of life no need for another human or any relationship but sexual gratification is so essential for healthy living that one cannot live if life does not include sexual gratification
2362667 the sexual body does not exist apart from the body that eats and drinks bathes and dresses rests and exercises and works sexual desire does not exist in isolation from other desires
2362668 prayerfully consider this fact of creation god created you as a spiritual and sexual person spirituality enriches our sexuality and sexuality doesnt exist in a vacuum isolated from the rest of our being
2362669 charles williamss masterpiece descent into hell shockingly images one mans fall when he elects to love himself in exclusion to the more troublesome and time consuming flesh and blood woman in her place he takes to himself a succubus and occult term for an imaginary woman this is in actuality the practice of masturbation with an accompanying fantasy life
2362670 it is impossible to separate our sexuality from our being sex isnt just something we do with our sex organs our sexuality is something we are it is part of our essence it flows through the whole of our being because of this you cannot isolate sex and make it just something you do yet masturbation says that by keeping things strictly genital you can have sex with yourself and not have it affect who you are
2362671 many christian ethicists are moving away from either wholesale rejection or enthusiastic acceptance of the practice of masturbation they favor instead a position of qualified acceptance based on a differentiation of several types of masturbation
2362672 you have heard that it was said do not commit adultery but i tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart
2362673 the man who is enslaved to masturbation wont give his wife her sexual rights
2362674 two anthropological themes stand at the heart of gen 1 26 27 first the creation of human kind in the divine image and second the creation of humans as male and female that is as sexually differentiated and hence relational creatures
2362675 ill speak kindly to you as long as you speak kindly to me ill have sex with you as long as you meet all of my emotional needs
2362676 as sexual beings humans are fundamentally incomplete in themselves human sexuality not only participates in this incompleteness but also spurs individuals to seek community through relationships the ultimate goal of sexuality and hence of the impulse toward bonding is participation in the fullness of community namely life together as the new humanity as the eschatological people in relationship with god and all creation
2362677 according to former u s surgeon general joycelyn elders masturbation could be the answer to the social problems brought on by unwed mothers and the deadly aids virus after all wouldnt it be better for guys to relieve themselves rather than go out and rape someone or impregnate someone or get a sexually transmitted disease is it only inhibited people who cant accept masturbation as a normal part of healthy sexuality

2362709 you have been made a prophet only to restore peace in the world
2362710 this is an opportunity to spend quality time together creating a craft of love
2362711 just kidding we want to get crazy and push our bad ass craft off a 30 foot drop
2362712 i believe its best that he kept his head dont you
2362713 thats a good kind of person to have on hand when youre launching 30 feet above the water on a craft made of plastic bricks
2362714 hes a man with a plan got a counterfeit dollar in his hand hes misstra know it all
2362715 hes a man with a plan got a counterfeit dollar in his hand hes misstra know it all
2362716 has speed like no other viking has possessed in recent memory
2362717 messages queued for submission is the current number of submitted messages which are not yet processed by transport
2362718 there is considerable marketplace interest in the gametap business and brand
2362719 we are considering various strategic options but have reached no final agreement as yet when there is a resolution we will announce it
2362720 they didnt mind in fact they even threw a party
2362721 hmmm a fourth grader writing a murder mystery clearly based on students in the class dying thats odd
2362722 things were low before this but whats happened has been like a kick in the guts
2362723 certainly the company needed changing but the attitude has been there is a crisis and costs need to be cut
2362724 qantas employees have been placed second third or even fourth compared with shareholder interests
2362725 thats when they listen to you they dont listen to people who are nice to them they keep being told things are bad but then the company does well
2362726 people can only take so much they have to accept cuts work with less people and that doesnt appear to happen at the top
2362727 we begged them not to do it in perth because that airport has serious difficulties
2362728 when it was introduced in sydney airport last week it became a pr disaster they skimp at how they train people and they are always in a hurry to save a buck
2362729 airport rostering is based on no plane being late as a result people can wait more than an hour for their luggage because there are not enough crews rostered or people do not want to work more than a minute of overtime
2362730 the other day qantas put out a press release saying 20 per cent of support staff will be cut well from where
2362731 our guys feel they have been let down by management because its hard to do your jobs when spare parts have been sold off and people are not being trained
2362732 when there are such low staff numbers people cant do their jobs thoroughly
2362733 problems used to occur and they would not attract publicity
2362734 management has started to become accountable for the very poor decisions they have made over recent years
2362735 its comparable to your car the older the car the more time maintenance and effort it is to keep it running as well as it ever has
2362736 there is nothing to say it cant but they are costlier to run in terms of fuel they burn and to maintain
2362737 it is one of the reasons why jetstar has had the success it has it has a new fleet you dont start to run up those maintenance costs until two or three years into the life of an aircraft
2362738 the tensions described by these professors were seen by task force members as typical of many campuses where interest in criminal justice is taking off
2362739 god and objectivism a critique of objectivist philosophy of religion
2362740 she was sort of disturbing other spectators around her which is against the house rules
2362741 he loved the game his fans his friends and most of all his family
2362742 he is lost but not gone he will be missed but not forgotten
2362743 there will be a moment of silence for him tuesday night at the all star game then one last time they will cheer bobby murcer big at yankee stadium the biggest place the kid from oklahoma ever saw this time to the heavens
2362744 they are saying it was actually the eighth second of the eighth minute after eight oclock but i didnt follow that closely
2362745 we have six weddings and thats quite unusual for a friday
2362746 when my fianc proposed he chose 08 08 08 because he thought it would be nice for my family
2362747 when a customer sees a home the numbers can make a big first impression
2362748 im completely in favor of the separation of church and state my idea is that these two institutions screw us up enough on their own so both of them together is certain death
2362749 this is my life and i dont give a damn
2362750 i just want people to know nothing is going to happen right away
2362751 at the optimum things wont be ready until september 2011
2362752 this preliminary schedule was developed just working around a june 2009 referendum date that you informed me of
2362753 i would propose that this is a lengthy schedule and some of the individual line items may possibly be reduced in time frame or accelerated
2362754 its not to early to ask people who want to get involved to contact us
2362755 is the only way to promote a culture of life
2362756 to think you have done a generous thing for your neighbor or that you have built up a culture of life just because you voted for a candidate who says in his brochure that he wants to overturn roe v wade is far too thin an understanding of the catholic faith
2362757 therell have to be a full moon and some bizarre turnaround for this to become a political contest
2362758 we explored options on checks for two b 737 400 aircraft once space became available at our tullamarine facility a decision was taken to have the work done there
2362759 now is the time qantas should sit down with us to commit now to maintaining maintenance operations onshore
2362760 and to move off the path of cost cutting and any further possibilities of further job reductions in their maintenance and engineering area
2362761 all the highlights were rectified to the satisfaction of the qantas team before aircraft delivery to australia
2362762 were at the point where were saying thank god 80 per cent of them are using an illegal drug rather than alcohol even though in 10 years theyll be suffering manic depressive disorders
2362763 but we just couldnt deal with that many people affected by alcohol
2362764 it is embarrassing weve sworn an oath to do certain things and were not being given the resources to achieve that
2362765 its deemed more acceptable than in the city because the valleys the alternative scene and always has been
2362766 when certain people drink it brings out more of a violent tendency often leading to problems
2362767 young men especially can become aggressive on alcohol and get involved in fights and assaults
2362768 the really common things that we see at the royal brisbane and womens hospital are head injuries where theyve fallen over and hit their heads and we see lots of people with broken hands after hitting people
2362769 it really is very frustrating from a medical perspective because it chews up our resources if people didnt drink we wouldnt see anywhere near as many patients as we do
2362770 the big thing a lot of us feel is that one of the most dangerous and insidious things about e ecstasy is that most young people think its not hurting them but every time they use it its hurting them a little
2362771 we deal with them all the time these kids who are now 30 or 40 who are suffering serious mental health problems as a result of their drug use in their 20s often it ends in suicide
2362772 i want to cancel i want to cancel i just want to cancel
2362773 you are lucky you guys are the only ones we can afford at the moment
2362774 we do not offer tech support on equipment not purchased from us
2362775 carry philosophical and theological meanings that are getting increasingly muddled and could become more so if it were applied even more broadly
2362776 cannot be denied to particular groups on the ground that these groups have historically been denied those rights
2362777 to make its case for a constitutional violation the majority distorts and diminishes the historic achievements
2362778 the people should be given a fair chance to set the pace of change without judicial interference
2362779 if there is to be a new understanding of the meaning of marriage in california it should develop among the people of our state and find its expression at the ballot box
2362780 obama has proposed a timetable to withdraw most u s forces from iraq within 16 months of his taking office mccain has opposed a specific timetable and said events should dictate when troops are withdrawn which approach do you prefer a timetable or no timetable
2362781 we have every intention of telling the life stories of obama and mccain but at a time when readers are most focused on the election and the same goes for exploring the issues that are driving this campaign
2362782 more candid personal artistic and flattering there were few artistic photos of mccain most were traditional campaign shots one exception was a shot of mccain speaking with the yellow glow of an ornate chandelier in the background
2362783 the disparity in the numbers is indeed hard to reconcile as photojournalists we always strive to be fair we have tried to be balanced but it seems that in a large operation such as ours we need to monitor the use of political images even more closely
2362784 reflects that obama is new to the scene and has had more events that had more visual impact obamas campaign is better at putting him in situations that mean better photos
2362785 it was a grand celebration with many people attending a big crowd but there was nothing in the post about it a couple of days later there was a little picture of three people i think this is an oversight
2362786 should have been covered absolutely it was the biggest celebration in decades for the local jewish community
2362787 a sincere effort was made to cover the event but it didnt work the way i would have liked
2362788 this is only the fifth medal of honor awarded thus far as a result of combat action in our nations two theaters of action iraq and afghanistan thus it is and rightly should be a big story and worthy of significant coverage in the washington post
2362789 our extensive coverage of pfc mcginniss heroism was a factor
2362790 given that kids today are ignorant today of history geography and most other things and that the wwii memorial just opened recently i cant understand why the post had nothing to commemorate that event
2362791 amazed to see that summer doldrums was reported to be the winner that horse did not run on saturday june 21 2008 he did win the race in a previous year i was at the race on saturday and i can attest to the fact that that horse did not run on saturday however how could such a mistake have been made
2362792 from last years story which was still in my laptop to the e mail when i filed the slugs were nearly identical i deeply regret what happened and have been embarrassed by it it was an accident and a mistake
2362793 this is in regards to his column this past sunday winds that made a journey anything but a breeze in particular this line as anyone who has lived in the united states the last eight years knows a rudderless ship is not so good
2362794 can we give it a rest please we get it already everyone at president bush is there a reason this kind of nonsense has to spill over into the sports section i dont deny mr phillipss right to write whatever he pleases in his column please keep partisan politics out of the sports section
2362795 alexandria va obamas new ad which plays a lot in alexandria shows pictures of his mother and grandparents playing up his white family until now hes been african american now suddenly hes a white midwesterner during the primary hillary was criticized for changing her image too many times wont obama be criticized for doing the same thing
2362796 i havent heard that criticism but it is striking not a single picture of his father now that really is consistent with his upbringing he really did not become immersed in black american culture until he left college and went to chicago the great irony is that he is much more white than black beyond skin color
2362797 im simply blown away by this display of ignorance please let mr weisman know that black culture is the all encompassing experience of being black there is not just one kind of black culture as black america is neither monolithic nor single minded if obama is more white beyond skin color i entreat mr weisman to delineate precisely what he means is he suggesting there is white behavior and black behavior or white thought and black thought
2362798 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2362799 in his closed door meeting with house democrats tuesday night presumptive democratic nominee barack obama delivered a real zinger according to a witness suggesting that he was beginning to believe his own hype
2362800 obama was waxing lyrical about last weeks trip to europe when he concluded according to the meeting attendee this is the moment as nancy pelosi noted that the world is waiting for the 200 000 souls who thronged to his speech in berlin came not just for him he told the enthralled audience of congressional representatives i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions he said according to the source
2362801 an understanding going back years that he is giving me privileged information from closed meetings it is by definition on background with someone you interact with constantly there just arent the formalities of sourcing on every conversation and e mail
2362802 unimpeachable when he gives you a quote you can take it to the bank you dont need to go around verifying it with others
2362803 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2362804 what to do with all of the great stuff you bought at the farmers market
2362805 the idea is to take a more sophisticated approach by not pandering to the audience
2362806 were not trying to reach everybody who could possibly be interested we will make it for fans of this type of music
2362807 music programming was never a big driver for vh1 it was about relationships cool content and doing a lot for brand
2362808 were looking at ratings as a longer term goal its more about the vibe and branding
2362809 what were after is the independent consumer and if they go to
2362810 people are now coming around to the fact that growth is slowing both in the u s and overseas so demand for commodities will decline
2362811 everybody is scrambling to get out of the ship before the guy next to them
2362812 its amazing how fast commodities have become the last place people want to have their money
2362813 it looks like the bulls have run out of ammo
2362814 with poor demand prospects ahead theres not a lot of reason to be buying commodities right now
2362815 the change in direction is not just about obama its also about hillary
2362816 shes become a far more appealing candidate to a far broader range of voters
2362817 now she offers a message and an argument that you need a fighter like her to undo all the damage the republicans have done
2362818 the small places places people dont normally get to at election time
2362819 and it sets up a nice contrast with clinton because of the position she has taken and ultimately with the straight talker himself
2362820 the say anything do anything style of politics that has become the habit in washington
2362821 shes got the kitchen sink flying the china flying the buffet is coming at me
2362822 i dont know how many of you have a lobbyist in washington
2362823 but the one thing theyve done a good job at and in many ways hillary deserves credit for this is portraying her as a fighter
2362824 the one national leader who can bring our country together and begin to change the future
2362825 we are reviewing the menu items for a motive a personal dispute previous crimes gang activity
2362826 right now people in the community saw heard or know something about this case we need to talk to them so we can get a murderer off the street
2362827 we felt like they were making a good faith effort to pay the money
2362828 board members have to understand they are running a business not playing school
2362829 this clearly vindicates what we said back then that the school was a mess it still is
2362830 we were in such trouble and the state was threatening to close us down
2362831 there were suspicions that shady things were going on he portrayed himself as independently wealthy so it didnt seem like he would need it
2362832 we were the ones who see these kids every day so we thought why would you bring this out in front of us
2362833 the conclusion we came to was that joel believes his own lies
2362834 if they can get connected to ninth graders early on the research shows they do so much better
2362835 if you start bombing out in ninth grade it lowers your gpa and affects your choices later on
2362836 we want them to be able to glide from eight to ninth grade and make it instead of jumping and falling through the cracks
2362837 this equity framework is important to ensure that no matter what zip code youre in your kids will have access to high level courses
2362838 eventually that will be you and well be talking about where you went to school
2362839 no that isnt the focus of our story im not going to debate our story with you we are focusing on the deplorable care that detainees receive
2362840 detainees have less access to lawyers than convicted murderers in maximum security prisons and some have fewer comforts than al qaeda terrorism suspects held at guantanamo bay cuba
2362841 about 33 000 people are crammed into these overcrowded compounds on a given day waiting to be deported or for a judge to let them stay here
2362842 some compounds never allow detainees outdoor recreation others let them out onto tiny dirt patches once or twice a week
2362843 we have to operate on whats going on when we get there
2362844 law enforcement should have been enforcing a law that says you should not be harassed
2362845 it has never been our policy to ask nursing mothers to leave our restaurant i have taken the necessary steps to ensure this mistake does not happen again
2362846 this is a young woman who is taking really good care of her baby and now she is being penalized
2362847 we had other programming commitments and respect for other audiences so we cant keep all the people happy all the time
2362848 the ratings results from thursday for make me a supermodel and the soccer show the decision was vindicated
2362849 he gave a prized car a ferrari with his racing number 82 on it to a long time pal
2362850 the sudden move angered his children its especially hard for them to come to grips with whats going on
2362851 the word theyve been given is that he has only a few weeks to live
2362852 i dont think race played a role in the chiefs decision
2362853 i have the experience and tenure to be qualified its a great opportunity and im excited about it
2362854 its much more cooperative and we actually get more work done than during the monthly meeting
2362855 i expect any good relationships will carry over to my new assignment
2362856 i think he will be a good man for the job
2362857 the police community relations council has a good feeling about him
2362858 he gets the community piece of the job and thats critical
2362859 that person doesnt get the importance of diversity and hasnt gone out into the community and worked on making those connections
2362860 i know residents tell me how much they love him when he is at community meetings
2362861 it will be a loss for them but he will have a bigger impact in his new job
2362862 it is because my last name is tibetan and i am tibetan
2362863 i had a feeling they would be waiting for me
2362864 she took a lot of risk thats how brave tibetans are
2362865 this is the responsibility i was born to people in tibet are risking everything i have to do the same
2362866 i just had to go there to see their claims
2362867 but i wish i was in tibet with my relatives
2362868 never trust a computer you cant throw out a window
2362869 data source localhost initial catalog database persist security info true user id user password pwd
2362870 old school local journalism relevance and relationship are at its core
2362871 part of a new strategy you really hear from readers about whats important in their lives that new traffic light a mile away is something that affects them on a daily basis
2362872 the whole goal of the site is to appeal to people in loudoun its affecting people in their own back yard
2362873 from a news standpoint loudounextra com has certainly enhanced the print sides presence on the web and increased the amount of coverage for loudoun county
2362874 it is more bringing the site to people rather than bringing the people to the site
2362875 were quite pleased by the awareness of the nine month old site in the community
2362876 but introducing a new site to a community is not a simple exercise it will take some time to figure out what is resonating with both users and advertisers and whats not its really hard to evaluate this on a stand alone basis right now
2362877 about 60 percent of the sites advertisers had never done post print ads before
2362878 in my mind there is an opportunity to bring on new advertising from small and medium sized businesses who could not afford it otherwise as well a new way to reach the community were doing quite well by that metric
2362879 im an active mom hyperactive in local events and politics and i can get a quick snapshot and its more up to date than the print edition or the other local newspapers i can get in and out quickly without going through pages of newspaper
2362880 i go there all the time its comprehensive knows about controversial school issues and whats going on in real estate
2362881 the si is one of the few remaining high quality language humor contests in the major u s print media moreover because pat and her predecessor have occasionally devised contests that require a thorough reading of the rest of the newspaper the sis existence has in fact resulted in better informed readers
2362882 it is always funny often thought provoking on occasion controversial and i really enjoy reading it and writing for it i have so little control over most variables in my life please do what you can to save the invitational
2362883 please tell the rulers of the washpost that the style invitational must be preserved the fate of the nation hangs in the balance
2362884 it was the same basic idea but it morphed into a ruder more political and less literary
2362885 weve had some financial issues for the last few years
2362886 we are refocusing our programs on kind of what were known for
2362887 we will be eliminating a few ancillary programs that we have been running that have expenses attached to them that we can no longer afford
2362888 we have tried not to cut our staff and our programs
2362889 but weve gotten to the point now where these cuts have to be made we do have to streamline we have to re focus i think this is something that many companies are facing
2362890 were still there were still helping the community in amazing ways
2362891 were serving large numbers of people and we still need the communitys support
2362892 dragging her out to the bar for all you can eat wings
2362893 you should check the winners to make sure they did not do such a thing
2362894 your poem must be your own work not something you copied or read somewhere or heard someone say it must come from inside your head taking someone elses words or thoughts and offering them as your own is called plagiarism teachers and newspaper editors arent happy if you do that
2362895 embarrassed and saddened although i am not sure what else we could have done
2362896 has been a source of controversy for obama for months because of the inflammatory words and themes of some sermons
2362897 i had expected to read a detailed story giving background about obamas pastor in todays washington post after the extensive coverage given to the rev wrights sermons elsewhere by the media in the past few days at least five shocking video clips with excerpts from his sermons that were hate filled have appeared online news stories about these diatribes have appeared in other papers why is the washington post not covering the story
2362898 when the story opens with the rev jeremiah wright spent 36 years teaching this congregation how to recognize injustice and his parishioners sense it all around them now one has to wonder if any injustices were perceived or alleged or if he was even wrong occasionally perhaps his racism and religious bigotry provide a unique focus that allows him special insight into injustice i doubt it though
2362899 at the time michelle suggested the story before the latest revelations about wrights comments there was little that was new i didnt see what it would add that was significantly different
2362900 i am pleased that we were able to present elis very thorough and thoughtful piece on wright and his relationship with obama an article we had set in motion well before the situation came to a head in such a timely fashion
2362901 the question becomes do we want a president who has spiritual leaders who say challenging things to them
2362902 we are in a worldwide crisis now because of excessive deregulation
2362903 we let investment banks get into a much wider range of activities without regulation
2362904 a more robust framework for the prudential supervision of investment banks and other large securities dealers
2362905 recent experience has clearly illustrated the importance for the purpose of promoting financial stability of having detailed information about money markets and the activities of borrowers and lenders in those markets
2362906 you have to have the person whos writing the risk bearing the risk
2362907 that means a whole host of regulations theres no way around that
2362908 a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed
2362909 the absolute prohibition of handguns held and used for self defense in the home
2362910 would have us believe that over 200 years ago the framers made a choice to limit the tools available to elected officials wishing to regulate civilian uses of weapons
2362911 a permissible legislative response to a serious indeed life threatening problem
2362912 permits restrictions on place on types of weapons on conditions of sale and on carrying concealed weapons
2362913 too many fathers have abandoned their responsibilities acting like boys instead of men
2362914 you and i know how true this is in the african american community
2362915 we know that more than half of all black children live in single parent households a number that has doubled doubled since we were children
2362916 be there for their children and set high expectations for them and instill in them a sense of excellence and empathy
2362917 struggled at times to pay the bills to give us the things that other kids had to play all the roles that both parents are supposed to play
2362918 no government however firm might be its wish can avoid having policies that profoundly influence family relationships
2362919 the only option is whether these will be purposeful intended policies or whether they will be residual derivative in a sense concealed ones
2362920 minister of industry jim prentice said friday the government had no intention of introducing new legislation to regulate cellphone companies over changes in text messaging services
2362921 prentice had met with the heads of bell mobility and telus over the companies new texting charges introduced in july which called for customers whose cellphone plans did not include texting bundles to be charged 15 cents for incoming text messages previously customers without text plans were only charged for outgoing messages
2362922 prentice said in a statement friday that after meeting with the two companies he was assured that customers charged for spam could contact their service provider to have the charges removed from their bills
2362923 given these undertakings by bell mobility and telus i would encourage consumers dissatisfied with existing plans to seek alternatives
2362924 bells new texting charges went into effect friday telus announced a similar plan with its changes set to take effect on aug 24
2362925 mdn give up that annoying indiana jones pop behind its driving us nuts
2362926 assured that customers charged for spam could contact their service provider to have the charges removed from their bills
2362927 pick the lint out of the fabric of your life
2362928 most limits are self imposed they may not appear to be because they are so well integrated into your life that the lines have become blurred i often joke that cotton is not the fabric of your life your beliefs are they are woven so tightly into the fabric of your being that they have become truth if you can remove them like lint and observe them you may find that they are not really a part of you rather theyre parasites youve allowed to come along for the ride
2362929 except for a relatively small druze population arabs are excluded from military service mandatory for all but ultra orthodox jews an essential shared experience of israeli life and a traditional training ground for future political leaders
2362930 christian and muslim arabs including bedouins are exempt from compulsory service in israels military
2362931 from the perspective of the defense establishment thousands of arabs with machine guns wasnt a pleasant idea
2362932 there are a wide array of discriminatory policies and practices that are a direct outcome and effect that the arabs are excluded from the army
2362933 it is true israel doesnt ask the arabs to serve they dont want to serve it is an agreement by silence there are arabs who have served in the army muslims and christians but it is very very limited
2362934 it is quite difficult for arab muslims to enter the army but not impossible unlike christians and bedouins muslim arabs are discouraged and prevented even if they volunteer now the army could say there is positive proof by pointing to one or a few
2362935 the israeli military establishment never fully trusted them to be loyal
2362936 i want to join and you wont let me anyone has the opportunity to volunteer
2362937 by and large israel does not allow arabs to serve
2362938 if one is to say all arabs or muslims are not allowed to serve that is not accurate either they dont want it to look like they are preventing arabs from serving so they take them on an individual basis
2362939 the livelihood people can make a good living in the military
2362940 it is not merely unusual to find arabs in the idf it is amazingly rare other than some druze soldiers who in israel generally do not consider themselves arabs and a few bedouins who worked as spies i did not encounter a single arab in idf uniform and i spent a lot of time with israeli soldiers as a class arab citizens of israel are excluded from the military
2362941 i cant help it but reading about such episodes of screaming gushing and swooning makes me wonder whether women i should say we women of course arent the weaker sex after all or even the stupid sex our brains permanently occluded by random emotions psychosomatic flailings and distraction by the superficial what is it about us women why do we always fall for the hysterical the superficial and the gooily sentimental depressing as it is several of the supposed misogynist myths about female inferiority have been proven true
2362942 so i dont understand why more women dont relax and revel in the things most important to life at which nearly all of us excel tenderness toward children and men and the weak and the ability to make a house a home then we could shriek and swoon and gossip and not mind the fact that way down deep we can be kind of dim
2362943 funny clearly tongue in cheek and hyperbolic but with a serious point that provided food for thought at a time when the clinton candidacy and some womens reactions to the obama candidacy have put the subject of women and womens roles front and center i thought her piece held up a mirror to some foibles so many women including me can recognize in themselves even as we seek absolute equality and expect to be taken seriously
2362944 have come far enough to be able to laugh at ourselves and not feel threatened by some satirical self criticism and self examination
2362945 didnt anticipate the fury of the internet and the blogosphere much of which seems to me to have either overlooked or missed the humor i saw
2362946 it presented a different albeit very non pc take at a time when women and politics is a riveting topic in this country i expected the piece to be controversial but i did not expect the intensity of the reaction it was a learning experience about the section my job and our readership
2362947 i wrote a fairly blunt e mail arguing that it wasnt up to snuff and that the paper shouldnt run a glib essentialist screed that insulted an entire gender
2362948 misogyny is the last acceptable prejudice and nowhere more so than in our nations clueless and overwhelmingly white male controlled media maybe theres another thing women can do besides fluff up their husbands pillows fill more important jobs at the washington post we should be half the assigning editors half the writers and half the regular columnists too current roster of op ed columnists 16 men two women
2362949 why cant women make fun of women are women such a sacrosanct subject nowadays that theyre off limits for anyone to write about them except in a reverent portrayal of them as victims of men i dont buy that
2362950 there are some things that you dont joke about the washington post would never think of publishing an opinion piece even as a joke or in an attempt to provoke about how stupid african americans or hispanics are
2362951 we had other programming commitments and respect for other audiences so we cant keep all the people happy all the time
2362952 the ratings results from thursday for make me a supermodel and the soccer show the decision was vindicated
2362953 besides setting box office records on this tour the english group also may be setting some type of record for the most cliches in a single concert a manlight show steam from dry ice covering the stage three different times the bands name spelled out in lights a laser beam something an opening act at the troubadour did last year an explosion at the rear of the stage and of course the obligatory 20 minute drum solo but zeppelins material is so lacking in both commentary and emotional challenge that the music ends up as an empty exercise in sound while there are some soft moments indeed the gentle stairway to heaven has become the bands anthem the thrust of the evening is on heavy pulsating assaults the lyrics are often woeful the themes unaffecting
2362954 we must apologize for the slight delay but we couldnt get into the building we hadnt got any tickets its a fact
2362955 for the benefit of anybody who was making a bootleg then the twelve string was out of tune on song remains the same
2362956 the drumming and the hammering is by courtesy of acme quaalude company ltd this is a guy building a chicken pen can you hear it
2362957 that was a combination of key signatures that just will never occur again amidst the rushing and screaming of cowboys hello cowboy in the sand singing neil youngs song but changing cowgirl to cowboy and now there comes again a song we really dig
2362958 malacum salaam sorry about the delay but the treacherous conditions on the roads theres snowstorms back in hollywood
2362959 that was an old work song actually a long time before mr zimmerman listened to it down in the village back in the 1960s
2362960 just a minute just a minute thank you very much thats it see you again long beach goodnight they didnt tell you it was like this in valhalla it happened for the first time in six and a half years does anyone remember laughter we never seem to be able to get things together in los angeles on a very firm basis but like i was saying the song remains nevertheless continuously the same
2362961 well that was thoroughly enjoyable better than a good chick almost
2362962 a bit better than last night too many reds by the time we get to the forum we should be sky high
2362963 tarantura to release new box set of long beach 75 customers alert tarantura is about to release a huge box set of the long beach concert without giving any information as to the content and source of the shows please note that there is a new long beach tape soon to surface of far superior quality to what is out there now so be careful that you dont spend a fortune on a re hash of material just before the new source comes out so they can sell it to you again ps the real tarantura label not the one hijacked by you know who in japan would never even consider doing this marketing scam
2362964 a new long beach tape soon to surface of far superior quality to what is out there now
2362965 advances the strong california policy favoring open competition and employee freedom
2362966 those have been drivers of the states economy especially in the technology area
2362967 an employer cannot by contract restrain a former employee from engaging in his or her profession trade or business
2362968 as long as you dont steal trade secrets or confidential information you can do what you want
2362969 when text is copied from a previous email and should be
2362970 must we hear about it every time this crack addict attempts to rehabilitate himself with some new and typically half witted political grandstanding id be grateful if you would take me off your mailing list i cannot think of anything the useless marion barry could do that would interest me in the slightest up to and including overdose
2362971 around the nation its almost open season on black people
2362972 i am deeply ashamed for what i did and i know how hurtful my words could be immediately after i pressed send i knew it was the dumbest thing ive ever written in 30 years of journalism i want to affirm that my own momentary irritation at receiving unsolicited e mail had nothing to do with the washington post or anybody who edits the washington post or anybody who might ever write about mr barry for the washington post
2362973 i appreciate downies sincere apology but its not enough he page ought to be fired
2362974 it was serious and i took it seriously the post has treated me with more patience than i might have treated me
2362975 as far as i am concerned theres no sanction short of he needs to be fired i cannot believe that a reporter would do something like that and get away with that its like the most outrageous thing that ive heard coming out of journalism for a long time
2362976 while perhaps he should have left out the overdose part i think it was a personal matter and has no bearing on the paper the man writes about classical music not ward 8 politics its ridiculous that you all are kowtowing to mr barry and giving him another reason to complain about being treated unfairly are newspapermen not allowed to have opinions about matters they dont report
2362977 and thus does a person become not a free citizen but merely a corporate lackey beholden to his employer in every aspect of his life
2362978 were very liberal about the definition of professional it can mean everything from a well known company such as active cultures recent musical revue in tribute to of all things the history of microbiology
2362979 may skip a production by some company for reasons of track record quality its a matter sometimes of resources
2362980 why does peter marks write so many reviews of shows at new york city theaters it strikes me as a disservice to area theatergoers especially those interested in local and regional theater
2362981 they have a significant impact on what audiences in the rest of the nation eventually will see
2362982 basically we cover just about everything it has to be professional dance we pick the best quality and most interesting of whats offered
2362983 we make it to most of the local choruses smaller orchestras and chamber groups at least once a year while giving full attention to the
2362984 weve covered the national philharmonic at least five times in 2007 and we get to as much as we can at strathmore
2362985 later the same evening an opera inspired by five paintings of edward hopper maryland opera studio at the university of maryland page said that the short advance story and review the opera received were a matter of time and resources
2362986 unfortunately almost every musical event that takes place in the d c area except the nsos opening night happens between friday night and sunday afternoon and we have only a limited amount of space
2362987 if somebody would start a truly first class monday night series it would almost invariably be covered the same thing is true with anything that happens in late july or august
2362988 to strike a balance between whats popular and whats interesting important or otherwise noteworthy i also pay attention to range making sure that theres stylistic diversity on the schedule its an inexact science but i think we usually wind up with a pretty good mix
2362989 in january for instance im writing about the miley cyrus hannah montana tween pop concert at the verizon center as its a major cultural event and im also sending myself to the black cat to review sharon jones and the dap kings a superlative rhythm and blues band thats struggled to find a broad audience also on our coverage agenda are rapper lupe fiasco the old folkie richard thompson japanese electro rocker cornelius bluegrass star ricky skaggs and jazzman cyrus chestnut
2362990 pretty weak the institution hasnt always been as vigilant it should have been on executive travel
2362991 when you put it all in a package it is wholly ugly you dont expect high ranking public officials to do this west took advantage to a fare thee well
2362992 in some museum circles we were not accepted and i felt i had to explain nmai to the rest of the world
2362993 pile on you look for the worst in every situation
2362994 its an extraordinary amount of money to spend directors have to travel but you can spend your entire time at professional meetings the director has to have self discipline plus there must be oversight part of the blame can be affixed on rick west and part of the burden goes on the governing authority he is not to be singled out as being different in this regard there have to be colleagues and oversight that help you work these things out
2362995 would you please explain the posts policy on reader feedback on articles do reporters and editors look at the e mail exchanges or is the post merely providing a forum for expression and dialogue among readers or to foster a sense of connection to the paper
2362996 if theyre abusive now and then responding sparks a thoughtful dialogue
2362997 comments attached to stories about race ethnicity and related issues such as immigration often reek of racism intolerance and ignorance to ignore them in my opinion is to endorse them
2362998 i dont mind abusive or insulting comments in the least like anyone else i find the most extreme abuse unsettling but short of that its all part of the exchange with readers we have our say in our articles and comments if were going to let readers have their say we ought to let those boards be a true reflection of all the wrath foolishness wisdom and range of opinions that people bring to our work
2362999 i have never understood why some colleagues treat the online comments as if they were representative of the overall reader reaction to a story online comments are like the phone calls on talk radio they tend to be the folks with the most polarized and virulent of viewpoints
2363000 there really isnt any time in the day where i can stop and read the paper just about all of my girlfriends have the same type of scenario as i do and we many times dont really find things in the daily paper that catch our attention and would make us slow down and be late for things in order to read it
2363001 my sense is that there are fewer staff written stories now about relationships parenting dilemmas faith and religion and consumer problems as well as community breakdown and cohesiveness and what contributes to both women dont see enough of their everyday lives in our paper other than in style health home and food
2363002 women are especially interested in local news they are careful readers of metro especially the suburban professionals and neighborhood activists i bump into all the time they want to recognize themselves their neighbors their neighborhoods their issues in the newspaper
2363003 a mirror of the community an opportunity to recognize shared experiences their issues schools schools and more schools we dont write enough about how our school systems are really working what its like to be a family coping with an underperforming school system or one that has schools operating on extreme overdrive such as montgomery and fairfax anything affecting children health mental health how to cope with the challenges and joys of being a multitasking parent is important how to make ends meet in a highly expensive area too often we seem to write for and about the very wealthy and show little knowledge or empathy for the lives many of our readers live
2363004 not to stereotype but judging by the differences between the way my wife and i read the paper i might surmise that women tend to be slightly more interested in articles on how to live ones life and less avid about articles on inside the beltway policy disputes the posts stock in trade of course
2363005 this shouldnt be seen as just a woman thing we need to get this right and guys ought to pay attention to it men still run the paper at most levels and we need their buy in
2363006 egregious i thought the story was a great way to perpetuate a rumor or innuendo without the simple act of saying it was wrong
2363007 one half of the story was a billboard for the rumors
2363008 this was a legitimate subject for journalism explored by one of our most sophisticated political reporters
2363009 we should have been clearer about what it did and didnt say in the headline through the display and in the body of the piece
2363010 it obviously makes me think about how i edited it it seemed to me the story made clear that obama was not a muslim but that the campaign was having trouble contending with people spreading that rumor i thought that in this context saying it was a rumor meant it wasnt true but clearly some people didnt see it the same way the post has a responsibility to confront seemingly credible rumors and that was one of the reasons for the story
2363011 i dont think rumors like this will die obama is going to have a problem with them as long as hes a candidate
2363012 when a newspapers articles are providing fodder for its own editorial cartoonist something is seriously wrong the article which i read thoroughly seemed to give some credence to the campaign to smear senator obama as a closeted muslim if only by the fact that it was given a place on the front page instead of being buried on page 70 or so as an utterly baseless rumor being put out
2363013 reasonable people can disagree on this but the people i have heard from are not reasonable what i find especially disheartening is the idea that our motives are simply assumed to have been malicious
2363014 letter grades were based largely on the charities fundraising costs and the percentages of money raised that was spent on charitable activities
2363015 without an explanation of how they were derived is a disservice to readers and the affected charities
2363016 gave those ratings unquestioned legitimacy your readers deserve explanations of this complex subject
2363017 lumped together with the very sort of organizations we shun
2363018 do not reflect donors intentions on how the money is spent they want to give money to veterans not educational expenses
2363019 the overarching principle of the bbb wise giving alliance standards for charity accountability is full disclosure to donors and potential donors at the time of solicitation and thereafter
2363020 this is not the last story well write about the veterans charities we plan to continue covering this topic fully as well as other important stories in philanthropy
2363021 no one thought she would win including her own people polling was misleading but so too were signs on the ground what happened is we all got swept up in a powerful story line and werent attuned enough to signs to the contrary thats the beauty of political reporting its always unpredictable and keeps us humble
2363022 it takes a long time to turn it around its big and its hard to go against the wake when everyone you know is absolutely convinced that the issue is how many digits shes going to lose by its hard to not be in the party especially when the masters of spin are reaffirming the story line
2363023 van externe aansprakelijkheid is sprake als een vennootschap of bestuurder namens een vennootschap verplichtingen tegenover derden aangaat waarvan hij bij het aangaan van de overeenkomst wist danwel behoorde te weten dat de vennootschap deze verplichtingen niet kan nakomen opzettelijk derden benadeelt of zichzelf onrechtmatig bevoordeelt
2363024 why on earth are you going to quebec instead of ontario
2363025 the mandate is to be provocative i look to be grabbed
2363026 by an idea that can start or change a debate i look for something fresh vivid unusual that will force readers to have a good hard think
2363027 we have an embarrassment of riches by default we turn down a lot of good things
2363028 we like letters to be short so we can fit more of them we say six months so more people get a chance though we waive that rule when someone whos been mentioned deserves a chance to talk back of course the rules have evolved over time particularly the web one and we rethink them from time to time
2363029 whether the editor makes his selection based on how favorable the writer is to the post position
2363030 when we submit a letter to the editor of the wp how long should we wait to see if it gets published before modifying it and resubmitting it to another newspaper
2363031 indeed it strikes me as arrogant that a reader with no affiliation involvement or relationship with something published in the post is not considered a competent commentator
2363032 the fact that the antiwar crowd was much larger and an estimate of the war supporter crowd were initially in the story and high up however news from the die in and arrests was breaking on deadline and beyond and we were busily reorganizing the entire story several times under a time crunch
2363033 we were editing in takes the story was moving in installments with info being shifted between takes in the process the reference to numbers essentially fell through the cracks between the takes
2363034 we should have mentioned that the pro war group was much smaller it was an oversight
2363035 as thousands march to the capitol to protest iraq conflict 189 arrested war supporters take on vocal minority
2363036 absent an explanation a reader might think that the war supporters were in the majority
2363037 may have given an incorrect impression about the number of pro war and antiwar protesters war opponents significantly outnumbered war supporters
2363038 the picture selection opens with a large picture of the pro war protesters right in the sweet spot at the top center it was a much larger picture than any showing the antiwar crowd and seemed to inflate the importance of the pro war support
2363039 it was one of the easiest and most confident crowd counts ive done in 25 years of crowd counting because the bollards nicely regulated the number filing through at any given moment the 800 at the pro war rally were so few that they were easily counted individually
2363040 because there was no way to know how many people joined the protest at the capitol
2363041 i have subscribed to your paper for many years and thought the full page color ad in this mornings paper was extremely inappropriate we use the washington post at school as a regular part of our curriculum daily and do not think that is what we want our students to think the newspaper is about
2363042 everyday i read the kidspost with my boys after school this morning i tore out the kidspost page to save it for them i was very horrified when i turned the page over today and saw a full page ad featuring a smiling man with blood splattered all over his face how am i going to explain this disturbing picture
2363043 we actually had a fair amount of internal debate about whether to run it and ultimately decided to take it we erred on the side of running it because we felt that while she is nude it was reasonably discreet as a mother of three young children myself i take your point about putting it behind the kidspost page
2363044 am i the only reader getting sick of seeing all the ads usually on a4 this morning both advertising better sex for life
2363045 is to accept ads so long as the services being advertised are not illegal and do not seriously offend our sensibility as a family newspaper
2363046 a common practice across the federal government we were working to keep a highly qualified individual with impeccable credentials in government service
2363047 matched the requirements for advice that could be provided by mr riechers use of this type of adviser is not unique but it was an unusual situation i believe use of the cri contract was not only legal but ethical
2363048 missed some of the specifics that were provided mr riechers did perform the tasks under the contract to support the air force
2363049 we have done other contracts like this over the years
2363050 to let the facts speak for themselves and offer the opinions of the best experts i could find those experts were sharply critical of the arrangement
2363051 lots of jobs are used for interim purposes until a person is on a payroll
2363052 it is not bad if you step back from the detail
2363053 i havent encountered an arrangement quite like this obviously it raises questions about the management of government funds when a contractor can be directed to compensate a prospective government employee for a purpose unrelated to the reason the money was originally appropriated on its face that doesnt sound like good government
2363054 it lacked important context and facts there are questions of appearance here but this does not appear to have been a no work contract he did work for the air force while it doesnt mean the arrangement was the right thing to do the picture is somewhat different when you look at the context
2363055 questionable even if there is a legal justification theres still a real appearance problem especially because of its prior situation with druyun you would think the air force would have been sensitive to the appearance issue
2363056 this is not the kind of example that we expect from the leadership in the procurement community if its commonplace then its disappointing from a procurement standpoint it almost flaunting the rules
2363057 writing about fashion can be lighthearted writing about body parts is grossly inappropriate and thats what the column was it had no place in the washington post
2363058 insulting to every woman who has ever tried to be taken seriously in a business meeting
2363059 take a stand against this kind of coarseness and pettiness
2363060 sen clinton from the time she was first lady on had a really publicly tortured relationship with public appearance her style and fashion showing cleavage is not common for her it seemed so out of her stylistic character it suggested to me someone who has become more comfortable being a sexual person as well as one of authority intellect and confidence
2363061 it is news because it is out of the ordinary and says something about clothing and sexuality in our culture and the way that we perceive people and the way that people want to be perceived
2363062 hair has become a central issue in the race for the presidency
2363063 the vice president was dressed in the kind of attire one typically wears to operate a snow blower
2363064 as for the senators cleavage being accidental i never presumed to know what was on sen clintons mind i only know the way in which that display could have been perceived and thats what i wrote about accidental or intentional the fact remains that seeing cleavage on her was surprising given her history and given her location and there is a difference between writing about body parts and writing about decolletage and what it reveals
2363065 why did bryant feel the need to clean up portiss language while wise presumably didnt most importantly how did post editors miss the incorrect use of quotation marks
2363066 when we put a sources words inside quotation marks those exact words should have been uttered in precisely that form
2363067 for me having covered athletes for 15 years ive always felt conscious and uncomfortable about the differences in class background and race im an african american and in terms of the people who are doing the speaking and the people who are doing the writing i really dont like to make people look stupid especially when i understand what theyre saying
2363068 sportswriters have been making minor grammatical fixes to athletes quotes forever the meaning of what the athlete is saying is not altered just the grammar its rooted in the belief that you shouldnt embarrass someone whose command of grammar is weak we have told our writers to run quotes verbatim or paraphrase when the grammar is horrific but some old habits die hard we will try to do better
2363069 i am totally convinced along racial class and cultural lines that when it comes to white players from the south reporters instinctively clean up their language redskins coach joe gibbs in his own way can sound as inarticulate as portis in terms of perfect grammar so i clean up his language to not embarrass him i also do it with athletes whats fair is fair
2363070 i just have a hard time cleaning up anyones quotes i just feel it robs people of their personality and if im not capturing who the person is through the rhythm and cadence of their words im not telling the readers who they are i just feel people need to be portrayed as they sound irrespective of whether youre an aging white coach or a young black athlete otherwise we run the risk of homogenizing everyone
2363071 quotations of people whose speech is marked by dialect incorrect grammar or profanity often present difficult choices
2363072 sometimes we will want to avoid humiliating a speaker by paraphrasing in grammatical form an ungrammatical statement
2363073 ever says in public is transcribed we dont clean it up in fact we go to great lengths to make sure the quotes are as precise as possible if its fractured we can use ellipses or brackets or fragment quotes if the fracture is particularly noteworthy we might point it out
2363074 i try to avoid using fractured quotes mainly because i feel they can be distracting other times i use ellipses my theory is that using fractured language puts the focus on the wrong thing bushs poor syntax or poor stage presence or whatever when he is talking about vital issues on certain kinds of pieces features or in the loop i use them to illustrate clearly this guys style
2363075 if such quotations make the speaker look stupid or foolish we should consider paraphrasing them outside of quotation marks of course when appropriate a story should note that a source was struggling with english

2363079 given the crisis in confidence that the securities industry experienced we expected to find that analysts influence would have diminished
2363080 disinclined to be an open government administration there is a culture of secrecy particularly after 9 11 that has seeped down to the agencies and bureaucracies are already inclined toward secrecy by their nature
2363081 can be notoriously difficult partly because theyre all lawyers and they do have sensitive documents so is the military even on information on contractors that is not involved in national security
2363082 that means requests are harder to review redact and release
2363083 this negotiation is an on going process it has not come to a halt tonight and will be resumed tomorrow in the course of the morning
2363084 right now as we speak russian bombers are bombing the poti port which is the western port of georgia as well as senaki airfield which was bombed numerous times today and of course it was quite anticipated from my side that we should have some kind of provocation in abkhazia as well we are seeing the bombing of kodori region of upper abkhazi
2363085 how else can we call it when hospitals are being destroyed schools residential areas when scores of thousands of refugees are leaving the republic
2363086 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2363087 well have to wait and see what happens for the spring after we get information from the departments
2363088 it is important for the deans to approach the cuts in a differential manner in their departments they are the ones who can say this aspect of my physics program is more important than that aspect of my physics program
2363089 were just beginning to evaluate how well deal with it
2363090 regardless how big your budget is a million dollars is a million dollars it is hard to find ways to make the cuts
2363091 cuts are going to be very very difficult and its just too early to know the impact
2363092 i will be meeting with faculty administrators and staff for input ideas and options to address the reductions before final decisions and resolutions are made
2363093 at this time it is too early to determine the impact on potential unfulfilled positions or reduction in staffing
2363094 were asking people to start planning for 2010 and thinking hard what our important programs are and how we can invest in those
2363095 generally tries to protect the academic units that are delivering the core teaching and research
2363096 a coalition of top scientists from private groups and federal agencies
2363097 in no way implies that it has been endorsed by our member organizations
2363098 new and independent scientific research about eating fish deserves a full and fair hearing which is why the seafood industry openly supported this public discourse
2363099 i had the impression they had endorsed these recommendations which went into my thinking in offering the story for page 1
2363100 journalists seem to like it when sanchez criticizes the bush administration but when sanchez delivers devastating criticism of journalists this is something that can be ignored
2363101 were important and interesting and thats why i included them
2363102 white wrote well and appropriately about sanchezs complaints which were utterly predictable after extensive media coverage of his actions in iraq during the period of the abu ghraib abuses what was unpredictable and therefore much more newsworthy was his pointed criticism of others in the federal government were happy to write about the people who dont like us but in the context of his full remarks those complaints were much less electric

2363108 a friend of mine hit me up to tell me that perry farrell wanted to get in touch with me that alone was pretty f in cool being the fan that i am anyway he asked me to dj with him in his tent at lollapalooza i didnt ask any questions just said yes i had no idea what exactly he wanted me to do but i went and met with him the day of and he just said to do what i wanted cant really beat that so i played a set before he performed some songs it was crazy being on stage with him even crazier was then watching him perform with his special guest slash yup slash it was sick they performed jane says and the crowd sang along to every word i dont think i blinked the whole time it was ridiculous i still smile thinking about it corny i know but true it was literally one of those moments where you feel like its christmas i got to meet slash yup ha i know i sound like a total dork but i dont care ive been a fan of his since forever i generally make it a rule to stay away from anyone i admire so as not to be disappointed but i didnt and i wasnt i had met perry farrell before when i was djing but didnt really talk to him basically coz i get really shy around people like that so the day off i was pretty nervous but he was sooooo sweet and nice and cool i could probably ramble on and on but i will save you the superlatives

2363111 e polls are generally proposed on the europa website including on the presidents website for a short duration and removed when the interest is fading out they are not designed for formal consultation other mechanisms in the political process provide for that but for giving the visitors in this case the visitors of the website of the president an opportunity to convey to the president their personal opinions in an informal manner generally the results can be consulted for the full duration of the poll in the concrete case of the biofuels e poll campaigning and organised voting unfortunately defeated the purpose of the poll and resulted in technical problems preventing individual citizens to express their personal opinion on this issue to the president the effect of the campaigning is immediately visible on the tables attached the poll was subsequently removed from the presidents website
2363112 i was extremely surprised that neither acknowledged that see is the daughter of
2363113 carolyn doesnt have a retirement plan nor benefits such as insurance coverage shes a bit like the gardener who comes to mow the lawn once a week
2363114 to be quite frank the post review was one of the more critical reviews of peony in love
2363115 ive been insistent to the point of mulishness that i only review the books im assigned i never ask to review a book since that could lead to accusations of bias either before or against particular writers and i never suggest a book for possible review
2363116 of course the review of lisas book had no direct connection to carolyn but thats the point of a disclosure policy isnt it when a reviewer is as frequent regular a contributor as to be linked in the mind of most readers with the posts book section then one would think any disclosure policy that applies to staff members would apply to her
2363117 was somewhat disturbing to read stephen hunters michael moores new film sicko it is no secret that moore is an avowed leftie hunter meanwhile openly supports the conservative right and has made donations to the national republican congressional committee while i certainly dont contest hunters right to support any organization in the context of reviewing a film that is political on so many levels it was wrong for hunter to receive this assignment
2363118 that michael gerson was twice mentioned and once quoted and identified as a former bush speechwriter i did find it a bit strange that no mention was made of his current status as a post op ed columnist
2363119 at the time that we interviewed him gerson was not a post op ed columnist and was far better known as a former bush speechwriter gersons column began five weeks before we published the cheney series during that time we were putting the series into its production cycle for the newspaper it just didnt occur to any of us that we needed to identify him as a columnist
2363120 we have a heck of a lot of trailwork to do
2363121 other peoples money ex con michele fletcher hopes to cash in with her tale of greed
2363122 to drum up sales for a book who thought this was a cover story so she did her crime and served her time certainly she should have a chance to make an honest living but why the special treatment of a story that dominates the style section
2363123 of ex prisoners writing fictionalized tales of life on the streets the genre has grown beyond a few thousand novels sold by self published authors to hundreds of thousands of books sold through mainstream retailers
2363124 the story was written to put a local face on a fast growing industry she was widely known in her prince georges county community and people want to know what happened to her she has turned the same energy she used to manage the scheme to become a player in street literature a world where her conviction gives her a measure of authority
2363125 the story on the ex convict rewards her criminal behavior with valuable free publicity she seems to have no remorse for her crimes and seeks to live the high life again without requisite sweat equity or genuine talent
2363126 understand how some readers might be offended by michele fletcher and the choices she has made thats up to individual readers and their moral compasses wading into those waters however is not our job our job is to report interesting stories about people and their lives
2363127 of great subjectivity we arent always going for traditional storytelling in style
2363128 are there no standards about what type of ad especially a full page ad in the sunday a section can be run in the post i found the flynt hustler ad about the private lives of members of congress profoundly offensive
2363129 why did they stoop so low as to run an ad by that smut merchant does the post need the income that badly
2363130 our long standing policy is to accept advertisements without regard for whether we like them or agree with the views they express our goal is to allow advertisers to deliver their message in the way they want although we dont accept ads that contain false or misleading statements of fact or advertise an illegal product or service
2363131 this is an election year and we have to be careful to elect someone who is going to tell the truth it is time to weed out the liars my intention in running this ad is not to expose just anyones sexual life but if someone takes a public position that is contrary to the way they live their private lives they are fair game and the public should know about it the hypocrisy in politics is overwhelming with candidates preaching one thing and practicing another the press is also reluctant to tell the truth and many relevant news stories are suppressed my intention in running this ad is to keep people aware that there are ways to get at the truth and for the american people to know if our elected leaders are really our best representatives

2363136 a vast number of football fans were not able to see it live
2363137 showing the game live was something we certainly discussed with the australian olympic committee and channel 7
2363138 there would have been an enormous number of football followers across the country who would have wanted to watch the game live
2363139 as for live coverage we try to do the best we can but it is extremely difficult to juggle

2363142 it is now easier than ever for companies to give all employees a google com search experience inside their business
2363143 with the improved architecture for the search appliance businesses can provide secure search across the largest enterprise content repositories such as documentum filenet livelink and sharepoint all from one easy to maintain appliance
2363144 we were invited to participate in the beta program for the new google search appliance and were extremely pleased with its simplified deployment architecture
2363145 being able to search 10 million documents in a box not only makes maintenance and deployment across our domestic and international locations much easier but we also get the same fast reliable and relevant search results weve come to expect from google
2363146 for us choosing an enterprise search solution came down to two factors getting the quickest and most relevant search results not only does the google search appliance deliver fast and relevant results but our employees and agents dont need anything more technical than a few keywords to find what they need
2363147 and the new personalization biasing and alert features represent the type of user focused innovation that makes the google search appliance a good fit for our agents and for our organization
2363148 go see a movie about women on the opening weekend that is what matters to hollywood

2363153 various technological and economic forces are bearing down on what we do so forcefully and frankly so fast that the very nature of journalism is being challenged in fundamental ways
2363154 since a free press first evolved we have derived our authority from a feeling a sense a pretense that journalism is if not infallible something close to it we speak of ourselves as being interested in the truth the real truth were truth seekers were truth tellers and we tell truth to power
2363155 are just going to have to grow up and like big boys and girls take it on the chin
2363156 trust has to be re earned all the time not only in the brand but in each and every single piece of copy
2363157 that the public at large has a rather more honest assessment of what journalism is than we give them credit for surveys capture a rather sophisticated sense of what we do which in the privacy of the newsroom or the pub we know ourselves but which we think were keeping secret from everyone else this pretense
2363158 there are millions of fact checkers out there and some know far more than we do so we can refuse systematically to correct or clarify our journalism but we would be foolish to imagine that it will therefore go uncorrected or unclarified it will all that will happen is that it will take place elsewhere
2363159 is something more fluid a much more iterative thing than the tablet of stone
2363160 i would like to see us say over and over until the point has been made that the newspaper that drops on your doorstep is a partial hasty incomplete inevitably somewhat flawed and inaccurate rendering of some of the things we heard about in the past 24 hours distorted despite our best efforts to eliminate gross bias by the very process of compression that makes it possible for you to read it in about an hour if we labeled the paper accurately then we would immediately add but its the best we could do under the circumstances and we will be back tomorrow with a corrected updated version
2363161 as the best description of what a newspaper is and is even more so today the greater the speed required of us in the digital world and speed does matter but never at the expense of accuracy or fairness or anything which would imperil trust the more we should be honest about the tentative nature of what is possible
2363162 they explain us to them and them to us sometimes they manage the even harder job of explaining us to us
2363163 anyone can perform an act of journalism how do we readers and journalists together learn more
2363164 distrust the institutional voice and trust more the human voice the more we represent that personal voice the better

2363173 faithful friends are a sturdy shelter whoever finds one has found a treasure faithful friends are life saving medicine
2363174 the worst thing you can do is create a matched community an inner circle of people who see life exactly as you do life is becoming more complex not less which necessitates an ever greater diversity of counsel
2363175 be as diverse as you can make and take them with varied experiences attitudes politics even theologies people to help you be creative not merely to help you implement creativity

2363183 it seems like this movie is just going to be about him bashing other peoples religions thinking it makes him look smart
2363184 i cannot fathom why it has taken 100s of years 1 000s i dunno im just a blogger to realize that millions of adults believe that superman is real thank somebody for youtube and accountability
2363185 you dont need to pass an iq test to be in the senate
2363186 believing in god is no more crazy than believing there was a huge explosion and it all just came together to be so perfect and intricate to where we are today
2363187 this is the first phase of a very long campaign our goal in the past few months has been to introduce the candidates to our readers and to give some idea of what their candidacies will be about weve also looked for opportunities for traditional accountability reporting illuminating contradictions or mysteries in their records or backgrounds that would be relevant to evaluating a presidential candidate
2363188 ein gravierender nachteil des erdgases ist aber seine trockene konsistenz wodurch ltere leitungen und verbindungsmuffen nach und nach undicht werden in gro st dten m ssen die gasleitungen daher etwa alle zehn jahre berpr ft und saniert werden
2363189 it is our job to weigh what politicians say against what they do we believe it is our job to unearth and put before the public as much information as possible about aspirants to the presidency surely our readers are well equipped to judge the relevance of information such as that presented in our story about hedge funds and the 2008 political candidates
2363190 the disclosure comes in the midst of a widening student loan scandal exposing financial ties among lenders universities and government officials
2363191 incredibly misleading what the article didnt mention is that these five are each very large public corporations that do a huge amount of business in varied fields why was the story published and with such an accusatory headline why was it placed on the front page of the business section
2363192 the perennial problems of deadlines and space limits at mid afternoon i was asked by the desk to change gears and do a different story which didnt involve abdullah or jordan
2363193 we should have at least had a brief wire or some acknowledgment of his speech to the joint session and what he said on the day it occurred
2363194 i should have assigned someone else to write a story on the speech even though it was not a major news event it was worth having in the paper but it slipped through the cracks however we did come back to the speech in a larger sunday story by deyoung and glenn kessler about evolving u s diplomacy in the mideast
2363195 regarding the front page article firings had genesis in white house i request that you look into why reporters dan eggen and john solomon saw fit to avoid any mention of the firings of all u s attorneys by president clinton for the younger generation and people with short memories the article would imply that such firings are a new thing
2363196 bush also got rid of all but one u s attorney in 2001 and in both of those cases it was at the beginning of a change in party power which seems fairly obvious and routine the issue here is doing a mass firing in the middle of a term which leads to appearance problems and which is viewed by many as an intrusion on the independence of prosecutors no one including the department of justice can cite a time in recent decades when it has happened before
2363197 would appear to be a deeply serious breach of journalism ethics
2363198 boswell and shapiro had criticized athletes for gambling because it has a corrupting influence on the sport
2363199 do post editors condone this sort of conduct particularly since the bets were placed on an event the reporters were covering for the paper how much was wagered and how long has it been going on how do the reporters justify their moral criticisms of others when they themselves engage in the same illegal behavior
2363200 a bunch of silly categories and no one wins much
2363201 except for a few horse races or a personal golf game ive never bet on anything else in my life
2363202 we come back after the day and watch highlights and tease each other about
2363203 no ive never bet on anything during my years at the post in fact this year i didnt even participate in the pool because i was too tired to stay up i put up the 50 bucks as a courtesy to the other guys and they picked my team for me i was the only one in the house to not win a dollar for the week this is done in houses all around augusta for fun and laughs and is a way of giving everyone something to talk about during the week as in who had the low round today thats about as serious as it gets
2363204 im confident that the small scale pool in no way affected the coverage of the event and was a 25 year tradition that was started only to bolster camaraderie for those living together while covering the event that said weve stressed to our folks that prizes for these sorts of pools including the ncaa tournament should not involve cash no matter how small the amount
2363205 a lot of money on a team or individual is always wrong
2363206 i wouldnt call the masters pool serious for myself i dont get involved in pools
2363207 to avoid an appearance of bias no member of the sports department may gamble on any sports event except for occasional recreational wagering on horse racing or dog racing or jai alai this exception does not apply to staff members who cover such racing or regularly edit that coverage
2363208 just because its in the culture doesnt mean its the right thing to do
2363209 reporters go after others with zeal while believing that the rules dont apply to them and that they are above reproach accountability for thee but not for me
2363210 if your coach says that youve potentially got three guys who can start that usually means you havent got any
2363211 hey the macbook pro is the same price as the macbook air and its like twice as fast i is on a winner there
2363212 we havent come to any conclusions yet i think you can say we are trying to explore every possible option
2363213 you couldnt rename a station people still need to know where theyre going
2363214 thank you i just downloaded santogold via the torrent you pointed to

2363217 men fiche mon mari ma promis de moffrir un stage au d me de montmiral na
2363218 unnecessarily cynical i am just a guy that loves god and loves the bible i was just saddened that what was such a significant event for me had been covered in a way that didnt reveal that to the public
2363219 wow i forgot i watched this series and that it even existed
2363220 when obama met with acorn leaders in november he reminded them of his history with acorn and his beginnings in illinois as a project vote organizer a nonprofit focused on voter rights and education
2363221 venture through space exploring new civilizations and life forms youll also beam down to planets and have adventures inside your ship its a galactic wide game theres going to be tons of space to investigate we have a great system for exploration which will allow for almost infinite possibilities
2363222 conceptually its going to be a vast improvement but we want to see what the real world results are
2363223 in a lot of ways a hybrid is an ideal police vehicle because police officers spend a lot of time stopped and in this vehicle when you stop you stop using gas
2363224 being involved with this work isnt like the normal doctor patient relationship its more like a friendship
2363225 everythings expensive now tortilla tomatoes eggs chicken milk rice cooking oil everything
2363226 cash transfer programmes like this hold out an example of how you can directly provide care to the poorest families and enhance their basic living conditions
2363227 its efficient filling a gap and allowing people to hold their heads up high

2363262 because i had to go on richard amp judy yesterday
2363263 in cracking shape thank you getting better every day more and more shipshape and generally ready for action
2363264 its bigger than id expected much much bigger but also better its a very big job bigger more challenging more intellectually challenging than anything ive ever done i didnt really know what it would be like but i could tell it was a wonderful job i remember years ago when michael heseltine first started rabbiting on about it thinking golly that would be a fantastic thing to do
2363265 happy green clean safe yeah and pioneering on the whole environmental agenda taking that stuff seriously making london the centre of the new global green revolution you know if you want to flog a new green idea then london should be the place where it happens
2363266 because were going to appoint a superb environmental adviser very shortly
2363267 we will be building up a a strategy and you know revising a lot of the targets over the er next few months but im sticking to our general desire to reduce co2 by 60 by 2025 and you know youre going to see some really fantastic things on cycling i would say to people add that adjective i mean no cyclings not an adjective its a participle add that participle ok its going to be clean green safe and cycling
2363268 but i think his comments were capable of perpetual misconstruction which was not going to be helpful
2363269 i just think it would have made things very difficult for him it would have sent out a wrong signal to a large erm you know chunk of the london population that we werent here to work for all of them
2363270 and were here to work for everybody in london ok
2363271 well er im not quite sure its true i dispute your premise
2363272 nothing would make me happier than to be able to boast a top team that was more diverse
2363273 im a great believer in organisations that are run by women the spectator under me was a feminocracy
2363274 well id have to look at the numbers but my impression is that we are a completely equal opportunities employer and im absolutely determined to remain so
2363275 i think meetings can sometimes its a bit like running in a dream you get that heavy feeling in your legs and you feel you can hardly move its just like treacle and weve got some things done quickly but some things youve got to bang at and then youve got to bang again and keep banging so when you do come into government and im in government now you know im running this thing you find actually how much energy it needs to push things along and you need good people around you to help you push it along
2363276 its perfectly true that when i came in just as a short term measure i mean you know what plannings like its mega stuff youve got to look at big balsa wood models of new developments and youve got to get your head around the arguments so i said listen ive got a lot to do in the next couple of months so i did temporarily delegate my powers but ill be taking them back soon planning is central to my vision for london if youre going to build a wonderful site in the middle of london and youve got this epic opportunity to build something thats going to last for 100 years then for gods sake put something on it thats going to be worth looking at
2363277 a kind of garble that preserves intonation pitch and rhythm but erases content

2363289 we are providing more free debt advice and are working closely with lenders to ensure that repossession is only ever a last resort but it is important to remember that we are not seeing repossessions on the same scale as the early 1990s
2363290 for years house prices and personal debt were allowed to soar unchecked and ordinary families are now feeling the effects with rising mortgage repayments and sky high food and fuel costs it is little wonder that more and more peoples budgets have been driven to breaking point
2363291 these numbers remain extremely small when seen in the context of the 11 74m mortgages in the uk
2363292 the possession rate now is similar to that of the late 1990s but remains less than half the rate experienced in the early 1990s
2363293 with current fears that unemployment is set to grow there is no doubt we are inching ever closer to the dark days of the last repossession crisis
2363294 but the real horror is that today struggling homeowners have less protection than in the 1990s but most people dont even realise it
2363295 research by shelter shows 23 of mortgage payers think they would receive prompt state help if they could not pay their mortgage in reality because financial help for homeowners in difficulty was cut after the last housing crash nothing would kick in for nine months which is too late
2363296 beyonc knowles has been a spokesperson for the lor al paris brand since 2001
2363297 it is categorically untrue that lor al paris altered ms knowles features or skin tone in the campaign for f ria hair colour
2363298 there is no doubt that anyone seeing that ad will know that it is beyonc
2363299 skin is lighter than the way im used to seeing her
2363300 advertisers and magazines need to be careful about this even if its just a production process
2363301 our peacekeepers are waging a fierce battle with regular forces from the georgian army in the southern region of tskhinvali
2363302 one hundred and fifty russian tanks armoured personnel carriers and other vehicles have entered south ossetia this is a clear intrusion we have russian tanks on our territory jets on our territory in broad daylight
2363303 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2363304 my duty as russian president is to safeguard the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are we will not allow the deaths of our compatriots to go unpunished those guilty will receive due punishment
2363305 many russian volunteers intended to go to south ossetia and he said it was very difficult to maintain peace in the region
2363306 we are delighted with this outcome this is a judgment that allows turf tv to continue in business and maintains healthy competition in the supply of picture and data services
2363307 we were dealing with an entrenched monopoly supported by ladbrokes and william hills to an extraordinary extent
2363308 the tote are irredeamable sic bastards and everyone their sic should have been shot at birth members of the abb i dont think so
2363309 the resident homoeopath katie jermine quizzed me about my diet stress levels and lifestyle she then strapped on a wristband and plugged me into an electronic device called the quantum qxci which scanned my system for vitamins minerals food intolerances toxicity organ function hormone balance parasites digestive disorders and stress levels
2363310 the most advanced medical assessment and therapy device in the world today
2363311 technology attracts clients and charges are higher for practitioners who use state of the art assessment and therapy systems
2363312 i went into a decline every time i went on stage for the next 18 months those words came into my head and eventually i realised i needed to forgive him
2363313 i always thought that everything i wrote was completely forgettable so this is rather a boost
2363314 if i inspired a funny song then im very glad i am perhaps a kind of svengali to him
2363315 because they dont have any orifices but one of them looks just like margaret thatcher we thought they were meant for the fringe but then we figured they had been sent by chuck palahniuk as props
2363316 there are very smart temporary loos with chandeliers so we think it will be very glyndebourne
2363317 its ridiculous i must be a heck of a writer to produce a pornographic book without sex scenes my book is as realistic a portrayal as i could muster of the prophet muhammads harem and his domestic life of course it has sexuality but there is no sex
2363318 it was my hope that my book would develop empathy for this other culture
2363319 it has always rankled me the way history focuses on men and wars and mens politics and leaves women out i wanted to honour the women in muhammads life by giving them a voice
2363320 it is not just that there were issues with historical accuracy this was quite deliberately provocative she objectified the wife of the prophet as a sex object and made her violent as well
2363321 married at nine to the much older muhammad aisha uses her wits her courage and her sword to defend her first wife status even as muhammad marries again and again taking 12 wives and concubines in all
2363322 the pain of consummation soon melted away muhammad was so gentle i hardly felt the scorpions sting to be in his arms skin to skin was the bliss i had longed for all my life
2363323 denise says it is a declaration of war a national security issue
2363324 think it will be far more controversial than the satanic verses sic and the danish cartoons
2363325 it could incide acts of violence by a small radical segment
2363326 oh poverty crime homelessness drugs bad things those we should do something about them sometime
2363327 the research on the use of such technology shows that when it is well designed it can actually be better than teaching even by the best teachers
2363328 robots cant teach the only effective teaching is by breathing living teachers who can look a pupil in the eye and respond to them
2363329 use phonic knowledge to write simple words and make phonetically plausible attempts at more complex words
2363330 of course children might take to it but that does not necessarily mean its good for them three year olds should not be doing phonics they should do whats normal in nurseries singing rhyming and playing
2363331 im coming into the meet with goals i want to accomplish and thats all im worried about my goals are not public coach bob bowman and i are the only ones that know them
2363332 i like challenges i know there will be challenges and i look forward to rising to the occasion

2363354 i cant get into details about other folks that are interested in this technology but as you might imagine of course there is more interest out there
2363355 with six degrees of freedom you can basically make any movement at all and be able to track that in combination with the sensor bar and other sensors included in the wii remote add the gyroscope capability and you have the ability to work in all three dimensions of space

2363358 go on number three wake up five go on my son
2363359 this is a real community here and theyre destroying it look around you youve got all sorts four and five year old kids jumping up and down they wont do that in front of a computer screen
2363360 nearly a century of history so much of the old east end has already gone this place shutting down is a tragedy
2363361 not the sort of customer who was ever going to ensure its survival but when you hear its going its a side of london i love
2363362 because she isnt going to get the chance to see them here again
2363363 with my grandparents my parents i really will miss it theres such a buzz here a real electricity
2363364 itll tear the heart right out of this community rip it right out its a disgrace
2363365 people never retire from the stow ive got a colleague in her mid 80s i just think what am i going to do with my saturday night i love this place
2363366 at that time a working man couldnt get a legal bet except at a dog track he couldnt get credit at a bookmakers greyhound tracks were also a lot cheaper to get into than racetracks and far easier to get to
2363367 the problems started with the arrival of the betting shop in the mid 1960s
2363368 the popularity of the sport as a bet remains remarkably strong greyhound racing accounts for about a fifth of all betting shop turnover the problem is that fewer people are actually going to the tracks to bet now you can walk down to the high street bookies or place your bets on the internet or even through your television set
2363369 at home i feel 89 when im taking bets i feel 70
2363370 your choice for a night out was the dogs the cinema or the dance hall what cant young people do these days though mostly they sit in front of the telly and push buttons
2363371 is that these days theres no longer any money in cloth caps on the terraces you have to offer a leisure experience fine dining and excellent wines rather like the labour party you have to attract a more prosperous constituency football has done it
2363372 theyre faring modestly well tracks like yarmouth where you could now eat your dinner off the floor and peterborough poole sheffield belle vue there are new tracks being considered too
2363373 you can have a modest flutter a couple of quid the action is fast and furious you dont have to move from your seat in the restaurant if you take it seriously the betting side is a science of amazing proportions and the animals are of course absolutely wonderful
2363374 is now well on its way to being resolved 80 plus of retired racing dogs are now rehomed thats north of 8 000 animals a year and the others are put down by a licensed vet you really cant run a modern leisure business if theres any hint of cruelty attached to it i can now look at myself in the mirror without feeling ashamed which i couldnt five years ago
2363375 just wanted out and didnt particularly want there to be any greyhound racing in walthamstow after they have gone
2363376 has never made a loss and just look around you theres clearly a massive desire for this venue for people round here the stow is walthamstow attendances have been up for the last 18 months it needs to be brought up to date a bit and it needs to be managed better there are 800 jobs here it could do with half that

2363387 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public when a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story i used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it but being 99 honest is no longer enough

2363402 hosting an olympic games has been a century old dream for the chinese nation
2363403 for seven years the hearts of 1 3 billion chinese people have been pulsating in unison with the olympic movement the olympic spirit has soared to new heights on this vast land
2363404 i hope all the countries and all the nations are there watching and will learn where i came from

2363418 the benefits of investing in collectables as an alternative asset class have never been clearer not only do rare stamps and historical signatures provide a means of diversification and a safe haven in difficult economic conditions but also provide a hedge against inflation
2363419 we need to make restitution and make it promptly to those investors who find themselves trapped in this auction rate nightmare
2363420 the impact of the dispute on ability to remain on track with the development of new fields in terms of investments and implementation including adequate staffing
2363421 corporate governance issues of the magnitude that tnk bp is facing are not commensurate with an investment grade rating
2363422 does not have any major concerns at this point about the way the company will operate in the next couple of months without a ceo in russia executive responsibilities are clearly defined and the operations in the field which are the most important thing are performing well
2363423 it appears that the shareholders dispute is now having an impact on important external perceptions of the company
2363424 id certainly like to see sir steve redgrave perform this
2363425 these paddles by the way are very very heavy we appreciate the precision and energy of these movements
2363426 it has been a chastening experience and reporting a loss is something i and my colleagues regret very much
2363427 we are deeply disappointed to be announcing these results and apologise for the pain this has caused our shareholders
2363428 were in the middle of a financial markets crisis the industry is in a tight place and as a major participant in the industry we are in a tight place we are not alone in having taken write downs
2363429 i wont do this job forever but right now you will find me extremely galvanised to do the task at hand
2363430 we reiterate our view that rbs has absolutely no need to sell rbs insurance
2363431 at the very same time that non uk companies like google and apple are free to build market dominating positions online in the uk without so much as a regulatory murmur
2363432 the competition commissions questions have revealed a number of important issues which are outstanding between the parties and which they have indicated they are unable to resolve without further negotiation
2363433 half of me was going to dig my heels in and not even come in for questioning at all
2363434 not after the way i had been treated by the police the last time with all the leaks to the press but then i think ok lets just play it straight let the police do their job
2363435 yeah of course i didnt protect the brand if i had been a bit more savvy and protected the brand id still be on television
2363436 its getting even worse the estate agents are getting people and even those who have already agreed to buy property asking what they should do
2363437 its definitely having an effect anything that makes people unsure about buying freezes the market
2363438 we do have to make sure that we look at what will have the best impact on helping the housing market move again

2363447 we dont want a monoculture of heather or of grouse many people have a potential interest in the uplands farmers foresters keepers wildlife enthusiasts tourists we are working towards a sustainable way of managing geltsdale to meet those different needs
2363448 we recognise the biodiversity achievements of many shooting moors and like it or not their style of intensive grouse moor management is not going to go away
2363449 but the moorland associations own figure of shooting contributing 12 5m a year to the rural economy is hardly staggering compared to the huge economic potential of tourism
2363450 well weve recorded 96 species breeding on geltsdale this year
2363451 that slight banking on the moor edge above was the tramway from the mine where stephensons rocket worked in its retirement
2363452 this is robust science and it is important that this sort of monitoring continues
2363453 the question was posed by david miliband when he was environment secretary what are the uplands for our moor is going to be part of the answer
2363454 in the evening standard of august 6 we stated that the duke of edinburgh had been diagnosed as suffering from cancer of the prostate we now accept that the story was untrue and that he is not suffering from any such condition
2363455 we unreservedly apologise both to him and to his family for making this distressing allegation and for breaching his privacy
2363456 this complaint reveals the clear advantages of coming to the pcc with complaints of privacy intrusion
2363457 the process has been quick the final settlement was negotiated less than 36 hours after the original complaint was made
2363458 this is one of the most spectacular finds in europe
2363459 it is sensational to discover a near complete skeleton is unique in romania and a rarity in the world
2363460 we used to get about one or two repos a month now were seeing one or two a week
2363461 but were all going to be learning a little about diving in the next few weeks
2363462 we all think he can win he has as good a chance as anybody there will be no one out there that hes competing against that he hasnt beaten already he is excited but determined to do the best he can for himself his family and his country
2363463 thats a good sign because he usually calls when hes homesick i dont want to be phoning him too much because he might start missing home which affects his training
2363464 ive been in touch with them and theyre loving it the british diving team is a close group so well all be cheering for them
2363465 people are coming and giving it a go thats what sport and the olympics is about people being inspired to take part
2363466 we were there scratching our heads looking into the trenches thinking this could be it
2363467 so we did some more research and then we found the angled walls
2363468 other theaters of similar vintage also have angled walls so the discovery was significant
2363469 its in the right place its at the right angle to be a polygonal shape
2363470 the greatest surprise of all even for me after eight years spent working as a film critic has been the sustained level of intensely sadistic brutality throughout the film
2363471 the dark knight is a superhero movie and the violence it contains exists within that context
2363472 watching screen violence had changed the frontal lobe brain function of normal adolescents to be more like that of the children with disruptive brain disorders
2363473 the housing market has returned to earth fast and hard
2363474 in the markets conditions which many of us had already described as the worst in a generation took a turn for the worse
2363475 one of the worst fannie mae has experienced on the debt and equity markets
2363476 neither of these companies have properly provisioned for what were heading into
2363477 this thing is going to get worse and last longer and deeper than they originally thought
2363478 the financial sector crisis is now spilling into the real economy its not out of the woods
2363479 from the survey it is clear that 2008 bookings remain strong there are fewer discounts being offered in the late market consumers are upgrading to longer haul and all inclusive products and 2009 bookings are up
2363480 with our survey pointing towards a solid end to the 2008 summer season and even some early positive booking signs for 2009 we see scope for some near term share price upside
2363481 for summer 2008 we think that trading has remained healthy
2363482 i loved him so much that i would ski naked down mt everest with a carnation up my nose if he asked me to
2363483 i couldnt move she grabbed the top of my pyjamas and tore them from my body until i was naked i didnt wish it to happen i was extremely depressed and upset after being forced to have sex
2363484 methinks the mormon doth protest too much you have seen the size of mr anderson and you have seen the size of my client
2363485 are you going to ask me about my dogs or not because thats all im prepared to talk to you about
2363486 if that is what you want to talk about then i dont want to talk to you
2363487 drill here drill now drill here drill now four legs good two legs bad
2363488 the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking
2363489 want americans to move to the urban core live in tenements take light rail to their government jobs
2363490 mr bush is the triumph of the seemingly average american man
2363491 hes not an intellectual intellectuals start all the trouble in the world
2363492 if theres a fire on the block hell run out and help
2363493 so the g o p has found its issue for the 2008 election for the next three months the party plans to keep chanting four legs good two legs bad
2363494 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
2363495 what i mean instead is that know nothingism the insistence that there are simple brute force instant gratification answers to every problem and that theres something effeminate and weak about anyone who suggests otherwise has become the core of republican policy and political strategy
2363496 in the case of oil this takes the form of pretending that more drilling would produce fast relief at the gas pump
2363497 the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking
2363498 sad to say the current drill and burn campaign is getting some political traction according to one recent poll 69 percent of americans now favor expanded offshore drilling and 51 percent of them believe that removing restrictions on drilling would reduce gas prices within a year
2363499 the headway republicans are making on this issue wont prevent democrats from expanding their majority in congress but it might limit their gains and could conceivably swing the presidential election where the polls show a much closer race
2363500 we would never disrespect authority or disrespect brown theres no way in the world
2363501 you dont go to jail because you like different restaurants do you
2363502 you feel that youre entitled to the favor of god to do things other people cant do

2363506 it means a lot to me to be going to notre dame
2363507 i know that when i graduate from there a lot of doors will be opened for me that wouldnt have been opened if i had chosen to go somewhere else for football it is a great place but it is a lot more than that and all of that weighed into my decision
2363508 every program has its ups and downs and some could say that notre dame has been down
2363509 but if you look at the people the program has coming in they are going to be back on top very soon a big part of me going there is that i wanted to be there for when notre dame is back on top and i think that will happen in my time there
2363510 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it
2363511 i read that she was checked out and cleared afterwords
2363512 and she hadnt had any reported problems during that two week span
2363513 that one is out there like he hit her and she lost her baby
2363514 it was a week later he knocked her mirror off her car rampage said and hell tell you when you talk to him i care about everybody i care about all life i would never hurt anybody
2363515 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it
2363516 why did you call cps child protective services on me
2363517 i would like to see these items addressed before i put this place on the market
2363518 when i saw the pictures in the papers i was absolutely baffled
2363519 i thought surely no member of the public is going to believe that a board game could be used as a weapon
2363520 could be used to conceal someones identity or could be used in the course of a criminal act
2363521 a beard can conceal someones identity are the police going to start banning beards
2363522 when we watched the news there was this endless sense of frustration and disbelief that despite the mass marches and protests we were off to war
2363523 we thought it was a ridiculous process that needed to be ridiculed
2363524 the manager of the local borders bookshop in cambridge thought it was a great idea and wanted to trial it
2363525 a day before it was due to appear head office said not to stock it that happened time and time again
2363526 we dont censor our products the game just wasnt selling
2363527 this is to acknowledge with grateful thanks your contribution to mrs churchills red cross aid to russia fund
2363528 the uk does remain subject to high levels of covert non military activity by foreign intelligence organisations they are increasingly combining traditional intelligence methods with new technical attacks for example attempting to penetrate computer networks via the internet
2363529 theres a whole range of issues ive got problems with the whole wording issue and some of the politicians that are going to be there i think the council have made a real mess of it altogether
2363530 i would love to see everyone there on friday as a council we have tried to do our best to mark the anniversary
2363531 i realise its a sensitive time and different people will react differently but i cant legislate for how some families are going to react
2363532 i very much respect the decision of individual family members not to attend
2363533 concerned that the decision to withdraw this funding will have wide implications
2363534 let me assure you that this decision has not been taken lightly and does not in any way detract from what urban concepts has achieved
2363535 everyone involved with dont trigger was totally shocked by the decision to stop our funding especially as we had been held up as a great example of a grass roots project the government have asked the community to come forward and get involved in efforts to cut gun and knife crime and thats exactly what we are doing without the funding we are finished
2363536 there is a real turn off factor among young people when they know a message comes from the government
2363537 our message is so effective because people in the community know us and respect the work we do
2363538 this was a deliberate attack requiring a long chase with revenge in mind
2363539 it was an attack carried out without any regard to the standards and rules that we live by and no thought for the victim his friends and his family
2363540 the public have every right to be concerned about the increase growth of this sort of violence
2363541 it is a tragedy that this sort of triviality caused such a young man to lose his life and has caused enduring heartache to his friends and family
2363542 martin was a charming loving boy who has left us with cherished memories that will remain with us for ever
2363543 the pain that martins death has caused for our family is indescribable life will never be the same a piece of our heart has been taken
2363544 we as a family will never make sense of the unnecessary suffering that was inflicted upon martin it was extremely sad to be burying martin at the tender age of 14
2363545 then i saw what seemed to be a stabbing motion rather than a punching motion four or five times in very rapid succession
2363546 martin probably did not know when he began running away that he was running for his life pursued for such a distance by these defendants on cycles and mopeds
2363547 this is such a case which leads from dirty looks to death in one hour
2363548 this is a tragic case and the impact on martins family and friends cannot be quantified
2363549 the murder of martin highlights the potential fatal consequences that may result from carrying knives and other weapons in this case an innocuous meeting of two groups of youths escalated in to a series of confrontations resulting in martins tragic murder
2363550 the investigation into martins murder has established that any of those youths involved in these confrontations could just have likely become the victim in this case
2363551 i never say anything bad about the people ive slept with and i never go with married men
2363552 i stood up and started to peel of my clothes right down to my black lace underwear we then ended up making love in all sorts of positions
2363553 as i sat there topless he began to kiss and caress my boobs then i took down his baggy jeans and showed him the time of his life
2363554 i was down in london at a show called the pepsi chart show and i got invited backstage to meet him we got to talking and then i ended up going back to his hotel room it was all a bit of a shock because id never met any celebrities before
2363555 it wasnt until a few days after i told my best friend and he said you should phone the tabloids
2363556 they all just sort of happened i was in hollywood looking for modelling and acting work and i just seemed to end up at the same parties as a lot of celebrities a lot of girls get star struck but ive never been like that so i always ended up going over and talking to them or having a drink with them they key is to get evidence that you can show to the papers so i always get a picture or make sure we swap numbers apart from that its just like a normal one night stand only they are with celebrities
2363557 i would really like to have relationships with some of the famous men ive slept with but it is difficult as they are always too busy so i think i may as well make some money out of it as far as im aware none of the celebrities ive ever sold stories on has ever been angry about it
2363558 my mum doesnt like the fact that i do it
2363559 when i did the first one my mum phoned me and asked me what i was playing at she didnt want me to do it but i told her im in a five star hotel im getting 10 000 and im going to be in the paper she didnt say much after that obviously no mum is going to be happy about it if i had a daughter i wouldnt let her do it
2363560 i know ive done it but i only do it for the money and the publicity its something i have done but i would never want my daughter to
2363561 i usually try not to tell any new boyfriends too much about my kiss and tells i dont think its a big deal and its in the past although when i met kenny i told him i was a kiss and tell girl
2363562 no you did not the first i heard was when i got a phone call telling me you were trying to sell the story on me
2363563 i dont really know how we ended up in a relationship after that i suppose i just really like kenny
2363564 you sail the boat and then the weather closes in then something needs fixing and then the weather closes in again
2363565 the problems have not been the ones we would have expected that my health would not be good enough and that i would not be up to it as a sailor
2363566 behind these figures are thousands of families facing sleepless nights worrying about how to make their next mortgage payment many thousands more will be waking up to the frightening reality of repossession the government urgently needs to step in
2363567 i have said on a number of occasions that we are looking at all the options and stamp duty is one of them but ive also always said that stamp duty and removing it in itself may not kick start the market in the way that people think it might stamp duty represents a small amount of the upfront costs so we have to look at all these issues
2363568 bumped into making a decision before the pre budget report
2363569 what we have done is put 10m behind more debt advice for people 90 per cent of our county courts now have free legal advice and we know that if people get the right advice something like 85 per cent of repossessions can be avoided but we are also looking at more ways in which we can help people facing difficulties

2363575 we are all thrilled and flattered to have the opportunity to work with dennis there is a certain leap of faith involved in choosing a producer dennis outstanding track record and reputation serve to make that leap awfully exciting i do believe the end product will be some very special recordings

2363577 we went into the studio with the mindset of making our heaviest record yet but the record that came out has flavors of and straight up blues we didnt use the same rigs that we use onstage we used all vintage guitars and amps and im pretty psyched about it the songs are pretty timeless in their texture

2363585 thats why i cant figure out what happened after that
2363586 we have 40 guys on our roster now that are entering year 4 or 5
2363587 the challenge is to make sure they dont come back and think same old same old
2363588 i think thats fair we havent been successful on that stage
2363589 should that paint a picture of our whole conference i dont think so
2363590 if he stays healthy hes in line to be our all time leading rusher
2363591 dozens of puppies will compete in athletic events including swimming amp gymnastics
2363592 capital murder is a crime where the grand jury can do either one of two things they can sentence them to life in prison without parole or die by lethal injection
2363593 the legislature passed a law that states committing a murder in a vehicle is punishable by death
2363594 they say theyre doing certain things but those things dont come into fruition
2363595 theres only so much time we can spend on this contract before we move on
2363596 i think the county is calling them repairs to the system

2363600 i cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article of the constitution which granted a right to congress of expending on objects of benevolence the money of their constituents
2363601 as long as we recognize the power within us we will continue to have choices and we will continue to lead
2363602 a war dance of the handmaidens of the oil companies
2363603 you have to know what youre talking about you cant grandstand
2363604 theyll have to use their imagination as to how they can get a vote
2363605 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling
2363606 in the same breath that theyre said to be apolitical theyre said to be a celebration of human rights and theyre said to be a sporting festival we hope that can transcend mere sporting festivals
2363607 i think when we talk about the crisis in darfur we talk about the millions of innocent people that are suffering there and we talk about the positive role that china could play should they choose to and the rest of the international community i mean these people have been failed i think at every level
2363608 chinese authorities have in the past cracked down prior to big international events
2363609 for all those reasons and the fact that georgia has demonstrated that it is a close ally we cannot simply sit by and say so be it what does south ossetia mean to us
2363610 these attacks mark a dangerous and disproportionate escalation of tension as they occur across georgia in regions far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia
2363611 we are asking our friends and the united states among them to somehow to try to mediate and try to persuade russia to stop this military aggression and invasion of georgia
2363612 im spread between several other investments and personal obligations at the moment so bringing aboard an investor or chef with a stake in the restaurant makes sense

2363614 just spotted the notice to vacate sign attached to the front door of the shut down in early july but literally nothing has moved inside tables are still set lights still dimly lit bottles still on shelves etc i heard that they may have had their lease terminated over failure to pay rent for the last few months
2363615 the sentiments of dying sinners who have neglected the care of their souls during life are like those of the damned who mourn in hell over their sins as the cause of their sufferings but mourn without fruit and without remedy
2363616 it was a great way to start especially against them
2363617 theyve got a great defense and theyre strong up front weve had some trouble starting out well on the road in the past but i thought this was a great start and a lot to be happy about
2363618 considering he wasnt a center until three weeks ago id say he did fine
2363619 thats what the preseason is for to work these kinks out
2363620 there are things we need to improve on and this will be a good measuring stick
2363621 our first unit early on we moved the ball pretty well and kind of mistake free there
2363622 thats one of the things you look for in an early preseason game and i like the way we ran the ball
2363623 we feel very comfortable with our running game but we wanted to get our pass game a fresh start
2363624 i know how much he wanted to get back and was very excited about finally feeling healthy twins manager ron gardenhire said
2363625 it cant be much fun for mike i feel really bad for him because hes a gamer and wants to play
2363626 the ingredients of the macmurray man are paradoxical but consistent brittle cheerfulness an anxious smile that subsides into slyness a voice that tries to be jocular and easygoing but comes out fradulent the semblance of a masculine carriage that turns insubstantial and shifty in other words macmurray is a romantic lead built on quicksand a hero compelled to betray a lover likely to desert
2363627 here are four memorable versions of a counterfeit nice guy in which the crispness of a new bank note turns sodden and limp once it is put down with spilt gin
2363628 i held off saying i would do it because in the first place i wasnt sure that i was able to never having done anything like that type before and then also i thought people arent going to like me if i kill somebodys husband
2363629 was macmurrays grinning guy next door affability he wasnt glamorous and aristocratic or rugged or callow what he was purely indistinguishably was american fred macmurray could play a glad handing everyday salesman in billys mind at least he would be perfect as a scheming killer on the make
2363630 a spectator in the scene of life both in his work and in personal relations he seemed strangely to have retired within himself

2363659 i always said i never wanted to win i was actually dreaming about walking up that pearly staircase all week
2363660 clearly jen and i have a lot of talking to do
2363661 i made some real friends in there but with jen well she became more than a friend but i dont wanna sound cheesy
2363662 i was worried about what shed read about me in the press or see on tv which might change her mind about me
2363663 when stu came in and jen got all girlie over him i thought are you mugging me off
2363664 it became quite clear what big brother was up to the last thing i wanted was to be is trying to compete for a girl in front of millions of viewers
2363665 i would like to let the whole world know that there is a large scale military aggression going on against georgia
2363666 during the last minutes and hours georgia has been bombed from the russian federations side populated areas peaceful spaces have been bombed and this is nothing less than international aggression in its classical sense
2363667 responding to the unilateral cease fire declared by president saakashvili and his offer for peace talks and negotiations the separatists launched artillery fire against the villages of tamarasheni and prisi
2363668 according to our data there are casualties amongst the peaceful population
2363669 this was a planned action these speeches about peace and friendship and not restarting military action were simply a smokescreen after which followed what we see today
2363670 we hope that the georgian side will reconsider and return to the negotiating table although a lot of blood has been shed
2363671 grenade launchers were fired on the city center everything was in flames the center was burning we gathered the whole film crew and left at 6 a m we arrived at a village called java but within 40 minutes su 25 jets flew over the village they circled twice over it and the third time they started bombing us one of the bombs exploded 25 meters from our vehicle
2363672 on the day of the opening of the olympics on the eve of the olympics the georgian leadership undertook highly aggressive actions toward south ossetia
2363673 they in fact began military action with heavy arms fire artillery and tanks there are casualties dead and wounded and there are casualties among the russian peacekeepers it is very sad it is very alarming and of course it will lead to a response
2363674 as a result of all of these actions tbilisi the georgian leadership has completely lost its credibility as a responsible party in the negotiation process and in international relations according to the principles of the united nations
2363675 huge numbers of south ossetia residents are leaving for russian territory
2363676 in principle those who want to leave leave and those who dont stay and pray that nothing terrible happens to them
2363677 we see panic rising among the population and the number of refugees trying to save their own lives and the lives of their children and families growing
2363678 pull back from the brink of a full fledged war
2363679 not allow the death of our compatriots to go unpunished
2363680 im quite appalled by the accident rate on the roads especially among young men
2363681 it comes from poor judgment peer pressure or social driving late at night
2363682 last weekend was fantastic for bookings many consumers probably waited for their july pay day before making their decision
2363683 we believe we know who is doing what and how they are doing it
2363684 there are mr bigs but the person you start out thinking of as the mr big is quite often not
2363685 the coalition leadership believes that it has become imperative to move for impeachment under article 47 against general musharraf
2363686 the pakistani military can see that the pakistani people decided in favor of the democratic forces and against the dictatorial elements in februarys elections
2363687 so in these conditions the military is definitely expected to respect the peoples verdict
2363688 settle disputes through the political process instead of through violence
2363689 russian peacekeepers did everything to make the georgian side stop firing mortars grenade launchers and large caliber weapons on the city of tskhinvali
2363690 but the firing didnt cease and we were forced to return fire we will now do our best to suppress this
2363691 they came up with a new method they shoot at us from civilian objects from schools and hospitals so that in case of return fire that causes damages they can present it as a barbarian act by the georgians
2363692 this is indeed a barbarian act on their part because they carry out their propaganda at the expense of the life health and well being of residents
2363693 im sure that the deepening of the confrontation is not in the russian federations interests it is certainly not in georgias interests
2363694 what is happening now is the result of a long standing policy of hysterical militarization of constant war rhetoric of the militaristic propaganda waged by russian television over the past few days over this tiny region that is home to just 30 000 people
2363695 those who have pursued this policy all these years are responsible for all of this
2363696 i was absolutely horrified when i logged on and was faced with an advert for free vibrators
2363697 it certainly wasnt what i had been expecting and im just glad i got there first before my kids decided to take a look

2363703 you have me and you were messing with those syanks
2363704 you forgot one representative foley from florida he had a thing for little boys a few years ago
2363705 the real travesty of all of this is that the offenses for which mr hamdan was found not guilty were the only offenses that he was charged with initially back in 2004 he was acquitted of all those
2363706 the only specifications he was convicted of are offenses that were added after the fact by the military commissions act of 2006 long after he was confined here in guantanamo bay
2363707 a trial that depends on handicapping the defense cant possibly be fair
2363708 mr hamdan did receive a full and fair trial he was convicted of material support to terrorism five specifications out of eight that he was charged with and as we can see the military commissions process is moving forward
2363709 what were seeing suggests there may be a social connectivity constant for humanity
2363710 people have long had this suspicion that we are really close
2363711 it will be much bigger and just how top soccer stars would like a betting shop to be
2363712 it is not unusual to see several of the players flashy gas guzzlers parked outside the old shop
2363713 i am offering you an immediate cease fire and immediate talks
2363714 i reiterate my plan which was put forward three years ago and which was improved in the following years of virtually unlimited autonomy and self administration for south ossetia
2363715 we will try not to return fire coming from the separatists
2363716 we have already shown such goodwill in the past however this goodwill has not been taken adequately
2363717 during our meeting the general and i spoke in detail about the current situation
2363718 the general is also concerned about the current situation and he says the only way to stop the escalation is through a direct dialogue a meeting he is very disappointed with the refusal of the separatists to take part in the meeting
2363719 russian peacekeepers did everything to make the georgian side stop firing mortars grenade launchers and large caliber weapons on the city of tskhinvali
2363720 but the firing didnt cease and we were forced to return fire we will now do our best to suppress this
2363721 they came up with a new method they shoot at us from civilian objects from schools and hospitals so that in case of return fire that causes damages they can present it as a barbarian act by the georgians
2363722 this is indeed a barbarian act on their part because they carry out their propaganda at the expense of the life health and well being of residents
2363723 im sure that the deepening of the confrontation is not in the russian federations interests it is certainly not in georgias interests
2363724 the situation in the conflict zone is extremely tense and requires immediate deescalation i have been in contact with tbilisi and tskhinvali today and urged them to stop all military action and reestablish direct contacts
2363725 i expressed concern that their representatives failed to meet today and reiterated an invitation to the parties to meet in helsinki as soon as possible i also plan to visit georgia in the near future

2363860 wayne swan and kevin rudd have spent every day since the election talking up inflation and talking down the economy this is the slowdown kevin rudd and wayne swan wanted us to have
2363861 attributing that kind of influence to the statements of the treasurer is just not credible

2363902 this tree was just growing taller and stronger above the rest of around it it was gorgeous
2363903 he was gone from the location of the incident before deputies arrived there were minor injuries but they did not require medical attention he was subsequently booked for misdemeanor spousal battery
2363904 the idea is to take a more sophisticated approach by not pandering to the audience
2363905 were not trying to reach everybody who could possibly be interested we will make it for fans of this type of music
2363906 music programming was never a big driver for vh1 it was about relationships cool content and doing a lot for brand
2363907 were looking at ratings as a longer term goal its more about the vibe and branding
2363908 what were after is the independent consumer and if they go to

2363918 if we can do more we just might ideally wed like to get multiple groups from w seattle together to create many parks at the alaska junction under one street use permit which makes it cheaper
2363919 like a preschool teacher youre always there to make it fun and exciting for the animals
2363920 twenty five years ago it was do the jump get the fish
2363921 today weve come so far now its do the jump get whatever you like
2363922 so today at the end of the day they are just as eager as they were at the beginning of the day twenty five years ago it was hey im full you want a ride across this pool call a cab the animals were just sated
2363923 aside from show behaviors all animals are taught husbandry behaviors
2363924 the aerials are really exciting for the crowds and the trainers too but what a trainer finds most exciting is when a young whale learns those little behaviors for this first time
2363925 if you can train the animal to be okay with these things the trainer knows that they will be okay with all the other things
2363926 its like watching a baseball game sure its nice to watch home runs but what gets parents most excited its seeing their kid get a hit for the first time

2363932 a lot of times with dogs you can say hey im in charge if you try that with these guys he pointed to the killer whales in the show pool behind him thats uh not going to work real well
2363933 after a session well pick apart everything that worked or didnt
2363934 you know rats and roaches are kind of obvious evidence that theres some sort of problem and consumers should take that into account but the problem that we see is that whats invisible to the naked eyes is often whats more dangerous to the human body
2363935 so we would like to see a very easy a b c letter grade system in the window that consumers can at a glance while theyre making a decision where to dine take into account
2363936 so that food safety is part of that decision instead of just whether it has a zagat guide rating and what kinds of credit cards it takes
2363937 they are able to amass a huge amount of money and using that money to go out and buy land to do their marijuana cultivation

2363941 theres no way of them knowing who the buyer is

2363945 first and foremost is to stay healthy and try to regain that form from last year giving me something to look forward to next year i wouldnt wish what has happened to me this year on my worst enemy
2363946 i consider this season to be a little bump in the road in my career and i hope it makes me stronger physically and mentally all the way around
2363947 for this first time since being injured the first time i got loose like in six pitches
2363948 i felt good warming up and had a good fastball coming into the game it felt like it was coming out of hand really nice smooth and effortless
2363949 the biggest thing is just building that arm strength back once you get your arm strength back the secondary pitches are going to be better
2363950 fastball command you can always work on no matter how much strength you have in your arm but the offspeed pitches and the secondary pitches are the ones that suffer when you dont have the arm strength and once you get your arm strength back its naturally going to bring confidence in those pitches
2363951 and the split that he threw to dioner navarro was really a great pitch and the fastball to cliff floyd those two pitches were as good as it gets hopefully we can get that on a more consistent basis and for two or three days in a row like im sure you guys were used to seeing last year
2363952 but a 98 mph fastball down the middle doesnt do me any good i still have to pitch and i was able to make pitches the last couple of outings
2363953 theres surely no shortage of ink spilled on the topic of actors pairing with other actors on screen or off tracey with hepburn bogie with bacall redford and newman brangelina the rags have long chattered endlessly about these duets
2363954 but what of the relationship between directors and their favourite frequently employed actors
2363955 beijing you are host to the present and gateway to the future
2363956 this is a very good opportunity to show chinese strength to westerners the government wants to show that theyve exceeded all the previous olympics
2363957 dont you know you have to say good morning to senior students
2363958 do a hot hindi movie song for us show some moves
2363959 go now and dont breathe a word to anybody that we ragged you
2363960 i dont have much expectation for the singing and the dancing but from the behavior of the athletes and the volunteers i hope they can show the new look of china
2363961 definitely there will be nothing like chinas old sick man in asia image
2363962 the olympic songs i dont feel very good about it sounds like some prostitutes are trying to attract business
2363963 but china has walked out of national crises and reached todays achievement we are going to attend the world affairs and write the history of the world together with other countries china has been reborn instead of being very careful in front of foreigners
2363964 its not easy for china to develop to this level with that big a population this is the first time weve hosted such a big world event
2363965 when our employees become proficient in english and assimilate into our society it benefits the company the community and the individual everyone gains
2363966 u s business and hispanic integration expanding the economic contributions of immigrants
2363967 we believe that this is a substantial opening of pennsylvania avenue to the public
2363968 many people would think that i was a crazy woman i dont care i will do whatever it takes to find her
2363969 i still cannot believe that this happened its a nightmare i still cant comprehend how it happened
2363970 jeddah will be found its just a matter of time
2363971 its really been this organic event people who get it we all understand that love
2363972 you can go at your own pace and its quicker
2363973 i didnt know if i should do it but then i realized it was easier than taking the full course
2363974 this is a stopgap measure at helping these students get a high school diploma its certainly not going to help them go onto post secondary education which really should be our goal
2363975 if the students in prince william are simply trying to get through and some of our students are not as highly motivated as we might want them to be and it helps them get matriculated through then thats a good thing
2363976 it doesnt help their gpa at all we just give them a pass a standard credit
2363977 were trying to keep kids from getting a ged not that thats totally crippling but its better for them to have a diploma in their hand a lot of the seniors i talked to after they passed their course they went across the street and signed up
2363978 i can imagine that those last moments were unpleasant and thats an understatement
2363979 i dont know how to ask for forgiveness for something i didnt do
2363980 i feel embarrassed i feel like ive disgraced my family name
2363981 i didnt do this god willing ill find a way to prove my innocence
2363982 as soon as we heard about it we put fixes in
2363983 they authorize it almost immediately which is really perplexing what is the point
2363984 these requirements were not mandated by cms and are not a federal requirement
2363985 they dont have a good reason for what theyre doing
2363986 patients have been suffering the consequences of this whole switch
2363987 im sure we may be looking at it because of this tragedy
2363988 since theyve come to seattle this is really the first incident and certainly the first fatality connected to pedicabs
2363989 the recorder is in better condition than we hoped given the condition of the crash site
2363990 escape windows seat belts and other factors that would tell us something about the difficulties passengers would have had evacuating the aircraft
2363991 urine soaked to the extent that you opened a door and just sort of gagged
2363992 ive heard all the yapping but ive never realized they had that many dogs
2363993 when there is parvo you bleach everything you clean it you scrub it
2363994 so that kind of thing is just not safe for the kids
2363995 i think they should be punished to the limit and they should never have any more
2363996 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years
2363997 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2363998 when you crawl in bed with someone you not only need to think about your wife and kids
2363999 but you need to think how it affects the livelihood of people who are in the trenches and stand on the porches of voters and say it cant be
2364000 had this party in his hands he was wildly popular and all the time in the back of his head he knew the other shoe would drop
2364001 how do you go out and ask people to be part of your vision
2364002 egregious even predatory because his wife was suffering from a very serious condition and nationally they put themselves out there as the family
2364003 whats particularly disturbing is that john edwards put himself out there as a populist an angry fighter for the ordinary person whom politicians have been so out of touch with
2364004 he was their guy their champion the person who would give them a voice
2364005 the idea for many democrats was that he and obama would stay together and he would end up as attorney general
2364006 hell be lucky if he gets away with his car his hairbrush and his travel bag
2364007 i dont think theres any coincidence he decided to put this out between news regarding the trade of quarterback brett favre and the beginning of the olympics late on a friday afternoon
2364008 the story was a fire that either had to be extinguished or as the case turned out to be the damage limited by getting this out right now
2364009 engaging in the proverbial casting of stones by those living in glass houses
2364010 wild hair eyes that shifted their colour standing in front of an old church saying fantastic things making fantastic claims
2364011 i was coming up on 30 id never lived abroad i had japanese friends and friends whod gone to japan to teach and they seemed to have been enriched by the experience essentially this was the easiest option
2364012 she sort of came into my mind and would not let go of me
2364013 this truly is my natural state the natural rhythm i fall into
2364014 i like the quiet the opportunity to focus without the distractions of the day
2364015 its a choice based upon the fact im a much better person when i dont drink
2364016 it would be a more interesting environment in which to observe me and about which to write my winnipeg existence is a much narrower experience
2364017 you get the impression andrew is creating defensive positions around certain things and people that he feels he may have to defend
2364018 if anything i write to entertain myself i want to create situations that compel me to keep writing to find out what happens next and if i do maybe the reader will have that feeling too
2364019 not having a sack of bad poetry hanging around theres always more words coming better words
2364020 there was stuff in my manuscript that didnt belong that somewhere in there was the novel i wanted it to become
2364021 i thought the agent who represents fforde is someone id be interested in being represented by
2364022 it would be an egregious lapse of judgment for you to represent me allow me to outline 10 reasons why
2364023 there are hundreds of literary agents in toronto and new york and my assumption is if one says i kinda like this but no thanks you simply try the next one and so on
2364024 at that point my through line became whatever doesnt drive the plot forward gets taken out
2364025 in this case here was a gimmick backed by a degree of execution and intelligence that was very attractive
2364026 extremely confident id be published somewhere eric was this kind of gate and if you could walk through that door you knew you had a very good chance of entering a new world
2364027 some books just feel right right from the get go this was one of them
2364028 anne provided invaluable assistance in the first real extensive editing process with a real editor
2364029 certainly i could have told them before then but i was still trying to sort it out for myself
2364030 theres nothing shy about andrews writing he grabs the reader by the lapel and just doesnt pull him close he slams his face down on the burning hot element of an electric stove as actually happens on page four of the gargoyle then having unleashed these pyrotechnics he proceeds to tell an engrossing story its one thing to have chops and another to have something to say and still another to have a yarn to spin really i think hes a writer of limitless cleverness
2364031 im obviously very pleased that my novel will be read by a number of people and hopefully theyll enjoy it and find some value in it
2364032 but writing for me never was a destination that was going to be arrived at when i got published
2364033 nothing traduces the power of the original more egregiously than the nonstyle cultivated by the sundry modern versions
2364034 the greatest vehicle of mass literacy in the english speaking world has been the king james bible
2364035 though i speak with the tongue of men and of angels and have not charity i am become as sounding brass or a tinkling symbol
2364036 for reasons of public safety we ask the public not to run or obstruct the runners
2364037 the subjective living body becomes both representation and representative encouraging consideration of diversity vulnerability and the individual in contemporary society
2364038 he just gives it 110 percent every single time i ask
2364039 im so grateful that barkley gets to have the surgery and enjoy his retirement
2364040 rudy is a family pet he doesnt go anywhere but hes part of the family
2364041 we really got input from people in the community mothers who have delivered here
2364042 and we worked very closely with the staff in labor and delivery now to really incorporate their ideas into the design
2364043 they are able to amass a huge amount of money and using that money to go out and buy land to do their marijuana cultivation
2364044 this year were probably going to surpass 2007 easily just given the way were starting
2364045 the yakima valley is a huge player these are big operations that are difficult to track down
2364046 they use fictitious names they put property in daughters wives names to conceal identity and try to thwart law enforcement from going forward with civil forfeiture
2364047 theres no way of them knowing who the buyer is
2364048 medical emergencies in federal inspection areas dont happen very often but when they do it is certainly critical that we respond immediately to keep the person alive until the cavalry arrives
2364049 in this case we were very fortunate that officers were able respond in a timely way and perform the correct procedure until help arrived
2364050 theres a certain sense of pride and accomplishment any time you can help save someones life
2364051 the original plan was to have the baby on her due date which was the fourth of august
2364052 but if we went a week past the doctor said we were going to have to have a c section
2364053 then last night things got a little exciting and i started contracting
2364054 we were all kind of joking about it how amazing would that have been
2364055 i wasnt induced it was all natural it just happened
2364056 i have dreamed of you so much have walked so much talked so much slept so much with your phantom that perhaps the only thing left for me is to become a phantom among phantoms a shadow a hundred times more shadow than the shadow that moves and goes on moving brightly over the sundial of your life
2364057 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2364058 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2364059 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2364060 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2364061 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it
2364062 when you look into a mirror do you like whats looking at you now that youve seen your true reflections what on earth are you gonna do
2364063 i actually walked the country to see who i am who i really am but i dont know what the result of that will be 140 fourth ave north suite 370
2364064 we were a little leg tired today but that is usually the case the first day after two a days
2364065 the enthusiasm was there and that was important overall it was a good workout
2364066 clemson is looking for a snapper to replace three year starter colin leonard
2364067 i am also very interested to see the freshmen perform in that stadium they have done well as a class so we will see how they do in that situation as i said yesterday i think we could play 8 11 freshmen this year
2364068 i think the trend in stocks is up i do feel that july 15 represented the bottom for stocks and we are going to move higher
2364069 i really feel that what investors are looking for right here is signs that the economy is starting to pick up right now
2364070 it looks like we are finally getting the break weve been waiting for in terms of slowing down the inflation spiral that has been taking place
2364071 you have a tremendous rise in the dollar and thats putting pressure on crude oil which is helping to buoy u s equity markets
2364072 clearly the economy is still weak some of the stimulus from the tax rebates is
2364073 i think the key to watch for is the unemployment number once you go above 6 percent the concerns about recession will go up
2364074 look at the prices of food around the world its unfair to look at just the price of oil as the leading indicator of where inflation trends may be
2364075 theres strong likelihood that the fed is going to have to start to raise interest rates to control inflation
2364076 for a long term investor id advocate slowly going back into commodities right now gold will be my favorite recommendation
2364077 i went to turn up and i just couldnt do what i normally did
2364078 weve talked about a two quarterback system and we knew this would be coming not quite in this form but we knew we wanted to develop ronnie so this is a blessing in a sense and also allows us to give locker a little bit of rest
2364079 that the marginal or maybe even non christian was the only one in the group who understood that ministers are human and fallible and are subject to sin like everybody else is
2364080 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2364081 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2364082 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2364083 my friends we will disagree on a specific issue and thats healthy
2364084 i dont believe in ethanol subsidies but i believe in renewable fuels
2364085 we dont need another politician in washington who puts self interest and political expediency ahead of problem solving
2364086 i will always always always put my country first i have done that from the time i was in prison and was offered a chance to go home before my comrades
2364087 i put my country first then and will continue to put country first
2364088 why were they up there doing aggressive suppression in the wilderness in the most remote rugged terrain far from any community or infrastructure
2364089 what kind of social or environmental benefit warranted the extreme risk those crews were ordered to take
2364090 i watched colin play in an intra squad game as well as one game each against sweden and finland colin is a clever offensive player with quick hands and excellent puck instincts he scored once in the scrimmage and again wednesday night versus sweden while being one of the more skilled players competing for a roster spot on the u s team we need to get colin stronger and thicker yet his natural talent is something to get excited about he will be a fun player to watch in rookie camp and when the big boys come out to play at our main training camp
2364091 everything is on schedule and there have been no setbacks
2364092 the mortality rate for adult bariatric obese patients currently stands at 2 percent within the first month after surgery
2364093 it reminds me a little of the city because of the retail space but theres a suburban feeling too
2364094 i lived in the city when i was young and this place brings back a little nostalgia for that
2364095 we were driving down route 1 and just saw the building when we walked in we just got a wonderful feeling
2364096 we downsized from a house so space was really important to us
2364097 i liked the location i liked the apartment and there are very nice people who live here
2364098 a few minor maintenance problems which were corrected very quickly
2364099 people will get their money and get it back in the immediate future
2364100 our leading position in supporting the market and providing liquidity is clear and now were the first firm to give all clients private corporate and institutional the opportunity to be made whole
2364101 there is a view that institutional clients ought to be sophisticated investors who knew what they were buying
2364102 i cant see why ubs would want to settle with institutional investors now that citigroup and merrill lynch have set the precedent
2364103 it would certainly be a concern as we did not expect them to repurchase all of those auction rate securities however it will also mean that the problem will be sorted out and the uncertainty wont drag on
2364104 consistently working with regulators toward a comprehensive solution for all auction rate securities people shares fell 1
2364105 security positions that have been held for less than 12 months
2364106 berkshire has the ability and intent to hold these securities until fair value recovers
2364107 well i think it is vital that whites who do this work be involved with other whites
2364108 well i understand what you re saying here though i think we have to be careful about the notion that by not getting paid for doing movement work that were somehow really doing something that is self sacrificing or noble
2364109 write essays about racism and white supremacy and post them on the internet
2364110 i want to at least signal that i do care about this discussion and id like a permanent record of my feelings on this to be out there for future reference when this stuff comes up as it will again and again i feel certain
2364111 see this notion is not something i came up with and especially not as some convenient or
2364112 the worst example of fucked up logic ive seen in a while
2364113 and i dont need anyones permission no damn fight for my own humanity against the system of whiteness whose purpose is to destroy it as it seeks to destroy people of color this aint charity work its self help
2364114 yahoo understands that the trust of our users is our greatest asset
2364115 which was released worldwide late july you can go and check out jamisons work
2364116 no permitiremos la muerte impune de nuestros compatriotas los culpables recibir n el merecido castigo

2364118 he sido testigo de c mo el pueblo con usted a la cabeza ha enfrentado con valent a y dignidad los ataques m s perversos provenientes de los poderes tradicionales internos confabulados con los intereses imperialistas
2364119 para ello han pretendido deslegitimar los procesos de cambio han provocado la ingobernabilidad han generado la violencia y ofendido la dignidad de los despose dos
2364120 se or presidente hermano y amigo en su lucha por la justicia la libertad y el bienestar del pueblo boliviano y por la dignidad de los pueblos originarios de am rica latina sirva la presente para reiterarle mi apoyo y solidaridad
2364121 after i moved my leg i saw another person down there who did not move at all
2364122 and when i saw the people coming out they could barely walk
2364123 i saw people taken out of the bus and they had already died
2364124 a man came out of the bus and said his wife had died
2364125 some learned that their loved ones might have died there were a lot of tears
2364126 dont talk to me about how healthy my baby is going to be since what i know you really mean is you think i am really fat and i dont want to talk about it
2364127 oh you must have big babies no i am fat and prego
2364128 necesitamos un permiso para este a o para seguir ocupando las fosas que se encuentran en malas condiciones porque no tenemos espacios les comente en reuni n de cabildos a los regidores y presidente que ya no se cuenta con m s espacios para mi representa un problema serio ya que fallecen entre 200 a 250 personas al a o entonces esta situaci n es muy preocupante no tan s lo para nosotros sino para toda la ciudadan a
2364129 anteriormente nosotros hab amos acudido a la ciudad de coatzacoalcos ante la jurisdicci n sanitaria n mero 11 para que nos diera permiso para las exhumaciones de las tumbas que tenemos y ser reconstruidas con el prop sito de ser ocupadas por lo que en la reciente reuni n de cabildos acordamos el enviar un oficio al congreso del estado para que ellos determinen si podemos llevar acabo las exhumaciones ya que as nos los indicaron las autoridades sanitarias
2364130 en ninguno de los dos panteones municipales se tiene suficiente espacio ya que las administraciones pasadas empezaron a vender los espacios a gentes particulares a las cuales a reserva de que iban a fallecer sus familiares compraron los espacios y pienso que fue un mal trabajo el que se hizo porque no se pens a futuro por lo que nosotros no vamos a vender ning n espacio en primera por que no lo tenemos por lo que las tumbas que ser n reconstruidas y ser n para las personas que vayan falleciendo
2364131 if you were a dragon in a flower bed what would you be doing
2364132 id be spinning and counting how many of each color flower passed by why all the dragon questions

2364134 the u s department of agriculture believes there are four stores that are involved but we have not been able to confirm which ones they are
2364135 while coleman natural beef is a relatively small supplier for whole foods market we are extremely disappointed that we must now question colemans assurances
2364136 mocks are not magical they are just a simple extension of fake test objects
2364137 i think hell continue to be angry because im still going to say it doesnt scale weekly
2364138 es dif cil etiquetar lo m s ex tico de todo pero lo m s caro y llamativo son los escorpiones vienen de a dos por palito y cuestan 70 pesos 4 70 cada uno mide unos 10 cent metros lo mord s claro pero hacerlo no es f cil primero piensas y el veneno tambi n te pasa por la mente que te picar en cuanto sienta la mordida es tan raro tener una brocheta de escorpi n en la mano que se olvida que est muerto de negro pasa a verde tras ser frito la cola es dura y realmente imposible de comer una vez que est en tu boca se pega al paladar agggg no tienen carne as que su piel cruje en los dientes y lo salado escalda la lengua es imposible comerlo todo no sabe bien y despu s de masticar tres patas parte del cuerpo y seguir sin encontrarle el sabor no vale la pena seguir poniendo cara de asco
2364139 lo que si comen y por montones son las de escarabajo res pollo y cordero que es carne muy suave a precios realmente baratos una brocheta de estas no s lo en el mercado de donghuamen sino en toda la ciudad cuesta tres pesos 20 c ntimos de y es f cil comerse hasta seis pues son peque as
2364140 las brochetas son para los chinos como los tacos para los mexicanos las hay desde dos pesos y las venden por todas partes desde puestos callejeros hasta restaurantes en sanlitun un barrio de bares hay carritos de brochetas como los de hot dog en los antros mexicanos venden por la noche y aunque no tienen mucha variedad de carne s venden las m s sabrosas en poco tiempo uno se hace fan
2364141 eso s a los chinos les ofende que una vez que se compraron se tiren o no se prueben pues casi siempre esperan que uno las muerda y est n a la expectativa de una expresi n de gusto por eso una vez que te acercas al puesto o carrito lo m s decente es comprar aunque sea una de dulce pues el postre tambi n lo montan en palillos y se puede escoger entre kivi y fresas gigantes encarameladas que por cierto son todo un xito entre los curiosos pues adem s de que est n buenas resaltan entre tanta carne para salvarse de dolores de est mago despu s de andar de curioso hay que seguir las reglas puesteras mexicanas es decir arriesgarse donde se vea m s gente
2364142 quiz s porque no me siento con las fuerzas suficientes y quiz s mi agobio llegue a extremos nada agradables
2364143 es una forma muy peculiar de decir porque la letra tiene su aquel y de la que me siento identificada quiz s porque no me apetece
2364144 perdonad por no postear estos d as pero estoy de vacaciones joderos los que no ten is espero que vosotros tambi n est is disfrutando de ellas etc etc etc
2364145 me hace falta urgentemente una webcam para una videoconferencia que tengo que hacer el lunes
2364146 si te llevas un libro a un viaje sucede algo muy extra o el libro empezar a atesorar tus recuerdos m s tarde te bastar con abrirlo para trasladarte al lugar donde lo le ste por vez primera y con las primeras palabras recordar s todo las im genes los olores el helado que te comiste mientras le as cr eme los libros son como esas tiras de papel matamoscas a nada se pegan tan bien los recuerdos como a las p ginas impresas
2364147 i read the bible moses was an able man the jews are villains cowardly and cruel is there anything more horrible than the story of lot and his daughters
2364148 the science which proves to us that the earth is not the centre of the celestial movements has struck a great blow at religion
2364149 saya membaca bible musa adalah orang yang cakap sedang orang yahudi adalah bangsat pengecut dan jahat adakah sesuatu yang lebih dahsyat daripada kisah lut beserta kedua puterinya
2364150 sains telah menunjukkan bukti kepada kita bahwa bumi bukanlah pusat tata surya dan ini merupakan pukulan hebat terhadap agama kristen yosua menghentikan matahari yosua 10 12 13 orang akan melihat bintang bintang berjatuhan kedalam laut saya katakan semua matahari dan planet planet
2364151 religions are always based on miracles on such things than nobody listens to like trinity yesus called himself the son of god and he was a descendant of david i prefer the religion of muhammad it has less ridiculous things than ours the turks also call us idolaters
2364152 agama agama itu selalu didasarkan pada hal hal yang ajaib seperti halnya trinitas yang sulit dipahami yesus memanggil dirinya sebagai anak tuhan padahal ia keturunan daud saya lebih meyakini agama yang dibawa oleh muhammad islam terhindar jauh dari kelucuan kelucuan ritual seperti yang terdapat didalam agama kita kristen bangsa turki juga menyebut kita sebagai orang orang penyembah berhala dan dewa
2364153 surely i have told you on different occations and i have intimated to you by various discourses that i am a unitarian musselman and i glorify the prophet muhammad and that i love the musselmans
2364154 dengan penuh kepastian saya telah mengatakan kepada anda semua pada kesempatan yang berbeda dan saya harus memperjelas lagi kepada anda disetiap ceramah bahwa saya adalah seorang muslim dan saya memuliakan nabi muhammad serta mencintai orang orang islam
2364155 in the name of god the merciful the compassionate there is no god but god he has no son and he reigns without a partner

2364210 people began to shout to rise from their seats and clap and cry out a forceful wind carrying the reverends voice up into the rafters and in that single note hope i heard something else at the foot of that cross inside the thousands of churches across the city i imagined the stories of ordinary black people merging with the stories of david and goliath moses and pharaoh the christians in the lions den ezekiels field of dry bones those stories of survival and freedom and hope became our story my story the blood that had spilled was our blood the tears our tears until this black church on this bright day seemed once more a vessel carrying the story of a people into future generations and into a larger world our trials and triumphs became at once unique and universal black and more than black in chronicling our journey the stories and songs gave us a means to reclaim memories that we didnt need to feel shame about memories that all people might study and cherish and with which we could start to rebuild

2364217 we were shocked we applied at places like mcdonalds burger king and jack in the box we went to shoe stores pizza parlors and convenience stores the workers were overwhelmingly spanish speaking pretty much they always ask us do you speak spanish they said we prefer bilingual
2364218 its hard when you cant even get an interview because you dont speak spanish
2364219 its like three strikes black young and non spanish speaking im mad but there is nothing i can do about it its not fair
2364220 dame dos hamburgesas con queso un big mac dos papitas fritas y tres sodas
2364221 give me two cheeseburgers one big mac two fries three cokes
2364222 thats what were up against its a form of discrimination
2364223 mcdonalds is committed to recognizing the talents and job performance of all employees and values the contributions that come from people with different backgrounds and perspectives we believe in developing and maintaining a diverse workforce that will strengthen the mcdonalds system
2364224 i dont think its discrimination its more about catering to the customers who come through the door
2364225 of course you dont have to learn to speak spanish to get a job in a fast food restaurant but in certain parts of the country like san bernardino where youve got the impact of immigration it certainly limits your chances of getting the job you want
2364226 you better believe black teens looking for summer jobs are feeling the impact of immigration
2364227 its a very stressful and difficult dilemma sometimes you feel like youre straddling two nations on one hand you strive for diversity on the other you are forced to hire people who are best equipped to serve your core customer base sometimes that boils down to bilingual preferred
2364228 the job chill is not limited to the fast food industry
2364229 in most cases i was asked do you speak spanish we are being pushed out of minimum wage jobs on every front employers are under intense pressure to capture every dollar that comes in the door customers want cheap fast hassle free everything what happens to black inner city kids whether they get summer jobs or not is not on their radar
2364230 i keep telling black people who support illegal immigration and think that latinos mexican pr amp dr are our friends to wake up they have proved over and over and over again that they dont give a damn about blacks

2364232 we have russian tanks moving in we have continuous russian bombardment since yesterday specifically targeting the civilian population
2364233 russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory
2364234 georgia will not yield its territory or renounce its freedom
2364235 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
2364236 we wont allow the death of our compatriots go unpunished
2364237 we think that this is a very serious error of judgment and political blunder
2364238 i hope that the georgian side will reconsider its reckless actions in the area of the georgia south ossetia conflict
2364239 but at that time teen movies were john hughes movies there was so much drama maybe im an undramatic guy but i remember a complete lack of anything big going on in high school the essence of being a teen to me was a whole lot of energy and music but nothing much technically happening on any given night there wasnt a car wreck there was no one impregnated no huge love story from the wrong side of the tracks
2364240 matthew looked like hed do fine with college girls but i needed wooderson to be a little creepier but matthew just sunk into character his eyes shut to little quarter slots and he said hey man you got a joint he just became that guy
2364241 i didnt use a steadicam for instance had i been able to get film stocks from that era i wouldve i just wanted it to look like a 70s movie in a way blown out windows just a certain style i was very much playing off that the way music was used in movies pre mtv for instance sort of a storytelling narrative element to music more along the lines of easy rider mean streets graffiti even you go back to scorpio rising films like that but pre mtv influence so i was very consciously looking at that era stylistically
2364242 they were in some delusion about this could be a pg 13 movie if we had less cussing im like are you kidding teenagers drinking driving smoking pot this is an r rated movie but they well less maybe there could be less they were afraid they were gonna offend people
2364243 youd watch the movie with a test audience this is the down side of making a studio film youd watch the film with an audience and theyd laugh and applaud and have a great time and then the cards would come back poor you know we tested poorly so those audiences at those testings more or less killed this film for being a wide release and we just got marginalized it was kind of a studio production with an independent release sort of the worst of both worlds
2364244 the most slyly funny and dead on portrait of american teenage life ever made
2364245 to this day you cant go to a video store on a friday night and get dazed and confused because the kids still have dazed parties and everybody knows every line in the movie
2364246 i want to say that this movie is great but the only reason i would be doing that is because of some sick sense of nostalgia that i have from my high school days of getting wasted i relate to the film but in the end the movie is about nothing its just serves as a reminder of how stupid we all were when were in high school how idealistic and self serving we were in the name of a good time dazed and confused is a movie about the past so if you like living in it youll probably like the film
2364247 much more than the superficial teen romps that passed for generational insight during the 1980s richard linklater has crafted the definitive adolescent allegory illustrating how music makes our experiences more ethereal and touching on almost every issue inherent in the high school of eras past and present this drunken drugged out comedy is a benchmark in the way young adulthood is illustrated and explained in the modern motion picture without gimmicks it achieves a greatness that few films can ever hope to emulate without a doubt dazed and confused is a great film
2364248 that was definitely one of those feelings you wish you could have every day
2364249 the biggest thing that win gave me apart from the 2 million was a window to take a break
2364250 since then i havent played back to back weeks until fort smith and the bmw in may this year there was a lot of rust every week ive been top 10 in birdies bogeys and doubles very inconsistent
2364251 we are all trying to be a little more positive
2364252 we figured out its not as hard as weve been making it we all got tired of playing bad and we know were better than what weve been doing
2364253 after the great start i think i did a pretty good job of staying in the present
2364254 he kind of kept me focused and we fed of each other its a good start im four back but this golf course isnt that easy
2364255 every couple of months i would check my bank account to make sure it was like wow now the money is starting to be spent and i need another win
2364256 the golf tournament business is primarily fueled by economic support
2364257 we did everything in our power to generate the sponsorship necessary to continue with the ginn tribute but given the current market and corresponding cuts in corporate spending it was an uphill battle
2364258 we also appreciate all of the fan support that the lpga received in charleston and from throughout south carolina and look forward to returning to the south carolina market in the future
2364259 the bunkers are completely flooded we cleared the water away from some greens and some are perfect with thunder storms expected in the afternoon it would be unfair to commence the second round
2364260 we are all going to miss sarge who was a patriot first and a professional golfer second
2364261 he embodied a bit of golfs everyman whom we all could identify with having risen from his oklahoma roots as part native american and serving his country in a 14 year army career
2364262 nothing is going to change we still are best friends
2364263 we cant change our attitudes if munoz plays better and wins awesome
2364264 i can get in my own game and forget who im playing and just see how low i can go
2364265 i just told myself to stay steady and play my own game and have fun at the same time
2364266 if you start putting well the rest of the game will come along
2364267 its going to be awkward because i have to play her but it will be normal because ill be talking to her
2364268 when dussel got the best of everything he drove like a true champ
2364269 thats what ive always wanted to do is run a 410
2364270 i finally convinced ron to let me do it its been going pretty good
2364271 weve given away two features here in the last two weeks that we should have won
2364272 driving the car is basically the same but getting used to that horsepower and the lighter engine so the front end is lighter just finding the right set up so i can drive was the hardest part but now weve found it
2364273 i love racing here at limaland but i kind of got sick of racing the 360 week in and week out i wanted something a little new
2364274 its something we can run twice a week real close to home
2364275 in my opinion hes earned it hes shown he can win in a 360
2364276 he got to the point where there was nothing else to prove so we moved up
2364277 we didnt win a feature last year but with as consistent as he was he proved he could be up front day in and day out and hes done the same thing in a 410
2364278 i know that i can drive a race car and i know rons going to give me the race car to do it the combination of those two were going to run well
2364279 anyone who knows ron they know he puts a little bit of pressure on his drivers as long as you go out there and do your job everythings good

2364283 but of all these friends and lovers there is no one compares with you and these memories lose their meaning when i think of love as something new
2364284 i wonder if well meet again talk about life instead talk about why did it end
2364285 her eyes went down and cut you up and theres nothing like a dirty look from the one you want or the one youve lost
2364286 but i still dont understand what this whole things about when all the words that you said are somehow stuck in my mouth
2364287 up in my lonely room when im dreaming of you wah oooo oh what can i do i still need you but i dont want you now
2364288 ive been living so long with my pictures of you that i almost believe that the pictures are all i can feel
2364289 but emotions wont grow and were changing our ways taking different roads then love love will tear us apart again
2364290 about as subtle as an earthquake i know my mistakes were made for you and in the backroom of a bad dream she came and whisked me away enthused and its as solid as a rock rolling down a hill

2364294 nothing theyre talking about is going to have a substantial downward impact on price
2364295 the only thing that holds out possibility is mccains proposal to more ambitiously drill on lands currently off limits but democrats are right that its unlikely were going to produce enough oil from those fields to substantially impact global crude oil prices
2364296 weve been talking about how obamas energy proposals meet the financial challenges voters are facing with energy costs while obama is proposing 1 000 to offset those costs mccain is talking about drilling as a first option and at the same time offering tax cuts to big oil companies that earned 143 billion last year obamas plan is to relieve the u s of dependence on foreign oil and make us a greener more environmentally conscious nation
2364297 people have been focusing more and more on the issue and i think they believe and the polls show that they agree with mccain on this one

2364328 were going to be again able to open up to new adult patients and new pediatric patients the interesting thing is that its not just affecting us there are 34 health centers across the state of ohio
2364329 all of those health centers are seeing an increase in those funds so were able to reach out to more ohioans its a great thing for lima and a good thing for the whole state of ohio for uninsured
2364330 shes always had a passion for the work we do here
2364331 it was very hard for our board of directors our mission is to reach out and be the family practice family doctor for people who are uninsured
2364332 we looked at our financials and we were doing very well but we knew if you extend yourself too far beyond what youre capable of doing eventually it impacts the quality of care that has always been our supreme mission is to make sure the people we do care for get the best care possible
2364333 this year so far with the independent decision maker weve hired and some of these other things and the enforcement time that we spend im sure were spending a lot of money there
2364334 its probably not going to be a break even proposition but it will push us in that direction at least
2364335 were not seriously looking at opting out now i think its important to try to continue to enforce the law
2364336 im not sure if that means people are tired of complaining because they think nothing is happening thats probably my biggest fear or were seeing more compliance id like to think that more operations more of our restaurants and taverns and workplaces are now in compliance and taking more seriously
2364337 hopefully they can take back to school that they have to show up every day to play this game
2364338 its been an up and down summer and we got on a hot streak toward the end of the season and it was kind of fun to end on a positive note
2364339 since we got hot at the end of the season and started playing a little better baseball its a good way to go back in the fall
2364340 theyre just so free spirited when people think about a wild horse they think about it being out of control but theyre not its just coming from a different environment
2364341 everybodys looking for something different most of them want them for trail riding we had one girl wanted to train one for show they make a good horse
2364342 time and patience are the two biggies not doing too much too soon
2364343 how long it takes it depends about 10 percent on the horse and 90 percent on the trainer
2364344 we had five ornery boys who had nothing to do but sit in the parking lot this gave them something to do they brought their friends over we didnt allow any smoking or drinking and they worked and stayed out of trouble
2364345 its a sense of accomplishment knowing youve taken a wild animal and trained them its that wild aspect that makes it special
2364346 its getting to the point where its not fun like it used to be i said that last year a couple of years ago its just at that point again
2364347 at this point my motors cant get any better my cars cant get any better and ive got two ungodly drivers
2364348 it gets to the point where you wonder how much more you can do
2364349 the notion that the state of ohio would come forward now to change venue for the defendant is absurd the state of ohio is well aware that the defendant does not even seek a trial in this court or any other
2364350 to that end the defense has offered to accept responsibility and to plea to all four first degree felonies with no agreement as to sentencing or even sentencing range leaving a potential sentence of 40 years available
2364351 though not filed the issue was reviewed by the defendant with the court within weeks of schwietermans arrest
2364352 since their initial claims of jury pool prejudice there have been numerous articles and extensive coverage of this case including the suppression hearing their failure to claim otherwise now is only inviting error
2364353 the stuff that they spray painted really i wasnt even completely aware that people still did that

2364358 it seems that weve got a lot of selling based on the stronger dollar
2364359 energy demand destruction and the dollar return have formed a quiet alliance to bring the oil market down and today the louder of the two is the dollar
2364360 the market has been ignoring the tbilisi pipeline situation and now the problems with russia the move lower really now has a momentum of its own with the financial players coming out
2364361 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2364362 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2364363 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2364364 i saw this immense instant attack coming at me and i kind of exclaimed something that probably most people would exclaim
2364365 the funny part is i think i actually kind of jumped up with both of my feet like in a cartoon i mean i was just totally just awestruck and in total panic
2364366 the effect was enormous on the bear the bear was maybe one or two metres from the end of it and it just got a full face of this bear spray
2364367 and it immediately just bolted and in a raging raging roar just began running through the forest and growling and roaring and smashing trees
2364368 it seemed like endless waiting to see if i could hear her again and i didnt after five to 10 minutes i stayed in the tree
2364369 you can imagine how quiet i was as i was climbing down this tree
2364370 hey mark heres a film you might like it its a musical

2364372 of de gebruikte strategie van de voorbije 14 maanden zo goed is geweest daar valt
2364373 turkey should play the mediation role it plays in the middle east in the caucasus as well
2364374 under these circumstances ankara cannot be expected to side clearly with any of the parties and confront others
2364375 we believe that this conflict atmosphere should be overcome through restraint common sense and dialogue and that acts that could lead to new tensions should be avoided
2364376 even then russia will get involved people of north caucasus will get involved making it difficult for georgia to stay there
2364377 turkey will already be drawn into the conflict because of turks of ossetia and abkhaz origin what turkey should do is mediation
2364378 se rebellent contre leurs cr ateurs et ma tres les humains ils veulent devenir autonomes
2364379 i was going to be so well prepared and i was going to do all those things that were revered in white society that i would be armored somehow from racism i would be able to confront white society on its own terms
2364380 should not point their noses too high because no man will think higher of them because they share the same complexion as the victor in reno
2364381 a symbolic recognition at the highest levels that america no longer seeks to stanch the hopes and aspirations of black americans who are flamboyant defiant or controversial
2364382 condoleeza rice promises america a great gift that would be the perfect antidote to the hideous black sub culture that we ceaselessly praise by faint damnation
2364383 colleagues beginning today we are adopting an inquirer first policy for our signature investigative reporting enterprise trend stories news features and reviews of all sorts what that means is that we wont post those stories online until theyre in print well cooperate with philly com as we do now in preparing extensive online packages to accompany our enterprising work but well make the decision to press the button on the online packages only when readers are able to pick up the inquirer on their doorstep or on the newsstand
2364384 for our bloggers especially this may require a bit of an adjustment some of you like to try out ideas that end up as subjects of stories or columns in print first if in doubt consult your editor or me or chris krewson
2364385 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented fabulous actually who are you not to be you are a child of god your playing small does not serve the world there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people wont feel insecure around you we were born to make manifest the glory of god that is within us it is not just in some of us it is in everyone and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others

2364387 the real contest is always between what youve done and what youre capable of doing you measure yourself against yourself and nobody else
2364388 working towards closing the it skills gap we are excited with the new delivery of a degree where both the needs of employers and the academic structure will be met
2364389 perhaps you should reconsider your terminology cloud is an architecture not a service
2364390 anecdotally we are hearing from our clients that they are starting to cut down on search marketing
2364391 we are talking about very large companies and they are all under budget pressures
2364392 but the economy is not good in the u s where most of the spending takes place
2364393 as a snapshot of a part of the universe it has some truth
2364394 yahoo has historically had a very strong position in asia vs google
2364395 electronic manufacturers such as philips sharp canon dell microsoft hewlett packard sony apple and toshiba should stop poisoning people in ghana and other developing countries
2364396 they must stop using hazardous material and also take responsibility for the whole recycling of their products
2364397 children in particular are highly susceptible to toxic substances which lead in the long term to cancer that affect the lungs and all parts of the body
2364398 there is the urgent need to review ghanas environmental laws and regulations as well as the penalties to prevent recalcitrant waste brokers and recyclers from breaching them
2364399 these e wastes should eventually be shipped back to the manufacturers in europe and elsewhere and the cost be borne by manufacturers
2364400 i am surprised at how quickly theyve grown the number of reseller partners they do business with and how much revenue theyre getting from the channel
2364401 they havent had to deal with the largest resellers out there
2364402 theyre getting that good growth from the lower end of the market
2364403 they did a brief introduction opened up with a presentation and then after the first slide it turned into a discussion
2364404 ive seen so many manufacturers make channel programs in a vacuum of what its really like from a reseller standpoint
2364405 we let you handle capture retention archiving and content management to manage your content proactively because the information has already been retained classified and managed
2364406 they are expensive because organizations often have to expand them to deal with other cases and typically these solutions dont address the bigger problem of information retention
2364407 we want e discovery to be part of the basic daily process rather than having you run around putting out fires
2364408 nobody has the breadth anymore to cover all databases all repositories it requires a very large set of capabilities and ibm global services and eds are among the few entities that folks love to help solve that kind of complex problem
2364409 a very important part of the ediscovery process is that the tools you use must respect things like deletion policies and keep accurate logs of access and searches
2364410 this is not the end application for the legal team were just focused on proactive management and collecting and identifying the information
2364411 i am right here in kl and we dont have much time left together but you rather tend to these thankless people than tend to me
2364412 i want to be a dolphin because they are really smart

2364414 bundled customers must sign the bundle service agreement online at www verizon net fiosbundleterms within 30 days after installation of services if the agreement is not accepted within this time frame bundled discounts will not appear standard retail prices will apply

2364416 nonprofits are investing and responding to gaping holes in the marketplace they often identify problems before government and business does
2364417 theres a million students in the primary schools in peru and every one of them will be getting one of our computers
2364418 the olpc plans to support a dual boot option that would enable children to use either linux or windows on the same machine
2364419 olpc got other companies to look at the commercial possibilities in a much more serious manner
2364420 with a profit driven company the risks taken at olpc wouldnt have been taken
2364421 the high degree of risk taking resulted in a better product for profit companies look at olpc as a crucible of creativity
2364422 were going to sell over a million computers this year which is roughly 250 million in revenue
2364423 thats a pretty amazing statistic if you look at how companies measure their performance
2364424 weve said all were going to say about the olpc project and have no interest in revisiting it
2364425 we applaud all efforts to get pcs and technology into the hands of children in developing markets
2364426 i certainly underestimated the degree to which commercial interests would sabotage a deal or the degree to which olpc would find itself in an amd intel proxy war
2364427 the truth is that those companies see children as a market not a mission
2364428 even if you take a country like rwanda or mongolia salespeople want sales and in the case of intel they do not want amd to get any toehold the result startling in fact is analogous to mcdonalds competing with the world food program
2364429 perhaps the best still rings performer this country has ever produced
2364430 decidi parar de ter pena de mim mesmo al m do meu olho h duas coisas que n o est o paralisadas minha imagina o e minha mem ria
2364431 i threw the ball a lot better than the linescore said
2364432 i just really got outpitched theres nothing really more to say
2364433 that last start i was trying to get out alive
2364434 i didnt care if i gave up 100 runs that game i was so beat out there i was so exhausted out there
2364435 he was attacking the zone with like nine pitches it seemed like
2364436 i think a j was not hustling on the play
2364437 he hit the ball and pretty much thought it was out of play
2364438 when i hit it and drew caught it i didnt know where it went
2364439 i thought it kicked away from him just trying to make something positive here hoping we can get a run to score o c did a good job reading the throws
2364440 its a little odd to play against a group of individuals that ive been so close to for so long its like playing in the backyard with your family so its different that way
2364441 but you know you got to separate and move on
2364442 thats what its all about having fun the guy thats pitching over there is a great friend of mine
2364443 hes been a good player his whole career he had a good day today i didnt notice anything and nobody said anything to me about it
2364444 if you look around everybody gets excited when they do great thats just the way the game is today
2364445 i know what my job is i just got to stay ready when they need me
2364446 he didnt leave me a whole lot of plate but i thought i might have snuck my hand in there when he called me out he had a pretty good view of it
2364447 moi je meurs mon esprit coule par quatre vingt blessures
2364448 nao gostei daquela cena super h hr deles se olhando naum
2364449 even if they claim that their work is non political they still convey a certain stance
2364450 children and young people have a right to receive an education and pedagogy that respects people without either open or subtle discrimination
2364451 you cannot separate her work from the fact that she was involved in a xenophobic organization
2364452 sometimes you see the same black kid in every picture
2364453 we tell colleges that its a mistake and they shouldnt do it but we get overruled
2364454 hey you were a little late on that throw im going to break another yard and you threw it a little bit before i was ready
2364455 the reason we recruited you is because i like your mom
2364456 yeah every once in a while you need a kick in the rear end
2364457 hey thats a great way to handle the thing give them some responsibility and some loyalty to each other
2364458 well there were two football players so did you tell them they shouldnt go talk to the people at judicial affairs
2364459 these guys did this these guys did this this happened
2364460 one quarterback can do this and the other quarterback cant do something
2364461 hey we dont want to be good we want to be the best
2364462 hey look if i keep my staff together well be okay
2364463 youre not tired you just think youre tired get your rear end moving weve got a suck it up big play coming up
2364464 this guys got the no 1 recruiting group another one the no 2 recruiting group
2364465 they think that guy is one of the 10 best players in the country
2364466 i dont know maybe half of its right and maybe 90 percent of it is i dont know
2364467 hey you know what dont give in dont give in dont give in
2364468 this guy is the first guy rah rah rah i like the way he moves his hips and the way he puts his right arm up so fast he ought to play on the right side of the ball not the left side because his left arm is a little slower than his right
2364469 when are you going to let me drive your bmw
2364470 your leg may not be solid but your heads okay
2364471 eighty six percent of chinese people surveyed said they were content with the countrys direction up from 48 percent in 2002 and 82 percent of chinese were satisfied with their national economy up from 52 percent
2364472 step up and do the right thing for their investors
2364473 this was not a mutual mistake by financial services companies this was a deliberate effort to ensnare consumers with great damage
2364474 investors have been locked in a nightmare with these securities
2364475 our research reflected the honest belief that auction rate securities offered higher returns in exchange for less liquidity and noted that market changes had begun to occur
2364476 id looked at thousands and thousands of web portfolios so i felt like i had a pretty good idea of what was good and bad
2364477 i built these two initial designs these are just what i want as a client and buyer
2364478 im kind of open to the next round of designs coming from what photographers want
2364479 there is so much emphasis put on website design whereas i think the photography trumps all that
2364480 i want these portfolios to be like your black leather portfolio they just hold the pictures and make it easy to look at them
2364481 its a big decision and 1 000 is a lot of money
2364482 once you commit its at least a year long process to create the site so i didnt expect right out of the gate a ton of people
2364483 go for it mom you have nothing to lose even if you dont win you can always say it was exhibited in the prestigious competition
2364484 i need the city i need to know there are people around me strolling arguing fucking living
2364485 ohhh you are a saint to send me testcases along with the code
2364486 if only i could figure out how to do the bike ride and the bbq and the dinner party

2364489 beijing you are a host to the present and a gateway to the future
2364490 i think were talking about a sea change in the use of these techniques for development
2364491 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2364492 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2364493 in the beginning people overreact to each other for example one turk warns another not to go to cyprus because if he does the greek cypriots will kill him a cousin of mine who lives in greece does not give friendship with turks a chance he says he does not hate turks but that he wants them to stay away from him
2364494 we just said no to a bad solution its also questionable how many of those who voted yes to the plan in northern cyprus were actually turkish cypriots many people who live in cyprus are not cypriots
2364495 there are around 65 percent turkish cypriots and almost 35 percent turks living in the northern part of the island
2364496 we have contact with the turkish republic but we are a separate country
2364497 we can live together we have already proved that here
2364498 if there is a problem start evaluating it from the point of view of the other side or a third party if you hear of problems on the island of cyprus first take a look at the views of greek cypriots or a third party
2364499 people usually first go to the turkish embassy in athens and apply for a turkish visa there but our group came here from budapest greek cypriots can get visas to enter turkey from anywhere that has a turkish embassy but we do not need visas when we want to visit the northern part of the island a national identity card is enough
2364500 if they ask a foreigner one question they ask me two because i am from cyprus
2364501 when we went to an office with other exchange students to get residence permits to stay here for a few months they all finished what they had to do but my greek cypriot friend and i had to spend more time to handle it they asked extra questions that they had not asked the others such as why we were here and how we got here
2364502 we have words from ancient greek as well as italian english and turkish when they talk we understand them but when we talk they can understand only 50 percent of it at most at first
2364503 ok your up so we warm up oh no wait the crew has to go to dinner
2364504 children in families with incomes of as much as 83 000 a year
2364505 slide under the nearest gas truck and taste their own blood
2364506 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented fabulous actually who are you not to be you are a child of god your playing small does not serve the world there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people wont feel insecure around you we were born to make manifest the glory of god that is within us it is not just in some of us it is in everyone and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others

2364514 since hes come over here hes been awesome you get a pitcher like that you want to give him everything youve got so you can make sure he gets the win hes doing his part
2364515 i dont sit there in my office and dream hes going to go 7 0 or 6 0 whatever hes just been almost unhittable or unscorable since hes been here
2364516 thats usually what i try to do go out and throw strikes they were swinging early and that helped me out
2364517 the first couple innings i was trying to do too much and you cant pitch that way
2364518 if theres a guy thats got every pitching going like that theres really not anything you can do as a hitter
2364519 you just have to pick a pitch and hope he makes a mistake
2364520 its a lot easier to catch cc than it is to hit against him
2364521 this new board brings a wealth of knowledge and experience that will strengthen siia and its ability to support the industry
2364522 you just have to do it dont try just do it addiction is weakness
2364523 it may not work for you but just because it doesnt dont mean it doesnt work
2364524 right now we arent optimistic that he will pitch this year
2364525 we would really like to have lews opinion because hes familiar with tom
2364526 to stay out of trouble say yes sir all day and no sir all night
2364527 hopefully itll lead to great music and fans are saying that they hope to hear the great music at shows hopefully itll lead to what was always meant to be
2364528 im fighting so hard to get on anybodys tour right now im making great music now its just about making it heard i am where
2364529 when a team is on a bad roll as were the as you want to keep them down
2364530 but ill come in from the bullpen pitch a couple of innings and anything i can do to help the team i will
2364531 he got us to hit the ball on the ground
2364532 when you dont throw a million mph youve got to be able to hit your spots and just let them know that youre going to control that part of the plate
2364533 apparently there is a third inning in detroit when youre pitching
2364534 you hate to see those guys come up in those situations
2364535 i knew i hit it well but i saw him dive for the ball and said noooo
2364536 i was playing in a little bit trying to stop the bleeding with a runner on second base
2364537 it mightve been tailing away a little bit it was close thats all i had there was nothing else left in the tank i was at full speed
2364538 over the last couple of months i dont think theres been a better player in the league not just hitting but fielding too
2364539 when things are going bad what can go bad will go bad
2364540 it doesnt last forever but when youre in it it feels like it
2364541 no ill just tell him when i get to heaven
2364542 well you should tell him thank you by praying to him that is how we talk to god before we get to heaven
2364543 moooommmm when i talk to him he never talks back
2364544 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
2364545 ergenekon is a patriotic organization established to protect turkeys regime
2364546 ergenekon is an organization aiming to stage a coup to forcibly overthrow the government
2364547 ergenekon is a crime organization aiming to acquire special interests
2364548 there is no such thing as ergenekon and the investigation is a politically motivated process
2364549 in which direction overall do you think turkey is headed

2364555 as we discussed ideas about who could best outfit our athletes in a manner representative of the olympic movement and what it stands for today we believe ralph lauren is uniquely suited to deliver an outstanding product
2364556 polo ralph lauren is a quintessential american brand that represents a timeless and classic look which we believe our athletes will be excited to wear
2364557 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2364558 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2364559 we went 14 hours with no epidural having contractions every two minutes it was the best dance we ever had
2364560 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented fabulous actually who are you not to be you are a child of god your playing small does not serve the world there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people wont feel insecure around you we were born to make manifest the glory of god that is within us it is not just in some of us it is in everyone and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others

2364567 well her abdomen is not swollen the incision has healed up nicely why do think she has an infection
2364568 anal sacs are small sack like nodules on both sides of the inner portion of the anus they are comprised of millions of microbial secrections that allow the feces to slide out of the anal opening sometimes a bit of the feces gets into the sacs and they need to be cleared all you have to do is insert your fingertip just like i did and kind of press or pop them to allow the fluid to escape
2364569 does the smell you are talking about smell like this
2364570 like a tinge of fish slightly fishy faint fish aroma tuna casserole or tuna can m k
2364571 an inverted vulva can collect urine the collection of urine is a breeding ground for bacteria and can cause such problems as vaginitis and urinary tract infections this is the source of the smell
2364572 well what do we do how do we cure it once and for all a shot oral antibiotics
2364573 all you have to do is insert your fingertip into the opening and wipe it out thoroughly with a clean cloth a baby wipe would be perfect
2364574 well ok i guess how long do we have to do this and how often
2364575 it was sent over to accounting for processing and we think well get the checks out in a couple of weeks

2364622 die aussage auf dem sticker ist aber eine allgemeine n mlich dass man einen gegnerischen willen niemals zu ndern oder zu brechen versuchen darf weil man sonst unter dem niveau der moralit t steht und einfach nur plattgemacht werden soll
2364623 als n chstes behauptest du noch leute die vergewaltiger als solche bezeichnen sind staatsaffin

2364645 ive gotten a lot of questions the last few weeks asking if obama is the antichrist
2364646 i tell everyone that i dont think the antichrist will come out of politics especially american politics
2364647 i can see by the language he uses why people think he could be the antichrist
2364648 but from my reading of scripture he doesnt meet the criteria there is no indication in the bible that the antichrist will be an american

2364668 our inventory levels in these clearance and transitional categories were significantly lower than last year affecting sales results but leading to improved gross margins

2364791 we were very physical it was a lot of full line we installed short yardage today and at the end of the practice in the heat of the day we ran and we ran hard
2364792 the defense thrived in the heat and in my opinion had a great day they also thrived in the run defense and the offense fought through it which is what theyre supposed to do were not ready to play a game there is no way were ready to play a game but if we work like we did today we will be ready to play and certainly have the opportunity to play well as the season goes forward

2364802 our team is going to have a lot of energy were going to be real excited its our first day in pads august 9 there will be a lot of people flying around its a learning process right now and there will be a lot of big plays
2364803 from the players perspective it the scrimmage is a learning experience we can see where we are at right now the tape will show that once we get that on film we can correct everything and get ready for the first game and the season
2364804 the guys on the sidelines really help us out on the field getting us motivated and letting us know our teammates are behind us there is the support of everyone on the team that if someone makes a mistake then he knows the team is still behind him then hell recover come back and make a big play later

2364806 everybodys been waiting for the first day of pads thats all weve been hearing when camp starts when the pads come on thats when real football starts as coach tomey says

2364816 the magnitude of our so called rescue was leisure and hospitality
2364817 it was to some extent a lifeboat but it was a lifeboat that was pretty patchy were creating an economy where were always struggling to make ends meet
2364818 usually the real estate markets will kind of follow or trail whats happening in the rest of the economy
2364819 but the real estate market dragged us into this recession which is not the usual way its happened
2364820 basically the real estate related jobs the losses there were much larger than id expected
2364821 its our own creation because of the strategic choices we have made in creating jobs at the low end of the wage spectrum

2364829 we want more riders to come out and test it out because we dont have the same population they have down south
2364830 we want everyone to be able to come and ride it and see if they like it
2364831 the biggest thing that i have really been trying to stress to everybody that i tell is that the course is ridable for any person that considers themselves a mountain biker
2364832 we want to get as many people out as possible to just show mt sima that there is a serious mountain bike following in the yukon and this is something they can make money on and that they can bring tourism up for

2364902 the entirety of philosophy is conceived on the basis of its greek source as is well known this amounts neither to an occidentalism nor to a historicism it is simply that the founding concepts of philosophy are primarily greek and it would not be possible to philosophize or to speak philosophically outside this medium that plato for husserl was the founder of a reason and a philosophical task whose telos was still sleeping in the shadows or that for heidegger on the contrary plato marks the moment at which the thought of being forgets itself and is determined as philosophy this difference is decisive only at the culmination of a common root which is greek
2364903 this was the moment when language invaded the universal problematic the moment when in the absence of a center or origin everything became discourse provided we can agree on this word that is to say a system in which the central signified the original or transcendental signified is never absolutely present outside a system of differences the absence of the transcendental signified extends the domain and the play of signification infinitely

2364980 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2364981 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2364982 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry

2364985 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices
2364986 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2364987 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2364988 used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it
2364989 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2364990 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2364991 help two friends and former colleagues rebuild their lives when harassment by supermarket tabloids made it impossible for them to move forward on their own
2364992 i had sex with her but the child is not mine
2364993 we want our senior citizens to form social interest groups that come together regularly through regular activities they make friends when their children and grandchildren are out they have their own activities to look forward to
2364994 people coming to an event doesnt mean they interact with one another the software should be how the residents committees rcs can help facilitate residents in forming interest groups and how to help the rc sustain the interest of these groups
2364995 the problem is roughly20 per cent of residents are active in participating in rc activities a majority should be doing it
2364996 but fortunately for us we have done well in the last few years so right now there is still a tight labour market in that sense singaporeans will be cushioned from the worst effect of a global downturn
2364997 in singapore academic achievement has been such a powerful tool for social mobility and passport to career and material success that it is used as a key tool to identify talent
2364998 but unless we reframe our definition of talent we will always see talent as a scarce commodity and suffer a talent no enough syndrome
2364999 we need to slaughter the sacred cow of the traditional assessment system
2365000 we cant paint everyone with the same brush but today the mark of success is all the cs car cash condo credit card country card more than in the 90s
2365001 singapore is not short of talent but theres always a fight between practicality stable job income and passion theres also the fight between pursuing your own dreams and living up to parental or familial expectations
2365002 a couple of years ago prime minister lee spoke of a mountain range of excellence in order to broaden our national discourse on talent this broadening is imperative for any mature society let alone one with global aspirations
2365003 too often singaporeans fail to take risks because they are scared of failure the end result is we end up having the government trying to teach us to do things that governments are traditionally very bad at entrepreneurship art music and so on
2365004 sometimes being talented means that one has opinions that run contrary to popular belief singaporean society is not always used to embracing contrary opinions
2365005 the situation has gotten a lot better but there is still much room for improvement
2365006 we need to ask are we a place for young graduates raring to go or are we a city for middle managers with families or for senior citizens winding down maybe thinking of a second career where does singapore pitch itself
2365007 you have to look at the character of the city to see what talents it could have
2365008 it helps shape the socio political ethos with its new visions and ideas thereby driving the country towards a shared future to the man on the street singapore talent facilitates a sense of belonging and symbolises what it means to be singaporean and to live in singapore in this vein much more needs to be done to change existing mindsets that singapore talent is third rate
2365009 singaporean talents are only recognised in singapore when they are recognised internationally first
2365010 on a more practical level local budding talents find it necessary to go overseas to hone their talent be it in sports academies music observatories prestigious art and cultural institutes leaving singaporeans unaware of them western audiences get the fruits of our talent
2365011 constant promotion of foreign talent may have sidelined local talent
2365012 first that it is insufficient second there are certain areas in which singaporean talent is not yet ahead of the curve so we need foreign talent to take us into new sectors
2365013 in other words are we sophisticated enough to invest in talent purely for talents sake and not because of the rewards such an investment might bring
2365014 the newfoundland portion of the trail was officially opened two years ago in portland creek on the northern peninsula

2365048 something about psychiatry perhaps its historical ties to psychoanalysis and the anti religious views of the early analysts such as sigmund freud seems to dissuade religious medical students from choosing to specialize in this field
2365049 it also seems to discourage religious physicians from referring their patients to psychiatrists

2365057 he justifies some behaviors such as female genital mutilation because within a particular culture they may well be supported by a moral pillar like purity or duty and suggests that people who lack those particular pillars as many in the west do cannot then criticize those behaviors
2365058 when he gets into the political or cultural comparisons though ie how liberals only care about two of the four pillars and are kinda morally impoverished

2365064 en el contexto de la protesta social donde hemos constatado incluso m ltiples casos de tortura a la poblaci n civil por parte de carabineros algunos de ellos con consecuencia de muerte que quedan en la impunidad por ser juzgados por tribunales militares pensamos que este es un fen meno que trasciende a las organizaciones de derechos humanos pues ata e a la sociedad en su conjunto que ve c mo estos hechos comienzan a transformarse en pr cticas cotidianas
2365065 in many respects this wind industry is a learning process
2365066 the texas coast will be the toughest place to build wind farms from an ecological perspective
2365067 our intention has always been to deliver the benefits of renewable energy while minimizing any impact to the environment
2365068 we were meticulous in the way we approached the development of this wind farm which we believe will be used as a model for future wind farms around the country
2365069 a new branch of mystic thought had already grown strong one not religion in nature but no less perilous to mankind exaggerated nationalism half a century has shown that this new adversary is so strong that it places in question mans very survival

2365079 an extremely frustrating day back and forth on the phone between air canada and iberia airlines
2365080 air canada assured us our luggage was en route to the hotel yet iberia would not confirm this
2365081 we asked air canada to please call iberia airlines to ensure that the courier had been arranged and that our luggage was on the way but they would not do this
2365082 our entire trip was a waste of time and money for all four team members
2365083 we spent thousands of dollars on airfare race entry cost accommodation as well as lost wages and loss of potential prize money
2365084 thankfully we were able to retrieve our luggage but not without huge expense to our team we assume because of the expenses we incurred due to air canadas incompetence with our luggage that we will be reimbursed for all costs associated with this event
2365085 denies all of the allegations of fact contained in the plaintiffs claim
2365086 air canada denies that the plaintiffs suffered any loss or damage as alleged or at all
2365087 particulars of the plaintiffs actions include but are not limited to failing to make the proper arrangements with respect to the shipment of the plaintiffs luggage
2365088 i mean the bear was trying to pull the guy out of the tree

2365095 well take a great game in six months over a mediocre one in two every time
2365096 because of the way i came up through the ufc a lot of people didnt see a lot of my fights people develop an attachment to fighters that they see fight live when they see you in a pay per view or they see you in a live event and they watch you fight they develop a real attachment to you
2365097 so yeah i think a lot of fans still dont know who i am really they havent developed that kind of attachment or an appreciation for me but its not really their fault i guess its just the way things go we had a stacked weight division and i just kind of slipped through the cracks
2365098 i think its a key factor in any career for someone to be successful if you dont have the confidence in yourself to achieve the things that lay in front of you then youre always going to be a failure
2365099 i think i struggled early in my wrestling career at purdue because i lacked confidence but ever since ive started fighting ive put myself on the same playing field mentally as all my opponents and my confidence is through the roof im just as much of an athlete or just as much of a man as anybody else im facing
2365100 jon fitch is like a new breed of mixed martial arts fighters hes not like the old school guys
2365101 of course hes a great wrestler thats his first background but hes very good standing up and on the ground as well so hes bringing a lot more problems on the table than the other guys that ive fought in the past im going to have to use a lot more tools than ive been using in the past
2365102 thats the thing with koscheck hes really stubborn and he didnt want to listen to anybody and we were telling him to practice his wrestling
2365103 he had it in his head that nobody could take him down if he didnt want them to literally i dont think he drilled a single takedown that entire training camp i havent taken that approach to it i always train everything but ive also gotten back to wrestling basics again just to sharpen things up
2365104 one of the biggest things is punching power ive been working a lot with javier mendez and thats kind of his specialty
2365105 so im hitting at least twice as hard as i used to other than that my cardio is just on another level now in my first time training for 25 minutes i wasnt sure where i could take my body physically but im increasingly surprised with how great of shape im in
2365106 because thats another way of identifying as the mark of the beast says all people will be identified by a mark thats another step in that system
2365107 other than the fact we can eventually identify them doesnt seem to present a problem at this point
2365108 just a sigh of relief now go out here and cash a check somewhere i couldnt do that before because i didnt have an id
2365109 youre saying to the state they can control everything you do monitor where you go this is surrendering something that god gave me to the state
2365110 we dont have any thoughts or anything like that we havent had any witnesses and nothing to show at this point foul play
2365111 were going to treat any investigation like this as a criminal investigation until anything proves otherwise
2365112 were trying our best to work with other agencies hopefully we can link these things together
2365113 shes been having a wonderful experience here at wvu and loves the program
2365114 she continued to back up then his bike got caught under the tire of the vehicle and he started screaming at her
2365115 the green movement means that a lot of money is flowing in changing which innovations are rewarded
2365116 how breakthroughs happen the surprising truth about how companies innovate
2365117 inventing is about connecting taking pieces that are already there and connecting them in different ways
2365118 your best opportunity to come up with ideas is not to lock yourself alone in a room but to be out in the world seeing what others are doing and use that in different ways
2365119 this saying has led many engineers to their doom its fundamentally dangerous to assume that if you have a great idea somebody will care
2365120 patents can suppress innovation but without protection people wont make investments
2365121 we should be teaching everyone enough engineering that they can understand the basics of technologies they may encounter
2365122 weve spent a trillion or so dollars 30 000 dead or wounded a large loss in international influence and prestige all for the sake of disarming a country with no wmds
2365123 my concern right from the beginning was that the war wouldnt be worth the effort it would require and that the american people dont have a good record in supporting long costly struggles in developing countries
2365124 we are new to the crash simulation field but weve made it a strategic corporate objective to develop a strong leadership position in the automotive industry
2365125 crash test is a major full vehicle simulation and we want to have a leadership position in full vehicle applications
2365126 the more work that can be done via simulation and the more accurate simulations we can do the fewer prototypes and physical tests would have to be done
2365127 theres a move afoot in the automotive industry to rely on more realistic simulations building prototypes is expensive and time consuming
2365128 i expect an unbiased report which will provide some recommendations on ways to save money and improve efficiency
2365129 we have to come up with the logistical conclusions the monetary conclusions and the political conclusions
2365130 perhaps by combining some of our efforts by combining the organization we wouldnt have all that much duplication of equipment
2365131 you may see some recommendations that two or three communities make sense to join together
2365132 if may be that it may not make sense for them to join together
2365133 were not doing to draw conclusions before the study is done
2365134 we look at fire law enforcement public works school districts water plants and electric plants
2365135 we need to see if theyre doing the most efficient job for us so we can provide good service
2365136 weve done a good job to be pro active with mutual aid agreements automatic mutual aid and training
2365137 we share the same tactics we deploy the same strategies and thats how we can operate as one department
2365138 every community needs to determine what level of fire protection they want and then communicate that to the fire chief
2365139 from there they build it the way they want it and the way they want to pay for it
2365140 when it comes to fundraising were always looking at any and all ways and this is a great way to earn some money but more importantly this event will hopefully allow us to gain some awareness and publicity
2365141 i dont know how well well do with this tournament but our goal is to pay for half of our transportation bill for next year
2365142 when teams like the wings and clarence play i told my girls they better be watching
2365143 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established i only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby
2365144 ill make you a star and even you will believe it
2365145 i have given a complete interview on this matter and having done so will have nothing more to say
2365146 it is a little known fact that bacon amp i are pals and that bacon is fond of belting out karaoke at the pav and i am fond of drinking at lee harveys
2365147 so recently we finished singing a duet atomic dog jumped offstage and began lamenting on the perils of animal rescue and came up with the benefit idea
2365148 98 of cats and 88 of dogs relinquished to the city are euthanized each year
2365149 we need to do everything we can to ensure that these animals are the first choice animals when someone is looking for a companion rescue animals seem to understand they have been just that rescued from there the relationships flourish every rescue ive had has been the perfect companion
2365150 in an additional effort to give back to my community
2365151 i have decided to combine my deep appreciation for fine cuisine and helping other animals by creating a cookbook the proceeds of sales will benefit the spca of dallas
2365152 you get up at sunrise you shoot all day its non stop
2365153 contrary to what a lot of people think when youre working all day with them the models you dont see them that way
2365154 i am a bit disappointed there are not more photographers from canada i am proud to print the canadian flag on all of my shirts
2365155 ive always been a fan of photography since i was a boy i owned every magazine from national geographic to playboy
2365156 the photographers are not allowed to retouch the photos they have to be spot on the money
2365157 waxaan ogoaadey intaan puntland xilka ka hayey waxaan waligey ka ogeyn
2365158 there have been a lot of people ive talked to who havent been able to get their teeth cleaned because they dont have the finances and they dont have the insurance
2365159 the utility bill will come out essentially zero each month
2365160 we reduce the total energy requirement for these homes compared to existing building codes by about 75 percent
2365161 i think colorado is a good place where something like this could be done
2365162 i just want to let it be known that its not xcels fault that its my fault and just apologize to everybody
2365163 i think it would be nice if we stayed here but i think its going to be hard
2365164 i think its wonderful ive never had a gift like that ever
2365165 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2365166 i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2365167 its a dramatic fall for the former vice presidential candidate who was widely seen as a potential cabinet member in the future or even a running mate for barack obama
2365168 of course i mean for a lot of americans including the family that i grew up with i mean its its fundamental to how you judge people and human character whether you keep your word whether you keep what is your ultimate word which is that you love your spouse and youll stay with them
2365169 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2365170 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2365171 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2365172 its more disappointing but again my biggest concerns the family right now
2365173 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2365174 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2365175 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
2365176 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2365177 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it
2365178 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2365179 fragomen has lost business from clients as well as opportunities to compete for new business
2365180 confident that its reasonable interpretation of its rules will be upheld
2365181 singing is good gruff and strong in comparison to his soft speaking voice
2365182 the words he writes and sings have the same effect theyre simple but manage to softly capture your heart
2365183 my waiter was disappointed when i told him i was content with just a glass of wine a few tuesday nights ago at jayne marie on cross lake i wasnt there to eat despite it being a great place to enjoy steak or seafood i would have eaten if forced i would have at least ordered a steak if that was the only way i could have gotten a table and listened to david mcmillin that night
2365184 not only did venture beat out the other classic wooden boats but it also beat the modern boats
2365185 every year it takes a lot of hard work to keep her in top shape
2365186 the weather conditions varied a lot from day to day during the event
2365187 its pretty special that as old as it is it can still compete with and beat the newer models
2365188 i keep getting stuff about these songs are about these terrible things that happened
2365189 but i dont know if my life is any darker than anyone elses i really just think that theres something about catharsis and taking some of your worst moments and trying to find the beauty in them theres almost a defiance in that
2365190 and then when my mom got sick i got sick my dads terminally ill i think i just like snapped one day i picked up a guitar and started playing and then it was eight hours a day for a year
2365191 fitzgerald is talking to his mentor who says the only difference between leading a scholastic life where you write it down and a non scholastic life is that if you lead a scholastic life you leave a record
2365192 i always loved it when you take something really clean and proper sounding
2365193 and every single clich about the record industry is true people offering you drugs telling you how famous they can make you how much you need them in order for it to happen how if you dont do x y and z its not gonna happen
2365194 its kind of a myth that you need a big studio and all that stuff now
2365195 technology is such that you can get some really amazing sounds our studio wasnt exactly what youd call a home studio but it was in a home
2365196 it takes away one of the barriers to recording stuff suddenly you have all these artists who would never have an audience who have an audience people say the record industry is crumbling its not indie rock is thriving
2365197 right now i should have my second novel and a 1 year old kid
2365198 perder n su tendencia abstractamente material o m s bien idealista y se convertir n en la base de la ciencia humana as como se han convertido ya en la base de la vida humana real aunque en forma alienada
2365199 una base para la vida y otra base para la ciencia es una mentira a priori
2365200 la naturaleza que se hace historia humana la g nesis de la sociedad humana es la verdadera naturaleza del hombre
2365201 la historia misma es una parte real de la historia natural de la naturaleza que viene a ser hombre lo mismo que la ciencia del hombre incluir a las ciencias naturales habr concluye lapidariamente marx una sola ciencia
2365202 puesto que para el hombre socialista toda la llamada historia universal no es sino la procreaci n del hombre a trav s del trabajo humano nada sino el devenir de la naturaleza para el hombre l posee la prueba visible irrefutable de su nacimiento a trav s de s mismo de su proceso de llegar a ser
2365203 writing is like prostitution first you do it for love and then for a few close friends and then for money
2365204 im still friends with a bunch of players so i talk to them
2365205 the reaction ive gotten from the players side is that i got it i told a true story about what its like to play in the nfl i was able to go beyond what the media can do on a daily basis because i put on a uniform and helmet and did everything they did
2365206 if you can find the right guy you can tell a different story that fans dont get to see i was privileged that they let me be that guy
2365207 these are not just guys that go out put on a helmet and bang each other on the head everyday
2365208 these guys think a lot about what they have to do and what it takes to make it in this league to be able to adjust to the pressure thats constant in their lives is what separates the players that stick around for a long time from those that ultimately dont make it
2365209 hes from the wall street journal hes going to write about us and now hes going to come up here and break it down
2365210 hes worked extremely hard and hes watching his diet so the weight will come down fairly quickly
2365211 i cant get into that a lot i feel a lot better
2365212 its great to be back and great to feel like im a part of the team
2365213 i can only put him in the game in an emergency situation
2365214 youve got two good football players and its very close
2365215 both of them will get a chance to play with the starting defense and practices and game situations will dictate who will start
2365216 im sorry that he died im sorry that this happened
2365217 on the other hand there are no winners here he was not a nice guy
2365218 this was just a slight social interaction that i think he would have liked to see as a long term friendship and i didnt
2365219 he denied it but there was no question it was he
2365220 he was really good at snooping even in the 1980s
2365221 he knew quite a lot about me without me telling him
2365222 he knew my sons names and their years in school
2365223 i think this is john roberts chief legacy so far
2365224 the court is saying we are going to be very skeptical of facial challenges and demand a high level of evidence
2365225 you get a general discussion of the meaning of the statute which can be helpful but you also get a remand to the lower court
2365226 the proof will be in pudding as to how the lower courts react do they take the hint from the consensus opinion or continue to go their own way we dont have a representative sample on that yet
2365227 eles s o os golpistas de hoje tiveram o segundo mandato e agora querem o terceiro n o v o levar n o tivemos a sabedoria da pol nia de eleger o metal rgico uma vez apenas mas no final do mandato o presidente lula vai sair ele e sua turma

2365240 members of our organization are still talking about what a huge help go daddy was to us from the start

2365246 we strongly advise you not to travel to the regions of south ossetia abkhazia and the pankisi gorge north of akhmeta because of the threat of terrorist and criminal activity related to local separatist movements
2365247 were certainly disappointed we were unable to reach a negotiated settlement said company spokesman bill johnson
2365248 we continue to believe that the offer we put forward to the union was an extremely fair and reasonable one and it would have made them the highest paid potash miners in the industry
2365249 the company simply refuses to move away from the offer that our members soundly rejected said hunt western canada director of the union
2365250 the company is making enormous profits and it is time to reflect those profits with fair wages pensions and benefits in other words share the wealth
2365251 it seems that pcs would rather work against us instead of with us to chart a way forward

2365254 now is the time qantas should sit down with us to commit now to maintaining maintenance operations onshore
2365255 and to move off the path of cost cutting and any further possibilities of further job reductions in their maintenance and engineering area
2365256 all the highlights were rectified to the satisfaction of the qantas team before aircraft delivery to australia
2365257 no matter how hard we try to get people trained theres always going to be a margin of error

2365259 i must give thanks to mr hussein whose experience i have gained a lot from
2365260 i saw some very good things in those matches and i am very happy i can help repay the club for taking care of me during the past six to seven months
2365261 these boys and the rest of the squad have very good potential but they are still very far from their optimum
2365262 they each have a lot of space to improve individually and i aim to help them reach that peak whether it is in fitness technical skills or tactical awareness
2365263 i guess this is the natural progression for me and it will certainly help improve me too as a player
2365264 they are a really mobile and professional outfit with one of the best players in the s league in tetsuya okayama

2365281 businesses i talked to are now being very cautious about new opportunities and want to be certain that they have the resources to continue maintaining what they are doing instead of venturing too far afield
2365282 new growth capital additions people are pushing their hold buttons on that

2365296 i can confirm that the two policemen were severely beaten up by brazilian troops of the un mission here
2365297 we deplore and condemn this behavior and those at fault should be punished
2365298 the cost of those unfunded mandates at this point will be assumed by the state which is where that funding shouldve come from in the first place and that takes the pressure off of local property tax payers
2365299 this is the senate majoritys response to people who are saying our number one concern is escalating property taxes weve addressed that we now need the other house to take action and make this a reality
2365300 at this point the democrat majority and speaker nancy pelosi refuse to put any legislation dealing with drilling on the floor of the house for a vote
2365301 i called for congress to go back in session and to never have gone on vacation
2365302 the strategic petroleum reserve was set there for matters of urgency
2365303 were in an emergency it certainly feels that way where i live in rural america
2365304 we need action now not six months from now or a year from now or two or three well lose and our people will continue to suffer
2365305 the oil companies for 15 years have had access to 75 of our coasts

2365307 ive called for a 6 000 tax rebate on every american made ultra high mileage automobile

2365309 it will not be possible to have effective hiv aids prevention in the caribbean if we dont decriminalize sexual relations between men
2365310 human rights are limited for those who have sexual relations with men they are not recognized as a valid group by law and many countries silence them and deny them their rights
2365311 when trying to make weight these kids sometimes cut corners
2365312 we believe he did not increase his fluid intake the way we had told him to
2365313 they have a good draw they both trained well and i believe they are going to show their potential
2365314 his strongest opponents are in his later bouts hes got a good chance
2365315 the luck of participating in an olympics held in our motherland is a once in a century opportunity and a dream that our predecessors have fought to fulfil for 100 years
2365316 this is a historical chance for us we are burdened with a glorious mission
2365317 we all had the same title when we started out which was software engineer but later on we had a career ladder and the highest ranking engineer is called a google fellow i didnt get promoted but i said hey i can be the jolly good fellow
2365318 and everybody laughed i sent the card for printing and was waiting for somebody to fire me but nobody did and it stuck
2365319 down here its very hard to fail economically if you fail you dont have a good place to stay and theres social stigma in silicon valley if you fail you just start again nobody looks down on you you just rent a cheap apartment and start again
2365320 researchers have long wanted to find a way to move a patients disease into the test tube to develop cells that could be cultured into the many tissues relevant to diseases of the blood the brain and the heart for example
2365321 now we have a way to do just that to derive pluripotent cells from patients with disease which means the cells can make any tissue and can grow forever
2365322 this enables us to model thousands of conditions using classical cell culture techniques
2365323 this is exactly the kind of up to date information we are looking for we will be liaising to get access to the footage
2365324 all local aircrafts are accounted for they are either in the air or on the ground while being prepared for their next flight
2365325 i was informed by the chief of the village that one of the villagers saw a small white aircraft going down followed by an explosion
2365326 it seems like it went down and we are waiting for two hunters who were close to that area to return with possibly more details
2365327 it is a very inaccessible area and my guess is that a search operation with a helicopter would have better results
2365328 at this moment the only thing that i can confirm is that we have received information about an object that went down possibly an aircraft
2365329 currently we are assisting the judicial authorities with their investigations into this reported incident
2365330 we are verifying all incoming reports and information and assisting the police which are already in the area
2365331 the attack was an isolated incident which has deeply shocked our community
2365332 we wish to reassure visitors that antigua and barbuda is a safe destination
2365333 we have had a successful culturama but i really have to say that the responsibility for ensuring that we have a quality festival maintaining the key components that we have rests squarely with the people of nevis
2365334 we have become too much a nation of spectators and culturama invites us to increase our participation in our cultural activities i think we have at our disposal in nevis raw cultural talent and culturama provided that opportunity
2365335 we have also created the nevis cultural development foundation with four distinct units one of which is a festivals unit another is artistic development and the third one is research and documentation
2365336 i think as we go forward for the 35th anniversary what we are going to do is to invite suggestions and participation from the public right after the celebration of independence 25 and we are going to put together a festival so that by january february our international visitors and participants can feel a sense of that engagement
2365337 culturama is distinctly nevisian but there are only 14 000 people here so if we want to keep it going we have to internationalise it and we have to add several components to it
2365338 in this context i want to record my appreciation to the people in st kitts because the people in st kitts came over to take advantage of two things the opportunity to make some money i saw bus drivers and i saw people selling food and also the revelers came over and they could not come without the boats
2365339 nevisians in the diaspora in the virgin islands the dutch antilles in the unites states and britain they must feel that they can be part and parcel of a festival called culturama we have to move in terms of cultural development outside of the 36 square mile physical space that we have and we are going to want to engage our nevisian in the diaspora throughout in all of the activities
2365340 i think the opportunity exists for us to participate to lift cultural expression and to ensure that we make some money from culturama as i have said in the past culturama has a challenge where you can be very cultural you can produce all of the height of cultural expression and on the second level we also have to do it in a way in which it is economically viable that is the challenge
2365341 i believe we owe it to the nevisian community to ensure that we rise above that level of behaviour which is too base and which lacks sophistication lacks patriotism and to as the police says while people are having all concerns about crime it was the responsibility of the police to ensure that they rise above all that concern to deliver to them a festival that was crime free and a festival of which all of us can be proud

2365348 in the end i was pleased with my score because it was so difficult out there
2365349 it was nice to get ahead of the game early i had a couple of chances on the back nine which would have been nice to convert on holes 11 and 13 but it was hard
2365350 i didnt drive it too bad on the back nine i didnt drive it as well on the front nine if i can hit a couple more fairways i think im fairly good
2365351 i played as bad as i have all year ball striking wise
2365352 i only made one birdie in two days and that was a two putt
2365353 my swing was horrible i didnt hit many fairways therefore i didnt hit many greens so i never had chances for birdie
2365354 its easy to time it on the range much harder on the course it didnt really fall into place at all
2365355 i would only recognise a french court and i only take my orders from the international rugby board and the french rugby federation
2365356 the only problem might have been if the bulldogs had asked for a release letter
2365357 but theres been no release letter asked at all if there is no request for an exit letter there is no recognition of a former contract
2365358 hes signed his contract with toulon hes played a game and hes with us
2365359 one thing that did come out is that its a lot more confrontational than super 14 and they like to be in your face and i suppose they like the rough stuff a little bit more than at home
2365360 de stijgende rente zorgt voor druk op de waardering van de panden
2365361 maar wat positief is is dat wij geen afwaarderingen hebben gedaan zoals het er nu uitziet verwachten we dat we dit ook niet hoeven te doen
2365362 we verwachten dat we op operationeel gebied de huidige lijn de rest van het jaar kunnen voortzetten
2365363 wij geven aan de markt aan dat we willen groeien
2365364 wel zou het kunnen zijn dat we tijdelijk pas op de plaats moeten maken vanwege de omstandigheden we wachten eerst af hoe de vastgoedmarkt zich gaat ontwikkelen
2365365 de koers moet eerst aanzienlijk aantrekken willen we daartoe overgaan
2365366 dat zou zomaar kunnen gebeuren sommige bedrijven zijn nu spotgoedkoop
2365367 het feit dat we op twee continenten zitten europa en de verenigde staten en canada biedt meer mogelijkheden

2365371 but after he spoke with his team mates reginaldo decided to stay he wanted to play football
2365372 i have been very distracted and my game has definitely been affected
2365373 but im grateful for the support given by my club mates and management and this has given me the motivation tocarry on
2365374 the countries will also send us reports to certify these warships are safe
2365375 i would like to give congratulations to superintendent seabrookes commissioner williams and deputy commissioner stafford for doing a marvellous job during the culturama season i would also like to thank the members of the st kitts police force for their assistance and support in executing checks and raids i am also pleased to announce that the raids will be on a continual basis until we are satisfied that we have brought this crime wave under control
2365376 the trinidad training program should be supported rather than criticised
2365377 i truly believe any effort to undermine the program will not be in the best interest of nevisians
2365378 crime is everyones business not just the governments business and the community should meet on a regular basis and share ideas with one another if we dont take action now we will be destroying ourselves if we continue to have all these murders in our society we can begin to see our people dying little by little who will become the rulers of our society the gangs then once they have killed one another they will turn on whoever is left it is a serious situation

2365386 door de recente gebeurtenissen is het vertrouwen in en de geloofwaardigheid van fortis zwaar geschokt
2365387 het gaat mij niet om lippens persoonlijk maar ik vind dat het vertrouwen van klanten medewerkers en aandeelhouders moet worden hersteld daarvoor is een sterk signaal nodig het wegzenden van de ceo is niet sterk genoeg

2365393 at a time when the global economy is contracting and with official development aid on a long term decline government is embarking on innovative methods to capture international funds in support of social and economic development
2365394 the new source of philanthropy capital has a range of advantages over traditional sources of development financing such as bilateral and multilateral aid or remittances these include independence from politics flexibility in development projects invested in and the ability to provide seed capital and long term funding
2365395 many of these contributions also come from barbadians who may never return to barbados permanently and therefore our policy is flawed if it only offers concessions and opportunities for those who have returned
2365396 constructively discharged and wrongfully terminated by stanford group company for refusing to participate in conduct that could subject them to criminal prosecution and or penalties
2365397 hobsons choice of either participating in illegal conduct or to resign to avoid potential criminal prosecution and or penalties as a willing participant with stanford

2365399 when management of stanford refused to take any corrective action plaintiffs became concerned that these illegal practices could implicate them given their knowledge of these activities and sought the advice of an outside securities counsel to determine the proper course of conduct

2365414 i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2365415 its a dramatic fall for the former vice presidential candidate who was widely seen as a potential cabinet member in the future or even a running mate for barack obama
2365416 of course i mean for a lot of americans including the family that i grew up with i mean its its fundamental to how you judge people and human character whether you keep your word whether you keep what is your ultimate word which is that you love your spouse and youll stay with them
2365417 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2365418 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2365419 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2365420 its more disappointing but again my biggest concerns the family right now
2365421 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2365422 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2365423 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
2365424 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country

2365502 the biggest driving factor now to the downside is the fact that the u s economy has a lot of company right now in terms of weakening economic growth
2365503 when you come in at 500 600 mph drop a 500 pound bomb and then fly away you dont see what happens
2365504 you watch it all the way to impact and i mean its very vivid its right there and personal so it does stay in peoples minds for a long time
2365505 it is quite different going from potentially shooting a missile then going to your kids soccer game

2365507 you have a pretty good optical picture of the individuals on the ground the images can be pretty graphic pretty vivid and those are the things we try to offset we know that some folks have in some cases problems

2365512 the olympics shouldnt have been offered to china on the basis of their human rights record
2365513 the olympics for china is a giant spectacle a game but for us its much more than that its a chance to call attention to what is happening in tibet
2365514 its important that we show the world that we stand up for those in prison and dying
2365515 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2365516 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2365517 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2365518 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2365519 were going to have a very clear message about how the campaign will cooperate and how the convention will be conducted when its appropriate to make that announcement
2365520 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2365521 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different you could argue that
2365522 my address wasnt published and i only lived there a short while before carl and i got married and moved out of state
2365523 no one knew my address or my phone number you had to stalk me to figure this stuff out

2365525 i said this happened and im sure youre the one who did it and he denied it
2365526 and i said well im still sure you did what can you do at that point
2365527 he seemed to know a lot about myself my children things i never remembered telling him which always disturbed me
2365528 i kept him at arms length as best i could
2365529 after a while after i decided that he was probably the perpetrator i was afraid of him
2365530 i thought that if he found out i had turned him in he would go after me and he knew how to do that this is something his colleagues dont seem to recognize in him
2365531 we already had firsthand experience with him going back and forth
2365532 what research we do or not do in the first place
2365533 prudence demands that we consider what we might do if cuts in carbon dioxide emissions prove too little or too late to avoid unacceptable climate damage
2365534 mesoscale iron enrichment experiments 1993 2005 synthesis and future directions
2365535 computational models predict that a 10 percent decrease in stratospheric ozone could cause an additional 300 000 non melanoma and 4 500 melanoma skin cancers and between 1 6 and 1 75 million more cases of cataracts worldwide every year
2365536 the promise of geoengineering will delay the implementation of mitigation
2365537 until there is an adequate scientific basis on which to justify such activities
2365538 the mount pinatubo eruption lofted more than enough aerosols into the atmosphere to compensate for a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide yet ozone concentrations fell by only 3 percent and its believed that this small reduction was caused by chlorine from human made chlorofluorocarbons which are now banned by the montreal protocol so while the threat to the ozone layer is worth studying in greater detail its expected to diminish with time
2365539 that if geoengineering is ever implemented it must be geoengineering plus mitigation and never geoengineering instead of mitigation
2365540 the sensitivity of polar ozone depletion to proposed geoengineering schemes
2365541 we could avoid all of the potential consequences presumably adverse that we know about

2365565 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2365566 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2365567 this is a glorious but also huge task for anyone
2365568 i should never let the dream of all the chinese people down that was why i was nervous
2365569 every time i must balance myself in the air and hold the torch as close to the cauldron gas outlet but every time the wind blew in different directions
2365570 means china is standing side by side with the rest of the world
2365571 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2365572 who the f are you how many hit records do you have
2365573 were you scared he was going to beat you with a phone or a champagne bottle
2365574 i am sure that with the effort of both countries experts deals will be concreted
2365575 it will be a great summit china has an important role and we expect that with efforts of perus government and people the forum can be developed in an excellent way we trust that
2365576 the truth is that i dont think that there are favorites in my category all the guys are good and honorable fighters but i am confident in my skills
2365577 not only can the cost and magnitude of relief and recovery efforts be beyond the means of many apec economies but the destructive impact on business is likely to disrupt regional trade
2365578 im not going to criticize leysis nude photos but i wouldnt have done that
2365579 i was in an haute couture fashion show and i didnt sit on the flag atop a horse
2365580 congressional representatives asked me to then id do it with pleasure
2365581 it is the biggest ever opening for any film so far
2365582 reports about the films content are mixed with good publicity and hype half the battle is won but i am not sure if the film will do well at the box office the collections are sure to drop from monday
2365583 audience should not apply any logic to the film just enjoy it it is fantastic singh is kinng is made on a lavish scale and will re write box office history
2365584 completion of director welcome and now singh is kinng we hope he makes some sensible films in future
2365585 the numbers started out pretty good just over 1 5 million tuned into the premiere episode but the audience has dropped off denise has turned into an unappealing reality star viewers were disgusted that a mother of two young girls would use such foul language
2365586 we are excited to have bipasha basu with us as our brand ambassador
2365587 not only were we enthusiastic about the brand fit but also we feel that bipasha lends a refreshing look to the brand we are excited about having her on board as the new face for gili
2365588 it gives me immense pleasure to be associated with a prestigious brand like gili diamonds are a girls best friend and gili offers a wide range of diamonds to chose from
2365589 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public when a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story i used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it but being 99 honest is no longer enough
2365590 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly but that misconduct took place for a short period in 2006 it ended then i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established i only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2365591 when the rain came the swiss seemed to adapt better in what way its hard to say
2365592 zambrotta i havent got any figures but he must have run ten miles in this match
2365593 hes got his hands down protecting his downstairs area and sticks his foot out like a nancy
2365594 if you dont mind me saying graeme the shot was a bit low to have affected his downstairs area
2365595 he swam a fair way out he was 250m out to sea at one point and he was out there for a long time
2365596 it was very fortunate he didnt drown it was very cold
2365597 for fuel prices to rival repaying a home loan as a major financial consideration shows just how much the cost of petrol has factored into australian household budgets
2365598 thankfully prices have come down with the global price of oil dropping in recent weeks but the steep cost of petrol is now firmly in the australian financial psyche
2365599 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2365600 we have received reports from our defence ministry that five russian military aircraft have taken off from russias north caucasus region heading for tbilisi said national security council secretary alexander lomaia georgian president mikheil saakashvili said earlier that 30 people had been killed mostly military personnel while a rebel leader said 1400 were killed in the fighting we deplore the russian military action in georgia which is a violation of georgian sovereignty and territorial integrity

2365604 im sending this solid proof out to everyone on my email list
2365605 im going straight to my irc political chat room and post this important information
2365606 we need to expose this obama as the anti christ before its too late
2365607 the antichrist isnt going to be an american so it cant possibly be obama the bible makes it clear he will be from an obscure place like romania
2365608 if you believe in jesus youll vote against the anti christ
2365609 i am neither geek nor nerd i am not a hacker a phreaker a programmer or any variety of technoid dweeb

2365612 obviously the more people we get in here the more we can raise for the veterans and everything we raise goes to them
2365613 i dont want to give people a forum to oppose me
2365614 if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2365615 there is no afl field in israel or the palestinian authority afl equipment can not be purchased in this region and had to be flown in from australia there are no professional afl coaches and the players speak different languages hebrew and arabic and accordingly all instruction must be translated into both languages
2365616 israelis cannot enter the palestinian authority and palestinians cannot enter israel without permits and so in order to hold joint training sessions the peres center organised permits for the palestinian players allowing them to attend training sessions in israel
2365617 the peace team was organised through the peres center for peace al quds association for democracy amp dialogues
2365618 an initial introduction meeting was held in january where we introduced the game by showing a dvd as well as featuring a practice match played by expat aussies then for the following 2 months or so we had many different guys coming to the training sessions checking whether they were interested in learning the sport we targeted players from sporting backgrounds mainly from ball skills backgrounds taking fitness and physique into consideration as well as basic coordination skills with the oval ball from march we have had a squad in training coming to practices at least once or twice a week
2365619 85 of the players hadnt seen or touched a footy before
2365620 not playing on or seeing a proper footy pitch or goals before they reach australia and not having experience in playing with proper referees the calls will be in english which is not their mother tongue and they are not familiar with the calls and signals as they have no opportunity to watch the game at a professional level or any other level for that matter obviously the players only having 23 training sessions and 2 short training camps means that they have not had huge opportunities to improve their play
2365621 that coach simon got from kevin sheehan james demetriou nick hatzoglou ron barrasi and of course
2365622 were not coming to oz just to look pretty were coming to let everyone know that we have arrived and that were here as a united team who have overcome many obstacles to prepare and compete against whoever we come up against together as one team palestinians and israelis
2365623 whats wrong with me that i cant just move on like a did

2365626 zo mannetje deze methode is de bijbel en als je die volledig onder de knie hebt mag je op al de rest van de drums spelen
2365627 verdade seja dita pelo que eu sei a rivalidade mais de um lado do que o outro ou seja nunca vi a central comics com uma atitude de rivalidade para com o mundo fantasma embora n o possa dizer o mesmo do mundo fantasma para com a central comics
2365628 a este ponto sou sincero nunca pensei que uma loja como o mundo fantasma e pondo favoritismos de lado que a maior loja de portugal em termos de stock atacasse a central comics uma loja mais pequena
2365629 cc o sustento do hugo penso eu por isso e apesar de pessoalmente nao concordar muito essa regra mais que aceit vel
2365630 eu em ponto algum disse que o mundo fantasma n o tinha raz o e mesmo assim acho que n o tinha o hugo j n o trabalhava para a devir nessa altura acho eu s disse achei mal o mundo fantasma ter se preocupado em salientar esses factos
2365631 sim mas so apareceu a regra quando a cc passou a ser uma loja fisica enquanto era virtual n o se preocupavam lololo
2365632 ja viste a nova regra que querem impor no forum de um post por topico lololo
2365633 mas o blog n o se referiu a loja fisica mas aos trofeus e aos premiados diferente
2365634 o principal promotor dos pr mios trabalhava na devir sob um pseud nimo e durante esse tempo premiou alarvemente o patr o e at como argumentista ganha os seus pr prios pr mios
2365635 quer dizer faz sentido s quando teve uma loja f sica que o hugo resolveu implantar essa regra h que ter lucros para ele s acho que absurdo nao se poder mencionar as lojas pois toda a gente sabe quais s o
2365636 sendo os tcc uma iniciativa da loja com a coordena o do hugo um ataque aos tcc a dizer
2365637 um ataque ao hugo e n o aos tcc em si

2365641 any idea whether this will work on the original 9200 pvr
2365642 i think its safe to assume that now that bell has introduced this feature their competitors wont stay behind for long and no internal hds are not swappable on any pvr unit that im aware of unless you dont mind voiding the warranty
2365643 i think itll be nice for the students to come in and see their teachers work and i think from the community too itd be nice to get the community in here to see what our art teachers and other teachers are doing for our children in the school system

2365654 a lot of stuff around here is oh bad they show the bad stuff and i dont know it feels good to be able to be noticed i guess

2365668 the russians have got to be ashamed of themselves second half i dont know whats the point of going through a two year qualifying campaign if theyre going to go out in the second half and not be bothered they went out as if it meant nothing
2365669 theres a melancholy in the russian nature a bit like the welsh
2365670 if you listen to an aria instead of a hip hop your attention span might grow and you might reflect and look into your soul as some people like to do
2365671 sometimes when you make a mistake at the back you need to make another one to get out of trouble

2365700 we have our routine patrols through the neighborhoods really what we strive to have is the close relationships with the community members

2365728 disarmament alone will not make the world safer we need to continue sending a tough message that we will not tolerate nuclear proliferation we are working hard to strengthen the nuclear non proliferation treaty and reinvigorate the global commitment to it if all states live up to both the letter and the spirit of the obligations under that treaty the vision can become a reality

2365747 think my best friends wedding with a sexual twist and you get the picture

2365928 i dont know if its just my personality or my game
2365929 but we were pretty busy because we had an outing today so it was hard to keep up
2365930 he got to go to the british so his mother gets to be with him this week
2365931 obviously i havent had success at augusta but the u s open british open and this one i feel suit my game quite well
2365932 ive heard a lot of comments this week from anywhere to hes wearing a lions jersey so theres no way he can win because of the luck of the lions
2365933 the attacks in stanbul on thursday were launched by the martyr ongan battalion a group within the pkk
2365934 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2365935 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2365936 i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2365937 thousands of friends of the senator and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2365938 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2365939 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2365940 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it
2365941 when you look into a mirror do you like whats looking at you now that youve seen your true reflections what on earth are you gonna do
2365942 i actually walked the country to see who i am who i really am but i dont know what the result of that will be
2365943 i realized the pros dont hit it any further than i do
2365944 when i hit my driver like i did today this is an easy sport
2365945 i dont think its going to be won by 1 under par
2365946 i just need to make sure that i stay around where i am and maybe a little closer to par thats going to have a chance on sunday
2365947 its the kind of round ive been looking for to get myself back on the leaderboard and feeling the good vibes
2365948 when i got here on tuesday i called home and i said this is the hardest golf course ive ever played
2365949 if i were to play here every day i dont know if i would enjoy it its a very difficult golf course
2365950 regarding the pga in my neck of the woods at oakland hills i think its time for the euro drought to end harrington has a great chance to win this tournament i hope he does dont laugh but ian poulter i have a feeling will play very well the crazy thought of the week is darren clarke playing very well its time for him to start getting things going i thought anthony kim could win but i have played the south course and those greens require precision and am not sure he has the touch phil wont win since he cant handle hitting fairways daly should just stay home if hes gonna shoot a pair of 82s finally vijay his putter isnt going to work at oakland hills
2365951 tiger is very sadly missed and it was painful to watch the last nine of this tournament without him kudos to vijay for good solid ball striking and persevering in spite of putting woes which do tend to come with his age but what can you say about the phil sideshow it is about time that we all looked at phil and decided that the emperor has no clothes and stopped being afraid to say so
2365952 michelle wie hasnt won anything since turning pro if she cant win on the lpga what makes her think she can win on the pga
2365953 the wgc event at firestone was one of least compelling events i have watched this year what is with the opposite field events for the best of the rest surely sponsors cant be that desperate but we know they are when they keep inviting michelle wie the ladies british open was the best golf over the weekend the u s senior open was surprisingly without drama it was nice to see cabrera win but with no one challenging him i soon lost interest there just seems to be a total lack of charisma without tiger woods in the field vijay was hanging on for dear life and phil cant play unless he has dave pelz analyzing every shot and has butch harmon heckling everyone else if phil had one iota of course management with his ability he would run away from the field dont you think that it is time for butch to stop trying to horn in on the limelight one last thing what is with the olympics and golf our great game has no business in the olympics i can just see golfs version of ski jumpings eddie the eagle can you imagine tiger teeing it up with someone from some have not country who cant break 100
2365954 my friends laugh at me because i like to split my hi def screen between the pga tour and nascar on sunday afternoons
2365955 when you have a city that has been careful about its image for the last couple of decades but we have an ordinance thats outdated we need to slowly change that and this is the first step in getting that done
2365956 we have a lot of working people who get off work and come in to have a drink
2365957 its hurting the bar owners and the bartenders its hurting our tips
2365958 i dont want it to get to where it affecting what i do in my back yard
2365959 i dont think they should have a beer joint in the middle of a residential place
2365960 this is a byproduct of the smoking ban that went into effect
2365961 our children are the most valuable resource theyre the most important thing so we just need to do all we can to keep them safe
2365962 the people in belize do not have access to preventative or restorative care so what we would like to do is offer dental services to them where otherwise they would just need extractions
2365963 we dont have any thoughts or anything like that we havent had any witnesses and nothing to show at this point foul play
2365964 were going to treat any investigation like this as a criminal investigation until anything proves otherwise
2365965 were trying our best to work with other agencies hopefully we can link these things together
2365966 shes been having a wonderful experience here at wvu and loves the program
2365967 ill be throwing in a week ill probably throw the beginning of next week
2365968 well that kind of puts a damper on even a yankees win
2365969 we are all going to miss sarge who was a patriot first and a professional golfer second
2365970 he embodied a bit of golfs everyman whom we all could identify with having risen from his oklahoma roots as part native american and serving his country in a 14 year army career
2365971 he will always be remembered for winning the 1969 u s open the last player to win after being in local and sectional qualifying orville later added a u s senior open to his resume in a successful champions tour career our thoughts go out to his family and our membership mourns his loss yet we take solace that his legacy will inspire generations to come
2365972 with the equipment the players have today i think this course is easier than it was when hogan won in 1951
2365973 this is the way a major championship golf course should be set up
2365974 you kind of had to know what you were getting into here
2365975 weve been reading about it all year you have to embrace it
2365976 i think if your speed is good sometimes its easier to read the big breaks rather than if its just quite subtle
2365977 you almost feel like youre being tested on every shot that you hit
2365978 its tough kids got to play like iron man football they get no breaks you got to be in the best shape and you cant get injured it makes it tough on the kids and on us trying to figure out when we can give a kid a break so it doesnt hurt the team
2365979 we have kids that played last year that should be here because they would be starting i dont know why theyre not here weve been calling them like crazy trying to get them out here because the reps are nice but we need numbers
2365980 it could be very challenging were gonna have to play every down stay in shape get stronger run hard practice hard just think positive
2365981 were all in pretty good shape right now and we have to be because most of us arent going to come out the entire game i mean offense defense and special teams a lot of us will be on the field every single play
2365982 talent wise i think were in pretty good shape the kids that are here are really doing a good job and i think they will do a good job through the season we just need some more number out
2365983 you know i think we are all aware of what being a christian costs of all the things we cant do but i think we need to get better at sharing all the wonderful things that come to christians like god incidents instead of coincidents
2365984 my name is ozymandias king of kings look on my works ye mighty and despair
2365985 the bunkers are completely flooded we cleared the water away from some greens and some are perfect with thunder storms expected in the afternoon it would be unfair to commence the second round
2365986 and we try to resolve them while yes saving humanity
2365987 xena the warrior was always pragmatic it was about getting the job done
2365988 gabrielle was more about the open heart and trying to save everyone gabrielle wants to save xena and ava wants to save nicholas
2365989 and we joked around later that we were there to bless the set because they were all damned its been a long time since ive actually worked with lucy on a film set together but its like picking up a bike again she and i have a shorthand we can literally say two words to each other and we know what were saying that just felt really nice
2365990 the little cameos that lucy and i played in bitch slap were a real treat directly for all you guys out there you know
2365991 i have a couple lines you guys are going to love
2365992 elise if i give you any more collagen your lips are gonna look like they got stuck in a pool drain
2365993 you will have a curfew of 7 p m to 7 a m wear an ankle monitor and have no contact with these children
2365994 i would give him something to drink and he would just throw up throw up
2365995 he was like lying on the bathroom floor he couldnt move
2365996 i cant keep the water from getting in his mouth his ears whatever
2365997 theres no way to prevent that if hes playing in there
2365998 we havent been able to identify the patients because everybodys unconscious
2365999 having a patient thats not a known name is really nothing new to us
2366000 we take care of the patient to begin with and worry about their name is secondary
2366001 we were even able to solicit within our community here various vietnamese interpreters and translators
2366002 so we had folks available in their native language to discuss cases injuries and keep them updated
2366003 when i come to help them i see them very happy or relieved
2366004 you can see the hapy lights flashing in their eyes
2366005 i just think its really a part of your life that you gotta keep to yourself
2366006 youve got to find what you love and that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers if you havent found it yet keep looking dont settle as with all matters of the heart youll know when you find it
2366007 getting up in the morning and having work you love is what makes life different for people and if you get into a position where you really dont love what youre doing get off it its easy to be on someone elses track or something that sounds like a safety play
2366008 youve got to find what you love and that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers if you havent found it yet keep looking dont settle as with all matters of the heart youll know when you find it
2366009 getting up in the morning and having work you love is what makes life different for people and if you get into a position where you really dont love what youre doing get off it its easy to be on someone elses track or something that sounds like a safety play
2366010 to go wrong in ones own way is better than to go right in someone elses in the first case you are a man in the second youre no better than a bird
2366011 o minist rio p blico ajuizou ainda a o civil p blica contra o estado do rio grande do sul propondo a
2366012 it was improvisational questions and answers with host russell brand just like other promo guest stars ll cool j and pete wentz did russell joked about there being sexual tension and britney shot back i dont feel the tension the other joke was about no one knowing who russell was so she called him by the wrong name ll called him russell bland and britney called him russell brown
2366013 we went 14 hours with no epidural having contractions every two minutes it was the best dance we ever had
2366014 we have this wonderful thing weve been working on and now it looks like weve got a gun to our head
2366015 that was spectacular tonight the world was able to join in a magnificent tribute to the athletes and the olympic spirit it was an unforgettable and moving ceremony that celebrated the imagination originality and energy of the beijing games
2366016 we saw 204 national delegations march into the beautiful new national stadium in the age old tradition of the games millions of people around the world were able to experience the thrill of seeing their heroes in a sea of team colours and national flags
2366017 we witnessed athletes from these 204 countries and territories united in peace in one place
2366018 this iconic stadium is one of the worlds new wonders it was a fitting setting for an amazing opening ceremony i look forward to an equally exciting and unforgettable 16 days
2366019 opening ceremonies have always been a way for host cities to welcome the world and for the world to gather and share the olympic spirit this ceremony to open the beijing olympic games was a breathtaking culmination of seven years of planning and preparation the world will remember this for a long time
2366020 tonight wasnt the end of a journey but the fantastic beginning of 16 days of outstanding sport competition this was a night to remember for the chinese people and for the world
2366021 he went to washington and became part of the problem
2366022 he voted with bush more than 90 percent of the time the people of missouri dont agree with george bush nine out of 10 times
2366023 i lay out a health care plan and they attack it and call it welfare for kids
2366024 as if a 1 year old whos sick doesnt have the same rights they do
2366025 when youve been immersed in the politics of jefferson city for decades how can you credibly say that youre an agent of change
2366026 what i support is the hulshof agenda that brings a fresh perspective to jefferson city
2366027 i dont think hulshof will be able to get away with the lack of substance that he showed during the primary campaign
2366028 he is a capable politician and hes knowledgeable but he shied away from that during the primary
2366029 weve tried to create an event that will be of interest to anyone who loves the coast
2366030 but our special goal is to deepen the knowledge of those who will then share this knowledge with others whether that be as coastwatch volunteers name members or in other roles so the conference has a double focus not only on coastal and marine science but on how to share the information with a broader public or with young people
2366031 i am excited as heck about jared crick he earned his way up with the ones and he had another good day today
2366032 hes a veteran and a smart guy he did great the first couple days of practice we decided to rest him today hes going to be fine i dont worry about ty at all as long as he stays on and keeps with his exercise routine that back shouldnt bother him once the season begins
2366033 they have to be smart were asking them to think a lot
2366034 they have a lot of different assignments but ultimately they have to be physical and they have to be willing to play men and not gaps and command double teams hold their own and try to keep our linebackers free
2366035 i like the flow of people along the street and theres something different in every shop
2366036 i see people here i know from newport and the belpre area
2366037 its just something different we had dinner and just like to look at everything
2366038 as for bringing people downtown its good there isnt a lot of buying but people dont want to fool with it when they are visiting and all
2366039 this is a great way for an artist to get exposure
2366040 i talked with a lot of travelers and we had good conversations
2366041 to let the families know their loved ones have not been forgotten and to let those who have taken our loved ones know we have not forgotten as well
2366042 oh love it love it every day is a new experience and theyre just so great
2366043 my son said mom theres been a fire in olathe and i said not the place i want to move into
2366044 and its just amazing how things turned from where this was four years ago to where it is right now
2366045 restrictions were placed on trawling with the enabling law in 2001 forcing the commercial fishing companies to only use the method in deeper waters thus benefiting local fisherman
2366046 we have approved the law prohibiting trawling because we decided that what we had done was not enough we will help commercial fishers convert over to traditional fishing methods
2366047 the production quadrupled a growth of 300 percent and thats going to continue to go up
2366048 it popped in my head to lay it down in the fairway and hit a shot down there
2366049 if the pin was easier you might have saw a bit more of that but where they put the pin its pretty much impossible you have to try to get up where you can chip on
2366050 just because its a shorter hole doesnt make it a great hole
2366051 this was an opportunity for us to promote our company name in belpre
2366052 they asked if wed come and i thought wed give it a try
2366053 were selling a lot of chairs today for the concert and parade
2366054 its a good way for them to become involved in the community
2366055 they like to be princesses and they like to make new friends they keep doing it because its fun
2366056 ive never been here before but i wanted to play guitar hero
2366057 im not sure if ill stay until it starts but i rode some carnival rides and hung out with friends so it was fun
2366058 these smaller shows are more personable and you have more time to connect with the audience
2366059 the transit discussions in the region really showed the benefit of talking together
2366060 we discovered quickly that issues of water traffic and crime dont know jurisdictional boundaries
2366061 its amazing to have so much support and so many people behind you i feel absolutely blessed to be a part of this parish
2366062 father john zahn associate pastor at our lady of grace has been following david for a while and he came to the trials he has been very very supportive as well as the parish
2366063 he dives all over the world but he has always just been very unassuming
2366064 well talk for a while about what is going on in his life there is absolutely no pretense
2366065 he said you dont know what this means to me
2366066 when i was little i used to watch my cousin and my brother at their diving practices and i tried to do the same stuff they did
2366067 i could do the same things without any training so they thought i should try diving
2366068 the night before a competition i always pray and my church has been praying for me i know that has helped
2366069 they are at mass every week they have been working hard at this for years mary beth is a well rounded wonderful young lady and a humble child
2366070 the entire parish has been praying for her i was at her house after they found out she had made the olympic team they were so excited they always do things with style neighbors had already spray painted hula hoops in the olympic ring colors to decorate their yard it was beautiful to see them
2366071 the town is making shirts with pictures of her and shes autographing them
2366072 bishop william l higi has blessed her twice father paul prays here at church and had everyone say a decade of the rosary for her
2366073 her uncles cloistered community of monks is praying for her it goes from our little catholic community all the way to the monks in chile we have lit a lot of candles im still taking deep breaths
2366074 will provide the karmic conditions for living beings to obtain immediate happiness leave the sufferings and hardships of samsara forever and attain the ultimate state of buddhahood
2366075 in both these cases we need to consider the fact that there was the human element involved
2366076 certainly security is our number 1 concern and we will ensure that all of the recommendations from the internal review will be implemented
2366077 we dont need another 5 000 or 6 000 or 7 000 condos to compound the present problem
2366078 its already too congested and this will compound it even more
2366079 where you create residential a denser retail and entertainment opportunities all on a site thats already well served with transit
2366080 first thing in the morning everyones going to work the shops arent open our peak hours are usually in the middle of the day and on weekends
2366081 you know they say its a great plan but they dont live here
2366082 three night clubs in coney island avenue between hermit sic place and caton avenue brooklyn were destroyed by fire soon after closing time yesterday morning with a property loss of about 150 000 from the riding academy next door
2366083 the fire of unknown but officials said possibly incendiary origin apparently started about 4 a
2366084 by the time four alarms had been turned in and before 200 firemen with 30 pieces of apparatus had arrived on the spot the flames had eaten through the walls of the cats meow and were rapidly consuming the adjoining resorts
2366085 edward markey mounted police sergeant was roused from sleep in his home at 399 coney island avenue arriving at the fire only partially dressed he fought through the smoke and flames and released the maddened animals
2366086 the rest however which had kicked down a plaster wall of the stable in their frantic efforts to escape the heat and smoke broke away from the hands of the reserves of the tenth division police and stampeded through the neighborhood
2366087 the police reserves mounted the seven police horses and swinging improvised lariats set about rounding up the frenzied beasts
2366088 i basically just tuck it in my car and leave hoping that nothing happens
2366089 theyre going by looking in vehicles seeing a laptop an ipod a purse something that they want and then breaking the window in the vehicle
2366090 my car isnt worth much so i think nobody would ever want to steal it
2366091 you get somebody in these groups they know everybody else whos doing what where you can take these items where you can fence this and fence that
2366092 we cant dabble in the business policies or the personnel policies of an airline
2366093 what we found was that because they carried less fuel on the airplane they were getting into situations where they had to tell air traffic control i need to get on the ground
2366094 the additional cost of carrying unnecessary fuel adversely affects americans financial success
2366095 we didnt see any proposed changes we thought needed to be made
2366096 to either not stop for fuel when needed or to carry insufficient amounts of fuel
2366097 adding fuel indiscriminately reduces profit sharing and possibly pension funding
2366098 me kaipasimme h nt viime kaudella kaipasimme h nen johtajuuttaan ja rauhallisuuttaan

2366104 in heaven the lovers are french the cooks are italian the police are english and its organised by the germans
2366105 in hell the lovers are german the cooks are english the police are french and its organised by the italians
2366106 channel nine the station that feminism multiculturalism and innovation forgot
2366107 channel nine would you like a dumb blonde with that
2366108 youve made it quite clear in your column on various occasions that you dislike channel nine and our program line up therefore id hate to waste your time and cause you any further heartache reviewing our shows
2366109 his is a face that could get away with blue murder indeed many conservatives types think he already has as theres no sensitive subject that he hasnt prodded with his gasp inducing humour in his mockumentaries we can be heroes and summer heights high try racism class political correctness disabilities homosexuality pedophilia incest drugs eating disorders

2366112 i think we are about the furthest community away from the school and to not have transportation if you live a mile you can still walk there it takes about 15 minutes from here theres just no way
2366113 our research shows that over a third of people privately renting are doing so because they cant get a mortgage at the moment
2366114 on the surface of it this looks like the rental market should be buoyant but if you consider that many of those renting may be struggling to make ends meet its certainly not all good news for buy to let owners
2366115 is this story referring in allegory to george w bush
2366116 literature is something we infer after the story has been told
2366117 john edwards was not aware that assistance was provided to anyone involved in this matter
2366118 i did it of my own volition and without the knowledge instruction or suggestion of john edwards or anyone else the assistance was offered and accepted without condition
2366119 to have been given under the influence of passion and prejudice
2366120 our understanding is that this encounter stemmed from a momentary misunderstanding as to the exact location of the u s mexican border
2366121 former democratic presidential candidate john edwards on friday admitted to an extramarital affair while his wife was battling cancer he denied fathering the womans daughter
2366122 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2366123 edwards is no longer an elected official and he is not running for office now dont expect wall to wall coverage
2366124 of course i mean for a lot of americans including the family that i grew up with i mean its fundamental to how you judge people and human character whether you keep your word whether you keep what is your ultimate word which is that you love your spouse and youll stay with them i think the most important qualities in a president in todays world are trustworthiness sincerity honesty strength of leadership and and certainly that goes to a part of that

2366128 this decision confirms the right every california child has to a quality education and the right parents have to decide what is best for their children
2366129 i hope the ruling settles this matter for parents and home schooled children once and for all in california but assure them that we as elected officials will continue to defend parents rights

2366134 you should keep them in a locked garage if possible but if you cant you should always keep the cars locked
2366135 you should try to park your car near your bedroom so you can hear if someone is trying to enter it

2366143 drop by drop sorrow loneliness and despair pass through the dark empty room where flesh bleeds sex exudes beauty and sweat and ghosts of the past wander through images of distorted bodies many will recall the marlon brando film version this adaptation captures much of the core of that movies very abyss in stunning portrayals by startling and courageous young actors surrounded by live cameras creating a sexual tragedy haunted by sounds of lost tangos and the shadow of myths

2366161 ten years for me is confirmation that i have come out the other side accepting what my life has become and loving it so completely
2366162 i have never found talking about my story an easy thing to do
2366163 i struggle to find a balance between who i was before the murders and who i had become
2366164 privacy continues to be part of my survival privacy was the only thing i could control
2366165 my name was changed on the advice of the police to avoid being traced as strange as this may sound their reasoning was that carmel miller did not exist she had no identity she couldnt be found in any phone book or on any electoral rolls
2366166 the police felt that this course of action was necessary because at that time they did not know who they were dealing with and james and i needed to be protected

2366169 ten years on my life has reached a point where i feel that my experiences have taught me much
2366170 i have learned that a persons treatment through the criminal justice system can influence their ability to come out the other side intact
2366171 i have learned that being a victim of crime thrusts you into a different category of society you have to learn things about yourself the community and media without any instruction booklet
2366172 i have learned about the kindness of strangers the stories of other victims and met people who in my previous life would never have acknowledged my presence
2366173 i went into the court process naive and uninitiated and found that i came out with both positive and negative impressions
2366174 i learned that you cant expect the legal process to provide you with the panacea to ease your loss and your pain
2366175 yet a sensitively and humanely run trial can make a difference and provide an end to the legal proceedings which can allow victims of crime to have a new beginning simply because they have experienced a little bit of justice and dignity in the process as well as in the outcome
2366176 i have learned that it is okay to love your life so completely and acknowledge it without fearing that you are dishonouring those who have died what i have also learned is that you honour them more by living

2366232 i watched that video and i think the press is trying to create some sort of soap opera

2366263 fernandez was extremely tough he showed great heart and determination i dont know any other fighters who could stand up to some of the shots i hit him with that being said i am very happy with my performance the game plan coming in was to work the body and try to break him down i am very happy with the team that is around me right now i have full confidence that my manager ben and joe deguardias star boxing are going to take me to the top of the division i am going to rest for a little while and then get right back in the gym where i go from here is up to ben and joe but i feel that i am ready i hope everyone in attendance and everyone watching at home was pleased with my performance and i look forward to fighting again as soon as possible
2366264 i am happy they stopped it i knew vinny could punch but wow he hits hard i felt like i got kicked by a mule

2366286 i was hoping the riverdale mayor and council realized the effect it will have not only in riverdale but on its neighbors like pompton lakes it will affect our school system and definitely our traffic the population of the high school will be strained
2366287 a good decision overall the goal being to revitalize and to redevelop dilapidated industrial properties in the southeastern portion of the borough
2366288 multifamily units for seniors have statistically been the most undesired
2366289 there would be difficulty financing the project because its multifamily and age restricted

2366312 the adoption of a fully computerized customs administration and new technologies such as web based secure communications cargo tracking mobile x ray technology gamma ray cavity detectors video monitoring electronic customs seals specialized aircraft and vessels digital identification cards and others has the potential to substantially speed the movement of goods and facilitate trade
2366313 in developing countries with authoritarian regimes this could be a powerful precedent for the development of democratic institutions

2366353 thats something were definitely going to have to work on most of those plays were plays where a guy got sucked in and were going to have to work on that but we can adjust weve got guys who are very versatile in what they can do so we can adjust to that thats no problem
2366354 were happy about that and now we have to continue to build on that
2366355 there is some speculation of the time he will be out but well have to do some discussing of that situation maybe even this evening
2366356 they couldve lost every game i still wouldve loved them
2366357 i kind of learned the game from them thats who i was pretending to be
2366358 i pictured myself out on the field as a kid and then just walking out there it was unbelievable
2366359 thats why i wanted to get all that out of the way so when im out there pitching i wont be in a dreamland
2366360 im hoping to give them six strong innings thats my goal
2366361 for some reason our yard was the perfect wiffleball yard the way our roof was that was our green monster you really had to get a hold of one to get it over
2366362 with all my friends it was always the angels id never been to a dodger game until last year with the giants
2366363 they couldve lost every game i still wouldve loved them
2366364 i kind of learned the game from them thats who i was pretending to be
2366365 i pictured myself out on the field as a kid and then just walking out there it was unbelievable
2366366 thats why i wanted to get all that out of the way so when im out there pitching i wont be in a dreamland

2366369 with all my friends it was always the angels id never been to a dodger game until last year with the giants
2366370 im not going to speculate when hes going to come back just because i dont want to put any pressure on him
2366371 players think that when they get hurt they can come back the next day but well be smart about it
2366372 no not at all it would have been different if i wasnt still throwing 99 mph it was a different feeling that i never had so i just wanted to make sure
2366373 ive been a little out in front with my swing
2366374 i havent been taking it that hard its a new series new at bats
2366375 im not going to speculate when hes going to come back just because i dont want to put any pressure on him
2366376 players think that when they get hurt they can come back the next day but well be smart about it
2366377 no not at all it would have been different if i wasnt still throwing 99 mph it was a different feeling that i never had so i just wanted to make sure
2366378 ive been a little out in front with my swing
2366379 i havent been taking it that hard its a new series new at bats
2366380 and i was translating them into green bay terms to favre the wording was different i was using the terminology we had in green bay kellen did a great job but we have a long way to go
2366381 the only way youre going to know these guys know how they play and know the coaches is to be in meetings and to go to practice
2366382 the concepts are the same but its just the terminology thats different
2366383 i want these guys to know me know what im about how i play what type of leadership i have to me the most important aspect of winning is chemistry
2366384 hes going to work extremely hard for the remainder of this training camp
2366385 its a little different with someone who has the experience of brett as opposed to rookies he has a wealth of experience to draw from there will be a lot of association with the concepts hes familiar with we may adjust some of our terminology to fast track him
2366386 and i was translating them into green bay terms to favre the wording was different i was using the terminology we had in green bay kellen did a great job but we have a long way to go

2366392 the jets organization didnt feel i was the quarterback to lead them where they wanted to go
2366393 thats extremely clear thats fine thats part of being in the business thats why you cant take it personal the most difficult part of the last 24 hours is coming to the realization that youre no longer wanted by your organization youve been there eight years and in the blink of an eye youre not wanted but i have an inner peace about it
2366394 right now im focused on the next opportunity i can either look at this as an obstacle or an opportunity
2366395 it makes me feel good that teams were interested that solidifies the fact that im a good quarterback and i can play this game and i can start and win
2366396 the jets organization didnt feel i was the quarterback to lead them where they wanted to go
2366397 thats extremely clear thats fine thats part of being in the business thats why you cant take it personal the most difficult part of the last 24 hours is coming to the realization that youre no longer wanted by your organization youve been there eight years and in the blink of an eye youre not wanted but i have an inner peace about it
2366398 right now im focused on the next opportunity i can either look at this as an obstacle or an opportunity
2366399 it makes me feel good that teams were interested that solidifies the fact that im a good quarterback and i can play this game and i can start and win
2366400 i made a couple of mistakes the guy started to feel much more comfortable on the court and the momentum was gone
2366401 i didnt serve very well in the third set and the balls are pretty slow so it was difficult for my game i could not change it by serving and volleying it was perfect for him because he was playing very simple tennis
2366402 yes it would be good if i am but i am not going to shoot myself if i am not
2366403 the key was just to put the ball back as much as possible it was not so easy at the beginning he was playing very strong but i think i did a good job
2366404 you have to remember that this market has baffled anyone whos used fundamentals or charts but if youre a chartist today is the death knell for the possibility of new highs in the marketplace
2366405 the biggest driving factor now to the downside is the fact that the u s economy has a lot of company right now in terms of weakening economic growth
2366406 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2366407 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2366408 i spent a lot of time trying to get the engine going it kept going in and out i kept working the throttle trying to keep it going in doing that i inadvertently kept flying and wound up over the neighborhood
2366409 i still thought i could pull it off over the wires but then the wheels caught and pulled me right down into the wires
2366410 so when i came down i kind of went forward but this knee hit the sidewalk and it shattered my kneecap
2366411 theyre very safe planes i guess he just had engine problems and had to put it down somewhere he tried to put it down on the road and hit some power lines
2366412 i feel real bad that i destroyed my friends airplane
2366413 i dont know where its going to go next i guess instead of buying my own plane i guess i need to buy him a new one
2366414 i think you can just look at the economy and see that everyone is having a tough time right now with all of their bills
2366415 this is the worst bill ive ever had ive never had a bill this high
2366416 ive never been cut off but the way things are looking now i dont know
2366417 i thought this opportunity would never come i really didnt
2366418 i thought no one loved me and no one was there for me i just thought my life was over and i didnt have anything to look forward to
2366419 the need is so strong so the fact that we have these young people who are dedicated and who have been trained its very inspiring
2366420 i know therere a lot of people out there in these struggling times that need the help that we can provide
2366421 we had been trying for a while so we were obviously very ecstatic when we found out that we were pregnant
2366422 you think were having a baby lets buy baby furniture and to be prepared we had to buy a burial plot
2366423 the day we got the news it was like if youre on a ride at the fair where the bottom drops out and youre still held on the sides of it it just felt like somebody took the floor out from under us
2366424 she did have some facial anomalies that could be scary when you first look at her so how do we work with our 4 year old we were able to help the family in that light
2366425 you think i dont know if i can handle watching my child die but it was very peaceful and sweet and we were together thats all that mattered we were together
2366426 i eat because im depressed im depressed because i eat
2366427 using humor to heal and educate with badly drawn cartoons
2366428 how can i rejoice when my children the egyptians have been destroyed
2366429 12 percent and 35 percent per week for a minimum of 40 weeks
2366430 i find it somewhat surprising that the attorney general is issuing press releases without notifying mr talbot of the lawsuit
2366431 12 percent and 35 percent per week for a minimum of 40 weeks
2366432 i find it somewhat surprising that the attorney general is issuing press releases without notifying mr talbot of the lawsuit
2366433 i am extremely pleased to launch the jack 1 foundation and im very happy that the kick off events are happening in my beloved hometown of port arthur
2366434 giving back to the community is something that i have believed in strongly throughout my entire nba career i feel blessed to be in a position where i can start my own charitable foundation that allows me to work more closely with deserving community groups both here in port arthur and my adopted home in the bay area
2366435 whoops i was actually supposed to be doing something i wonder what it was
2366436 nearly 13 and so many people visit her site and lavish their attention on her little kids real or not on the internet it always a source of weirdness to me
2366437 die deutsche bank hat ihre kunden falsch beraten und so getan als seien ars wie bargeld
2366438 everything from the ground to the ceiling is going to have to be replaced obviously this is completely gone
2366439 t m on oudoin harrastukseni mutta t ll on omanlaisensa tunnelma
2366440 oh honey its a really sweet story he bought me on ebay
2366441 we just cant be 10th in the country for salaries and expect we would get the best people
2366442 i recognize that these are top decision makers and if we want to retain
2366443 we want to be able to attract the best the country has to offer and we can only do that if our salaries are comparable to alberta and ontario
2366444 our objective is to help integrators improve their visibility in the marketplace todays times are tough and they need an integrated approach to marketing our partnership with cedia helps ci integrators reach that objective our marketing tools offer a complete solution that is professional easy to acquire and affordable
2366445 and three or four more large sheets of paper that caught my eye walking into paper source is like visiting a paper lovers paradise the website doesnt do it justice the walls are covered in endless rows of paper in various styles materials and colors they have a huge stationary and card making section where you can find paper envelopes die cut shape papers and more its pure deliciousness they also have gorgeous ribbon books cards nic nacks flowers and other trinkets to buy cant leave the store empty handed another good reason not to visit the place too much laugh heres a sampling of my goodies from the trip because these are sold in a 20
2366446 ive been raising lambs for a couple of years now
2366447 this is the second time ive gotten grand champion so its a lot of fun
2366448 i like all the rides and the animals and the food
2366449 with our deal where you pay the one ticket price
2366450 and you get to ride the rides and go to all the shows and everything and theres no additional cost its made it real nice for us people are happy
2366451 you dont know the feeling until you lose a very close friend
2366452 if anything were getting just inundated with people who want to help
2366453 as a community we can come together in a time of crisis
2366454 it was definitely kind of disheartening for me because ive been a packers fan basically my whole life
2366455 and him in another uniform i couldnt picture it it didnt seem right
2366456 the stuff that is remaining is going to become nostalgic at this point and there is only going to be a limited number of packers memorabilia left
2366457 you know brett favre fans are going to want brett favre stuff no matter what uniform he is in
2366458 im not going to pull for the jets but ill keep an on them ill always be a brett fan
2366459 brett is probably the best quarterback ive ever seen play
2366460 he is very athletic he has got that gun slinger mentality that i think most fans like you never know what hes going to do
2366461 schools are looking at me mostly as a db but some are looking at me as an athlete some as a receiver its a whole lot of different positions
2366462 they all want to see some senior film washington said they would come to one of our first three games and look at me in person
2366463 my top five schools are arizona state oregon oregon state ucla and washington
2366464 im not in a rush to decide i want to take some visits for sure
2366465 the schools havent really seen me play as much because i havent been to the college camps and we had other guys on our team last year that got a lot of attention
2366466 but its been a good attention to the school that theyve brought
2366467 im just taking it stride staying patient and working hard
2366468 weve been building a water balloon cannon to fight back against the madeline
2366469 im a british squire so normally i have my nice powdered wig on as well and a very large ridiculously loud coat
2366470 my wife and mom were hoping that johhny depp would be out here tonight
2366471 what we wanted to do is tie something into maritime month august has been maritime month in marquette for three years now
2366472 and they wanted to tie into we have our beautiful lake here and having a little fun with the pirate theme
2366473 this all goes back to the repeal of prohibition 75 years ago its time for a change its time to bring indianas laws into the 21st century
2366474 when you remove that monopoly and allow competition to take place in that cold beer segment prices are going to fall
2366475 i dont know if itll increase our sales or just spread it out over seven days
2366476 its met with mixed emotions on behalf on this mayor and the council but we feel like we have to do this to protect our citizens
2366477 this is the only house weve ever had my wife and i have been married 39 years and raised all our kids here
2366478 i was hoping something like that would happen i was pretty sure it would i dont see how they could hardly do anything else these houses arent livable
2366479 they must elevate those homes anywhere from two and half feet to as high as seven feet
2366480 that could be a real problem as a matter of fact it is a real problem for the city of martinsville like all communities right now we are operating on very limited budgets
2366481 what a great explainer he is for simple minds like mine
2366482 its really important that we proceed with this project because its been on the books for over 20 years
2366483 everyone then who hears these words of mine and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on rock the rain fell the floods came and the winds blew and beat on that house but it died not fall because it had been founded on rock
2366484 wasch mich mach aber bitte nicht nass das ist wohl eine leitphilosophie in deutschland
2366485 oppressed people played a leading role in building for this march and the slogans of the march addressed their needs this is a real departure for the movement
2366486 american trade unionists say money for jobs and human needs not war machines
2366487 beat back the attacks on government workers and on social services
2366488 this is making it tough to speak and thats what i do for a living
2366489 its better to be in the mix than out of the mix
2366490 it all depends on how you are on the field
2366491 that was a start of something it helped me get confidence back there
2366492 im not disappointed i didnt play much before because it gave me time to mature it made me smarter on the field im able to handle different situations better i dont put anything against the coaches or program that i wasnt playing before im happy that im playing now ive got to take it from here on dont look in the past look to the future
2366493 my goal is to come out here and be consistent and show the coaches i can play so we can spread the ball out
2366494 theyre going to get most of the balls but im showing the coaches i can still play
2366495 they know its coming pretty soon theyre going to win a national championship here hopefully
2366496 its better to be in the mix than out of the mix
2366497 it all depends on how you are on the field
2366498 that was a start of something it helped me get confidence back there
2366499 im not disappointed i didnt play much before because it gave me time to mature it made me smarter on the field im able to handle different situations better i dont put anything against the coaches or program that i wasnt playing before im happy that im playing now ive got to take it from here on dont look in the past look to the future
2366500 my goal is to come out here and be consistent and show the coaches i can play so we can spread the ball out
2366501 theyre going to get most of the balls but im showing the coaches i can still play
2366502 they know its coming pretty soon theyre going to win a national championship here hopefully
2366503 it gets to you when you come out here and see a 19 or 20 year old guy and you know what theyve been through or what theyre getting ready to go through
2366504 its really special for us to have the opportunity to be here and i hope its something we can continue to do
2366505 its crazy to hear about some of the things these guys have been through
2366506 im playing a game and theyre involved in physical combat theyre serving and protecting us i think we all made sure to let them know just how much we appreciate them
2366507 i was listening to these young guys tell stories about being within 100 yards of a big explosion or being in a helicopter when it went down
2366508 thats the reality of war but its the stuff you dont hear about every day it makes you stop and be thankful for what they do
2366509 theyre doing the dirty work on a daily basis to keep us safe we just entertain the people hopefully our being here shows how much we support our troops and the effort they provide to protect our country
2366510 the reason i like it so much is because the players like it they dont look at it as oh weve got to get on a bus and go somewhere they look forward to it
2366511 if you can manage time you can manage everything in life
2366512 we spend or can spend upwards of 30 000 a week just for the fuel
2366513 i think its a necessity theres a lot of costs involved in kids and their activities in school and sports and its just a part of life i think
2366514 well its hard you got to sell corn the last corn we sold was 7 15 a bushel now its down cash corn around 5 00 so thats going to hurt
2366515 its a great big gamble all the time this year is probably somewhat insecure but they always are
2366516 agriculture has done pretty well because it has an international market our farmers tend to be the most productive in the world plus countries like china continue to grow but a lot of food and the weak dollar have really helped our exports
2366517 as i got up to the gate i saw him laid out
2366518 it was shock it was anger it was frustration all rolled up into on e
2366519 i cant let my kids out in my own front yard ive got five acres and i cant let my kids out in front yard because im afraid of what might happen
2366520 my friend said oh they might be having a barbecue but i said it smelled like burning wood
2366521 so i was like i dont know if thats a barbecue but it stopped so
2366522 financial support and needs for the rest of her life
2366523 some use that positively and some negatively i think it reminds people who i work for the american people and the country i love not a party or me
2366524 we have the second highest business taxes in the world obama wants to raise them in fact he wants to raise taxes on everything he can
2366525 i dont have to tell you folks in lima how tough times are and how much worse that would make it for you i want to relieve the burden we are placing on the backs of our children and their children with the deficit
2366526 obama is a great orator but washington is full of them what he says is different than what he does
2366527 the present speaker doesnt even allow a vote or discussion on items such as drilling i thought thats what you voted them in there to do
2366528 i would call them back into session as president until they do their job
2366529 i am all for developing alternative energy we have the largest coal reserves in the world much of it here in ohio we can use it with the clean technology we have and are developing we have to stop the 700 billion transfer to countries that dont like us
2366530 obama wont acknowledge the surge worked and is working he wants peace but that means unconditional withdrawal
2366531 that would lead to more violence and another war thank god for the brave men and women we have willing to serve
2366532 his basic premise is this government is too big so lets grow it our taxes are too high so lets raise them were winning in iraq so lets quit
2366533 i know you and i will disagree on certain issues and thats good we need that discussion to get us through these tough times i believe we will
2366534 you know where i stand and what motivates me its the same principle that i followed when i was a pow in vietnam and could have been set free for a price i chose to put my country first not to do whatever it takes to get elected as too many politicians are willing to do
2366535 you need a careful balance between being negative about the moveon org crowd and being positive i want my supporters to be proud of the campaign i run at the end of the day americans are pessimistic right now and want to know how you are going to fix things be it health care the mortgage crisis or the price of gas i changed my mind on off shore drilling when 4 a gallon became the norm probably to most of you like me it wasnt an issue a year ago i have talked to experts in the oil drilling field and they tell me it would only take months not years as some say to get the oil flowing so lets do it now
2366536 ask this question what would saddam hussein be doing now with a barrel of oil at 120 hed be doing what every intelligence agency told us then acquiring and perhaps using weapons of mass destruction remember the scandals already in place then the corrupt food for oil program our planes being shot at daily no doubt he was committed to wmds there were mistakes in iraq the initial victory was easy but the strategy to finish it off was wrong and i said so we can disagree about the war but the world is better off without saddam in power
2366537 my wife cindy was a special ed teacher so its a concern education is the future of america and to me its the civil rights issue of the 21st century what are we telling our children if we force them to attend a failing school were shirking our responsibility we need competition charter schools work vouchers work if parents want to home school that is their right weve seen tremendous change in the new york city schools and there are 30 charter schools in new orleans i want to reward good teachers and schools and have bad teachers get a new line of work cindy and i sent our kids to private school as did barack and michelle obama we want every child to have that same choice plus we need to reauthorize but fix no child left behind
2366538 it takes five years to build a nuclear power plant in france they get 80 percent of their electricity from that it just proves that if you live long enough anything can happen weve had nuclear powered subs for 60 years were capable as a nation of meeting every challenge we need to explore every avenue nuclear hydro electric solar wind what high energy costs do is hurt the lowest income people the most the ones who can least afford it if we develop our resources it doesnt matter what the saudis charge
2366539 they should spend more of their own money on their projects
2366540 it will never ever happen while i am president as far as amnesty we need a comprehensive approach to immigration reform i have stressed that we must secure the border with fences high tech surveillance vehicles whatever we have at our disposal then i believe we need a realistic guest worker program we have the tools and prosecute violators we need to be humane and compassionate in dealing with the 12 million illegals this is a national security issue plus we have to deal with the drug cartels that control border towns they are killing americans
2366541 i believe this part of america has provided more service members to our wars than any i propose giving veterans a plastic card let them take it to their doctors and get treatment they should not have to wait and we cannot allow a walter reed situation again this is a tough war as george washington once said how you treat those who fought in previous wars will dictate the willingness of others to serve in present conflicts
2366542 i pointed out previously the old auto jobs in detroit wont return the new ones will the new technologies like flex fuel are where the new jobs will be i propose a 5 000 tax credit for the purchase of one of these vehicles i recently saw an electric car in california that was great it just cost 100 000 just like how cell phones have progressed i firmly believe that once we give the auto industry the incentive and freedom to develop these technologies prices will come down and the industry will bounce back
2366543 one way is to demand that democrats and republicans in congress sit down and give us a workable energy policy featuring all of those items i mentioned and to not leave until they do so i have shown i can work with those on the other side i dont care who gets the credit its not going to happen overnight because this has been ongoing for 30 years
2366544 i feel i will do enough in my campaign to not only reach the american people but to have them reach me i also appreciate freedom of the press
2366545 drilling solves two problems when you increase supply by what were talking about prices go down immediately thats a fact and you relieve pressure on fixed income households what you have is china and india increasing demand on a rather finite resource at this time two it will increase jobs these are well paying ones
2366546 there are two important duties for the vice president one in the event of a tie in the senate he or she casts the tie breaker and two that person will have to check on my health every day
2366547 there is also the all important issue of judges there is expected to be two maybe three vacancies on the supreme court i was proud to vote for president bushs appointees john roberts and samuel alito who i believe are two of the finest in history those who opposed them were strictly on the grounds of ideology not qualification i voted for stephen breyer and ruth bader ginsburg appointed by president clinton because he had won two elections and had earned that right plus i felt they were qualified i will appoint judges who will strictly interpret the law and not legislate
2366548 ill be back to the heartland of america i ask for your votes and support
2366549 he was watching the lottery i had gone to bed
2366550 mietimme minne muuttaisimme ja t m konepaja alue oli yhten vaihtoehtona

2366552 kolmosen ratikka kurvaa kampin kautta jo ensi vuonna ja suunnitelmissa on my s suora raitioyhteys j tk saaresta kamppiin
2366553 itse asiassa kuulin juuri ett kun kampin ratikka aloittaa liikenteen helsingin raitioverkko on laajimmillaan koko historian aikana
2366554 we really were surprised at the level of trust we found we didnt think wed be as successful as we were
2366555 any one of these people would have happily clicked on a malware site or viewed our profile with a data stealing trojan application
2366556 there are many in the market who think these prices are as good as it gets and are positioned to see lower prices but we continue to see one off oil rises near 117 on supply fears
2366557 theoretically this would decrease the amount of money invested in oil as a hedge for the falling dollar
2366558 he felt responsible for making a difference in this world
2366559 if they were having a tough day he was the one to step up to the plate
2366560 he died doing what he wanted to do and protecting others
2366561 they lifted off from the helipad they went forward a slight bit then the aircraft rapidly descended and hit the hillside
2366562 the aircraft was in what they call translational lift meaning it had lifted off and was headed out of the helipad and then it went down it was just a matter seconds after it took off i dont know yet exactly how quick the fire started but had to be very very quickly
2366563 we are not a huge company this has had a very severe impact on us we know between the grayback people on the aircraft and our company its been a huge blow to southern oregon and i know its been a huge blow to the firefighting community
2366564 they have sent in their troops and weapons and they are bombing our towns

2366570 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2366571 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2366572 this is a glorious but also huge task for anyone
2366573 i should never let the dream of all the chinese people down that was why i was nervous
2366574 every time i must balance myself in the air and hold the torch as close to the cauldron gas outlet but every time the wind blew in different directions
2366575 means china is standing side by side with the rest of the world
2366576 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2366577 it looks as though i actually photographed that whale myself in 1991
2366578 it was a tool so we could integrate the catalogues and learn where the whales went
2366579 we knew we would miss the mark and we knew we needed to get married in the summer because im in school so 8 8 08 just flew

2366586 these were conservative investors thats why they bought these securities

2366589 they keep finding ways to attack the industry and that will drive innovation out of new york city and to london tokyo and elsewhere
2366590 anyways uh i always work under the theory that once they start blooming you want to remove as much stress as possible
2366591 its just like if you feel good you want to run that extra mile
2366592 i think you almost have to be at a genius level to do what hes done youve got to be thinking 24 hours a day
2366593 you just hope that some of what he does spills over and applies to your operation
2366594 i think theres a certain degree of fibbing that takes place
2366595 i played college athletics and i think farming is more competitive
2366596 they would have had to move out and move their homes probably to the dump
2366597 its a win win for everyone the majority still have mortgages on their homes they would have lost all their investments and still have had to find a place to live
2366598 its been a real joy to participate in this kind of experience
2366599 so many manufactured home parks are closing around the state that were losing valuable affordable housing
2366600 its more cost effective to save this housing than to build new affordable housing
2366601 love hewitt s left thighbone strikes me as unusually long and i feel like it lacks the convincing self assurance of her right femur
2366602 the jury handed down a big sentence but it was a just sentence
2366603 the jury apparently took this offense seriously and wanted to send a message that a multiple dwi offender was not going to be allowed back on the roads of wichita county
2366604 president bush dropped the ball he took us to iraq and that led the taliban to come back
2366605 the talibans resurgence has created fear among the people who live outside the capital and away from the central government they say whos going to win this war i want to be on the side of whos going to win theyre afraid for their lives
2366606 this is a result of not having our eyes on the prize
2366607 everybody has been too fixated on iraq we need to transition out of iraq and finish the job in afghanistan which is more of a threat to national security than iraq ever was
2366608 president bush dropped the ball he took us to iraq and that led the taliban to come back
2366609 the talibans resurgence has created fear among the people who live outside the capital and away from the central government they say whos going to win this war i want to be on the side of whos going to win theyre afraid for their lives

2366626 the most important thing in his life is getting drunk
2366627 the partying and other shenanigans if thats the way he wants to be i dont choose to be a part of it
2366628 this team never gave in no matter the score or the inning
2366629 we knew if we could just get a couple of runners on base we had a good chance at a comeback
2366630 i dont take out the ring that often i just wanted to show it to the kids as an example of what they can accomplish if they put their minds to it
2366631 all 11 players on the roster are coming back next year to the high school team and we just came off a season where we went 20 9 and made it to the passaic county tournament championship game losing to hawthorne 5 3 this summer and the confidence gained with the championship will be a big boost to help our team next year

2366636 i feel the pedicab industry needs to be better monitored to prevent future accidents and fatalities from occurring
2366637 im sure we may be looking at it because of this tragedy
2366638 he was a great reader a real handyman he loved fishing
2366639 our heart goes out to all those involved in this accident
2366640 we would like to get to the bottom of this situation as much as anyone
2366641 ive never seen any problems with them ive been doing this since 1993
2366642 a few are really good at what they do unfortunately the companies hire a lot of kids trying to make an extra buck
2366643 we welcome a dialogue on how to ensure the safety of all those who travel on the streets of seattle
2366644 it is one model that sounds good in a polling interview do you want your taxes capped everyone always says yes but when you ask do you want the state telling you what you can and cannot spend on education then its like well wait a second here
2366645 this is a time for real relief people in our communities really need some real progressive change in terms of tax policy and this certainly is not it
2366646 its not a scheme and im surprised that theyre attacking their governor and quite frankly theyre attacking 75 of the people of the state of new york that want the senate to act as were acting today
2366647 hopefully it will happen in the next few months and if not itll happen at the beginning of the next session when therell be a different composition to the state senate
2366648 were in the business of serving our customers and we want to make sure they are around for a long time too
2366649 we want restaurants and other establishments to put the word out that you will eat better in our restaurant because we do not use trans fat
2366650 id be curious to taste it and see ill be the guinea pig
2366651 doctors told us there was nothing else they can do for her
2366652 we dont see it very often in a pediatric practice
2366653 i think the hardest part is knowing no wedding no parties no first date you know all that first stuff
2366654 if i can put myself in position early to be competitor for gold and go out and win it that would be great thats our goal
2366655 i want to make the final that the next goal in our sport is to make olympics then best you can there if everything goes well and i dont fall i think i can make the final isnt any reason why not
2366656 im firm believer in american heart cant be beat when its pushed were going to be pushed but were going to come out on top
2366657 ive never been out of country im just from taft so i cant even grasp though of what im about to experience
2366658 i like to see it grow and do well and we seem to be doing a pretty good job of that
2366659 and thats where my expertise lies he said its in investments and banking and how to work through that and get ahead of the game
2366660 unfunded pension and health care liabilities is approaching 200 million now i probably called two dozen people in the last 30 days it so happens beau woodward popped up and said yes hed be willing to do it
2366661 but i tend to vote in their direction most of the time because im a conservative guy
2366662 harolds a great guy but hes shown that he doesnt understand the pension issue abernathy said
2366663 harold really wants the endorsement of the unions in his elections if youre going to be in an elected position youve got to take a tough stand and stand for the taxpayer
2366664 operation nabucco ii turkey under radar of ergenekon and oil war
2366665 it is important for prisoners of conscience to know that the world has not forgotten about them
2366666 this legislation is not laughable on the surface its like oh wow what is this but its becoming more and more of a common problem with people haplessly crossing an intersection and almost killing themselves
2366667 the secretary headed a task force on driver safety and this issue came up and he was intrigued by the idea
2366668 hes seen a couple of instances of walking and texting himself right now though he feels that it needs more study
2366669 i would like to do the fight here but i will consider terms and conditions from bob to do the fight himself however i will not consider a venue in the us because of the double taxation
2366670 boxers must pay tax there and when they come back here they must still pay and that leaves them with no money i will be happy to do the fight in china or philippines
2366671 while we did not want to in any way protest the olympic games we felt it was a significant opportunity to raise awareness and be a voice for those who are not allowed to speak out against the chinese government
2366672 we knew what we were going into we knew we would be detained we knew we could be arrested we knew we could face jail time we understood all of that but we also knew that we would probably be safer as foreigners than some of the chinese people and so it was an incredible opportunity to try and be a voice for them
2366673 there is a lot of people that believe in what we did and they understand our heart and thats all that matters to me a handful of people who dont like me because i am christian and pro life big deal
2366674 chances are your mutual fund manager doesnt eat his own cooking
2366675 the number of managers showing no faith in their process is staggering
2366676 are you joking i wouldnt eat this slop in a bazillion years
2366677 you cannot parcel a cemetery out as unused and used cemetery
2366678 weve been delayed due to circumstances beyond our control for 89 working days
2366679 without liquidated damages theres no assurance the church will ever leave the cemetery
2366680 we have no intention of staying permanently on that property we intend to be off by february 9 2009
2366681 weve entrusted our loved ones to the city of austin and they have breached that covenant with us
2366682 were talking about an undeveloped portion of the cemetery where there are no burials
2366683 by using the trailer to do this we hope to minimize the impact of the day to day operations of both the lebanon police department and the county dispatch system so we can take care of most of the communications right from here
2366684 we have instant communication with our people who are working on this detail and actually with all the officers who might be working in surrounding towns if we need it
2366685 there are two places we can do this one is in september when we pass the continuing resolution that funds the government for the rest of the year the second is the lame duck session where there is all the things we were not able to do and there is hope once all the political deadlocks are broken we could go ahead and do that
2366686 that rule was overturned by a federal judge in d c in july and everything has been put on hold so well see more effects of acid rain on the adirondacks and the people we are one of the hardest hit parts of the country
2366687 senators leahy and sanders are in favor frankly so are the senators from new hampshire and maine who are all republicans
2366688 it covered the entire field all the way up the bank this is a 40 acre field and it was completely underwater
2366689 theres a path right through the middle of the corn field where a current of the river carried everything down
2366690 were going to be short feed usually we sell hay this year were going to be short feed
2366691 you aint going to have the grain because its drowning in the water and the alfalfa suffers because we cant get to it and it loses protein
2366692 its just been sitting on the ground since june sometimes the end of may at this point the feed is not worth a whole lot to make milk
2366693 a lot of people are getting really nervous about harvesting and whether theyre going to be able to get into their corn fields to take the crop off
2366694 it can stop any time its going to make an expensive fall for us
2366695 getting poorer instead of richer thats all i can say
2366696 right now we have a little money set aside for the winter bills to keep up with them
2366697 we were concerned that people might be using all of their savings to get through this winter
2366698 some of us said instead of relying on others to help us what are we going to do to take care of ourselves and thats where we started thinking what can the communities do to help themselves
2366699 i know its serious and we have to do something and hopefully what we do will mitigate issues
2366700 we could really reach out to put together a nonpartisan document
2366701 their health has been getting worse and we have horses of our own and these horses are extremely thin
2366702 its humiliating to have someone say youre abusing one of gods creatures
2366703 over the years as they do with many large organizations
2366704 chris lieto a professional triathlete from danville has become a poster boy for environmentally conscious training and racing
2366705 i dont want it to just be a wasteful time i want it to have some purpose to leave it better in some way
2366706 she repeatedly suggested that the defendant was asserting through his statement that the states witnesses were all lying because their versions of the relevant events were different than his
2366707 the defendants version of events could only be accepted if the jury determined the states witnesses were liars we think such a summation is equally inappropriate
2366708 she repeatedly suggested that the defendant was asserting through his statement that the states witnesses were all lying because their versions of the relevant events were different than his
2366709 the defendants version of events could only be accepted if the jury determined the states witnesses were liars we think such a summation is equally inappropriate
2366710 they will be given time to change to a new one once it comes into effect
2366711 the fiji china link has evolved from trade and investment to education and training where a significant number of fiji locals have had the opportunity to study in china over the years the statement said
2366712 crude oil traded in singapore below us 118 on tuesday night there were immediate forecasts in nz and australia for imminent falls in oil fuel prices
2366713 unfortunately in fiji government announced a whopping price rise across all oil fuel products a litre of car fuel now costs an unprecedented 2 44 this was beyond imagination less than a year ago
2366714 at a time when the average household is already sacrificing to make ends meet this appears to be an iniquitous burden from the perspective of government responsibility
2366715 they asked me what i had said and i told them what i thought of everybody having the common name fijian
2366716 i stand by what i said on tv on wednesday night everything i told the police they wrote it down and i was released
2366717 you see the word fijian fiji is the land and the suffix an refers to the people who own the land the traditional owners of the land are to be called fijian anyone else can be called fiji citizens but not fijian
2366718 the three parties stand on the other side of the fence when it involves the interim government
2366719 we meet have some yaqona and talk about things that are affecting our people never has there been any suggestion to unite the three parties
2366720 to find entry into occupied dwellings is somewhat unusual for us and again it thats why were encouraging folks to be on alert
2366721 we were at the house and he never left if he would have left i wouldve known hes been with me all week so he didnt do it i know he didnt
2366722 in some cases lets say we dont get to a point where we actually ideally get to replace it at the time thats necessary well close the structure and put in a temporary as needed
2366723 after 09 theres a big cloud of uncertainty out there on the federal side
2366724 what happens after federal fiscal year 09 theres lots of talk in congress and the administration about changing funding sources questions about whether the gas tax is a suitable funding source for the long term its a looming question and it will impact vermont dramatically
2366725 what did you find there young lady what are you taking pictures of a frog a snake a diamond ring
2366726 studies conducted by the university of minnesota show that over 40 percent of the retail dollars that could be spent in mower are spent elsewhere
2366727 that adds up to a loss of over 134 million taxable sales alone we want to reverse that trend and help mower county and austin reach our potential
2366728 were not asking anyone to spend any more dollars or shop exclusively in mower county
2366729 that just wouldnt be realistic we do think spending 10 percent more lcoally should be easy and that people will find they not only will receive great service and value from local businesses but that they will also save time and fuel
2366730 the property taxes they provide also furnish support essential to government services and local schools
2366731 as these businesses suceed or fail so does our community
2366732 were not going to track whether an individual meets their commitment or not
2366733 were just asking you to take a look at your shopping habits and make a commitment to give mower county more of your business not all of the time but when it makes sense for you together we can build a better county
2366734 daisy daisy give me your answer do im half crazy all for the love of you it wont be a stylish marriage i cant afford a carriage but youll look sweet upon the seat of a bicycle built for two
2366735 to get the 1914 bike and the mural in this span of time is pretty amazing
2366736 we had found them that very day that mr payne came in with the bike its very rare to see ladies bloomers for one thing there are no bicycle costumes found because of the short period of time they were worn and they were looked upon with disdain they were ridiculed on the street and the women who wore them were ridiculed by their families for wearing bloomers because when bikes first came out a lady had to ride with a full dress bustle and all
2366737 when amelia bloomer designed bloomers fashioned after the middle eastern pantaloons it didnt last long
2366738 these are not bicycle bloomers but the day i found them i thought it sure would be nice if we had a bicycle and mr payne came in and said he had something we might like just a few hours later it was a bicycle i couldnt believe it
2366739 i thought maybe it would be a 1950s bike but he said it went way back beyond that
2366740 they were at the state street bridge location for only about 20 years
2366741 they were somewhere else before and after that we found what it looked like in the hibbard spencer amp bartlett catalog several years later when it had fenders i dont think this bike ever had fenders
2366742 we havent done anything to it it was a little dusty so we cleaned it up
2366743 im thankful to the ladies who saved the mural to mr payne for bringing the bike in to the volunteers who worked on the exhibit like ed wright who built the wall for the mural and made the roping and to charlotte who helped with mural repairs were pretty proud of this exhibit
2366744 how awesome its been to watch the hand of history bring together a boy a bike and an advertising mural
2366745 we just had a ceremony at the gray law building four years ago that area looked like a bombed out third world country
2366746 so that we can complete the work weve done to this point
2366747 i come to you like a long list of women and men from outside tuskegee
2366748 i come to offer myself as presidential candidate barack obama with hope
2366749 there comes a time for a defining moment when change must take place to grow
2366750 our history is great but what are we doing now about tuskegee to help growth
2366751 its time for tuskegee to reintroduce itself to the world like barack obama says its time for change i agree
2366752 it has been a positive process however its not a marathon but a relay sometimes you need fresh legs by giving someone else a chance
2366753 we need in place a mayor not in competition with the city manager but working with the city manager
2366754 i say to my opponents like president reagan said i wont hold my opponents inexperience against them
2366755 i dont bring any baggage to the job everything i do is to help this community
2366756 thats one of the main reasons we didnt work out
2366757 well arent people who are hard driving in the board room supposed to be submissive in the bedroom
2366758 a tax cap is just pandering to the state of new york
2366759 many of us recognize that a tax cap is not the answer that the people are clamoring for or in the best interest of education funding
2366760 they dont understand the crushing burden of real property taxes on people
2366761 whats amazing this is a bi partisan effort between the republican controlled senate and the democrat governor
2366762 why the assembly would stand in the way is totally beyond me
2366763 within 10 years save more oil than we currently import from the middle east and venezuela combined
2366764 the u s cannot drill our way to energy security
2366765 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
2366766 we have a moral environmental economic and security imperative to address our dependence on foreign oil and tackle climate change in a serious sustainable manner
2366767 this is what i signed my national guard contract for
2366768 its good im away from all the distractions back home
2366769 in boxing its not how strong you are its how long you can be strong
2366770 this is what i signed my national guard contract for
2366771 its good im away from all the distractions back home
2366772 in boxing its not how strong you are its how long you can be strong
2366773 when youre in the lead you dont know whats going on behind you
2366774 youre not running scared but you dont get any input either
2366775 i didnt know i was on a record pace until i came down the stretch and saw the clock
2366776 at that point i made sure i gave a pretty good effort at the end
2366777 i really wanted to win and i was definitely in a position to do that but these things happen
2366778 they falsely blamed the dogs death on the dogs they have blamed their illegal no knock entry on my mother in law for shouting when she saw a swat team in the yard
2366779 i always thought youd have written your first book by now
2366780 vamos a organizar una marcha de un mill n de personas para impedir la ejecuci n de las hipotecas
2366781 los esfuerzos de un individuo como yo es como poner el pulgar en un agujero de un dique para detener el agua ste no es un problema de individuos es un problema social
2366782 el gobernador schwarzenegger quiere reducir el sueldo de tod s l s emplead s municipales unas 200 000 personas al sueldo m nimo de 6 55 la hora mientras suben los precios de la gasolina y la gente ya no puede pagar sus hipotecas es como si fuera un gui n de hollywood pero no es as es lo que tienen para ofrecer como soluci n una soluci n hecha sobre nuestras espaldas bien tenemos otra soluci n un moratorio y no vamos a dejar que todo siga como siempre no hasta que lo consigamos
2366783 that should be what are you doing sir or sir what are you doing i am not a hey
2366784 so if someone comes in and they say i want to put in a pizza restaurant we dont say well we already have to many pizza restaurants thats a private decision thats a market driven decision thats one the consumers will address and thats not a factor in our recommendation
2366785 w e want to make sure our kids are protected and safe
2366786 w e want to make sure whoever we hire be it a teacher to a bus driver is safe and an appropriate candidate for the job
2366787 the k 12 online conference is a free conference is run by volunteers and open to everyone
2366788 i would caution anyone from trying to link these events and trying to make a bigger trend out of them they are all separate company actions
2366789 the welch allyn expansion and the fact ge and others have located here means we have some good industry and business in town that are staying here
2366790 its one of the most versatile plants in the country they make a great product out there and i would expect that plant to make significant capital improvements and be a solid employer for the long term
2366791 you never know where a bullet is going to go whos house its going to hit and sleeping on the floor because you dont know where a bullet is going to go it might be in my house or my neighbors home so i commend the police department
2366792 jail you cant come out your own home you cant go to the store without being harassed by police
2366793 this turf belongs to taxpaying citizens not to hustlers and drug dealers we are going to pop them in the head
2366794 for them to send a person who just had a stroke her second stroke to a homeless shelter with a bag of medication
2366795 and walked right out after she used the bathroom and we havent seen her since
2366796 because were a homeless shelter so if they check in and decide they dont want to stay here theyre free to walk out the door
2366797 well im not gonna answer that youll have to ask the people at the med about that

2366827 i came from lithuania its a long trip i came for the beijing olympics

2366830 i began to experience problems driving at night and problems with blurred vision which prompted me to go to the ophthamologist and it was determined i had cataracts
2366831 i had some prior surgeries and that gave me a predisposition to early cataracts

2366872 with the effect of expansionary monetary policy building momentum and demand expanding commodities prices became almost uniformly under pressure with price increases accelerating to unprecedented double digit rates

2366956 he stated that the child was playing on a plastic picnic table and that the child had fallen from the table and struck his head on the way down
2366957 in situations like this investigators often times think of their own kids as would any parent
2366958 there are lots of things about raising young children that are very stressful particularly some of the behaviors that parents dont understand
2366959 even though they might not have been involved at all what if i had been there what could i have done to prevent this what should i have done
2366960 this case has a symbolic importance a practical importance because it is a lot of money involved and i think there are moral implications legal implications that are going to get sorted out

2366974 i find the manner in which davis issued this pulpit endorsement particularly offensive he appears to be openly mocking the irs rules furthermore davis statement indicates that he is clearly aware that the irs does not permit tax exempt houses of worship to engage in partisan politicking he did so anyway fully aware that he was violating the law

2367033 we think its not their fault that the budget crisis is a crisis and we hope the governor realizes the error of his ways of doing this executive order and rescinds it and works that much harder to make sure that workers in this state dont have to suffer because of his inability to get a budget done
2367034 we have a situation where its sort of a national disgrace that the federal government has yet to make a firm ongoing sort of commitment to the long term health needs of those injured by 9 11 and so its really past due for congress and the bush administration to do the right thing here

2367038 the residents of our state have made it clear they want relief from the crushing burden of local taxes
2367039 we will continue to work closely with our partners in the legislature to control rising property taxes through the passage of a sensible cap
2367040 im glad that my colleagues and i in the senate have passed a property tax cap
2367041 property taxes are too high and for many seniors on fixed incomes and working families this is the first step toward reducing the strain these taxes put on their budgets however the cap is just one recommendation in the commission on property tax reliefs report we need to cap what individuals and families pay in property taxes and eliminate unfunded mandates
2367042 passing a one house bill is not enough for us to declare victory
2367043 we need to do more and i will continue to push for a comprehensive package to bring real property tax relief
2367044 i would never do anything to diminish the quality of education in new york
2367045 i just think theyre out of touch with reality because they dont understand the crushing burden of property taxes
2367046 the senate today chose political expediency and the illusion of property tax relief over a real meaningful solution a restructuring of our property tax system based on equity income and ability to pay
2367047 in a downturn economy this is probably the worst thing you can do if we had a progressive income tax the people who have the ability to pay would pay and those who were unemployed would pay their fair share when they were employed again
2367048 i think the senates advance of the governors bill puts pressure on the assembly
2367049 and just because the assembly now says they dont want to do it doesnt mean theyll say they dont want to do it in the future
2367050 adversely impact the western new york economy by damaging a 200 million seneca retailing sector while violating treaties between the united states and the nation is certainly veto worthy
2367051 the state legislature should not try to help close its budget gap by denying the right of purchase to the seneca nation and its licensed retailers or by jeopardizing the jobs and livelihoods of more than 1 000 seneca and non seneca families involved in our retail economy
2367052 it is past time for the iraqis to take more responsibility for their own reconstruction with the iraqis sitting on a massive budget surplus we need to return american tax dollars to the u s treasury
2367053 the iraqis have the money to pay for reconstruction efforts and with the price of oil where it is today the united states should not be an atm for the iraqi government for the people of iraq this is a matter of self determination and self reliance for american taxpayers its a matter of fairness
2367054 the iraqis have made great progress in developing their oil infrastructure and they are now in a position to assume greater financial responsibility of their economic future now is the time to capitalize on this positive progress by ensuring that iraqis foot the bill for the reconstruction of their own sovereign country
2367055 the gao report on iraqi oil revenues simply underscores what i have said for some time the iraqi government must begin to use its oil revenues to rebuild and reconstruct their infrastructure
2367056 we have consistently said the internal politics of pakistan is an issue for the pakistani people to decide our expectation is that any action will be consistent with the rule of law and the pakistani constitution it is the responsibility of pakistanis leaders to decide on a way forward to succeed as a modern and democratic country
2367057 i think that pakistan needs now to focus on the very many different difficulties it faces and the best way to speed that process and remove the uncertainty would be for musharraf to make a graceful exit

2367061 the americans have not disclosed the details of what they actually know
2367062 its all about water infiltration into the ground instead of running out onto the street and down into our sewers and into our lakes and rivers the more groundwater you can keep on the site the less damage its going to do to the environment and the habitats of fish and things in the rivers and lakes
2367063 the don and inner harbour have some 50 points where combined storm water and sanitary sewers can overflow during heavy rains discharging polluted runoff directly into the waterway underground storage tanks would catch runoff and later send it to upgraded sewage treatment plants a project that carries a price tag of roughly 400 million to 500 million

2367107 i asked her what was wrong she said she couldnt close her legs because her private part was hurting her
2367108 they said the tissue was not torn but she did have bruises and scratches on her from what happened
2367109 you need to talk to your son and find out if somebody did this to him or is teaching him to do this and get to the bottom of it

2367115 whispered in musharrafs ear that it is time to leave
2367116 over the next few days they will make it clear to him musharraf that a protracted battle against impeachment is not in pakistans interests
2367117 washington was still hoping that the ppp would work with musharraf but he was not working with us america wants pakistan to be effectively governed and so has realized that the domestic struggle has to be resolved
2367118 the army is neutral but is expecting him to resign it will then influence his honorable safe passage as the armys senior leadership would not want him to be punished
2367119 the compelling vision of a more powerful future for suny oswego has united alumni faculty staff students and the community from the start of the campaign it has created a new optimism on campus that ensures our continued drive for unparalleled excellence for generations to come
2367120 i am honored to congratulate the oswego community on this tremendous accomplishment
2367121 the donations really benefit the students because it goes toward things such as the new campus center
2367122 anyone who wants to better the college for when they or someone they know are there as well as for the future can make a donation
2367123 particularly during the sars epidemic xinhua has for last few months been putting out news reports embarrassing to the government but they are designed to fool the international community since they are not published in chinese
2367124 detainees stated that falun gong practitioners who had not renounced their beliefs after six months in detention were placed in the intensive training section until they were reformed falun gong practitioners formerly detained at this facility mentioned that they would refer to this section as the intensive torture section
2367125 in february 2001 nearly 1000 illegally detained falun gong practitioners were forced to make 100 000 toy rabbits for beijing mickey toys co ltd subcontracted by nestle at the xinan labor camp falun gong practitioner ms jennifer zeng was detained there for 12 months
2367126 at the beginning of june 2005 i was sent to a special unit whose sole purpose is to deal with falun gong practitioners with a firm belief the first method they used was sitting on a high chair which was made of plastic about thirty centimeters across the surface was very uneven everyday one was forced to sit for over eighteen hours a day with a strict sitting posture both knees touching each other tightly both legs touching each other tightly both hands resting over the knees the back must be kept straight eyes must be open and no movement is allowed after a week or two many peoples bottoms started to rot

2367129 he was very smooth very convincing he told me not to be alarmed and that this could be taken care of
2367130 i mean he had a good chance of being a vice presidential candidate i think and now hes screwed it up
2367131 i guess its happened before and it will probably happen again
2367132 somebody whos going to vote against a democratic candidate because sen edwards had an affair wasnt really going to vote for that democratic candidate to begin with
2367133 if it were a case where the likely democratic nominee had done something like this that would be a big issue
2367134 republicans have to be very careful because while there have been some democratic scandals republicans have had their share of scandals of that nature in recent years as well
2367135 we didnt think it would become as popular as it has
2367136 we dont know exactly how many that used to be
2367137 my guess is the majority have already historically been lost to logging
2367138 what weve done there is added an additional 4 800 ha that are not spatially identified but are required by law for the district managers to manage that have additional old growth on them
2367139 these really high diversity spots are not randomly located theyre in these very wet flat benches or toe slopes and there are fewer of them left than we realize
2367140 they are cedar hemlock stands which are not species that are used extensively in our region
2367141 rather than spatialize those we said as long as there is a protection of just under 5 000 ha of those stands and that those stands can be identified that were comfortable with that approach
2367142 were just waiting until after aug 5 and then well be compiling all the public review and comment providing it to the delegated decision maker and then theyll make a decision at that time
2367143 what im trying to do is simply document those uses and put a value on them so when it comes down to should we or shouldnt we log it theres a decision being made in terms of what is the value of this tree beyond just a pile of two by fours or garden mulch
2367144 it has the potential to lead alternative economic development in the region quite aside from the high biodiversity value
2367145 if all things were comparable the potential is for about 10 000 people to be walking through this trail each year
2367146 the older the tree is the more carbon it stores
2367147 younger trees they store carbon fast because theyre small and since theyre so small the amount of weight they add compared to their size is a lot but when you get a big tree that whole tree weighs tonnes it would take a regular tree 300 years before that tree held as much carbon as these big cedar are holding and some of them will never hold that much
2367148 its not just a matter of peoples interest or opinions or anything
2367149 its a fact of reality that we have to keep them up or we dont have a chance
2367150 the only other inland rain forest in the world is in south america but its not a temperate rain forest its a tropical rain forest
2367151 it comes back to where we are in the landscape
2367152 these really big trees really old cedars really high diversity stands only develop when they have that extra water availability from surface springs and from subsurface its almost like irrigation flow
2367153 weve got saturated soils up there in the mountains and all that ground flow comes trickling down the hills and right at the base of the hill is where it all comes out
2367154 a site like this most of them appear not to burn at any time interval that we can find
2367155 they might cut down this big tree and you think it has a lot of fibre in it but if they get it to the sawmill and they run it through the mill they might only get a few fence posts
2367156 so its not very economical to cut down a 2 000 year old tree just to make a couple of fence posts
2367157 we have so many plants and animals that live in the same forest that are found nowhere else
2367158 there isnt anywhere where you can find all those birds and mammals living in the same forest especially an ancient forest
2367159 we have the lynx the wolf cougars and wolverines and they all live in the same forest
2367160 and nowhere else are all those species found together living in ancient forests in the whole world outside of parks
2367161 i thank god a million times that my son is ok
2367162 turn yourself in because this could have happened to you
2367163 its not a good feeling i wish you would have stopped
2367164 no i wasnt passed out i was in my car asleep waiting on my girlfriend to come and take me home and i had taken a pain killer and i was listening to the radio with my eyes closed waiting on them to come and thats the whole jist of the story
2367165 i take medication for damage in my nerves and the nerves in my leg and i take those only only when the pain is so unbearable that i just cant deal with it its not something i take on a daily basis at all unless i couldnt function
2367166 i dont take them that often i dont have those i was on another pain killer called tramadol which really didnt do any good thats why my doctor gave me these novacaine patches to put on my back im supposed to start therapy water kind of therapy to help my back because he said thats basically the only thing thats going to help cause i dont like popping pain pills whatsoever so like i said i just take them only as a last resort
2367167 how much would a little butt spanking decrease a lot of this stuff
2367168 they tend to get whippings and they tend to get beatings
2367169 its a major problem when you have nearly 25 000 of 110 000 students that are over age for grade thats a major issue academically as well as behaviorally
2367170 the first game in this kind of tournament is very tight and you have to compete
2367171 im very proud of them because the first game is never easy and you never know how it is going to be you train for three weeks and you try to find the right recipe about how the team will play it was important to get the three points
2367172 really really great to see the offense score on their first drive
2367173 oh look at the puppy look at him pawing at the glass he thinks its another puppy oh yes he does yes he does
2367174 we have consistently said the internal politics of pakistan is an issue for the pakistani people to decide our expectation is that any action will be consistent with the rule of law and the pakistani constitution it is the responsibility of pakistanis leaders to decide on a way forward to succeed as a modern and democratic country
2367175 ron dont you think the chap pitching is a bit out of shape

2367179 r ight you are wheels im surprised that charlie is hitting cabrera seventh but i guess he wants some pop down in the order and hell certainly get that from miguel cabrera
2367180 harry the phillies have really helped themselves over the winter and went out and added a closer a great starting pitcher in willis and of course cabrera at third and it will be a very interesting season for phillies fans

2367185 has consistently provided inaccurate and politically motivated revenue estimates that have put virginia in the budget crisis we currently face
2367186 buying locally is good for the local economy its probably healthier and its certainly tastier
2367187 knowing all this why wouldnt you want to eat fresh local foods
2367188 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2367189 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2367190 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2367191 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2367192 were going to have a very clear message about how the campaign will cooperate and how the convention will be conducted when its appropriate to make that announcement
2367193 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2367194 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different you could argue that
2367195 in this town we lose 20 000 people and in our region our goal is to collect 300 units of blood every day monday through friday

2367202 the church is like one big family here were very close we stick together
2367203 its now widely recognized that social protest has become a staple of egyptian politics what some journalists and researchers have taken to calling an emergent
2367204 the four myths can be roughly divided into two that are chiefly concerned with the causes of protest and two with its effects the bad ideas about protest causes assert that a the government allows protest as a safety valve and b that social protest is not about politics its about survival the bad ideas about protest effects claim that a widespread protest will topple mubaraks regime and b protest will lead to democracy
2367205 were sorry to report that longtime monitor correspondent john k
2367206 i am very struck by the value placed on little models that are never actually confronted with data from the real world
2367207 well lincoln heights is right next to all those places
2367208 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2367209 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2367210 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2367211 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2367212 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2367213 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2367214 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2367215 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
2367216 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2367217 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it

2367223 they do not have leaders where debts are collected by anyone in charge that day they get someone else to do it so they are not associated they have other people buy and register their vehicles and their weapons they are different from the hells angels because of their level of violence
2367224 what you had thought to gain from your little display of defiance of distance
2367225 strange i dont remember you being this reticent as a pupil
2367226 or perhaps it is because you never had to pay for your outright disobedience before
2367227 come come surely you havent been struck speechless there was a time when your mouth would never cease such an irritating habit you had of continuously talking even when you knew bloody well that you shouldnt

2367231 thanks to the merger of banca del gottardo into bsi our commitment has now extended to architecture with the awarding of this prize the award is the culmination of two years of work by the architectural foundation which was set up by banca del gottardo and which now forms a valuable part of the heritage of the whole bsi group
2367232 this award represents an opportunity to recognise and raise the international profile of architects who can make an outstanding contribution to contemporary architectural culture it is also a good occasion to reflect critically on ideas that favour first an ethical and then an aesthetic approach the names selected can be considered as some of the most important architects working internationally today their sensitivity and professional commitment in their countries of origin highlight their diverse hopes both fanciful and realistic in contrast to the contradictions and confusion that are rife today in the debates within the field
2367233 we have had a substantial increase in just about everything wages over the last couple of years with benefits fuel has gone up significantly even tires for our trucks have gone up
2367234 according to law any type of enterprise fund should support the services it runs
2367235 just like the wastewater treatment plant they have to raise sewer rates to pay for any increase in expenses they have
2367236 our department is self sufficient we do not get any money from the general fund whatever money we take in we work with
2367237 we have cut our labor force over the last few years but there are other expenses you just cant cut

2367247 there just seems to be an interest in the martial arts people will see it in the movies and they are fascinated by it i think just about everyone wants to give it a try
2367248 they all say its something theyd like to do but none of them have ever done it
2367249 as the world burns 50 simple things you can do to stay in denial
2367250 theyll be battling for playing time we want to see who can get the job done
2367251 to exert a great sense of a physical style of football i dont know what they waynedale and west holmes run but we want our kids to adapt on the run and be prepared for different looks honestly weve spent zero time preparing for either one of these guys i expect some mistakes but i dont want to see a lack of intensity and lack of physicalness
2367252 being a small school every year were hit hard with graduation
2367253 we look to get our young kids ready to go junior varsity and freshman games help us out having a new opponent to assess will help us see who can step up thats what the scrimmage will tell us there will be some juniors and sophomores to step up and fill roles in those positions
2367254 well see young kids develop and see whos ready to take on leadership roles but well look to the seniors to set an example in games or scrimmages for us
2367255 offensively speaking we have a solid running game and passing game
2367256 defensively our speed is pretty decent and we have kids that i believe fly to the ball and make some hits
2367257 we just have to get some consistency developed right now and start working on some depth our kids are going to come and hit that much i know we might not always be in the right place but theyre going to go out there and go 100 miles per hour though
2367258 we dont prepare for massillon but coach hall and i talked about what each wanted to do before the scrimmage
2367259 what were looking for though is we want to see our kids come off the ball on both sides of the line of scrimmage we want to see effort we want to see them be aggressive
2367260 wed certainly love to see no mistakes but we know thats not going to happen we want to take care of the football these are things that probably everyone wants to see out of their team in a setting like this but the bottom line is that we want to see how some of our kids who havent been under fire get out there and react under the lights and against another opponent
2367261 everybody will get into the scrimmage theres no question because we want to get everyone on film and be able to evaluate everyone
2367262 we want to make sure were getting a good read on everyone and make sure we as coaches arent making any mistakes on where were putting people everyone will get a good look and were going to get a chance to go back over them when we watch the film on sunday
2367263 it takes a combined effort and the cooperation of all law enforcement in stark county to make such a confiscation of this staggering amount
2367264 its kind of a long process we dont want to do a destruction every time we have a case
2367265 obviously we want to see the progression from week to week just like the kids we want to see them compete besides just going against each other
2367266 were really interested we have a handful of positions that are up for grabs its going to be nice to see the competition and those kids compete for their role on the team thats what i tell them right now were still in the phase where theyre competing for their role on this team and whats it going to be
2367267 realistically were looking at some guys not getting a lot of reps what i would call proven guys who were not going to have out there all night
2367268 at the same time everybodys going to at least get 10 to 15 reps and then some guys are going to get more
2367269 well evaluate them seeing them managing the huddle and doing those things
2367270 both of them have had good weeks of practice the quarterback position is a lot more than just throwing and handing off its managing a game and not letting those turnovers happen not throwing a ball just to throw it its just the little things we need a quarterback just like anybody else who understands his role on the team good quarterbacks dont have a lot of turnovers
2367271 for me as a coach its not receivers running and catching the ball i want to see receivers block on run plays
2367272 im really interested to see our kids attack and how they get after it its not so much making a mistake we want our kids to make a mistake going 100 miles an hour theres going to be missed blocks missed tackles we want to see effort
2367273 we have a running back by committee right now so we want to see all three of those guys get a little action
2367274 weve been really impressed with our sophomore running backs so we also want to see them as well the more depth we can get at that position the better because the three guys that are playing it could possibly be playing some defense too
2367275 theres some positions on the defensive line that are up for grabs
2367276 we have some guys who weve moved around opening some space for some people to compete theres some secondary positions that people are fighting for out there as well
2367277 there are two issues in downtown the one is parking and the other is the income tax
2367278 the cities have allowed the townships to grow there is ample retail and office facilities and free parking in townships
2367279 the first thing i hear from a prospective retailer is i dont want to pay income taxes so that tells us we have to look outside of the city
2367280 the reason we built that building down there is you have 22 000 cars going up and down that road each day
2367281 thats as good of a traffic count as on everhard road in belden village
2367282 the biggest challenge of that location is the perception of parking
2367283 when we built the building the mayor promised to buy the lot behind the building and as you can see that has not happened the essence is we lack sufficient adjacent parking
2367284 a lot of newspapers and television stations are doing stories on strip centers and malls with the economy a little bit sluggish that tends to create vacancies in retail spaces
2367285 their concern is and everybodys concern is the slowdown in the economy
2367286 people are watching where they are spending their money and so you tend to see some of your retail establishments flatten out a bit
2367287 pressures from tightening credit markets strain on merchandise flow and a sizable but isolated number of under performing stores in the chain
2367288 weve seen consumers holding back on discretionary spending and actually spending more on health products and groceries
2367289 its a given that consumers are strapped for cash and at the end of the day specific retailers who specialize in say electronics or sporting goods may be seeing a difference in the amount of consumer traffic or consumer spending in their stores right now
2367290 we have identified a unique combination of flavonoids in almonds
2367291 further blood tests demonstrated that eating almonds with their skins significantly increases both flavonoids and vitamin e in the body this could have significant health implications especially as people age
2367292 the synergy between the flavonoids and vitamin e in almonds demonstrates how the nutrients in whole foods such as almonds can impact health

2367329 located between the wheatbelt and the nullarbor plain it covers more than 16 million hectares which is around twice the size of tasmania
2367330 the area is a treasure trove of unique plants and wildlife with hundreds of species found nowhere else
2367331 its abundantly clear in this case that the suspects intent was to kill himself and anyone else who got in the way of that goal by taking the officers firearm
2367332 the officer reacted by using his training experience to secure that firearm and prevent his attacker from achieving his goal
2367333 its part of a police officers job but the case illustrates the difficult jobs police officers do every day
2367334 just when you think your assignment to direct traffic is a matter of routine it can quickly become a life or death struggle as it did in this case
2367335 this was a traumatic event for the officer and the department will support him and manage this situation as we move forward
2367336 the last time i got a reporting from fleet operations which was within the last two weeks we were within four cars of having enough cars to do that
2367337 when they take that home and it sits in their driveway it provides a visual that there are police in the area
2367338 all the indications were from them to us that there was not any additional cars needed
2367339 it was the assignment of the car that sits there
2367340 some of those cars were left parked in what we felt were unsecure locations

2367347 for fuel prices to rival repaying a home loan as a major financial consideration shows just how much the cost of petrol has factored into australian household budgets
2367348 thankfully prices have come down with the global price of oil dropping in recent weeks but the steep cost of petrol is now firmly in the australian financial psyche
2367349 we strongly advise you not to travel to the regions of south ossetia abkhazia and the pankisi gorge north of akhmeta because of the threat of terrorist and criminal activity related to local separatist movements
2367350 we explored options on checks for two b 737 400 aircraft once space became available at our tullamarine facility a decision was taken to have the work done there
2367351 now is the time qantas should sit down with us to commit now to maintaining maintenance operations onshore
2367352 and to move off the path of cost cutting and any further possibilities of further job reductions in their maintenance and engineering area
2367353 all the highlights were rectified to the satisfaction of the qantas team before aircraft delivery to australia
2367354 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2367355 we have received reports from our defence ministry that five russian military aircraft have taken off from russias north caucasus region heading for tbilisi said national security council secretary alexander lomaia georgian president mikheil saakashvili said earlier that 30 people had been killed mostly military personnel while a rebel leader said 1400 were killed in the fighting we deplore the russian military action in georgia which is a violation of georgian sovereignty and territorial integrity

2367362 researchers have long wanted to find a way to move a patients disease into the test tube to develop cells that could be cultured into the many tissues relevant to diseases of the blood the brain and the heart for example
2367363 now we have a way to do just that to derive pluripotent cells from patients with disease which means the cells can make any tissue and can grow forever
2367364 this enables us to model thousands of conditions using classical cell culture techniques
2367365 because the distribution of compounds found in each fingerprint can be unique we also can use this technology to pull one fingerprint out from beneath layers of other fingerprints
2367366 by looking for compounds we know to be present in a certain fingerprint we can separate it from the others and obtain a crystal clear image of that fingerprint

2367401 the people of queensland deserve a guarantee that the review wont be fobbed off to the queensland law reform commission
2367402 its been a bit of their style they change from week to week depending on the opposition which is a credit to terry
2367403 but i would think their form the last six weeks has been really good geelong beat them by 10 goals but if you look at that game they actually played some quite attacking and attractive footy
2367404 id be surprised if they deviated from that style not dissimilar to carltons with the talent theyve got and the ability to play fast football and run the ball
2367405 it was more from the centre bounce they generated that
2367406 they got some relatively easy ball out of the centre square probably three in a row at one stage and thats when it looks quicker
2367407 its certainly something we need to be mindful of because he can be really damaging particularly with his aerial work
2367408 we need to have people ready to take him in certain areas of the ground
2367409 i think hille is one bloke whos really challenged him over the journey so he needs to step up and match him
2367410 he hille runs offensively very well he backs himself in but hes also very good at the stoppages
2367411 he actually has clearances so coxys going to have to be very aware of making sure he picks the right time to run forward and when to defend

2367423 in case we have an amber alert once the bolo or dispatch is put out i can enter the tag information into the plate reader and not only does it start looking at license plates from that point on but it goes back and checks archives of all the plates its checked up to about a month

2367444 parents drawn to products that seem healthier for their children based on references to fruit on the packaging are being deceived
2367445 food and beverage companies are some of the most sophisticated communicators in the world and are clearly capable of accurately reflecting what is in their products if they wanted to
2367446 the nation is facing a staggering epidemic of chronic diseases that result from poor eating and physical inactivity
2367447 children are particularly affected and these food companies are making parents jobs even harder by using misleading packaging to lead them to think that they are making a healthy choice when they are not
2367448 thats the main point of the study you eat a normal amount like five or six walnuts a day thats something you can do every day without any problem

2367458 we know that obese men tend to have lower psa values than their normal weight counterparts possibly caused by larger blood volumes which dilute the readings
2367459 now we know some of the real implications of this that these men are at a disadvantage in terms of prognosis compared to normal weight men
2367460 we used patient data to examine the association between body mass index or bmi a measure of obesity and the amount of disease discovered after surgery to remove the prostate
2367461 we compared men who had their cancers detected by psa screening to those who had an abnormal digital rectal exam which may not confer the same bias against obese men
2367462 in contrast obese men with abnormal digital rectal exams had similar outcomes as normal weight men
2367463 the aggressiveness of obese mens tumors coupled with the fact that they may be more difficult to remove is like a double whammy for being obese
2367464 the least we can do is find a way to level the playing field when it comes to diagnostic tools
2367465 obesity is very common in the united states so this potentially affects a lot of people
2367466 we cant forget that when we use the term obese we are not just talking about very very large men a man who is 5 foot 9 and weighs 203 pounds would be considered obese

2367469 that happens everywhere because were such a large system there are going to be unanticipated outcomes and opportunities to do things better
2367470 cutolo admitted it was their fault they screwed up and they were going to put measures in place so it never happened again

2367474 the servicemember at the four to 10 year point trying to make a career decision has no way to project any retirement value
2367475 by definition the gate pays and separation pays are flexible they may or may not apply to his skill in 10 to 20 years
2367476 not from the standpoint of what we owe military people for an arduous career of service
2367477 what we are suggesting here is that there needs to be some parity between our older and our younger retirees
2367478 it is not fair to ask the oldest retirees who make the least to pay far more than younger retirees for a benefit that is just somewhat more generous
2367479 we are very disappointed with the sentencing in this case

2367483 rielle says hes been responsible for finding her a place to live and even getting her a car to drive
2367484 if he really were the father of her baby and had engaged in an extramarital affair with her i doubt seriously that hed bring his wife and kids over to her house for dinner which rielle told me he did a few weeks ago
2367485 rielle has said from the beginning that the baby is johns but she appears willing to do whatever they want her to do to protect his candidacy

2367492 the film reptilicus was adapted to the comic strip format by the charlton comics group and dated august 1961 a second issue of reptilicus october 1961 featured a brand new adventure of the monster grown anew from a piece of the monsters flesh floating in waters off the coast of north africa by the third issue january 1962 the title of the periodical was changed to reptisaurus the terrible and the color of the winged saurian was altered from green to red charlton no longer had to pay a copyright royalty for the use of reptilicus they explained their own reptisaurus as a prehistoric survivor brought out of hibernation by an atomic bomb test and the creature took off for new adventures reptisaurus looked basically like a crimson reptilicus until the seventh issue october 1962 wherein he suddenly and quite mysteriously appeared with a new body and a snout horn to go along with it
2367493 it is doubtful that anyone remembers the mightiest adventure tale ever told
2367494 seeking declaratory relief and clarification by the court cited as basis of the suit is a contract assertedly entered into march 7 1960 and an amendment dated feb 1 1961 in an extensive presentation of the aip claim which also asks general and punitive damages in several amounts on a number of individual complaints it is set forth that defendants sidney pink bernard greenbaum and cinemagic inc agreed to produce and deliver a picture of the stated title reptilicus conforming to several physical requirements at a given date now past and did not perform the contracted production activities agreed upon

2367497 on one of my european trips i flew to denmark to look at a rough cut of
2367498 my god sidney what have you done youre going to have to loop this entire picture
2367499 well youve got these danes speaking english and theyve all got that sing song scandanavian accent that will never fly in the u s this is a science fiction film but those voices have turned it into a comedy if we show it in the states the way it is now audiences would laugh themselves silly until they got enough energy to demand their money back
2367500 sam youre kidding me on this one arent you these actors are speaking just fine just fine
2367501 we have to distribute this picture in the states science fiction aficionados are serious people we cant run the movie with the existing sound track youll have to get some american voices and loop it
2367502 sidney it says right in our contract that the movie has to be shot in english
2367503 right now its in a form of english that american audiences arent even going to recognize
2367504 first of all the suit will drag on for two or three years just waiting for a trial date and that will hold up the release of the picture
2367505 then when we show it to an american jury they wont be able to understand half the dialogue in the movie sidney will be the laughingstock of hollywood
2367506 i was gone from copenhagen only five weeks but much had transpired since my departure letters were on my desk that alerted me to some strange actions by aip it appeared they were busily engaged in making a new musical score for
2367507 as my lawyer the most disreputable of all i have ever known
2367508 the news from los angeles was not good sevin had failed to bring about his guaranteed speedy resolution of our lawsuits
2367509 the foreclosure sale had already taken place the selling price was the balance of the mortgage due with interests and costs the total was approximately 67 000 sevin was very mysterious about his whereabouts at the time of the sale but offered to represent us in a repurchase for 100 000
2367510 we were able to prove mr sevin represented the lady who made the loan and that he collected a legal fee and finders fee from her while at the same time collecting from us for the same service he arranged the auction sale his whole plan had been designed to bring me to the brink collect fees from all concerned and then make a killing for himself and the lender by forcing me to buy the film back at a ballooned figure the whole mess ended up in litigation we sued for damages and the return of all fees paid to him when he was purportedly representing us the suits dragged on for years
2367511 you would think that sam and i would have become enemies but nothing could be farther from the truth basically we liked each other and it was always strange to me the way he kept on trying to screw me i think both sam and i were tired of the battling i wanted to go back to work and the entire sevin affair had disgusted me so much i wanted to get away from the whole damned scene when sam suggested we get together i was glad to do so we settled with aip buying all rights to journey since they destroyed our original materials it was impossible for me to restore the picture to our version at bents request we removed his name from the film i received more for the sale than i could have ever received under normal conditions and the reptilicus figures were changed to reduce the enormous costs claimed by aip

2367518 the national enquirer is not well regarded as a news source by the news media
2367519 we began pursuing the story soon after it first appeared but the standard for proof in this kind of intimate behavior is and should be very high
2367520 better to get it right even if we couldnt get it first
2367521 i think the mainstream news media were responsible for not airing it and not printing it earlier there really wasnt anything to report
2367522 if the story were false it would be a tremendously hurtful thing for his family and professionally lethal to him

2367534 but word of mouth spreads quickly and the first year we did 25 000 in advertising to get the word out
2367535 it probably wouldnt have been my choice but it was already known and we had advertising so we kept it
2367536 one day i was saying how much i love to go to thrift stores and garage sales and said thats the only cheap thrill i get in life
2367537 people always told me i had a good eye for quirky things we have clothes and lots of kitschy things lots of accessories shoes vintage costumes there really arent any besides us that do costumes and vintage
2367538 i dont know if the names helped me or hurt me

2367546 were very excited to have ricardo return home to iona and lead the nationally prominent cross country and track and field programs
2367547 im confident that ricardo can keep the rich tradition of excellence has been instilled in the program
2367548 i want to thank pat lyons for giving me this great opportunity to continue the tradition that my former coach and mentor mick byrne has started
2367549 it is extremely exciting to come back to a program that i was a part of for five years as a competitor and four more years as an assistant
2367550 this is a tremendous opportunity for ricardo and i couldnt be happier for him
2367551 i am sure i speak for the entire harvard track family when i say we owe ricardo a ton of gratitude for his hard work and contributions to the program and we wish him nothing but the best at iona the chance to return to his alma mater with a legitimate chance to win a national championship in his first year is just to good to pass up i am sure our team members feel a bit of mixed emotions right now as we will all miss ricardo but we are also incredibly happy for him

2367571 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2367572 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry

2367576 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2367577 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
2367578 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country

2367596 the undoubtedly very good first half result should not allow us to lose sight of the major challenges that lie ahead our company has the great opportunity to emerge relatively stronger from the increasingly difficult market and competition situation that we find ourselves in we have laid the foundations and will not jeopardize our future we have shown in the past that we are prepared for these kinds of situations and are capable of reacting to them our financial strength and operating adaptability will grant us the opportunity to remain profitable and strong and to continue to make our company more attractive for our shareholders customers and employees

2367601 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
2367602 fuel prices have doubled in the past year a successful hedging programme mitigated the impact but nevertheless fuel costs at 706 million were up 233 million in the quarter we expect our fuel bill to top 3 billion this year the equivalent of more than 8 million every day

2367606 i have a lot of trust in him as a player we connect well personality wise off the field i just feel like when i throw the ball to ruvell hes going to be in the right position to make the catch
2367607 i threw one ball to him and i came off to the sidelines and mike mccarthy ripped me
2367608 i think i take time to make sure after every play or if there is a questionable play ill go over afterwards and ask him what he was thinking so i can make the adjustment for next time
2367609 i think he has the same dialogue with me and with all of the receivers and thats important to make sure youre on the same page with the quarterback
2367610 i dont think we lack for verbal communication but i think the necessity of it isnt there as much
2367611 if there is a route or a ball we just kind of give each other the look and we know what the other person is looking for
2367612 in my head im always trying to do as much as i can for the team every time i am out there anything they ask me to do i would welcome a bigger role but if its not the case its not
2367613 thats what i was telling the offense i thought defensively it was outstanding i really like the way they were disguising their pressures
2367614 today we feel happier than we do at spring festival

2367651 ill take the blame for that but the way we played this week thats certainly not how we got here thats for sure
2367652 youre gonna have those games where you just dont play as well as you normally do unfortunately for us those games happened when we were playing in the state tournament
2367653 they can all put the ball in play we gave it our best but sometimes thats just not enough we cant blame it all on the defense and pitching theyve been great all year sometimes everybody just has a bad day
2367654 there is a reason all of these teams have made the state tournament but we didnt play our normal level of baseball which is frustrating

2367666 there are so many opportunities in large enterprise upgrades channel driven smb and midmarket installations that sellers in australia will find no shortage of opportunities regardless of what is happening in the rest of the world

2367668 smbs would be much better off purchasing a simple rack server than taking on the overhead associated with blades

2367730 when i read it there wasnt really anything new in there so it wasnt a surprise to me what was a surprise to me was the districts response where they really single me out
2367731 maybe things were done very loose maybe some regulations werent covered but again mark lawson had to be aware of them jan matousek certainly had to be aware of them i mean shes the deputy superintendent of schools at that time to me thats typical of the way the current administration has been very misleading very deceptive very deceitful
2367732 the last time i expressed my opinion i got walked out and i havent been able to go to work since then and i know people are mad at me but if they call me back if they said to me youve gotta come in tomorrow im ready to go back to work
2367733 we have young people out there who are like i said engaging in healthy activities the last thing youd want that to be compromised by is adults that are smoking or kids that are smoking so its really important to deliver that message that we are tobacco and smoke free in a lot of areas where our kids remain active

2367740 sometimes that can look like daycare for the other children it might look like a referral for another support system in the community it could look like hopefully wrapping her around her natural neighborhood
2367741 its clear that typical white women vote democrat and if you look at the way they turned out in record numbers to support bill clinton for reelection after even hillary knew he was cheating on her worse than a gypsy playing checkers with a blind man john edwards numbers are sure to go way up now

2367749 the older i get and the longer top gear goes on the more i enjoy driving rubbish the xk jaguar is a wonderful thing but an audi for 65 makes me skip around like an imbecile i cant deny it for a moment longer i actually like crap cars and i think im going to ask if i can be fired
2367750 we now live in a world of near universal automotive excellence exotics abound more common sports coupes and sedans perform like supercars of past years family sedans boast 250 horsepower all while modern technology marries decent fuel mileage and emissions with this scorching performance even subcompacts are depressingly competent ive driven the chevy aveo and kia spectra both of which look on paper as if they are terrible cars neither are this is all tremendously exciting i suppose but i miss the terrible cars cars are like people beautiful perfect people are interesting from time to time but if thats your entire world they get very dull thats one failure of some car magazines i think they overdo the exotics to the point where they become mundane and commonplace there is beauty and wonder in all levels of the automotive world
2367751 there is no excellent beauty that hath not some strangeness in the proportion
2367752 the problem with people who have no vices is that generally you can be pretty sure theyre going to have some pretty annoying virtues
2367753 ive literally pooped on the hood of an h2 before i will do so again
2367754 the older i get and the longer top gear goes on the more i enjoy driving rubbish
2367755 and then theres the smug satisfaction that comes from learning the foibles of a clapped out motor which gears jump out unless you hold on to the knob which switches have to be wiggled a bit how to stop the seat moving about im also staggered to think how many people are ruining their lives and living in less than domestic bliss just to finance a nice car you can have a nice car for 500 these days and when a cars life is already over in the eyes of most people and when every turn of the wheel is just a moment of grace stolen from the jaws of the crusher the burden of ownership is nil

2367760 i said do it now while im here so that a week from now after youre all gone i dont have an infected tooth
2367761 we see people waiting in those long lines and i simply dont know how they tolerate the pain they must be in because of infection and bleeding in their mouth
2367762 i told a young lady here that we could remove her teeth she was in her 20s and she just started crying you mean i dont have to pay for that she asked
2367763 yes in appalachia the need is extreme but this isnt just an isolated problem this is just where all our national health care problems converge high cost lack of access this is where the most number of people fall through the cracks
2367764 other nations have a lower gdp than we do and theyve made a political decision that their people are going to have health coverage but we keep deciding not to
2367765 we like to believe that everyone can get the care they need
2367766 but people who are low income work hard and dont have coverage through a job have to make harsh economic choices about their health care that might be to have a tooth pulled instead of getting a crown or to go without care at all
2367767 the diet here which is high in processed sugary foods because theyre cheaper promotes decay and when your teeth hurt you arent going to be eating salads
2367768 and now we know that theres a suggested link between all kinds of systemic diseases from diabetes to heart disease and oral cancer and the bacteria in the mouth its a cascading effect

2367774 i cant help them with their problem they cant see me i can be like 68 years old and im still trouble because theyre thinking about something in vietnam or theyre thinking about jane fonda or they think i slept with their daughter they think i burned my draft card its like a big rorschach of things that i did or did not do
2367775 i think that denver officials would be well advised not to believe everything that the fbi warns them about
2367776 thats how things can get out of hand due to fabricated exaggerated projections about violence or protest
2367777 what you saw in 2000 was the claim that 75 000 anarchists were descending the secret funding of permanent police equipment the denial of permits for protesters you saw the same thing in 2004 you will see the same thing in 2008
2367778 re create 68 banner conjuring images of the street clashes that overshadowed the democratic convention itself galvanizing the anti vietnam war effort and undermining democrats hopes in that long ago fall
2367779 i planned for multiple scenarios not knowing which one would play out
2367780 but certainly after the murder of kennedy coming on the murder of king to me it was in the air that we were going to be busted and face serious harm unless we surrendered and left the city and simply went along with the plan just go along with our own disappearance
2367781 in evaluating this case you should bear in mind that your prime objectives should be to neutralize him in the new left movement
2367782 thousands of hairy yippies were going to have sex in public while drinking from the lsd laden waters of lake michigan they actually believed that and this sex in the parks on acid would occur at roughly the same moment that black revolutionaries would storm the convention with guns
2367783 named strangely enough in memory of chicago police killed by an anarchists bomb during a violent confrontation between police and protesters in 1886
2367784 it takes two for a riot to occur and if it wasnt for the fbi advisers chicago 68 would not have happened repeat would not have happened
2367785 re create 68 sentiment of some denver protest organizers hayden saw little chance of a chaotic rerun when he sat down in april in his culver city office to discuss the upcoming democratic national convention
2367786 i do think they are playing around unnecessarily with the rights of protesters to protest
2367787 i dont know how the negotiations will come out but you know naming something a protest zone but then not allowing it to be heard or seen its a mockery of the first amendment most importantly its not necessary
2367788 it does seem to me theres a legitimate right to protest at stake
2367789 i dont think the protests will be very large if obama is the nominee i dont see the point in interfering with them its particularly crazy because most of the delegates at the democratic convention have been in many demonstrations themselves
2367790 the message was that the people coming to protest deserve this kind of repression if they get out of hand theyre just trying to scare the public into justifying more tax dollars for a false sense of security more gadgets for the police department
2367791 if they had given us permits i doubt there would have been much confrontation at all
2367792 what caused the rioting in the streets was the lack of permits and the lack of a place to stay too much order creates disorder is the way ive always put it
2367793 you dont have the draft you have one fifteenth of the american casualties now that you had at this point during vietnam the establishment is doing everything it can to keep this war from impacting the american people and yet people have seen through it
2367794 which i think means the ghosts of 68 are still with us people know a quagmire when they see one

2367799 dont wait until the new war has started in iran or iraq in the past dont wait till the bombs are falling and more thousands of people have died before you do what i wish i had done in 1964 or 1965 years before i did do it go to congress go to the press both by the way not just congress or they wont act as i found go with documents and tell the truth and do it at risk to your own clearances your careers these are not light risks but theres a wars worth of lives at stake

2367814 science helps us determine what the appropriate projects are that we should undertake it helps us validate the process
2367815 by doing scientific projects in advance we can determine the most efficient way to move forward with restoration projects if you dont do the science you start these activities and may find its the wrong thing that can mean a lot of money being poorly spent
2367816 weve been able to clean up some hot spots but the process is not going fast enough

2367819 they benefited to some degree where a couple of their very important models in their second year on the market the es and the rx which together account for over two thirds of lexus sales both improved significantly
2367820 the lower score is largely due to vehicles that are no longer in the marketplace

2368109 between islam and the west any clash of civilizations that exists they tell me is between fundamentalists of all faiths and their liberal and moderate opponents and in that clash the vast majority of americans are in common cause with the vast majority of indonesians

2368117 the 60 percent protective effect against hiv acquisition over the first 24 months of the study we now find to be sustained and possibly strengthened to approximately 65 percent over three and a half years of follow up

2368121 this is a disease we see in a lot of older patients with other illnesses so the decision to send them to surgery requires careful consideration cryoablation therapy is particularly attractive for older patients who may have complications or other medical issues such as accompanying heart or lung diseases that make traditional surgeries for barretts with dysplasia too risky
2368122 our study documented that hrt might be considered a useful tool to identify heart failure patients at high risk of death including high risk of dying suddenly
2368123 hrt may help physicians more effectively manage heart failure patients by indicating the need for more frequent follow up visits at specialized heart failure units and more intensely applied therapy including icd implantation in high risk patients
2368124 breast feeding is associated with resilience against the psychosocial stress linked with parental divorce separation
2368125 theres a lot less verbal communication but lots of tactile communication and eye contact that promotes positive physiological responses

2368145 most folks are paying attention with only one ear at most

2368156 the chinese authorities refused to issue visas to ten of our members but this has not stopped us from making ourselves heard in beijing by means of a clandestine radio broadcast using miniaturised fm transmitters and antennas
2368157 reporters without borders devised and carried out this protest in a spirit of resistance against state control of the media
2368158 this is the first non state radio station to have broadcast in china since the communist party took power in 1949 only international chinese language radio stations broadcasting on the short wave would be able to break this news and information monopoly but they are jammed by the authorities
2368159 gesture of defiance towards the chinese authorities who are still keeping dozens and dozens of journalists and internet users in prison
2368160 despite everything there are people who are going to be able to speak out about things you dont want the public to hear in the very heart of beijing regardless of the measures you take you will not get rid of free speech
2368161 you banned us from going to beijing you expelled us from china but despite all that we are here making our voice heard peacefully in a completely non violent fashion it is a way of saying censorship just wont work

2368206 take into consideration the longstanding relations of friendship with china
2368207 why are so many of us going to wall street
2368208 i dont think the point of our education is to make us rich we all feel we want to do something meaningful beyond just accumulating wealth
2368209 those who argue in terms of the false alternative between pursuing wealth vs serving the community ignore the real issue career as personal fulfillment vs career as self sacrificial duty
2368210 cant a career be both self interested and self sacrificial
2368211 the purpose of morality is to teach you not to suffer and to die but to enjoy yourself and live

2368216 the nav is probably the best looking of the big suvs
2368217 in todays brave new world of five buck gas and energy related panic it borders on dangerous to admit to lusting after a three ton station wagon
2368218 i cant testify to the navs high speed handling in the twisties because im not an idiot i call it a wagon but know deep within that its a high center of gravity suv as such it has to be driven with respect along with an awareness of the laws of both physics and unintended consequences at prudent speeds i e not much higher than the posted limits it handled the curves without any drama
2368219 the question then becomes one of priorities is it worth an extra 2 500 year to drive a navigator rather than a crv to me it is especially since those first generation navigators can be had for chump change while crvs are a pretty costly proposition and the crv doesnt come close to the navigators luxury comfort towing capacity and interior space

2368227 who paid for such a beautiful church in the midst of so many other needs
2368228 since the church is a government registered church and since it is in a prime location in beijing the government decided to pay for it
2368229 you can protest and make the world news for a moment or you can pray and go and give and help to change the situation china is a very unique country and will never be bullied into changing policy there are those christians who are working at many levels praying and talking and sharing some of those we met with are even working on certain levels of the olympics
2368230 the long term people working so effectively within china are there for the long haul and have long term goals and plans to help the people in this land they dont grab the headlines they grab the shovels and the chalkboards and the arms of those who need quite often just a shoulder to unburden themselves on
2368231 ravis heart ached for these people and he desired to reach them with the good news of jesus
2368232 it looks as if the gadfly has gone public and the story is not over
2368233 the twin message of ratifying the international covenant on civil and political rights and releasing prisoners is right on track and a message china can ill afford to ignore
2368234 despite promises to improve its human rights record the opposite has happened this event occurs as us president george bush prepares to deliver an address tomorrow the same day that he arrives in beijing expressing deep concerns about human rights and religious freedom the world is watching china must understand that if she wants to be an international player she must play by international rules
2368235 the run up to the olympics has been accompanied by a disturbing increase in persecution of unregistered christians including the largest mass sentencing of house church leaders in 25 years a level of expulsion of foreign christians not seen since the 1950s targeted repression of the chinese house church alliance restrictions on religious believers renting properties and attending the games and persecution and church raids in beijing
2368236 pastor eddie romero is a man driven by his passion for those suffering in china he is an affable much loved church leader and family man as well as a respected professor he is willing to risk all in order to provide a voice for those who have no voice in china while csw does not condone civil disobedience we do share his deep concern over the serious violation of religious and other freedoms in china china should indeed ratify the international covenant on civil and political rights and release those held for their religious and political beliefs
2368237 to call attention to the covert state sanctioned persecution of christians specifically and all other persecuted religious faiths inclusively furthermore the goal of this event is to bring about dramatic and verifiable changes in state policy and attitude toward christians and all other people of faith
2368238 all people should have the freedom to say what they think and worship as they choose
2368239 america will continue to support china on the path toward a free economy
2368240 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
2368241 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
2368242 and we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs but to allow the chinese people to express theirs
2368243 esto es grave y de continuar el incremento de la violencia podr a afectarse ampliamente el poco avance que hemos tenido en materia de estado de derecho y en consecuencia tendr a un costo extraordinario para el pa s por eso llamamos a las actuales autoridades a enfrentar e intervenir de manera r pida este problema porque de lo contrario el pa s vivir a situaciones muy dif ciles

2368263 you see things like this occasionally and you think to yourself why is it like that why hasnt someone fixed that

2368277 you sit there and count methodically the punches and you see law enforcement not stopping one of their own i think that is appalling
2368278 grave concern about this young man being held and beaten i think if youre holding him and allowing someone else to beat him youre a part of this process i think if youre standing by as an officer and youre watching a brutal kicking of a citizen that you have to be part of that process

2368302 the government statistician now has until 23rd august to complete their final analysis of the results before the clerk of parliament delivers the verdict to the speaker of the house
2368303 based on the chief electoral officers audit i am very confident we will have succeeded it has been a huge task and i am relieved that this stage of our fight against this undemocratic and stupid law is now over
2368304 while 42 cir petitions have been started only three have been completed in the past 14 years confirmation of the referendum on the anti smacking law would be the fourth
2368305 we thought this overdone and todays data has reinforced this perception in fact we would go so far as to say that there is a greater chance of the rbnz not going in september than there is of it going 50

2368318 the air quality is going to have a dramatic impact on everybody breathing air
2368319 its going to cause you to have more symptoms such as coughing or irritation in the throat and respiratory system
2368320 if the air quality is bad it makes air exchange harder and it makes it more difficult to maintain whatever pace level you might be running at
2368321 the faster you go the more air you have to move in and out the greater the difficulty
2368322 clearly air pollution levels when youre trying to run a marathon or do these other strenuous activities outside is really going to have a dramatic impact on the persons ability to perform

2368325 i dont think it would have as much impact on the swimmers because the swimmers will be inside and the air will be air conditioned or filtered or something like that
2368326 so i would imagine that the mens marathon runners from various countries probably are not going to show up and spend two weeks in this air if they dont have to
2368327 if anything is questionable i dont buy it and i dont sell it i stay away from every bird you cant find on a farm most birds are migratory and protected even roadkill if you see a dead owl in the middle of the street you cant pick out a feather its protected
2368328 some people say its terrible but others find it incredibly beautiful
2368329 the side effects bible the dietary solution to unwanted side effects of common medications
2368330 this could be a big reason why we have what we call the walking wounded and why so many people on drug therapy are having so many problems
2368331 its very simple most doctors consider vitamins and nutrients a waste of time
2368332 second of all theres not enough health education in the field
2368333 when i did a presentation at walgreens and rite aid they said well our pharmacists dont have time
2368334 its not like the old days where they can counsel patients
2368335 i practicing in nutrition for 20 years didnt even know about it until the publishing company asked me to do the book its like a hidden secret
2368336 you have these millions of people on statin drugs i dont have to tell you how many millions they are all getting their coq10 depleted
2368337 and the major side effects from statin drugs are liver problems and also statin induced myopathy which is muscle pain and weakness other problems include fatigue and memory problems
2368338 the doctors and the pharmacists are not educated in drug induced nutrient depletion its not talked about
2368339 why arent people told this stuff why isnt your doctor or pharmacist telling you that your drug depletes zinc out of your body its because vitamins arent deemed important unless its very very well known doctors are clueless they think drugs and surgery can solve all of the problems that we have
2368340 ill show them a list of the potential depletion problems of their drug and theyll say oh magnesium depletion can cause muscle cramps and depression
2368341 and theyre reading all of the depletion problems and theyll say oh thats me
2368342 i see it in my practice on a daily basis oh doc im on lipitor or im on vasotec or wellbutrin or vioxx and i dont feel well and we feel that its not all drug induced deficiencies but in part its side effects seem to be related to nutrient deficiencies
2368343 hopefully therell be some education the book which i wrote did ok it wasnt a best seller like some of my other books
2368344 this is our home if we catch someone that did this hed get whats coming to him him or her
2368345 today coming out from lunch the insta daughter and i saw a maserati quattroporte parked next to my mazda
2368346 gee thats a great looking buick even if the ventiports are a little goofy
2368347 i want a car no i want a van no i want an suv
2368348 gm toyota they want as little risk as possible because thats how they play the game
2368349 owning anything other than a maserati or a ferrari is merely owning a car
2368350 of all the people that commented above how many do actually own a maserati exactly not many so stop bitching about things cars you dont have
2368351 but the buick designers are just copying the look of the maserati in the hopes that some people might actually buy one
2368352 flick both these cars through some twisty bits and youll see why the maserati wins hands down
2368353 make sure the next generation q porte doesnt look like a amp buick lacrosse
2368354 you are missing the point the point is just by looking at the pictures and spec sheets doesnt mean you have experienced the car itself its like looking at the pictures of ny la and sf and you conclude the entire us is like that
2368355 youre just jealous and you shouldnt talk about things you cant afford

2368411 you can get too wrapped up in scores sometimes whether they are in your favour or against they only reflect one moment in time everything can change in an instant as was illustrated by the changing fortunes of the wallabies and the all blacks over the last week
2368412 firstly we didnt handle the physical intensity the all blacks brought to the game perhaps it was the fact that we were playing our third test match in as many weeks which is difficult although not insurmountable
2368413 its the nature of the beast that you learn the most in times of adversity both about the dynamics of the group and the individuals within it in terms of how they handle times of stress
2368414 the key is to respond well by taking on the lessons from what went wrong and parking the rest to dwell too much is to waste energy on a negative experience

2368493 concerns have been raised as to the employers ability to sufficiently monitor its employees hours worked

2368707 there are a lot of theories that there was an initial stress on the marshes and we dont really know what that would be
2368708 some people have implicated drought some thought it might be rising sea levels there are a lot of different things that could have gone wrong
2368709 some people have argued that if the marshes in louisiana were intact katrina would not have breached the levies so theres a real take home message there

2368845 it is very disappointing here you have this designation as a monument and there has been less visible activity going on in the monument
2368846 additional cleanup and prevention resources are needed to protect this marine national monument
2368847 its asking a lot for a monument proclamation to do that but you have to start someplace

2369009 esto apenas comienza pero ya no debemos dejar escapar puntos tendremos que estar muy atentos en todos los sectores del campo y ser efectivos a la hora de atacar creo que si nos aplicamos podemos pensar en ganar el partido

2369074 o profeta que a paz e a b n o de deus estejam sobre ele era a pessoa mais generosa e era mais generoso ainda durante o m s de ramadan quando gabriel o visitava a cada noite de ramadan para ensin lo o alcor o por isso o profeta era considerado mais generoso do que os ventos fecundantes
2369075 as cinco ora es di rias de uma sexta feira outra de um ramadan a outro s o expia es dos pecados cometidos entre eles se evitarmos os pecados capitais
2369076 o m s de ramadan foi o m s em que foi revelado o alcor o orienta o para a humanidade e evid ncia de orienta o e discernimento
2369077 crentes est vos prescrito o jejum tal como foi prescrito a vossos antepassados para que temais a allah
2369078 se jejuardes ser prefer vel para v s se quereis sab lo
2369079 comei e bebei com satisfa o pelo bem que propiciastes em dias passados
2369080 quanto aos jejuadores e s jejuadoras aos recatados e s recatadas aos que se recordam muito de allah e s que se recordam dele saibam que allah lhes tem destinado a indulg ncia e uma magn fica recompensa
2369081 todo ato do filho de ad o dele menos o jejum ele meu e eu recompenso por ele o jejum um escudo se algu m estiver jejuando n o dever dizer obscenidades nem se irritar se algu m discutir com ele deve dizer lhe estou jejuando por aquele em cujas m os est a alma de mohammad no dia da ressurrei o o cheiro da boca do jejuador ser mais agrad vel para allah do que o cheiro de alm scar o jejuador tem duas alegrias quando quebra o jejum ele fica satisfeito com a quebra do jejum se morrer seu senhor fica satisfeito com o seu jejum
2369082 os atos para allah se classificam em seis categorias dois s o retribu veis por merecimento dois s o retribu dos em igualdade um retribu do em dez vezes e um retribu do por setecentas vezes e um cuja retribui o s allah conhece o seu valor quanto aos dois primeiros quem encontrar allah adorando o com sinceridade e n o lhe atribuir parceiros merecer o para so e quem lhe associar parceiros merecer o inferno quem fizer o bem ser recompensado por ele quem intenciona fazer o bem e n o o fizer ser tamb m recompensado por isso quem fizer um bem ser recompensado em dez vezes quem gastar os seus bens pela causa de allah ser retribu do em setecentas vezes por cada centavo quanto ao jejum ele de allah e a recompensa por ele s do conhecimento dele
2369083 h no para so uma porta chamada de raian s ser usada pelos jejuadores quando eles entrarem ela se fechar e ningu m mais entrar por ela

2369085 save someones life and you have a burden for life
2369086 it is extremely improbable that we will have the structure and financial ability to take on all the people who require art antiretroviral therapy and then treat them for life
2369087 if you add the current 35 billion that is being spent in the developed world youre talking at that time about annually needing almost 90 billion dollars in a continuous fashion
2369088 and that doesnt even take into account complications with secondary resistance to drugs and other issues
2369089 a kind of curious passivity among the international aids establishment
2369090 the government is committed to a more disciplined approach to managing spending
2369091 certainly we felt some of the groups were not necessarily ones we thought canadians would agree were the best choices to be representing them internationally
2369092 i dont even want to say it their name on the phone
2369093 some of the groups we felt had little to do with our foreign policy or how canadians would want us to be perceived abroad
2369094 abolishing this program is the equivalent of killing the entire culture market abroad
2369095 these all seem to indicate concerns that are based in personal taste and conservative ideology rather than in how to best reflect the diversity of culture in canada and how best to represent canadian cultural expression
2369096 it really does seem to play to the most right wing part of the conservative party
2369097 it doesnt strike me as a strong political strategy for a government that is facing re election and byelections
2369098 we are still supporting arts funding including international arts promotion
2369099 estoy contenta por llegar al per vine para vargas llosa
2369100 it puts too much strain and unrealistic expectations on a relationship when you put it out there
2369101 there is no god but allah and muhammad is his last messenger
2369102 allah the almighty has said o son of adam so long as you call upon me and hope in me i shall forgive you for what you have done and i shall not mind
2369103 that line like a tree planted by the water i shall not be moved
2369104 it seemed to sum up what everyone struggling to come back after katrina was feeling i really wanted to bring the city together with that thought
2369105 folk tradition of adapting and transforming songs to serve as anthems to galvanize people in a cause
2369106 everything has changed since katrina even our neighbourhoods arent familiar anymore
2369107 youre talking about kids who lost everything their homes their schools and friends
2369108 for some of these kids this music is all they really feel they have and they are very excited about this project
2369109 were hoping that at noon on the 29th everyone will sing say or shout we shall not be moved
2369110 o jejum uma prote o contra i inferno igual aos escudos que s o usados na luta
2369111 o jejum e o alcor o ser o os mediadores no dia da ressurrei o o jejum dir senhor eu fiz com que ele evitasse o alimento e a bebida durante o dia portanto deixe me interceder por ele o alcor o dir eu guardei o seu sono durante a noite portanto deixe me interceder por ele ent o eles ter o a permiss o de interceder
2369112 ele deixa de lado a comida a bebida e seus desejos humanos por minha causa o jejum praticado em meu nome e eu o recompensarei por isto e toda boa a o ser recompensada dez vezes mais
2369113 aquele que jejua no m s de ramadan com f e esperando por sua recompensa ter o perdoado todos os seus pecados cometidos anteriormente
2369114 quem reza at tarawih no ramadan com f e esperan a na recompensa de allah lhe ser o perdoadas suas faltas anteriores
2369115 se adverte alem do mais de evitar o comportamento nervoso com os demais alegando estar jejuando sendo que o verdadeiro jejum precisamente o que leva a pessoa a ter sensibilidade especial acompanhado de um comportamento respeitoso sem cometer falta com os demais
2369116 quando encontrei jejuando n o deveis pronunciar obscenidades nem alvoro ar e se algu m te insulta o pretende lutar contigo diga estou jejuando estou jejuando
2369117 quando chega o ramadan as portas do para so se abrem e as portas do inferno se fecham e os dem nios s o acorrentados
2369118 quando chega o ramadan se abrem s portas do para so
2369119 e chama um anunciador oh cobi oso do bem continue oh cobi oso do mal pare e allah liberar certas pessoas do fogo acontece isto por todas as noites at que o fim do ramadan
2369120 cada boa a o do filho de ad o se multiplica sua recompensa entre dez vezes ate setecentas vezes exceto o jejum no qual um sacrif cio oferecido para mim e eu me encargo de recompens lo posto que o jejuante abandona sua paix o e sua comida por mim o jejuador ter duas alegrias uma ao finalizar o jejum di rio o iftar e a segunda quando encontra a seu senhor certamente o encorajamento do jejuante mais primoroso para allah que o aroma do alm scar
2369121 quem n o deixa de dizer falsidades e atuar de um modo enganoso saiba que allah n o precisa que se abstenha de sua comida e bebida
2369122 quando algum de voc s queira faze o iftar fim do jejum que comece com umas t maras o qual uma ben o se n o encontra pode come ar com um copo de gua que purifica
2369123 oh senhor para ti tenho jejuando e com teu sustento vou desjejuar fazendo iftar se foi a sede e foi umedecidas as veias e ser confirmada a recompensa se allah quiser
2369124 as pessoas continuam prosperando entretanto se apressam em fazer o iftar

2369128 durante o dia de arafat estando o profeta cumprindo os rituais de peregrina o foi enviado ao mensageiro de allah algo de leite e bebeu dela enquanto fazia seu discurso ante as pessoas em arafat
2369129 hoje o dia de ashura e n o prescrito para voc s jejuar obrigatoriamente eu estou jejuando sem duvida quem deseje pode jejuar e quem n o queira que n o jejue
2369130 neste dia nasci e foi segunda quando come ou a revela o
2369131 o mensageiro de allah nos ordenou que jeju ssemos os tr s dias brancos cada m s os dias treze quatorze e quinze
2369132 quem vomitar intencionalmente devera compensar este dia jejuando um dia depois de finalizado o ramadan
2369133 quem se esquece contudo se encontra jejuando e come ou bebe deve completar seu jejum durante o resto do dia porem foi allah lhe alimentou e deu lhe de beber
2369134 allah tem perdoado a minha na o se cometem algum ato por erro ou por esquecimento ou se encontra sendo for ado contra sua vontade
2369135 o profeta fazia itikaf durante os ltimos dez dias do m s de ramadan ate que morreu logo suas esposas depois de sua morte costumavam fazer o itikaf durante os ltimos dez dias de cada ramadan
2369136 o mensageiro de allah quando queria fazer itikaf rezava o salat fajr e logo entrava em seu retiro
2369137 o comportamento da sunnah de quem realiza o itikaf n o visitar o inferno nem acompanhar a prociss o do funeral ate o enterro nem tocar ou empreender rela es com sua esposa nem tampouco sair da mesquita a menos que seja por algo imprescind vel n o se faz o itikaf sem estar jejuando e somente se faz o itikaf em uma mesquita principal onde se realiza o

2369195 certamente h no para so uma porta chamada ar rayan pela qual entrar o os jejuadores no dia da ressurrei o ningu m al m deles entrar o atrav s dela se dir onde est o os jejuadores e ent o levantar o os jejuadores e entrar o atrav s dela e quando entrarem esta se fechar e ningu m al m deles entrar nela
2369196 quem jejuar o ramadan com f e com esperan a na recompensa lhe ser o perdoados seus pecados anteriores
2369197 quem praticar ora es durante suas noites com f e com esperan a na recompensa de allah lhe ser o perdoados seus pecados anteriores
2369198 quem realizar ora es durante a noite do decreto laylatul qadr com f e com esperan a na recompensa de allah lhe ser o perdoados seus pecados anteriores
2369199 disse me o anjo gabriel que aplaste seu nariz o servo no qual entre o m s de ramadan e n o tenha sido perdoado
2369200 e est o a servi o de allah anjos que resgatam as pessoas do inferno e assim cada noite
2369201 quem nele fizer um bom ato ser considerado como se tivesse cumprido com um ato obrigat rio nos demais meses e quem realize um ato obrigat rio como se tivesse realizado 70 atos obrigat rios nos demais meses
2369202 quem jejuar um dia em nome de allah afastar seu rosto do inferno 70 outonos
2369203 toda a obra do filho de adam lhe pertence exceto o jejum que me pertence e eu o recompensarei por ele e em verdade que o h lito da boca do jejuador mais agrad vel para allah do que o perfume de misk
2369204 corresponde ao jejuador quando este quebra o jejum uma s plica que n o negada
2369205 quando meus servos te perguntarem de mim dize lhes que estou pr ximo e ouvirei o rogo do suplicante quando a mim se dirigir que atendam o meu apelo e que creiam em mim a fim de que se encaminhem
2369206 por allah que n o chegava o outro ramadan sem que allah tivesse nos concedido tudo o que hav amos pedido
2369207 renunciou a sua comida a sua bebida e os seus prazeres por minha causa o jejum para mim e eu recompenso por ele e a obra bem feita eu recompenso como 10
2369208 na primeira noite do m s de ramadan allah olha para seus servos e aquele a quem allah olhar jamais o castigar
2369209 oh allah vou te adorar como jamais havia te adorado
2369210 fi is est vos prescrito o jejum tal como foi prescrito a vossos antepassados para que temais a allah
2369211 poss vel que algum orador noturno n o consiga outro beneficio de sua ora o sen o o cansa o e que algum jejuador n o consiga outro beneficio pelo seu jejum sen o a fome e a sede
2369212 aquele que n o abandone o falso testemunho allah n o tem necessidade que se abstenha de comer e beber
2369213 um servo inconsciente de si mesmo e conexo com seu senhor se fala fala de allah se se pronuncia o faz para allah se se cala fica com allah por que ele de allah para allah e com allah
2369214 quem oferecer um desjejum a um jejuador lhe servir como perd o dos seus pecados e como libera o do fogo do inferno e ter a mesma recompensa de quem jejuador sem diminui o nem mesmo ao m nimo
2369215 estoy acompa ando a este gran gobernador que es celso
2369216 no hay sociedad desarrollada que crezca con enfrentamientos muchas veces las diferencias tienen que ver con no saber mirar racionalmente los problemas
2369217 esto va a significar energ a para las industrias del norte de mendoza y del sur de san juan
2369218 s que est n muy contentos porque viene el burrito ortega a mendoza
2369219 estamos muy contentos porque esta obra significa un paso m s en otros tantos temas que tenemos que consensuar entre los distintos niveles institucionales para lograr una mejor calidad de vida para todos los argentinos

2369222 based on frequency content and the phenomenology of the signals these are not consistent from what we would expect from a meteor at all

2369228 debemos defender nuestros derechos y el de las personas que est n inhabilitadas por el tribunal supremo de justicia
2369229 la marcha partir desde la plaza morelos y culminar frente a la sede del consejo nacional electoral debemos defender nuestros derechos y de las personas que est n inhabilitadas por el tribunal supremo de justicia en una forma que violenta el sentimiento popular en torno a la normativa y la convivencia democr tica en cualquier pa s del mundo
2369230 no se puede actuar al margen de la constituci n y de la voluntad popular al aprobar leyes que no fueron aceptadas por los venezolanos el pasado 2 de diciembre cuanto rechaz mediante el voto la reforma de la carta magna
2369231 el presidente quebr la voluntad popular la misma que sigue teniendo el pueblo venezolano cuando rechaz la reforma
2369232 si no salimos a la calle a protestar democr ticamente convalidaremos la radicalizaci n del gobierno
2369233 si ellos no est n en capacidad de convocar a los sectores del pa s para discutir y consultar las leyes tal como lo expresa la constituci n y el famoso protagonismo del que tanto han hablado nosotros se los vamos a recordar todos los d as y estamos seguros que los venezolanos van a salir porque tenemos que defender nuestros derechos
2369234 by the time i got back the emergency response team was already packing up
2369235 so its a substantial cost and a very serious crime
2369236 it should be known that in 2008 the world shall be blessed they will call him the one

2369238 short of 666 they used every single symbol of the antichrist in this ad
2369239 there are way too many things to just be coincidence
2369240 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
2369241 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact
2369242 rampant habitat loss exacerbated by hunting for food and to supply the wildlife trade in traditional chinese medicine and pets
2369243 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
2369244 ya enviamos la petici n al rea jur dica del ayuntamiento para que de seguimiento a la resoluci n de derechos humanos y contin e con el procedimiento administrativo

2369247 i believe covered bonds have the potential to increase mortgage financing improve underwriting standards and strengthen u

2369250 eventually the financial sectors troubles will be communicated to the rest of the economy
2369251 as there is less investment available that restrains consumer spending it restrains corporate spending
2369252 one measure already signals that the woes of the financial system are straining the economy
2369253 we havent had the sense that we had the downward spiral in anything other than housing
2369254 what i am worried about is that we are headed in a direction where those negative feedback loops expand and intensify
2369255 that cycle will not be broken caron and other analysts say until the decline in home prices slows significantly or ends allowing the market to tally the full cost of the recent credit binge and restoring confidence among bankers and investors
2369256 we could reach a bottom in housing at the end of this year and have some growth in the second half of 2009
2369257 but that requires the economic backdrop to remain no worse than it currently is
2369258 another strain on the economy and markets is the rapid rise in the prices for energy food and other commodities
2369259 that immediately knocked out a large supply of people who were prepared to buy these homes
2369260 the main reason for suppressed prices of homes is the difficulty of financing them
2369261 its the end of a period of rampant leverage and lax lending standards and that takes a bit of time to work through
2369262 the return to wax of the man juke is a real treat featuring the irrepressible and rather underrated sophie faricy on vocal duties come away is a refreshing mid tempo scorcher with a killer break top notch

2369271 die deutsche bank hat ihre kunden falsch beraten und so getan als seien ars wie bargeld
2369272 there are two main issues that need to be addressed regarding the problems being experienced by fannie mae and freddie mac
2369273 the declines in home prices we are currently experiencing would pale in comparison to the rapid free fall in home values that would result if 68 of home buyers suddenly found themselves without funding options
2369274 every time asset prices fall financial institutions need to raise more money to maintain their minimum capital requirements
2369275 this pressure to raise funds and meet capital requirements creates a downward spiral in prices forcing financial institutions to continually sell even more assets into an already depressed market
2369276 a bad situation quickly becomes even worse this is exactly what has been happening among financial institutions since the credit crisis began in july 2007
2369277 issue 2 long term policyfannie mae was created in 1938 as a government agency with a mission to buy mortgages from banks and issue bonds on the bond market using the pool of mortgages as collateral for the bonds
2369278 their preferred status and insider ties to the government have resulted in record corporate profits when times were good and a taxpayer funded safety net when times are bad
2369279 just because the companies engage in a business that benefits the public doesnt mean that they deserve to be fully backed by taxpayers and the federal government
2369280 all the data is encrypted and we have hired hackers to try to break into our systems

2369291 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2369292 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public
2369293 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2369294 i have given a complete interview on this matter and having done so will have nothing more to say
2369295 que por las altas responsabilidades inherentes a su cargo y la dependencia directa de su mando del oficial superior que mantuvo los contactos con corres deb a tener conocimiento de los inadecuados mecanismos de visita y asistencia al ahora por segunda vez pr fugo de la justicia
2369296 hey p j you like to drive fast why not join a responsible organization such as the sports car club of america and enjoy participation in sports car racing that way you could drive as fast as you wish while still engaging in a well regulated spectator sport that is becoming more popular each year
2369297 governor douglas is ignoring the real economic pain vermonters are facing and instead is spending his campaign making wildly inaccurate accusations against me
2369298 its sad to see the governor of vermont stoop to these karl rove tactics just because hes worried about losing an election
2369299 as you know the anthrax letter that came to my office was a very deadly one people died who handled the letter that i was supposed to open that focuses my attention and put everybody in my office at risk right from the start

2369304 you post a lie it is proven 100 false you move the goalposts and post yet another lie and it continues on around till were back to the original lie as if it will somehow become true if its re iterated again the same misquotes over and over again the same hindsight bias appeals to authority etc
2369305 oh so thats why i was hired to secretly plant explosives in the twin towers and i believed them when they said it was to deal with an infestation of extraordinarily large mice
2369306 any man who is under 30 and is not a liberal has not heart and any man who is over 30 and is not a conservative has no brains

2369308 any man who is under 30 and is not a liberal has not heart and any man who is over 30 and is not a conservative has no brains
2369309 its much better to change your point of view in response to reality than to insist reality has got it wrong because it doesnt share your point of view
2369310 the twoofer mindset in a nutshell if theres no video it never happened if there is video it was faked
2369311 how many people does it take to demolish an act of treason
2369312 any man who is under 30 and is not a liberal has not heart and any man who is over 30 and is not a conservative has no brains
2369313 to date the u s government has not been able to determine the origin of the money used for the 9 11 attacks ultimately the question is of little practical significance similarly we have seen no evidence that any foreign government or foreign government official supplied any funding

2369318 well the troof movement has finally done it they cracked the case and found the true perpetrators of 9 11 some guy and his handicapped daughter
2369319 to date the u s government has not been able to determine the origin of the money used for the 9 11 attacks ultimately the question is of little practical significance similarly we have seen no evidence that any foreign government or foreign government official supplied any funding
2369320 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
2369321 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient

2369325 o you who believe stand out firmly for allah as just witnesses and let not the enmity and hatred of others make you avoid justice be just that is nearer to taqwa and have taqwa of allah verily allah is well acquainted with what you do
2369326 my father gave me a gift but amrah bint rawahah my mother said that she would not agree to it unless he made allahs messenger sallallahu alaihi wa sallam as a witness to it so my father went to allahs messenger sallallahu alaihi wa sallam to ask him to be a witness to his giving me the gift allahs messenger sallallahu alaihi wa sallam have you given the like of it to everyone of your offspring allahs messenger sallallahu alaihi wa sallam said i shall not be witness to injustice my father then returned and took back his gift
2369327 and let not the enmity and hatred of others make you avoid justice
2369328 the dwellers of paradise will on that day have the best abode and have the fairer of places for repose
2369329 you are more rough and crude than the messenger of allah sallallahu alaihi wa sallam
2369330 and have taqwa of allah verily allah is well acquainted with what you do
2369331 allah has promised those who believe and do deeds of righteousness that for them there is forgiveness
2369332 and they who disbelieve and deny our ayat are those who will be the dwellers of the hell fire
2369333 and whoever is saved from his covetousness such are those who are successful
2369334 beware of greed avarice for indeed greed avarice destroyed those who came before you it ordered them to cut off ties of relationship so they cut off ties of relationship and it ordered them to be miserly so they were miserly and it ordered them to commit sins so they committed sins
2369335 beware of greed avarice since greed avarice destroyed those who came before you it led them to shed their blood and make lawful what was forbidden for them
2369336 avarice is eager craving which causes a person to take things which are not lawful for him and to withhold the rights of others
2369337 avarice shuhh and eemaan will not combine in the heart of a believer
2369338 dust in the way of allaah and the smoke of hell fire will never combine in the belly of a servant nor will avarice and eemaan ever combine in the heart of a servant
2369339 the best of eemaan is self restraint sabr and compliance liberality musaamahah

2369457 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2369458 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2369459 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him

2369483 above 35 mph there is an external combustion system which is basically a heater that uses a little bit of gasoline or biofuel or ethanol or vegetable oil that will heat the air
2369484 heating the air increases its volume and by increasing its volume it increases the cars range thats why with one gallon of gasoline or its equivalent we are able to make over 100 mpg
2369485 no ones really proven a six seater passenger car can get any better than 75 miles to the gallon so this would represent a big step forward
2369486 they would have to prove that before they can throw rocks at the prius
2369487 that is above what you normally find even in an industrial setting
2369488 that takes quite a compressor to do it takes horsepower to compress the air up to that pressure

2369497 i dont think theres any question that the gas prices in louisville are higher than elsewhere
2369498 to the public i want to say i dont think its a retail issue dont get mad at your local retailer but we have a wholesale situation here that is causing jefferson county to function in a way a little bit different than our competitor cities
2369499 this is a supplier whose merger was approved by the ftc but it could may very well be that we have to refer some issues competitive issues to the federal government as it pertains to whether we have a monopoly at the wholesale level here in jefferson county
2369500 the kentucky attorney general cannot do a heck of a lot about 3 60 or 3 80 gasoline
2369501 thats a function of larger market forces however if jefferson county is 20 or 30 cents higher than it ought to be then perhaps i can do something
2369502 earlier this summer it became increasingly apparent that louisvilles gas prices were higher than surrounding regions and i instructed my administration to analyze relevant fuel price data our analysis has found that there does not appear to be a problem at the retail level but rather at the wholesale level with hard working kentuckians having to choose between groceries for their families and gas to get to work i am determined to get to the bottom of this inequity and am working with attorney general conway and mayor jerry abramson to determine our next steps we plan to move quickly and aggressively to protect the interest of consumers and families in louisville
2369503 im disappointed in the judgment that she showed on how to handle this matter with a family member
2369504 at this point i have no reason to believe she didnt handle things honestly and well go forward with a new acting director
2369505 i think that with the general counsel going in reporting directly to me on this matter as well as our internal auditor that we will set policies and procedures in place that will ensure this type of thing doesnt happen again
2369506 while in all instances i did not instruct or in any way suggest that rules should be broken or ignored
2369507 i understand that it could be viewed or misconstrued as receipt of special privileges or favors
2369508 weve been told that kimberly bunton was the person who would solve the problems in the housing department it appears from appearances shes part of the problem
2369509 you dont know where it goes back to how far it goes back the role of asking the internal audit department to look at it is not nearly enough
2369510 i think weve got to look deeply at this agency i think it needs to stop not with this agency we need to look around and see whats going on

2369532 one of the most enjoyable weeks in my 24 years of priesthood
2369533 warm humorous inspiring and most significantly a genuine positive generous affirmation of all that the conference was trying to achieve
2369534 what i think bishop mcmahons heartwarming speech did most of all was to convey to those gathered that he was not simply there as a token prelate but that he really enjoyed taking part actively that he supported our work and that he was prepared to crack some jokes that he knew we would enjoy being entirely on our wavelength and as they say reading from the same page
2369535 bishop mcmahon has certainly won the hearts of the priests who came to merton all of a sudden there is someone that many priests loyal to pope benedict will be watching closely and including in their mementos at the mass

2369541 we had exams today and we have exams tomorrow we got good work out of our players we didnt want to do too much tonight with exams tomorrow and a scrimmage tomorrow night
2369542 it was a great night from the special teams perspective
2369543 we covered every special team and well get some good film from this i thought it was really a good night for our coaches to get a chance to look at our special teams
2369544 i think were as mobile as weve ever been up front
2369545 theyre all 6 2 6 3 theyre all 275 to 290 pounds they can all move their feet really well theyre just good quick tough guys all five of them
2369546 treys big enough to mix it up with the nose guard and the tackle and hes athletic enough to pull and get out in front of the runner
2369547 trey was good enough to play in this league last year
2369548 we can flip them all thats the best thing about them i think that everyone of those guys is big enough and strong enough to mix it up with the nose in the three technique on the defensive line but athletic enough to handle the space vs the defensive ends and pass block out there
2369549 more than anything the scrimmage will be a ball security kind of thing
2369550 we get lulled to sleep a little bit out here our defensive guys typically pull off the guy carrying the ball they need to get tackled to the ground a little bit and see if we can hang onto the ball we had that same problem at the orange bowl when we werent able to tackle our backs because they were so beat up once they started getting tackled it was hard to secure the football we just want to have some live competition and hopefully the offense can take care of the football and the defense can improve on their assignments
2369551 certainly some of our veteran fifth year guys as long as they stay healthy those positions arent up for grab
2369552 one of the real issues we have right now is that we have five or six true freshmen who look really good
2369553 were going to keep looking at them i dont have a problem playing them if theyre the real deal and theyre going to get 20 or 30 snaps per game weve got a bunch of those guys right now who look pretty good but well know more after saturday
2369554 weve got some older guys that are hurt right now and some of them it looks like they may miss a week to two weeks
2369555 there are not many high profile races on the primary ballot this year
2369556 im anticipating 15 percent unless we see a significant surge of people going to the polls on tuesday
2369557 its ironic because were seeing record numbers of voter registrations and im confident that well see a record turnout in the general election
2369558 well be lucky to get to 15 percent quite frankly
2369559 this would be the lowest even year primary by a long shot weve been averaging about 25 percent for clark county
2369560 but this year there are no high profile primary races theres nothing thats really exciting the voters
2369561 were going to have back to back record setting elections
2369562 one is a record low and one is a record high

2369581 it was scary but doable but after some tests they thought it had spread already
2369582 that was devastating for my husband and i and mostly to think about my children not having a mom to grow up
2369583 mri sends a radio frequency wave and by a very complicated process an image is formed which we then can interpret
2369584 it did confirm what they believed it just being a tumor and it hadnt spread so in that respect it just helped us feel at ease as to the surgery we chose
2369585 i wonder if there will ever be a day i dont think about it
2369586 there will be an additional number of biopsies balance that with a woman having the reassurance that if the exam is normal then its 95 percent surety

2369748 nudity is a taboo in america because we primarily equate nudity or nakedness with sexuality and we have taboos about sexuality

2369750 nudity is a taboo in america because we primarily equate nudity or nakedness with sexuality and we have taboos about sexuality
2369751 a lot of it has to do i think with the puritan and victorian heritage that we have which says that any kind of temptation will lead you into hell

2369764 people will be removed from the area if they dont get their penis under control
2369765 one of those situations when things are a bit hard to control
2369766 i just wonder about how appropriate it would be to be aroused for more than a few moments
2369767 but either it is under special conditions like a strip tent or some porn magazine
2369768 their penis seems to betray what they have been thinking about
2369769 there are women who dont have much control at such moments
2369770 so extremely inappropriate to have an orgasm at such a moment
2369771 many teen nudists realize that theyre having problems with their hormones acting up
2369772 as a woman its much easier to hide any arousal

2369793 me han ensa ado mucho tanto como hombre como jugador porque son lindos ejemplos a nivel internacional como jugadores como entrenadores y como personas la verdad que somos grandes amigos
2369794 me parece que son los jugadores que han abiertos las puertas para muchos argentinos tanto a nivel futbol stico como a nivel ahora de entrenadores y trasmiten esa sensaci n de que siempre puedes ganar algo con esa gente por eso han tenido tanto xito en cada casa que han jugado
2369795 a m me gusta mucho la parte organizativa que es lo que mejor hago por eso he tenido tantos resultados porque nos ordenamos muy r pidamente y eso es lo que te da los resultados por eso apuntamos mucho al orden a la disciplina al trabajo eso es lo que m s resultados te da
2369796 me parece que la copa libertadores es mi mayor logro porque era el inicio de mi carrera y a los tres meses de ser entrenador ganar una libertadores me parece que es el torneo m s preciado de todos en sudam rica ganarlo creo que yo nos dio unas puertas abiertas para mi trabajo y por eso hemos ganado tantas cosas en argentina si est s organizado en la vida podr s tener muchos resultados
2369797 me parece que lo entendi que tiene que existir una competencia y no s lo conmigo con todos los entrenadores la va a seguir tenido
2369798 ojal que el futuro seguramente tendremos las puertas abiertas porque hemos ganando much simo

2369823 what we know for sure is kim young cheol didnt use any particular editing tricks nor special effects its all bonafide action made of long shots and assorted degrees of pain which sounds just about right
2369824 no cg no stuntmen no wires no stars who needed to be trained no rock or hip hop trying to interfere with the mood music is a healthy mix of traditional korean sounds treated with modern sensibilities as you can hear from the trailers just good old fashioned ass kicking and since its the olympics some gymnastic in the middle sounds yummy
2369825 yeah very low budget and probably very thin on plot guy deals with loan sharks cant pay the interest they want to sell him by the ounce pain starts but looks pretty badass
2369826 it played at pusan and the handful of korean language reviews we found on daum were very positive after so many slick but boring films im ready for a low budget ass kicker
2369827 the number one reason was because we believe he can help our hockey club and we felt strongly that we missed him last year
2369828 we missed his leadership and his play and his coolness
2369829 he wanted to come back and we wanted him back
2369830 and you obviously dont want to enter into a new contract without resolving the past so we did that
2369831 one of the critical factors of maintenance being performed is the number of licensed engineers and in australia that ratio is approximately one to one or two to one
2369832 we find in the overseas facilities that ratio could be as large as one licensed engineer to 10 unlicensed engineers

2369838 the lbcc seems determined to stage a real life version of fahrenheit 451 except they dont have the stones to actually try and burn books

2369875 great stuff off the wall instrumentation to really lose yourself in
2369876 all you have to do is look at the numbers and the quarterback rating
2369877 those are kind of frustrating things both quarterbacks experienced some of that s ball to domenik hixon that was caught with only one foot down just out of the end zone those are the difference in games particularly in preseason games when you have so many people youre trying to play and so many people that are going to get snaps the continuity factor is not all that easy so you do rely on some of those big plays
2369878 i think it is important to realize that every player in the league is evaluated by everybody by us
2369879 we are going to do our due diligence on every available player in the league so it is not to say that something will be done but we are certainly going to be aware of that these two have gone head to head since camp began and certainly there is some evidence as of last night that the competition is proving to bring out the best in both of them and it is highly competitive
2369880 we are pleased with the competitive aspect of the spot and i think if the progress continues we will be solid in the backup position
2369881 you see the performance and you obviously go ahead and visualize his further development and how he can help you as the season goes on
2369882 to tell you the truth i dont really see a difference
2369883 a lot of guys say its faster but i really dont see it if anything its learning the system trying to get the college calls out of your mind and learning the nfl system
2369884 im so used to finishing plays but in practice i couldnt do it because i didnt want to hurt any of my teammates
2369885 they speculate on the amount of time he will be out we will have to do some discussing of that situation probably this evening
2369886 that doesnt mean anything other than the fact that we will listen to the medical advice on again what they think is the length of his injury and then we will talk about what his status might very well be i dont want anybody to read anything into that because i just walked out of a meeting in which we discussed the game so i have not met with the medical people i do have a preliminary report here but there isnt any indication of time i havent met with general manager jerry reese nor have i met with vice president of medical services ronnie barnes and that will take place probably this evening
2369887 it is all speculation as to how far they might be out gilberry the hope was that he could get back sooner but there will be some time involved
2369888 its going to take some time to get used to especially with this being a live game atmosphere the coach and the player need to learn when to talk and not to talk it works good because you dont have to worry about anybody stealing signals
2369889 you cant have a secret ballot and have the ability to count it accurately
2369890 theres nothing in the four corners of the warrant saying anything about the calvos being a threat to law enforcement
2369891 i grew up in a small town in wisconsin named pewaukee and actually john is from genesee depot but we went to the same high school kettle moraine you want a spelling on that or are you up on your glacial terms
2369892 and then we also went to the university of wisconsin together for a year and thats probably where we became better friends
2369893 but then koepp transferred to ucla for film school but we kept in touch you know showed different pieces of work to each other and after i graduated college he said why dont you come out to l a and try screenwriting and that sounded a little more fun than law school so i came out and never left
2369894 but after we did those initial jobs we didnt write together for a long time
2369895 but i just really like kamps writing hes got a gift for character and anytime i feel like a script calls for funny you know how people say that funny is really hard funny is actually easy all you have to do is call kamps
2369896 hes just one of the funniest people i know and he manages to have humor that grows out of character which is really really the whole ball game theyre not just jokes theyre jokes because of who the people are
2369897 usually i write and i enjoy the writers lifestyle i like the isolation of writing so when i direct its kind of shocking because there are so many people to deal with and writers are writers because we kind of like the quiet
2369898 and so i was at the very end of this long shoot and everybody was driving me crazy so i went for a walk over lunch on a shooting day and i was walking around in the village and i saw a big tooth shaped sign hanging outside somebodys dental office and i thought what a great profession that must be because the people you work with have cotton shoved in their mouth and they cant talk to you it was a bad day
2369899 so that character just sort of leapt to mind and i thought what would be the worst thing that could happen to that guy if everyone had unfettered access to him and so the ghost premise came in
2369900 and we sat down roughed out an outline and sold it as a treatment to dreamworks
2369901 it was just a dream experience for me because dave kept me involved every step of the way
2369902 i live in california and dave lives in new york and i have two small children so i couldnt be on the set the whole time but i came out for the read through at the beginning of shooting we did a small rewrite at the beginning but when it went into production there werent a lot radical changes they would call occasionally for a line or because something had changed because the location didnt suit the scene but really the script we finished right before they started shooting is what appeared on screen except for editing of course
2369903 and a guy like ricky not only knows how to write well for others and hes won lots of awards for it and done brilliant work but he also knows how to write well for himself
2369904 the character of bertram pincus was very specific on the page he was one of the stronger characters i think john and i have ever written and certainly compared to the ones ive written on my own
2369905 but then whats funny is once ricky was cast it was impossible to imagine anyone else playing him i really think it is a uniquely good meeting of performer and material

2369920 ive learned a lot become a better professional and a better man because of my experience and my time in new york i dont regret or feel ashamed about anything that happened to me in my time in new york
2369921 the most difficult part is just the realization that the organization no longer wants you
2369922 you spend eight years there and in the blink of an eye youre no longer wanted there
2369923 there is much more wealth than before and business people are travelling more for both business and pleasure they find it much more convenient to travel on a private jet than use a commercial airline also a few years ago people did not want to flaunt their wealth so they did not buy private aircraft because it seemed a little bit extravagant now it is a lot more accepted
2369924 globally the private jet industry is up about 25 per cent since a year ago the market is growing dramatically
2369925 ive had it on the market for over a year
2369926 if i dont sell it what im going to do is change the dynamics of it in six months or so itll no longer be a bar
