1730012 family environments which have deteriorated over the past 40 years
1730013 many young people without a family tradition of higher education can find the idea of going to university daunting we hope that these taster activities will break down that barrier and help them to see the exciting possibilities they have ahead of them
1730014 in particular with fewer young people in the uk studying science and maths at a level and beyond its vital that we give them a chance to see how thrilling university science can be hopefully we are encouraging an interest that will last a lifetime
1730015 i have done this course for the last three years and have really enjoyed it
1730016 every year i have learnt something new and they have given me an insight into engineering and technology
1730017 the mentors are always really friendly and are good at helping us draw up ideas
1730018 i am looking forward to the competition at the end of the week and fairly confident our team have a good chance
1730019 it has made me more determined to get to university and i think the summer schools are great at opening up my options for the future i would really like to come back again next year
1730020 we have been working in teams this week to make two different robots
1730021 the best thing about this week has been working together and meeting new people we had to build a structure made out of plastic bags to fit my entire team in for ten seconds which was really fun
1730022 the hardest thing has been waking up at 6am every morning to get here from watford and understanding how each part of the robot works and seeing where everything goes
1730023 this week has been really exciting and i would like to go into engineering when im older
1730024 the mentors have been really helpful and have given us loads of useful tips i would definitely come back next year

1730058 immediately begin to remove our troops from iraq he will remove one to two combat brigades each month and have all of our combat brigades out of iraq within 16 months
1730059 we still have a ways to go number one were working on security and its very encouraging thats true but what were really trying to achieve here is sustainable security on iraqi terms so i think my first response to that would be lets look at the conditions
1730060 instead of any time based approach to any decision for withdrawal its got to be conditions based with the starting point being an intelligence analysis of what might be here today and what might lie ahead in the future i still think we still have work that remains to be done before i can really answer that question
1730061 its very dangerous ill speak for the coalition forces men and women of character and moral courage we have a mission and its not until the mission is done that i can look my leader in the eye and say sir maam mission accomplished and i think it is dangerous to leave anything a little early
1730062 id have to see the entire plan id have to understand the strategic objectives of the leadership and based on those strategic objectives come up with operational objectives its very difficult to comment on one way or the other whether one plan would work or one plan wouldnt work right now we are helping the iraqis achieve sustainable security and helping them to increase the capability of the iraqi security forces and we are making great progress along those lines
1730063 if we pull out of here too early its going to establish a vacuum of power that violent criminal groups will be able to fill once we leave
1730064 the same people keep coming back because we want to see iraq succeed thats what we want i dont want my kids that hopefully will join the military my notional children to have to come back to iraq 30 years from now and wear this
1730065 you cant put a timetable on it its events based
1730066 we have the capacity to do a minimum of two and a half brigade combat teams a month can we expand that capacity sure can we accelerate it depends it depends on the amount of equipment that we bring back and its going to depend on how fast we bring them out

1730112 it is well noted we have shown interest we have had discussions with madrid over it and they are ongoing the window is still open and we are still talking to madrid

1730127 anything energy wise that is useful must move to a higher state of entropy or it is useless to us
1730128 what do you do when its 20 degrees below zero at night and the wind is calm why you fire up the fossil fuel plants only one problem it takes nearly a day to bring their boilers up to a temperature where they can efficiently produce electricity
1730129 solar powered hybrid to be released 0 to 15 mph in 36 minutes
1730130 and these sources are extremely expensive to drill and get product to market
1730131 that prediction is totally false and irresponsible nobody is asking you to stop using fossil fuels now but your theory of 300 year supply of fossil fuels only promotes a continued philosophy of gluttonous consumption new technologies are being developed and should be embraced now especially by conservatives who should be leading the way in this endeavor
1730132 we have plenty of oil that must be why we have to go to the remote parts of the arctic and drill miles off shore to produce what remains of a rapidly disappearing resource
1730133 1 the claim is not false its true theres lots of fossil fuel resources on the planet were not within centuries of running out
1730134 yep the field could initially bring in 6 000 barrels day it is chevron decision to move slowly on this project not the lefties
1730135 my my did you morning talk with jesus go badly today
1730136 they have to do it because even today fossil fuels are cheaper than the alternatives
1730137 gt this is not in any way an indication that oil is vanishing as a resource which is the utterly false point you were trying to make lt lt br gt please list all the major sources of oil discovered within the past couple decades
1730138 nowhere did i even suggest the government become involved in any way or even bring up the subject
1730139 is this your idea of a debate using term such as
1730140 sorry pancho me lad you and modmark asserted that oil supplies are dwindling
1730141 environmentalists are church ladies dressed in green and make no sense at all
1730142 this issue with both of these things is that governmental intervention wont help us one bit other than to fund research
1730143 i also worked on the kilngas coal gas gasification plant
1730144 but if any of these are used as energy for transportation how would you tax it it would be far too easy to fill up at your house rather than a station that can determine taxes
1730145 he has the gall to expect us all to drive around in little euro weeny natural gas cars
1730146 sandrob weighs in with a spectacular denial of the overwhelming scientific consensus on several critical climate and population issues
1730147 all sources of alternative energy need more energy input that they produce in energy output
1730148 in the grand scheme of things we are tiny compared to the planet its pure hubris to imagine that we could completely destroy it so easily the planet is 4 billion years old our entire existence is a blink of an eye in that time span
1730149 it takes 25 times as much electical energy to obtain 1 unit of energy from hydrogen

1730169 universitario qued fuera nuevamente de la copa sudamericana y en su cuarta participaci n no pudo terminar con la mala racha de no haber podido ganar ning n partido en esta competencia el equipo gareca se debe meter de lleno al clausura y en el objetivo por obtener el t tulo nacional

1730171 election ballot titles should be neutral and not intentionally prejudice voters
1730172 its the ags job to provide a fair and unbiased ballot title and summary the ags job is to apply the law in a way thats fair to all californians not in a way that influences elections furthermore this ballot title is simply not accurate the purpose of the amendment is to protect marriage broadly as the union of one man and one woman not to eliminate same sex marriage specifically

1730193 it is indeed rare for two men to meet and fall in love while each is banging half of a pair of male twins
1730194 when one side calls the other divisive and they are sitting on pertanent facts this upsetting
1730195 they had to sit on this information and the uranium itself for fear of terrorists attempting to steal it
1730196 u n inspectors documented and safeguarded the yellowcake which had been stored in aging drums and containers since before the 1991 gulf war there was no evidence of any yellowcake dating from after 1991 the official said
1730197 there was no evidence of any yellowcake dating from after 1991 the official said
1730198 and then we tricked him by deciding to devote all of our resources to addressing a non threat while allowing actual threats to fester
1730199 but is that the best defense of the invasion of iraq that is left sure it was stupid
1730200 further processing isotopic separation is needed to make depleted uranium or enriched uranium for use in a nuclear reactor or a nuclear weapon
1730201 this yellowcake inventory was known for decades and does not further the wmd argument one iota
1730202 550 metric tons of saddams yellowcake used for nuclear weapon enrichment has been discovered
1730203 that is just way too much logic for any 1200 liberals to digest at any one time
1730204 a fixed false belief that is resistant to reason or confrontation with actual fact
1730205 while yellowcake alone is not considered potent enough for a so called
1730206 we are pleased that we have taken the yellowcake from a volatile region into a stable area to produce clean electricity
1730207 israeli warplanes bombed a reactor project at the site in 1981 later u n inspectors documented and safeguarded the yellowcake which had been stored in aging drums and containers since before the 1991 gulf war there was no evidence of any yellowcake dating from after 1991 the official said
1730208 house speaker nancy pelosi has dropped a bombshell by reversing course and suggesting that the judiciary committee might take up the issue of impeaching president bush
1730209 some have argued that the nuclear threat from iraq is not imminent that saddam is at least five to seven years away from having nuclear weapons i would not be so certain
1730210 saddam hussein and his weapons are a direct threat to this country to our people and to all free people
1730211 we know hes been absolutely devoted to trying to acquire nuclear weapons and we believe he has in fact reconstituted nuclear weapons
1730212 it cannot be emphasized too strongly or too often that this great nation was founded not by religionists but by christians not on religions but on the gospel of jesus christ for that reason alone people of other faiths have been afforded freedom of worship here
1730213 a fixed false belief that is resistant to reason or confrontation with actual fact
1730214 yes the majority of countries believed he had wmds but they all did not support war as the solution bush could not get un backing
1730215 check out the story so they could provide a response to the vice presidents office
1730216 the issue is that this revelation does not suddenly justify bushs statement that saddam was trying to get yellowcake from niger in 1999 and it does not by extension incriminate wilson and plame that was point this guy merola was trying to make
1730217 as it turns out the people who lied were joe wilson and his wife

1730220 valerie had nothing to do with the matter she definitely had not proposed that i make the trip
1730221 syria if we knew that iraq was really toothless and the real threat was buried in sands of syria why didnt we invade syria
1730222 ive heard that bold face lie countless times in fact he said this would be long and difficult struggle
1730223 in may 2003 coalition forces visited the former yellowcake extraction plant at al qaim and discovered 16 drums of yellowcake and radioactive waste materials we believe were associated with the pre 1991 nuclear weapons program
1730224 she has nothing else to say so i won the argument
1730225 in may 2003 coalition forces visited the former yellowcake extraction plant at al qaim and discovered 16 drums of yellowcake and radioactive waste materials we believe were associated with the pre 1991 nuclear weapons program
1730226 during the 1970s and early 1980s iraq bought uranium in various forms from the international market
1730227 anyone with an ounce of intellectual honest knows that this uranium has been known about for more than 15 years and that it has nothing whatsoever to do with joe wilson and valerie plame yet you insinuate that somehow it does shame on you mr merola
1730228 mr merola you owe your readers an apology for insulting their intelligence your piece was written to intentionally insinuate that the yellowcake in question related to the alleged attempt to acquire uranium ore from niger that joe wilsons mission showed to be a fraud
1730229 as it turns out the people who lied were joe wilson and his wife
1730230 thus this uranium fails to account for the 66 missing metric tons which certainly could have come from niger in 1995 or later
1730231 there is no evidence that this material had been produced after desert storm
1730232 the iraqi uranium originated from mines at ukashat in iraq and was originally intended for use in saddam husseins nuclear weapons program which was discovered and halted in 1991 after the first gulf war peter rickwood of the international atomic energy authority iaea told wnn that the materials were catalogued and sealed by iaea officials and kept under safeguards from that time this situation continued until immediately before the 2003 invasion of iraq when iaea staff had to leave upon its return in the summer of 2003 the iaea re sealed the complex and re catalogued its contents it was found that local people had entered the site and taken contaminated barrels for their own use during the security vacuum although no significant amounts of uranium went missing some high explosives did
1730233 israeli warplanes bombed a reactor project at the site in 1981 later u n inspectors documented and safeguarded the yellowcake which had been stored in aging drums and containers since before the 1991 gulf war there was no evidence of any yellowcake dating from after 1991 the official said
1730234 during his trip to niger wilson actually interviewed the former prime minister of niger ibrahim assane mayaki
1730235 it appears that american troops found the 550 metric tons of uranium in 2003 after invading iraq
1730236 as it turns out the people who lied were joe wilson and his wife
1730237 before 11 september 2001 many in the world believed that saddam hussein could be contained
1730238 we have been hearing from the far left for more than five years how bush lied somehow that slogan loses its credibility now that 550 metric tons of saddams yellowcake used for nuclear weapon enrichment has been discovered and shipped to canada for its new use as nuclear energy
1730239 hear about the 550 metric tons of yellowcake uranium found in iraq no why should you it doesnt fit the medias neat story line that saddam husseins iraq posed no nuclear threat when we invaded in 2003
1730240 secondly there has been a great deal of information that has come out about this trip since wilsons op ed first of all there was a trade delegation to iraq and though yellowcake was not specifically named it was the only possible commercial export product that niger had to offer that saddam could possibly have been interested in
1730241 wilson gave only an oral report when he got back extremely curious for a cia mission and very fishy
1730242 and the cia drew the conclusion even if wilson himself didnt that saddam was attempting to buy yellowcake from niger
1730243 all of this came out in the senate select intelligence committee which came to the conclusion that wilson lied in his op ed and in his other accounts of the occasion to the press
1730244 oh sure its all just innocent wording like when president bush said in his state of the union address in 2003 before 11 september 2001 many in the world believed that saddam hussein could be contained
1730245 but chemical agents lethal viruses and shadowy terrorist networks are not easily contained imagine those 19 hijackers with other weapons and other plans this time armed by saddam hussein
1730246 hear about the 550 metric tons of yellowcake uranium found in iraq no why should you it doesnt fit the medias neat story line that saddam husseins iraq posed no nuclear threat when we invaded in 2003
1730247 good relations with both the prime minister and the former minister of mines of niger not to mention lots of french contacts

1730257 new yorker cover prints buy the obama cover print the press is buzzing about on sale now
1730258 the new yorker may think as one of their staff explained to us that their cover is a satirical lampoon of the caricature senator obamas right wing critics have tried to create but most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive and we agree
1730259 we completely agree with the obama campaign its tasteless and offensive
1730260 i think its totally inappropriate and frankly i understand if senator obama and his supporters would find it offensive
1730261 obviously i wouldnt have run a cover just to get attention i ran the cover because i thought it had something to say what i think it does is hold up a mirror to the prejudice and dark imaginings about barack obamas past and their politics i cant speak for anyone elses interpretations all i can say is that it combines a number of images that have been propagated not by everyone on the right but by some about obamas supposed lack of patriotism or his being soft on terrorism or the idiotic notion that somehow michelle obama is the second coming of the weathermen or most violent black panthers that somehow all this is going to come to the oval office the idea that we would publish a cover saying these things literally i think is just not in the vocabulary of what we do and who we are weve run many many satirical political covers ask the bush administration how many

1730305 im appealing to all of those who may have intimate knowledge with regards to katelynns life since may of 2007
1730306 thats the time when i believe she was with her guardian im hearing a lot of third hand information which i can describe to you as disturbing but no one has contacted me and id like to speak first hand with all these people who are providing this third hand information
1730307 what other case do you know where a son of a hamas leader who was raised on the tenets of extremist islam comes out against it
1730308 i know that im endangering my life and am even liable to lose my father but i hope that hell understand this and that god will give him and my family the patience and willingness to open their eyes to jesus and to christianity maybe one day ill be able to return to palestine and to ramallah together with jesus in the kingdom of god
1730309 as a child i grew up in a very religious family on the principle of hatred of israelis the first time i encountered them was at about the age of 10 when soldiers entered our home and arrested my father until then i had never been separated from him we didnt know anything about the circumstances of his arrest his membership in hamas was a secret matter and we certainly didnt think he was one of its founders i didnt understand anything about politics or religion i only knew that the israeli army had arrested my father repeatedly and for me he was everything a good loving man who would do anything for me he took care of us bought us gifts gave of himself whereas the soldiers entered our house and took him away from me in high school i studied sharia islamic law in 1996 when i was only 18 i was arrested by the israel defense forces because i was the head of the islamic society in my high school its a kind of youth movement of the organization and my process of awakening began
1730310 until then i knew hamas through my father who lived a very modest and loving life
1730311 nobody knows them and how they operate as well as i do for example i remember how the family of saleh talahmeh a member of the military arm of hamas who was assassinated by israel was forced to beg for financial assistance because they were left with nothing after his death the hamas leadership abandoned them as well as the families of other shaheeds martyrs while the senior members of the organization abroad wasted tens of thousand of dollars a month only on security for themselves
1730312 even some of the current leaders of hamas were involved in the past in the security arm in the prisons so that he is among those responsible for these acts they were suspicious of prisoners who spent too much time in the bathroom even if it was only an upset stomach they suspected that the prisoner was transferring information or alternatively having sexual relations with other men a homosexual the gays were immediately suspected of collaboration then i understood that not everyone in hamas is like my father hes a nice friendly man but i discovered how evil his colleagues are after my release i lost the faith i had in those who ostensibly represented islam
1730313 youll see this interview will open many peoples eyes it will shake islam from the roots and im not exaggerating what other case do you know where a son of a hamas leader who was raised on the tenets of extremist islam comes out against it although i was never a terrorist i was a part of them surrounded by them all the time
1730314 i feel that christianity has several aspects its not only a religion but a faith i now see god through jesus and can tell about him for days on end whereas the muslims wont be able to say anything about god i consider islam a big lie the people who supposedly represent the religion admired mohammed more than god killed innocent people in the name of islam beat their wives and dont have any idea what god is i have no doubt that theyll go to hell i have a message for them there is only one way to paradise the way of jesus who sacrificed himself on the cross for all of us
1730315 only those christians with whom i met and spent time knew about my decision for years i helped my father the hamas leader and he didnt know that i had converted only that i had christian friends
1730316 you have to understand i was never one of them although i helped my father and accompanied him i was always opposed to the use of terror hamas members didnt like me i didnt come to pray in the mosques i hung around with strangers they didnt like my leather jacket or even my jeans they considered it going astray but i helped my father and conducted his affairs because hes my father not because hes a leader in hamas im not a hamas activist who converted to christianity thats not the story i wanted to help my father understand that harming innocent people is forbidden and through him perhaps to change other peoples thinking
1730317 when i was with my father i in effect pushed a moderate hamas leader into making logical decisions such as stopping the attacks and establishing two states alongside one another
1730318 but within hamas there were other leaders mainly from the gaza strip and damascus who thought they had to continue with suicide attacks as an effective means of achieving their aims the problem was that they were stronger than my father in terms of their status in the organization what helped stop the attacks in the final analysis was israels attacks against the hamas leaders
1730319 he had no connection to the military arm but they always consulted him about strategic decisions the hamas leadership did not make decisions only according to the opinion of the organization leaders in syria or gaza however you have to remember that the hamas leadership in damascus was in control of the organizations money therefore it had the most influence on organization policy they were also the only ones who were not restricted in contacting one another as opposed to the leaderships in the west bank and gaza so that they also served as go betweens among all the groups in hamas and incidentally although they now claim that the revolution in gaza was not planned i can tell you from clear knowledge that a year earlier in the summer of 2006 they spoke among themselves to the effect that if the tension with fatah continued they intended to take control of the strip
1730320 i like his voice but dont always understand the words
1730321 i respect israel and admire it as a country im opposed to a policy of killing civilians or using them as a means to an end and i understand that israel has a right to defend itself the palestinians if they dont have an enemy to fight will fight each other in about 20 years from now youll remember what im telling you the conflict will be among various groups within hamas theyre already beginning to quarrel over control of the money
1730322 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews they believe that tradition says that the prophet mohammed fought against the jews and that therefore they must continue to fight them to the death they have to take revenge against anyone who did not agree to accept the prophet mohammed like the jews who are seen in the koran as monkeys and the sons of pigs they speak in terms of historical rights that were taken from them in the view of hamas peace with israel contradicts sharia and the koran and the jews have no right to remain in palestine
1730323 more than that an entire society sanctifies death and the suicide terrorists in palestinian culture a suicide terrorist becomes a hero a martyr sheikhs tell their students about the heroism of the shaheeds and that causes the young people to imitate the suicide bombers in order to achieve glory ill give you an example i once met a young man named dia tawil he was a quiet boy an outstanding student not a muslim extremist and not radical in his ideas against the israelis i never heard extreme statements from him he didnt even come from a religious family his father was a communist and his sister was a journalist who didnt wear a head covering but bilal barghouti one of the heads of the military arm of hamas in the west bank didnt need more than a few months to convince him to become a suicide terrorist
1730324 do you know that hamas was the first to use the weapon of suicide bombers against civilian targets
1730325 they are blind and ignorant its true there are good and bad people everywhere but hamas supporters dont understand that they are led by a wicked and cruel group that brainwashes the children and gets them to believe that if they carry out a suicide attack theyll get to paradise but no suicide bomber will find himself there and no virgins are waiting for them after they have carried out an attack they have to understand that islam was created by people and not by god
1730326 in my eyes there were all cruel ugly inside but i think that mahmoud zahar one of the leaders of hamas in gaza is one of the worst
1730327 people with an open mind i liked to walk around among the buildings the restaurants the people to feel the night life i have many friends there whom i would like to see and i dont know whether ill be able to do that at all i mainly miss my mother my brothers and sisters but i know that it will be very difficult for me to return to ramallah soon
1730328 i hope that ill succeed one day in becoming a writer in order to write about my personal story and about the middle east conflict but at the moment at least my ambitions are only to find work a place to live i have no money i have no apartment i was about to become one of those homeless people but people from the church are helping me im dependent on them
1730329 i left behind a great deal of property in ramallah in order to achieve true freedom i wanted to get to quiet surroundings that would help me to open the eyes of the muslims and reveal the truth to them about their religion and about christianity to take them out of the darkness and the prison of islam in that way theyll have an opportunity to correct their mistakes to become better people and to bring a chance for peace in the middle east i dont give islam a chance to survive for more than 25 years in the past they scared people and in that way they prevented anti religious publicity but today in the modern age they wont be able to hide the truth any longer
1730330 i hope that someday god will give the opportunity to meet the right one she will have to be a believing christian and if shes a jew who converted even better

1730408 ive been reading some of the comments on other blogs about this with a mounting sense of wonder at the sheer naivete of some users for anything that is important firstly always plan for redundancy in your systems have an online and on computer service that are synched secondly do frequent backups to a 3rd source thirdly if its important pay for it ad funded services are responsive to the advertisers not to the users its that pipers tune thing

1730430 the team is eager to get back on the court as they are looking forward to this upcoming season
1730431 theyre ready for the challenge of turning this program around and moving it in the direction we need to go
1730432 i think we have to teach the team and theyve to remember what it feels like to win on a consistent basis and this group hasnt had that experience since theyve been here
1730433 we have to come out early and attack we cant come out sluggish
1730434 weve cut five points off of every set score now so were just playing to 25 so it will be very important for us especially as a young team to come out firing right away
1730435 we cant afford to get down 5 0 and be able to come back and still have time to work it out we need to make sure that we come into every match that when were starting at 0 0 that were ready to go
1730436 they were in some close matches last year but just couldnt quite pull them out and i think it is that mental toughness that everyone talks about that we will work on this season
1730437 our newcomers bring a great deal of experience and will enhance the competitive atmosphere we are looking to create
1730438 it is going to be a good fall camp for us to see what each of us is made of and to see how each player responds when they get pushed by another player
1730439 the thing that got this team in the most trouble last season was hitting errors and so that is one thing we will talk a lot about this fall trying to eliminate the silly errors where we dont take care of the ball we have to eliminate some of our hitting errors and get our hitting percentage up and then we need to be better at the net blocking
1730440 but i also know the person who goes to work and pays taxes and doesnt have a drivers license shouldnt stay in jail
1730441 i think you could argue that americans overall are better off because we have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment and low inflation and a lot of good things have happened a lot of jobs have been created
1730442 our utility operations turned in solid performances and our pipelines and field services businesses continue to benefit from our previous investments and the continuing high levels of drilling activity in the mid continent area driven by the strong demand for natural gas

1730444 it may not mean anything other than shes getting good legal advice
1730445 you dont know what the dea may suspect in this case and i think its a cautious way to proceed i think it would be wrong to assume shes done something criminal simply because shes invoking her fifth amendment against self incrimination

1730458 we have a new emergency department which they recognized for its privacy we have the smith family breast health center which they recognized and both were made possible not only through donations from the community but with a lot of input from the community
1730459 were in the process at munson of switching over to an electronic medical record
1730460 the advantage of an electronic medical record is wherever the patient touches the system whether its in the er in their doctors office getting an x ray across town well be able to pull up the record on the computer and it will be available to us
1730461 its a long journey but we think its an important one

1730476 is material support a war crime the defense believes it is not
1730477 this verdict will complicate the administrations plans to prosecute dozens of detainees in
1730478 i think you see even in a flawed system the administrations positions in the so called war on terror are too extreme even for american military officers
1730479 the verdict was in long before the jury began to deliberate

1730482 have you ever seen the movie version of romeo and juliet
1730483 you should see it the director franco zeferelli wanted to make the movie sexier and more appealing than the stage play so he took the second half of the famous balcony scene and put it in juliets chamber the next morning juliet and romeo are seen apparently naked under the covers in her bed and obviously have spent the night together after embracing and kissing and caressing juliets breast romeo walks naked to the window with his back to the audience to look at the sunrise but juliet merely sits up in the bed so she is seen half naked do you think you would be able to do that
1730484 i acted in plays at high school but there was never a nude scene
1730485 but this is college and youre a young woman now
1730486 i know and since my parents live in idaho they wont be coming to the production so i dont have to worry about that but can you tell me more about the nude scene and how it would work i dont want to be walking around backstage naked
1730487 better than that ill show you why dont you meet me at the theater after school today around three p m no one else will be there so ill run through the scene with you show you how it will work and you can decide yourself if you can do it
1730488 theres no one here but you and me and if you decide not to do it that will be that
1730489 okay this is an approximation of the bed the stage will be dark between scenes so you and romeo both wearing bathrobes can come out here in the dark take off the bathrobes and stuff them under the bed then you can get in the bed pull the coverlet up and the lights will fade on but they will be dim since this is early morning you will be face up on the side of the bed closest to the audience with the coverlet pulled up and romeo will be on this side facing you with the covers to his waist you can lie down now if you want to see what it will feel like
1730490 i dont know what it will really feel like unless im naked
1730491 yes i might as well find out if i can do it
1730492 ill turn my back while you take your clothes off and get under the coverlet let me know when youre ready
1730493 now you will have to pretend for the time being that i am romeo which will really test your acting skills since im old enough to be your daddy
1730494 but i will spare you that indignity from me then he will gently push the coverlet down to your waist and i think you should see what that feels like
1730495 you cant be in a fourteenth century story with twenty first century underpants
1730496 romeo wont be wearing any clothes and thats what scares me
1730497 would you be willing to take off your clothes so i could see what its like
1730498 we may try and get away with romeo leaning over and kissing your breast like this
1730499 and even though the audience wont see anything it would be natural for romeo to slip his hand under the coverlet and slide it down
1730500 yes at the age of eighteen and its embarrassing i come from a very religious family in high school i wasnt allowed to date anyone unless i had a chaperon some boys here at the college have asked me out but i dont want to go with them because i dont want them to find out im a virgin
1730501 im sorry i wish there was something i could do
1730502 there is something you could do juliet was not a virgin after that night with romeo was she
1730503 then thats what i want to happen to me i dont want to be a virgin after this scene
1730504 you could take my virginity i would give it to you for free i dont want it anymore
1730505 and how do you suggest i do that if i was willing to do that
1730506 you could do it here now what better time its the right place and no one else is around
1730507 yes i thought a lot about it before coming here i want to do it with someone who wouldnt brag about it around the campus and i know you wouldnt
1730508 first of all since youre naturally tight we need to get you lubricated to make it easier for you normally that is done with a womans own juices as she gets sexually aroused so im going to try and get you sexually aroused by performing oral sex on you is that all right
1730509 and you have to do your part by trying to get aroused all right
1730510 and now its your turn to do the same for me
1730511 then this is a good time to learn just kiss it lick it and then take as much as you can of it in you mouth and suck it
1730512 i should have said something about this before but you dont have to worry about getting pregnant
1730513 well you ought to think about it if youre planning to do any more of this with someone else
1730514 i will but what are you going to do about this sheet
1730515 i think im going to have it framed ill call it juliets flower and see if anyone guesses what that means

1730527 the presidency categorically rejects all allegations made in the so called report the presidency denies categorically that mbeki facilitated any money
1730528 obviously in the presidency we have decided to take legal advice and once the legal advice is given the president will take the necessary steps
1730529 these are rehashed allegations time and time again there is this assertion that it must be inherently the case that if we are dealing in arms there must be kickbacks

1730531 the p5 1 major powers are discussing next steps in the un security council and beginning to consider possible outlines of another sanctions resolution
1730532 we are very disappointed that iran has failed yet again to give a clear answer to the p5 1 generous incentives package the letter we received yesterday appears to be a stalling tactic
1730533 we havent set any deadlines ourselves for their response and there is ongoing dialogue
1730534 certainly there is a matter which is going to be discussed by the ministers in september
1730535 iran is ready to provide a clear response to your proposal at the earliest possibility while simultaneously expecting to receive your clear response to our questions and ambiguities as well
1730536 we dont have the decent and responsive statement from the iranians
1730537 the question posed is clear and calls for a simple answer does iran accept the freeze for freeze offer to launch negotiations it does not require further clarification
1730538 we regret that iran has once again chosen not to answer clearly despite all the efforts the six have made these past weeks to offer a framework for negotiations
1730539 the german government believes it is important to maintain the unity between the eu3 germany france and britain plus 3 us china and russia and that this unity is an important recipe for the success of our policy towards iran
1730540 i dont know if the panel can render fair what has already happened
1730541 the military commission system is a fair and appropriate legal process for prosecuting detainees alleged to have committed crimes against the united states or our interests

1730543 i feel very excited and very proud because the olympic games is a 100 year dream of chinas
1730544 we did this action today to highlight the chinese governments use of the beijing olympics as a propaganda tool

1730552 when we got back to the house a young boy told us he had seen asiba lying on a footpath next to the road
1730553 we immediately went there and i saw it was definitely her she was dead my wife was crying i did not kill her
1730554 we spent the whole day in the tavern drinking and meitjie and i were quite drunk she meitjie started kissing another man and i got angry with her and we both left the tavern at 5pm
1730555 meitjie ran away to her aunts place and i kept the children with me after i prepared supper for the children we all went to sleep in the same bed with the exception of asiba who was still finishing her supper
1730556 i went outside with the baby and checked around the back of the house and in the toilet but she was nowhere to be seen

1730559 coelho explained why he thinks giving books away online leads to selling more copies in print

1730561 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1730562 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1730563 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills is a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1730564 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity
1730565 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and economic needs
1730566 i know senator mccain likes to call himself a maverick and the fact is there are times when hes shown independence from his party in the past but the price he paid for his partys nomination was to reverse himself on position after position and now he embraces the failed bush policies and politics that helped break washington in the first place and that doesnt exactly meet my definition of a maverick

1730655 raising taxes in a bad economy is about the worst thing you could do because it will kill even more jobs when what we need are policies that create jobs
1730656 you cant be a maverick when politically its working for you and not a maverick when it doesnt work for you when you received your partys nomination
1730657 its time to retire these old policies and bring new energy to america

1730666 in theatre of war 2 we not only improved the graphics and the ai system we added new units and features we wanted to make a game that would exceed expectations of our fans
1730667 after the original game was released we spent a lot of time reading comments and gathering opinions i believe that theatre of war 2 will become popular not only among old fans but gain new followers it is a real step forward for our team
1730668 when 1c approached us with their plans for a sequel we knew that just like with the first title that was successfully released by battlefront com it would be a perfect fit for battlefronts lineup of superior war and strategy games
1730669 1cs dedication and love for even small details was apparent in the first game already and the sequel is even more ambitious were thrilled to be part of the ride and bring this game to our fans worldwide via download as well as to stores

1730673 all the focus has been on the level one merchants the high street and multi national retailers and making sure they are compliant with pci dss

1730675 we are as likely to see attacks in the uk as the us or any wealthy western country where there is ample credit cards with a good credit limit
1730676 there is a good chance that there is a lot more insecure technology down among those low level merchants
1730677 and this is the level at which there are going to be a large number of retailers as opposed to the comparatively small number of level one retailers

1730761 our business model has been highly successful and we remain very bullish on our growth prospects as the market for natural and organic products continues to grow however the challenging economic environment appears to be negatively impacting our sales
1730762 this combined with our commitment to maintaining financial flexibility and investing prudently in our long term growth has led us to take a more conservative approach to our growth and business strategy over the short term
1730763 we believe that execution by way of a gunfire is inhumane it is for these reasons that the defense attorneys are applying to challenge the legislation

1730779 a major step forward in our commitment to become the greenest technology company on the planet and establishes our leadership position for others in the industry and all other industries across the globe
1730780 the way energy costs are they are just not sustainable so for business to be competitive in the future we need constant supplies of green energy and so we are trying to enable that everywhere we can globally
1730781 it really worries me when companies claim they have achieved carbon neutrality when its really not possible
1730782 you have to question whether they have taken all their workers commuting into consideration and the materials in making a computer going all the way back to zinc mining
1730783 carbon neutrality is a large amount of greenwash computer companies should be focusing on the developments made in recent years in the reduction of harmful material inside the computers and reduction in power computers use with these high claims companies are setting themselves up to be knocked back down again
1730784 the rocks beneath your feet have a powerful impact on resources minerals where your energy comes from the hazards that you face and last but not least climate change
1730785 there is no reason to believe this is anything other than the simple burglary of a laptop which the local police are investigating

1730793 gene doping is the next major headache for the world of sport
1730794 in 2004 people were starting to talk about its use at the athens olympics this year in beijing the case is even stronger that this will be the first genetically modified games many scientists will say its still not possible but im not taking this for granted we need to assume that its happening its already feasible
1730795 there is no other technology that is likely to change the olympics more than gene doping its not possible to detect and theres a good chance that it will never be detectable in any meaningful sense
1730796 this forces the world of sport to reconsider what it does about testing its time for their plans to change its time for the era of human enhancement to take full effect in the olympics
1730797 im tired of everyone else harping on 4 a gallon for gas

1730815 how better to showcase what we do trying to describe our interactive online learning isnt effective but
1730816 we are not only using articulate for our sales presentations but have other departments asking us to convert theirs in fact two of the departments want me to convert their annual report to the owners
1730817 we work in a very competitive market we needed something that demonstrated how we are different from other training insurance mortgage and investment providers
1730818 how many times have you been sitting in a powerpoint presentation and just zoned out everyone has seen everything powerpoint can do quite frankly many of the tools have been over used how many different text animations can one put into a single powerpoint
1730819 no two presentations are the same we customize our approach to meet the individual needs of the client or potential client articulate presenter allows us to include everything we could possibly need in one standard presentation the presenter is then able to use the navigation to select and highlight the most appropriate sections
1730820 leveraging swbcs strong relationships with insurance carriers we research the best benefits package for the client as you can imagine
1730821 because articulate is so easy to use we are able to complete projects quickly as our demand continues to increase so does our need for new innovative and effective learning and sales presentations articulate allows us to respond quickly to needs of both our internal and external clients
1730822 theres a line in the sand just below 117 if you close below that it signals traders are giving up on the bull market in oil

1730831 while we expect continued housing and economic weakness will affect our overall performance this year we continue to maintain a surplus over all regulatory capital requirements
1730832 the blm has repeatedly rejected the west slopes request to consider options that would allow the natural gas to be developed while protecting the millions of dollars local economies get every year from hunting fishing camping and other recreation
1730833 the mule deer that spend the summer on the roan migrate to the piceance basin to winter yet the blm makes no assurance that the states largest deer herd will be able to maintain itself at anything like its current abundance its too bad coloradans have to go to court to protect its wildlife heritage from this agencys mindless devotion to industrys demands

1730937 while the percentage of developers incorporating multi core processors is expected to increase going forward it remains to be seen how this technology will ultimately affect the overall commercial market for embedded software

1730948 in the studio and no offense towards jason but rob has already contributed more to this record than jason did in 14 years
1730949 its difficult to praise rob without insinuating that there was something not great about his predecessor and ive got nothing but respect and love for jason but rob hes been with us five years now and its completely effortless its never felt this complete
1730950 sometimes i look over at him and hes playing his bass onstage and it feels like hes always been there his chemistry his personality it just all fits in really really well
1730951 a lot of it did have to do with our fear of losing some kind of control no doubt about that
1730952 but rob has slipped in somehow easier he has this respect about him we didnt have to haze the fan out of him or toughen him up somehow
1730953 he is very gifted very fast and he kind of just fits in hes such a gifted musician and rob spent a lot of time being the third wheel in the lars james songwriting process and he just adapted to it super quickly and was great to bounce ideas off of and to come up with a great suggestion when me or james would get stuck he was right in there with us its been incredibly positive to have him around in the creative process the way we all connect with each other and the way we connect with our fans

1731046 if senator mccain wants to talk about how washington is broken thats a debate im happy to have because senator mccains energy plan reads like an early christmas list for oil and gas lobbyists its no wonder because many of his top advisers are former oil and gas lobbyists

1731051 the water changes so much that every time you come down its different its new water and the water flows differently
1731052 this is the most difficult artificial course in the world
1731053 even for the top guys they wouldnt feel comfortable of nailing it so theres room for the underdog to come through here
1731054 the way the course is configured you just take a lot of hits on the way down
1731055 speed and strength will be less important than good boat control
1731056 with this kind of difficulty of the course i think everybody will have mistakes i dont think theyll be a perfect run

1731066 we regret that iran has once again chosen not to answer clearly despite all the efforts the six have made these past weeks to offer a framework for negotiations
1731067 we havent set any deadlines ourselves for their response and there is ongoing dialogue
1731068 certainly there is a matter which is going to be discussed by the ministers in september

1731271 that is that the laws creating the corporation for public broadcasting and providing for federal funding have long required cpb to exercise direct objectivity and balance oversight on behalf of congress and the public its past time that the corporation began upholding its obligation
1731272 public broadcasting law prohibits pre broadcast censorship and it also assumes post broadcast reviews so that chronic violators such as npr national public radio with its israel would be put on notice and if improvement was not made future funding requests would be more closely scrutinized rep cantors reminder to cpb that it must uphold the objectivity and balance requirement is most timely

1731326 obviously im worried any parent would be but i am certain that china would not resort to torture or abuse when the eyes of the world are upon them
1731327 we are concerned for his safety but i think the fact that he has managed one small voice against the chinese propaganda machine that he will be pleased to be heard about tibet and tibetan rights
1731328 he is a remarkable individual a very considered person i am very proud of his action
1731329 skills would be useful to call for a real difference

1731342 it sounds like paris hilton supports john mccains all of the above approach to americas energy crisis including both alternatives and drilling paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1731343 the rs are o k people the wife is kind of snooty though she never talks to anyone the guy is very nice and helps me with chores and projects around the house and yard but as soon as hes done he says his cell phone is vibrating and he has to take the call he has to work a lot because that wife of his is always shopping they say the have 3 kids between them but i never see them all at one time but their grandson is there every weekend their dog barks too much and i always have to trim the branches that come over into my yard
1731344 the business manager is in charge of the allocation of funds for various events raising money and contacting organizations for donations the position is not too difficult or time consuming once one learns the logistics of how to work with our funds and spending
1731345 obamas transformation if you go by his campaign so far would mean higher income taxes higher social security taxes higher investment taxes higher corporate taxes massive new domestic spending and a healthcare plan that perhaps could be the next step to a full scale single payer system is that what most americans want someone who will fulfill a democratic policy wish list
1731346 obamas proposal would impose social security taxes on income above 250 000 per year he would continue to exempt income between 102 000 and 250 000 from social security taxes
1731347 i would roll back the bush tax cuts for those making over 250 000
1731348 sen obama wants to raise the long term capital gains rate for families making more than 250 000 to around 20 percent or somewhat higher but not above the 28 percent level it reached during the reagan presidency an obama economic adviser says the same rate would apply to most dividend income for these investors
1731349 what we ought to tax is dirty energy like coal and to a lesser extent natural gas
1731350 ntufs third round of costing out the candidates platforms since january 29 found that clinton would increase yearly federal spending by 289 6 billion compared to sen obamas d il 343 9 billion both significantly higher totals from the last update on march 3
1731351 as presidential campaign pace quickens candidates race ahead with bigger federal budget promises updated study shows
1731352 by our calculations using figures supplied by the campaigns sen hillary rodham clinton n y has proposed new spending and tax breaks that would amount to almost 265 billion a year when fully implemented while the initiatives proposed by sen barack obama ill total nearly 333 billion
1731353 frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years
1731354 barack obama says john mccains plan to balance the budget doesnt add up easy for him to say its not a goal hes even trying to reach not only does obama say he wont eliminate the deficit in his first term as mccain aims to do he frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years considering his own spending plans
1731355 both obama and clinton promised to not raise taxes on those making less than 200 000 or 250 000 a year they both just emasculated their domestic programs returning the rich to their clinton era tax rates will yield at best 40 billion a year in revenue its impossible to fund a health care plan let alone anything else with that kind of money the consequences are clear if elected they will have to break their pledge and thus destroy their credibility or run a minimalist administration
1731356 green jobs and green technology will be vital to our economic future there is no reason that the u s should not be a leader in developing and deploying these new technologies
1731357 coal produces the majority of our electricity today some believe that marketing viable clean coal technologies could be over 15 years away john mccain believes that this is too long to wait and we need to commit significant federal resources to the science research and development that advance this critical technology once commercialized the u s can then export these technologies to countries like china that are committed to using their coal creating new american jobs and allowing the u s to play a greater role in the international green economy
1731358 nuclear power is a proven zero emission source of energy and it is time we recommit to advancing our use of nuclear power currently nuclear power produces 20 of our power but the u s has not started construction on a new nuclear power plant in over 30 years china india and russia have goals of building a combined total of over 100 new plants and we should be able to do the same it is also critical that the u s be able to build the components for these plants and reactors within our country so that we are not dependent on foreign suppliers with long wait times to move forward with our nuclear plans
1731359 this reform will simplify the tax code reward activity in the u s and make us more competitive with other countries a permanent credit will provide an incentive to innovate and remove uncertainty at a time when our companies need to be more competitive we need to provide a permanent incentive to innovate and remove the uncertainty now hanging over businesses as they make r amp d investment decisions
1731360 according to the department of energy wind could provide as much as one fifth of electricity by 2030 the u s solar energy industry continued its double digit annual growth rate in 2006 to develop these and other sources of renewable energy will require that we rationalize the current patchwork of temporary tax credits that provide commercial feasibility john mccain believes in an even handed system of tax credits that will remain in place until the market transforms sufficiently to the point where renewable energy no longer merits the taxpayers dollars
1731361 300 million battery prize obama derides this as a gimmick but mccains idea for developing a radically better battery for powering a new generation of cars strikes us as smarter than more bureaucratic approaches like the x prize that helped propel the first civilian aircraft into space a reward can leverage huge private investment the idea would be better though if it focused on building radically more fuel efficient cars regardless of the technology

1731427 i pretty much taught myself to do flips on my couch
1731428 my character is kind of like the jekyll and hyde clown
1731429 so im a nerdy scientist who drinks a potion and then changes into a monster and so there are some clown gags with that
1731430 hes just got an incredible joy hes an incredible troublemaker
1731431 i love the kid i mean hes just got all that clown energy

1731433 im looking for tumblers and wire walkers and jugglers and clowns
1731434 you know it was everything i thought that all my problems were solved
1731435 i thought im a clown on the biggest circus in the world thats it thats all i have to do for the rest of my life i was so wrong
1731436 i didnt really know what to think its like ive never signed anything that big before and im like literally right out of high school too like i just graduated and then i came here
1731437 is he a great clown now no i dont think hes a great clown now
1731438 i dont live with them on the streets im not going to bunk with them here and same thing with them theyre not going to bunk with me we have different sets of rules and politics that we go by
1731439 if some guys up there at level three or level four found out that you bunked up with another i mean who knows
1731440 i dont live with them on the streets im not going to bunk with them here
1731441 and same thing with them theyre not going to bunk with me we have two different sets of rules and politics that we go by
1731442 you got a lot of people that are scarred up some dead and you want us to get along no thats not gonna happen
1731443 were very optimistic that this is going to be a good thing
1731444 and it is the right thing to do it reflects community values inmates cannot continue to just live their lives by the rules and the warped ideology of prison gangs
1731445 of course at first its not easy but you have to adjust
1731446 but i was raised to see people for who they are and not for what they are
1731447 i think in your lower level institutions you wont have as many problems because the gangs dont have as much influence
1731448 but when you get into the areas where the inmates are doing a longer term then their influence is much stronger
1731449 the mexican mafia virtually controls every aspect of prison life
1731450 they control who gets assignments to what jobs they let the prison guards know that to maintain the peace certain people should be celled with other people
1731451 when you go into the prison system youre given two sets of rules one is from the prison officials if you violate prison rules you get written up and put in isolation depending on the severity of the crime or you get more time in jail
1731452 if you break the mexican mafias rules you might be killed
1731453 you have prison gangs that are exerting enormous influence on the streets now

1731488 now two points one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent
1731489 you know they think it is funny that they are making fun of something that is actually true they need to do their homework because this is serious business instead of running ads about paris hilton and britney spears they should go talk to some energy experts and actually make a difference

1731501 be surprised when conservatives libertarians and classic liberals fail to swoon at mccains success to date
1731502 its not fundamentally flawed messaging its a fundamentally flawed candidate
1731503 those were clearly the most effective commercials the mccain campaign has put out ever
1731504 the celebrity one made a clever point the the one ad was brilliant as richard nixon who thought a lot about these things always said politicians can recover from almost anything but being laughed at

1731516 this is the best resolved calculation of the milky ways halo ever carried out with a mass resolution five to sixty times better than the previous largest computations
1731517 previously the inner regions of the halo came out smooth but now we have enough detail to see dense clumps of dark matter
1731518 for the first time a numerical simulation is now able to study the dark matter makeup of a typical galaxy down to mass scales of a thousand solar masses instead of a few hundred thousand as before
1731519 this is equivalent to taking a picture of a cricket stadium and finally being able to see individual grass leaves instead of just patches of green
1731520 and imagine the timing just as searches are pushing the limits of our conception of dark matter
1731521 it will take some time to fully resolve our challenges

1731534 church assembles for public worship these two titles both names of the places for public worship in the old testament say that the church is the divinely appointed locale for public worship in this era
1731535 set apart for me barnabas and saul for the work to which i have called them
1731536 to worship is to feel in the heart and express in some appropriate manner a humbling but delightful sense of admiring awe and astonished wonder and overwhelming love in the presence of that most ancient mystery that unspeakable majesty which philosophers have called the
1731537 we know that god wants this element as part of public worship
1731538 the rule of this knowledge faith and obedience concerning the worship and service of god and all other christian duties is not mans inventions opinions devices laws constitutions or traditions unwritten whatsoever but only the word of god contained in the canonical scriptures
1731539 up make us gods who shall go before us as for this moses the man who brought us up out of the land of egypt we do not know what has become of him
1731540 take off the rings of gold that are in the ears of your wives your sons and your daughters and bring them to me
1731541 these are your gods o israel who brought you up out of the land of egypt
1731542 these are this is elohim o israel who brought you up out of the land of egypt
1731543 turned aside quickly from the way that the lord had commanded them
1731544 this is what the lord has said among those who are near me i will be sanctified and before all the people i will be glorified
1731545 making every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification
1731546 each one should be fully convinced in his own mind
1731547 the man who has doubts is condemned if he eats because his eating is not from faith and everything that does not come from faith is sin
1731548 in worship the church is forbidden to add rites and ceremonies to those found in the bible because the conscience is to be free of human requirements
1731549 reformed theologians argue that the whole substance of worship must be biblical not that only words from the bible can be used but that all that is done and said in worship is in accordance with sound biblical theology the content of each component must convey gods truth as revealed in his word
1731550 as for the form of the elements there will be some variations different prayers will be prayed different songs sung different scriptures read and preached the components of worship rearranged from time to time the occasional elements like the sacraments oaths and vows performed at various chosen times and the like
1731551 finally as to circumstances whether we sit or stand have pews or chairs meet in a church building or storefront sing from a hymnal or from memory what time on the lords day services are to be held and more these things must be decided upon in the absence of specific biblical direction and hence they must be done as with the case of the forms above in accordance with the light of nature and christian prudence according to the general rules of the word westminster confession of faith 1
1731552 this must be spiritually significant to you because god has prescribed it for public worship in the church
1731553 now accept the one who is weak in faith but not for the purpose of passing judgment on his opinions
1731554 if you as an individual are convinced for some reason that you should observe it then you have every right to do so in your home but we cannot extend such observance to gatherings of the church where we have dozens or hundreds of individual consciences that must be convinced from the word of god that such observance is necessary
1731555 music styles in themselves are selectively chosen or rejected by the scriptures
1731556 as horrible as the fall is do we make too much of it emphasis mine by trying to guess what it is all by itself instead of talking about how god works within it and helps us overcome it even while we continue in sin
1731557 such groundwork leads him elsewhere to draw careless analogies between the created world and music then quoting best god makes things god makes them well god calls them good and god has no trouble saying that one thing may be better than another if this does not trouble god whose handiwork far outstrips ours why should it trouble us consequently there should be nothing wrong with the discovery and disclosure of the coexistence of goodness and better than ness in musical and artistic practice continuing in makujinas words here we encounter not only a perilous disregard for the doctrine of depravity but an inexcusable neglect of the creator creature distinction the result is an incongruent simile that wrongly attributes intrinsic goodness to musical styles despite their origin in the cradle of sinful humanity
1731558 to say that a particular song is neutral is like saying a particular use of a knife is neutral
1731559 music as an idea as an object is neutral like a gun of course im not for gun control that the point guns are neutral objects once they are used morality enters the picture music as an abstract idea is neutral once it is used to create a song or style of music morality enters the picture
1731560 if you disagree with harold best on this issue then we have nothing more to discuss on the issue
1731561 any creation by a human being especially a form of communication is subject to judgment because since humans are fallible and depraved their creations are subject to fallibility and depravity
1731562 just remove all bad things from my life and i will be good
1731563 let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but only that which is good to the use of edifying

1731568 in the past three decades chicago has undergone changes that are routinely described as gentrification but are in fact more complicated and more profound than the process that term suggests
1731569 demographic inversion the people who live near the center some of them black or hispanic but most of them white are those who can afford to do so
1731570 has eliminated many of the things that made affluent people want to move away from it nothing much is manufactured downtown anymore or anywhere near it and that means that the noise and grime that prevailed for most of the twentieth century have gone away
1731571 in atlanta where the middle class return to the city is occurring with more suddenness than perhaps anywhere in the united states the most frequently cited reason is traffic people who did not object to a 20 mile commute from the suburbs a decade ago are objecting to it now in part because the same commute takes quite a bit longer to this we can add the prospect of 5 per gallon gasoline
1731572 the demographic changes that have taken place in america over the past generation the increased propensity to remain single the rise of cohabitation the much later age at first marriage for those who do marry the smaller size of families for those who have children and at the other end the rapidly growing number of healthy and active adults in their sixties seventies and eighties have combined virtually all of the significant elements that make a demographic inversion not only possible but likely

1731581 people whose need to belong is threatened do not necessarily mimic the first person they see they take into account aspects of the situation and act accordingly all unconsciously
1731582 conceptualized this way automatic mimicry is certainly is a useful addition to the human behavioral repertoire
1731583 the many faces of strand customers and there are different people depicted on each side
1731584 the path of least resistance is just to chuck it
1731585 were talking about a pan of lasagna that was never served
1731586 we reduced waste and increased the amount of people being fed
1731587 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism and i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it
1731588 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a nonstory
1731589 its just silly because the way people are talking about it youd think it was a bertolucci movie or something
1731590 were just recently very recently engaged so you know were just taking it easy and no big plan yet but its a good time and were just enjoying our time to be young and engaged
1731591 i mean im 23 theres no reason to rush into it everything feels very natural and relaxed
1731592 i dont live with them on the streets im not going to bunk with them here and same thing with them theyre not going to bunk with me we have different sets of rules and politics that we go by
1731593 if some guys up there at level three or level four found out that you bunked up with another i mean who knows
1731594 i dont live with them on the streets im not going to bunk with them here
1731595 and same thing with them theyre not going to bunk with me we have two different sets of rules and politics that we go by
1731596 you got a lot of people that are scarred up some dead and you want us to get along no thats not gonna happen
1731597 were very optimistic that this is going to be a good thing
1731598 and it is the right thing to do it reflects community values inmates cannot continue to just live their lives by the rules and the warped ideology of prison gangs
1731599 of course at first its not easy but you have to adjust
1731600 but i was raised to see people for who they are and not for what they are
1731601 i think in your lower level institutions you wont have as many problems because the gangs dont have as much influence
1731602 but when you get into the areas where the inmates are doing a longer term then their influence is much stronger
1731603 the mexican mafia virtually controls every aspect of prison life
1731604 they control who gets assignments to what jobs they let the prison guards know that to maintain the peace certain people should be celled with other people
1731605 when you go into the prison system youre given two sets of rules one is from the prison officials if you violate prison rules you get written up and put in isolation depending on the severity of the crime or you get more time in jail
1731606 if you break the mexican mafias rules you might be killed
1731607 you have prison gangs that are exerting enormous influence on the streets now
1731608 the highly racialized prison gang culture is now starting to infect street gang culture
1731609 this is a corrections system that cant even deliver health care
1731610 this is a corrections system that is on the verge of catastrophic failure to the point that a panel of federal judges is considering taking it over entirely
1731611 i think once it gets started and inmates see that this isnt bad at all man theyll like it theyre so used to being isolated thats what they know
1731612 he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills
1731613 indeed when i come to the children of israel and say to them the god of your fathers has sent me to you and they say to me what is his name what shall i say to them
1731614 thus you shall say to the children of israel i am has sent me to you
1731615 pride indeed is the cardinal vice it swings open the door to most of the other theological vices and undermines the classical virtues of prudence courage and justice it thrives not on what one has but on what others do not have and even when one has diligently practiced the most admirable virtues there always lurks the danger that at some moment one will look in the mirror and say oh my what a wonderful person i am thus does the vice lunge from its hiding place
1731616 we didnt set out to make an nc 17 film thats just commercial suicide
1731617 they felt it was rather sexually graphic my point is it was comically graphic all the sex in the movie with the exception of one scene is very cartoonish very campy
1731618 anybody not inclined to see a movie with porno in the title is not going to see it so it kind of regulates itself to a degree
1731619 and anybody who is going is not going to be surprised by what they see

1731627 ive been reading some of the comments on other blogs about this with a mounting sense of wonder at the sheer naivete of some users for anything that is important firstly always plan for redundancy in your systems have an online and on computer service that are synched secondly do frequent backups to a 3rd source thirdly if its important pay for it ad funded services are responsive to the advertisers not to the users its that pipers tune thing

1731631 as a group i think this is the strongest weve had
1731632 theyre all sweet kids too theyre all humble they want to learn theres no dont tell me attitude
1731633 i think you have to stay true to yourself i think america knows when someone is fake and i told myself that im going to be myself and you have to be able to adapt to any dance style even in the auditions they would put on any kind of music they didnt care if you were a hip hop dancer a contemporary dancer a jazz dancer or a folk dancer whatever music they put on you have to adapt
1731634 im definitely not the best dancer but i dont think the competition is about the best dancer i think the competition is about growth for people who love the show i think the greatest thing is when they see someone grow from beginning to end i think over the past few weeks ive changed not only as a person but as a dancer
1731635 courtney has such a simple pleasing charisma about her when she smiles she lights up the stage and for such a small girl she really dances big thats what youve got to do youve got to forget the size of people and just think goodness me they cover an entire stage courtney manages to do that
1731636 to never deny how incredible the human body is the human body has some reserve in it that you dont even know about never doubt the body because it can take you through but you have to listen to it
1731637 i really enjoyed the viennese waltz i loved broadway and contemporary ive found a love for every style on the show because i see how the choreographers light up when they do it the toughest the smooth waltz anything with smooth in front of it that is the toughest for me because that means youve got to take it easy youve got to be kind of fred astaire with it
1731638 twitch is incredible with his humor he uses it brilliantly its how he uses his smile he even uses props for laughs the spectacles the gold teeth his musicality is outstanding when he does his own solos hes had little to no training but hes got himself in the top four which i dont think has ever happened before
1731639 i was praying and hoping that id make it this far but we take it day to day every day you try to do your best and hope youre here next week as opposed to thinking i want to win this you just want to stay here for the experience as long as you possibly can everybody would love to say im americas favorite dancer but at the same time being in the final four or just being on the show period has been such a growing thing
1731640 my dance style is emotional maybe if i could say that
1731641 katee has such a wonderful technique and she has the charisma she lights up the stage too her eyes bring you in and theres just a glow when she smiles and shes grown as well
1731642 when me and katee did bollywood thats never been done on the show either people were going to love it or they were going to hate it so thank god everybody loved it and it was a success toughest west coast swing and choreographer mia michaels talk about getting pushed to the limit she doesnt accept anything other than your best and more i already knew it was going to be like that when you go into her class but when you come out youre so much better as a dancer and your performance nine times out of 10 is going to be gold
1731643 whats so crazy is that on the show youre seeing me cry but back home im so not a crier but to be here to be living my dream is so overwhelming im so thankful that im here thats why you see me cry a lot hip hop dancers i dont think theyve gotten this far so its cool that ive gotten here

1731663 smartphones are still seeing growth rates hovering around 40 0 year over year while the rest of the industry is growing at roughly 10 0
1731664 however grouping the rest of the handsets into one category is doing the industry no justice the rise of the feature phone has created a battle at the high end of the market with the main difference between smartphone and feature phone being the high level operating system we expect the competition at the high end will help drive growth within the market and help move volume to higher end devices

1731668 utterly fascinating fans of kay scarpetta will be equally captivated by sex therapist morgan snow whose job has her too often confronting the dark side of human nature
1731669 no one writes so simply and superbly about such lush things as food and sex as m j rose and at the same time gets deep inside the heart and mind of a wonderfully complicated heroine literate and page turning
1731670 intensely erotic and compelling flesh tones explores the disturbing realm that lies between love and obsession
1731671 m j rose blends the dark eroticism of anais nin with the lusty cravings of erica jong and delivers a refreshingly open look at a modern womans sexual coming of age
1731672 creationism is not for the re class because i believe that it can stand scientific scrutiny and that is a debate which i am quite happy to encourage and be part of
1731673 the issue for the current education minister caitriona ruane is that she tells us shes all for equality surely if that is the case you cant have one set of interpretations being taught at the expense of others
1731674 so if there are those from the scientific community who believe in creationism who can give a view about how the world came into existence then it cant be set aside you cant have one very narrow theory
1731675 this is not about removing anything from the classroom although that would probably be the ideal for me but this is about us having equality of access to other views as to how the world came into existence and that i think is a very very important issue for many parents in northern ireland
1731676 i have no objection to all kinds of daft ideas being taught in comparative religion classes but in science what we should teach is what there is evidence for and children should be encouraged to examine evidence
1731677 if this politician mr storey wants to import creationism into science classes im wondering which kind of creationism hindu creationism jewish creationism babylonian creationism aztec creationism
1731678 my guess is that it is probably genesis creationism and theres absolutely no reason for it
1731679 we live in a democracy and anyone can get elected
1731680 i think its sad that people with ridiculous views do get elected because it suggests that the electorate is not sufficiently well educated to see through them
1731681 i would hope that a flat earther would not be elected and would not be serving as an important official in educational circles exactly the same would be true of at least a young earth creationist
1731682 it concerns me as a scientist and i think that you would find that it would concern any churchman of any education either a bishop of the roman catholic church of a bishop of the anglican church
1731683 i would be very concerned about scientific falsehoods being purveyed in the name of religion
1731684 im quite happy to take criticism from mr dawkins and be castigated by him
1731685 evolution is a theory it is not a proven fact and we are quite happy to allow our views to be subject to scientific scrutiny just the same as his views are subject to scientific scrutiny
1731686 so far as i can remember there is not one word in the gospels in praise of intelligence
1731687 i say quite deliberately that the christian religion as organized in its churches has been and still is the principal enemy of moral progress in the world
1731688 i have examined all the known superstitions of the world and i do not find in our particular superstition of christianity one redeeming feature they are all alike founded on fables and mythology
1731689 it may be that brain hardware has co evolved with the internal virtual worlds that it creates this can be called hardware software co evolution
1731690 i dont live with them on the streets im not going to bunk with them here and same thing with them theyre not going to bunk with me we have different sets of rules and politics that we go by
1731691 if some guys up there at level three or level four found out that you bunked up with another i mean who knows
1731692 i dont live with them on the streets im not going to bunk with them here
1731693 and same thing with them theyre not going to bunk with me we have two different sets of rules and politics that we go by
1731694 you got a lot of people that are scarred up some dead and you want us to get along no thats not gonna happen
1731695 were very optimistic that this is going to be a good thing
1731696 and it is the right thing to do it reflects community values inmates cannot continue to just live their lives by the rules and the warped ideology of prison gangs
1731697 of course at first its not easy but you have to adjust
1731698 but i was raised to see people for who they are and not for what they are
1731699 i think in your lower level institutions you wont have as many problems because the gangs dont have as much influence
1731700 but when you get into the areas where the inmates are doing a longer term then their influence is much stronger
1731701 the mexican mafia virtually controls every aspect of prison life
1731702 they control who gets assignments to what jobs they let the prison guards know that to maintain the peace certain people should be celled with other people
1731703 when you go into the prison system youre given two sets of rules one is from the prison officials if you violate prison rules you get written up and put in isolation depending on the severity of the crime or you get more time in jail
1731704 if you break the mexican mafias rules you might be killed
1731705 you have prison gangs that are exerting enormous influence on the streets now
1731706 the highly racialized prison gang culture is now starting to infect street gang culture
1731707 this is a corrections system that cant even deliver health care
1731708 this is a corrections system that is on the verge of catastrophic failure to the point that a panel of federal judges is considering taking it over entirely
1731709 i think once it gets started and inmates see that this isnt bad at all man theyll like it theyre so used to being isolated thats what they know

1731750 het boek klimaatactivist in de politiek heb ik geschreven vanuit grote zorg om de klimaatverandering en het gebrek aan politieke actie om daar tegen op te treden in het boek analyseer ik ook welke maatschappelijke beweging er nodig is om tot een afdoende aanpak te komen ik blik daarbij ook terug op mijn eigen actieverleden en leg daarover uitgebreid verantwoording af ik vind dat ook de plicht van een politicus ik heb dat ook al eerder op verschillende manieren gedaan ik trek in het boek uitgebreid lering uit acties waar ik eerder aan heb meegedaan zoals de inbraak bij het ministerie van ez ik beschrijf daarbij waarom ik tot het inzicht ben gekomen dat acties zich moeten richten op de parlementaire besluitvorming en binnen de grenzen van de wet moeten blijven daarmee neem ik afstand van de actiemiddelen van 23 jaar geleden en spreek daarover een negatief oordeel uit ik geef aan waarom ik heb gekozen voor de parlementaire politiek om de klimaatcrisis aan te pakken de keuzes die ik twintig jaar geleden maakte zijn op geen enkele manier meer de keuzes die ik nu zou maken willen we de klimaatcrisis effectief aanpakken dat zijn politici met lef nodig die de noodzakelijke maatregelen nemen en is er een zeer brede en open maatschappelijke beweging onontbeerlijk waar zeer zeer velen zich in herkennen en aan kunnen bijdragen

1731754 this study demonstrates how remedial instruction can use the plasticity of the human brain to gain an educational improvement
1731755 focused instruction can help underperforming brain areas to increase their proficiency
1731756 any kind of education is a matter of training the brain when poor readers are learning to read a particular brain area is not performing as well as it might and remedial instruction helps to shape that area up
1731757 this finding shows that poor readers can be helped to develop buff brains a similar approach should apply to other skills
1731758 we are at the beginning of a new era of neuro education
1731759 as adults early maturing girls demonstrate lower academic and occupational achievement and report lower relationship quality and life satisfaction
1731760 it is thus important to identify protective factors that may mitigate negative effects of early maturation on girls adjustment
1731761 also early maturation only predicted physical aggression when combined with low maternal nurturance
1731762 parental nurturance may decrease girls susceptibility to negative peer influence
1731763 also parental nurturance may help girls cope with challenges associated with early puberty by listening to their daughters difficulties and providing support and encouragement nurturing parents can help them develop better coping skills and diffuse negative emotions that might otherwise manifest as aggression
1731764 by discussing difficult peer situations e g provocation peer pressure and ways of dealing with them parents may help their daughters develop a repertoire of adaptive responses that will minimize the need for inappropriate i e aggressive behavior
1731765 in addition knowing how their daughters spend free time may help parents identify and prevent negative peer and other influences
1731766 helping parents develop positive parenting skills may help early maturing girls to grow into healthy well adjusted adolescents and adults

1731769 there were fifteen of us when we got together and now just over ten years later there are only three of us still alive
1731770 transgender people are at particular risk to hiv as they face stigma discrimination verbal and physical abuse on a daily basis they are often forced out of home at an early age and many turn to sex work to survive
1731771 we need focused research studies to include transgender people in the design and implementation such as was done by the national aids programme in argentina and acknowledge transgender people as having their own identity
1731772 humans seem to be wired to look to faces to understand the persons intentions

1731820 as we search for ways to identify alzheimers early these mri studies shows that researchers are moving closer to accurate early detection of the disease and that we may soon be able to use this technology to determine who is at greater risk
1731821 these studies reinforce the need for increased awareness and education about the importance of living a brain healthy lifestyle including staying physically active
1731822 growing evidence shows that physical exercise does not have to be strenuous or require a major time commitment it is most effective when done regularly and in combination with a brain healthy diet mental activity and social interaction
1731823 the style of communication that we use with people with alzheimers influences how they feel about themselves and how well they respond to those providing care
1731824 with the growing prevalence of alzheimers it will be increasingly important for healthcare providers caregivers and families to understand the effect alzheimers has on communication and perhaps more importantly the impact their communication may have on the individuals quality of life
1731825 we cant leave any stone unturned if we hope to aid the 5 million people currently living with alzheimers and the millions more that will be devastated by this epidemic
1731826 we may not be able to do anything about aging genetics or family history but research shows us that there are lifestyle decisions we all can make to keep our brains healthier as we age and that also may lower our risk of developing alzheimers disease

1731862 jrs designs aim to create a standardized brand identity for bethpage federal credit unions branches
1731863 in order to take full advantage of the high visibility corner and the angles of the site we skewed from the traditional branch layout
1731864 as part of an aggressive growth strategy and to better serve our membership we desired to open new branches within communities where our members live and work
1731865 we wanted to implement a standardized design plan that was functional inviting and aesthetically pleasing and jrs understood this
1731866 our base design has remained constant since 2004 and whether it was a build out of a storefront shell renovation of an existing branch or new construction the jrs team has been professional dependable and creative
1731867 members have commented positively on the selection of colors and materials and the manner in which they were used

1731886 while british attitudes are more egalitarian than in the 1980s there are signs that support for gender equality may have hit a high point some time during the 1990s
1731887 when it comes to the clash between work and family life doubts about whether a woman should be doing both are starting to creep in
1731888 attempts to shoehorn women into workplaces made by men for men have failed
1731889 women still shoulder the bulk of caring and housework at home the long working hours culture and lack of flexible working means women are presented with impossible choices forced to choose between caring for a family at home or maximising their career opportunities the result motherhood carries a penalty and women and men are straitjacketed by gender stereotypes
1731890 many mothers tell us that in the first year of a babys life they want to stay at home but often feel they have to return to work too early because of financial constraints we need to do more to help mothers and fathers by increasing well paid parental leave and changing how it can be shared between them
1731891 the results are even more extreme in the us where the percentage of people arguing that family life does not suffer if a woman works has plummeted from 51 in 1994 to 38 in 2002
1731892 the notion that there has been a steady increase in favour of women taking an equal role in the workplace and away from their traditional role in the home is clearly a myth
1731893 instead there is clear evidence that womens changing role is viewed as having costs both for the woman and the family
1731894 it is conceivable that opinions are shifting as the shine of the super mum syndrome wears off and the idea of women juggling high powered careers while also baking cookies and reading bedtime stories is increasingly seen to be unrealisable by ordinary mortals
1731895 in britain and the us however where support for equal opportunities for both sexes is much longer standing some people are now starting to have second thoughts
1731896 in most cases this appears to revolve around concerns that the welfare of children and of the family are being compromised the more women spend their time at work and find themselves lumbered with the double burden of employment and family care
1731897 we are still educating to confirm a gender role division that people thought was eradicated 25 years ago
1731898 at the moment in the uk we are heading in the wrong direction after a period when there was greater support at an ideological level for an equal division of labour
1731899 if we are to make progress in devising policies that encourage equal working opportunities for women we need to know more about what gender roles people view as practical as possible and as fair
1731900 by making all roles flexible at every level ending the long working hours culture and challenging discriminatory attitudes women and men could participate in the workplace on an equal footing and live free from stereotypes about whose role it is to do the caring
1731901 when this happens business the economy and society as a whole will all reap the benefits
1731902 the british economy cannot afford not to have women in the workforce women make up 45 of employees in an age when we have significant skill shortages we cannot miss out on any part of the talent pool
1731903 our latest research shows 79 of organisations are struggling to recruit and 75 are struggling to retain skills they have to think how to address the need for more flexibility for women and men
1731904 a family does not suffer if a woman is in full time employment
1731905 it is the husbands job to earn income and the wifes to look after the children

1731931 by giving everyone both a communications and delivery platform might the internet break up mass media into fragmented media finally giving us only the news that we as individuals want news that reflects our worldviews our interests our parochial concerns our preferences and our tastes
1731932 however if you want a crowd to read your writing be sure youre writing something worth reading and as much as you can cut out the fat dont distract your reader so much that they miss the point of your message
1731933 it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming but who does actually strive to do the deeds who knows great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat

1731935 web 2 0 of them to allow user generated content to accompany the work of their journalists however the general opinion of the blogosphere seems to be divided about the decision
1731936 however giving reader comments such a prominent position is dangerous readers of news sites and blogs go to those specific destinations to read news in the voice they expect not to see a public argument from commenters i would applaud an expansion of new york times comments beyond blogs to general news stories i think commenting is great it gives readers an outlet for instant response and keeps writers honest but publishing comments on the main page especially so prominently under the main story seems like a bad idea what do you think leave your thoughts in the comments below we wont publish them on the main page though
1731937 when they start giving corrections the same placement and prominence as the story that contained the error then they will be transparent and conversational they are still burying corrections at the bottom of the story in the archive a day or two after it was originally published they have a long way to go before they have fully embraced the ethos of the blogosphere

1732057 en el microan lisis orientado al diagrama el poder no es inmediatamente productor sino del orden
1732058 creo en este sentido que deleuze va m s lejos que foucault al retener para el estudio del poder al nivel de sus efectos el concepto de represi n en la medida en que los microdispositivos son principios de organizaci n de territorializaci n de ah que desarrolle todo otro lenguaje sobre el cuerpo sin rganos y el campo de inmanencia del deseo l neas de fuga articulaciones etc

1732157 its just always been that when things go faster and get crazy and im calling my own plays things seem to work better for me
1732158 i think 38 years plus in education is plenty of time doing this
1732159 ive decided to go out on top of my game
1732160 i have seen both ends in the inner city schools in a challenging environment and working in the suburbs
1732161 its easy to improve things when its so awful but coming to the suburbs where things are really good was a challenge its a much greater challenge trying to go from good to great than from bad to good
1732162 it has been a great group of people to work with

1732178 but it certainly is not rehabilitation by any stretch of the imagination and it is not re naturalization which is a term they use and im not really sure what that means but it is cleanup i would describe it as cosmetic cleanup theyre taking out the trash
1732179 theyre covering their compost pits with a little bit of soil which could attract bears
1732180 theyve covered up slit trenches without really cleaning anything theyve covered up fire pits with branches and trunks of trees these folks interchangeably use cleanup and rehab and they like to use rehab but based on what im seeing its not rehab
1732181 i was told they put watermelon rinds underneath and put soil on top and then placed pine needles and lodgepole pines on top and placed on top of that dead and downed materials like needles and pine cones from the forest
1732182 the basic procedure is to break it up and re level the area and if necessary you seed it but the new seeds dont take until the rains come
1732183 the duff retains moisture and is full of local seeds and it prevents the ground underneath from drying out and it also helps it blend into the landscape
1732184 its just like mulching your garden the natural mulch is the forest litter under the tree canopy
1732185 its not a native plant but it outcompetes the plants that are native and we want to manage the forest for native plants
1732186 weve found over the years that foot traffic doesnt really have a deep impact
1732187 it doesnt harm the roots only the grass its a superficial impact that looks usually worse than it is as soon as it starts raining you will see regrowth
1732188 as far as im concerned theyre really good abut picking up trash
1732189 but those big pits and some of the structures they built i dont see how theyd be able to return those areas back to the way they were i saw about five or six pits for drum circles and lots and lots of campfire rings

1732194 some of these films are clearly an old fogys idea of what the kids were into at the time but even those movies have the sense of capturing this incredible moment as it was happening
1732195 the real story of the riots is closer to chinatown than katzmans movie
1732196 but riot re creates what was going on in the clubs with amazing fidelity and its the best footage we have of bands like the chocolate watchband who turned garage rock into psychedelic music i actually think that exploitation movies were particularly well suited to documenting the sunset strips heyday their primal intensity matches the rawness of what was going on
1732197 plus youve got all these heavy hitters in it lsd guru richard alpert folksinger bobby jameson body painter sheryl carson the zapruder footage of psychedelica is vito paulekas and the l a freaks dancing at monterey pop and theyre all over this we wanted the program to be an easy vectorscope to how that moment really looked and felt i mean some of these movies were most definitely exploitation now theyre artifacts
1732198 later after learning about the zulus of south africa who fought
1732199 i took off my government uniform and put on the uniform of the ghetto brothers and went about protecting our community
1732200 with struggles being waged by black people in the areas of education housing employment and many others it was only a matter of time before afro american athletes shed their fantasies and delusions and asserted their manhood and faced the facts of their existence
1732201 a lot of the black athletes thought that winning olympic medals would supersede or protect them from racism but even if you won a medal it aint going to save your momma from the effects of racism it aint going to save your sister

1732204 we decided to create a new committee which will negotiate an agreement for the elections with the supervision of the united nations
1732205 ive talked with some people who were as old as me and lived here their whole life and they didnt even know it happened
1732206 by dark hundreds were driving and strolling the streets looking for fields with tall grass or maybe even a bush
1732207 it was just kind of like everything was thrown together in a parking lot
1732208 most of the small incidents seemed to be connected with the scanty supply of drinking water on the hot dusty fairgrounds
1732209 i know were not considered the ultimate in hippies anymore
1732210 even the cops on stage were grinning and ad libbing a moderate version of the boogaloo
1732211 i was so tired at the end of the first day that i dont even remember anything the second day i just know i was there
1732212 for all the acid heads who had stayed up all night
1732213 one whole side of fence came down and i just rushed in with a bunch of people
1732214 we got a little too much sun a little too much other things
1732215 fell off the stage danced with a half dozen teenyboppers set off smoke bombs poured beer over his head smashed the instruments almost anything to divert attention presumably from the lack of quality of his music
1732216 to say that we would not like it back here would be the understatement of the year
1732217 but i feel there must be a place where people can blow off steam whether it be a football game at the coliseum or a pop festival in costa mesa
1732218 that era right there the newport pop festival really shaped who i became as a musician
1732219 thats how important that event was to me i wanted to be a musician but after i knew that was the life for me

1732233 you have previously said tower blocks must fit into the local context and will not be allowed in inappropriate locations you criticised the previous mayors love affair with high rise buildings which you said were wrecking londons skyline you have also pledged to protect local shops and independent traders we look to you now not to go back on your word
1732234 i got this sinking feeling and then the phone rings and its the chinese consulate saying that your visa has been revoked

1732236 my role over there was to provide support for all the team darfur athletes
1732237 i dont know what kind of support i can offer them here
1732238 this is one small example of a much broader effort by the chinese government to pressure athletes to keep quiet on any sort of issue to muzzle athletes whose only purpose is to help the people of darfur
1732239 it looks like the chinese government has been making a systematic global effort to keep athletes from saying anything at all

1732258 during the second quarter our total pv module shipments increased significantly largely as a result of improvements in throughput and operational efficiency at the existing facilities attributable to our r amp d efforts carried out at each stage along our vertically integrated manufacturing process the production of thinner 180 micron wafers throughout the quarter higher yields resulting from reduced breakage rates and higher cell conversion efficiency rates
1732259 as of today substantially all of our estimated production output in the second half of 2008 has been contractually secured
1732260 on the polysilicon procurement side in addition to our four long term contracts with wacker the new supply agreements with dc chemical and sailing demonstrate our collaborative relationships with existing suppliers and our ability to attract new partners
1732261 as a result of our strong momentum stated above we feel comfortable raising our expected pv module shipments and net revenue targets for the full year 2008

1732270 its a process we got the job done tonight weve been facing different situations throughout this whole 5 game exhibition series we have had to play differently which is great for us we needed games like these well be fine
1732271 they did it was a low scoring game and we held them down to seventy something points the third quarter we were adjusting switching the game was different for us tonight but we still won by double digits
1732272 well australia played us very well we were not shooting well and their defense took away a lot of driving areas they got really hot shooting in the second half to put a lot of game pressure on our guys and i thought our guys handled it well on a night where from the free throw line or from the 3 point things were not easy for us
1732273 were still in the process of getting prepared for the olympics weve played four games in six days and we gave them off yesterday just because were trying to pace ourselves probably that lack of practice had a little bit of an impact on our performance i didnt think we were as sharp as we have been and the three days that we can have practice in beijing have to be three good practice days in order to get us going weve been playing outstanding basketball and tonight i didnt think we played very well or not up to what we can play
1732274 australia played well our defense wasnt crisp early on they knocked down their shots and really made us work for the game it was actually a good game for us and we knew from the jump that theyd come out really physical you can make whatever you want from it were still growing well get better as each game goes on

1732280 new mccain campaign video about how media is in love with obama reminds me of those web videos the boys put out about their ex girlfriends 12 08 pm july 22 2008
1732281 ive carried a notebook in my back pocket since college and a lot of what went into those notebooks now goes on twitter if its less than 140 characters
1732282 it wouldnt be so much that you would shift your energies to twitter it would be part of what you do both for pushing out word of what youre doing and what youre reporting on and for following developments that you can develop into stories
1732283 i believe it is important for political parties to try to maintain the highest political standards so voters can have faith in the integrity of our system
1732284 so if chairman rivera believes jack davis broke the law i applaud him for coming forward but if he really believes in honesty and integrity he will return the tens of thousands of dollars he has taken from the man he now describes as a lawbreaker
1732285 is what wojtaszek saying is that hed keep his mouth shut if someone paid him enough money even if he knew they did something illegal
1732286 once again jack davis has shown he lacks the judgment to represent us in congress
1732287 the voters of the 26th district are sick of washingtons fraud and bribery they deserve a congressman they can be proud of
1732288 who appointed you god with absolute knowledge of what the future holds
1732289 well im sure you could find subjects of disagreement with anyone
1732290 there is no chance that electing obama will stop the cancer
1732291 and yes some hope is likely to be better than no hope depending on how we define hope and what the result of relative levels of hopefulness is likely to be
1732292 weve got to get the job done there and that requires us to have enough troops so that were not just air raiding villages and killing civilians which is causing enormous pressure over there
1732293 in our opinion a maid rite diner restaurant in midland would be very successful because of the citys growing population of approximately 102 073 residents plus the students and faculty at midland college along with the traffic off of interstate 20 and midlands booming oil industry the entire community would enjoy our famous sandwiches thick blue bunny malts amp shakes and our home made pies
1732294 we immediately hired a third party forensics team to look through our entire network as well as the computer system in that restaurant
1732295 and we immediately shut down any wireless in that restaurant
1732296 this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results
1732297 consumers companies and governments from around the world must further develop ways to protect our sensitive personal and business information and detect those whether here or abroad that conspire to exploit technology for criminal gain
1732298 we are pci compliant none of the credit card information is stored in our restaurant terminal
1732299 people are hacking internet explorer every day and if i did the same thing on ie people would just say its just another ie vulnerability
1732300 the basic thing that jinx implements is that it will download files from your computer and send it to a remote web site
1732301 i got bored with it so i made it into a bot and interactive so i can manage multiple jinx instances
1732302 we end up having a complete framework all in javascript in the browser without code injection or virtualization its just you firefox and us
1732303 i would say that if i would have the target and the time im pretty sure its portable and that this could work on any other browser that has ajax support
1732304 my concern is that firefox 2 is still in use and even though the same functionality isnt in firefox 3 anything that could potentially hurt our users is a concern
1732305 it would have been great if they contacted us before hand before they released the information so we could evaluate it and see how it might affect our users
1732306 giving us the opportunity to protect our users before its available to attackers is always preferable
1732307 when we started the first 100 fans promotion we were stunned when someone arrived 18 hours in advance and asked where he could wait in line

1732309 were excited about this new design which will enable us to better meet our customers needs in areas where property is limited
1732310 buckhead is an ideal market to continue this concept in atlanta based on area demographics and our strong brand awareness in our hometown
1732311 since its first chain restaurant opened more than 40 years ago chick fil a has become synonymous with freshly prepared food and my pleasure customer service
1732312 my team and i are eager to continue that legacy at buckheads newest location
1732313 as we continue to reshape time warner well increasingly focus on our goal to create and manage high quality branded content across multiple platforms around the world at the highest returns possible for our stockholders
1732314 we have the necessary flexibility to do something strategic with either of these businesses today
1732315 the general reason why we think it will improve is that we look at usage as a leading indicator
1732316 when we started the first 100 fans promotion we were stunned when someone arrived 18 hours in advance and asked where he could wait in line

1732338 the arbys brand stands for high quality products which has resulted in higher check average relative to our competitors during the second quarter we did not waiver from this long established cut above brand positioning and results were negatively impacted by the effect of aggressive competitor discounting looking ahead we believe continued competitor discounting at the current level is unsustainable given rising commodity costs and increasing profitability pressure on operators we are already seeing reports of competitors re evaluating the prices of their value menus our plan in the near term is to be opportunistic by offering more value oriented products supported by national advertising longer term we believe arbys will remain well positioned to deliver superior results due to our unique brand attributes loyal customers supportive franchisee base and strong operations centric business model
1732339 the combination of wendys and arbys continues to represent a major strategic opportunity to create significant long term value for the shareholders of both triarc and wendys we are focused on developing a comprehensive integration plan and organizational structure that supports enhanced operating performance at both brands as i prepare to assume my chief executive responsibilities at wendys post merger i am especially excited about the recent appointments of david karam a long time wendys franchisee to president of wendys steve farrar wendys current chief of north american operations to chief operating officer and ken calwell formerly with dominos pizza who will re join wendys as chief marketing officer all of which are effective upon the closing of the merger the addition of these high caliber and well respected restaurant executives to key leadership roles at wendys marks an important first step toward improving wendys performance and achieving our growth objectives we remain on track to close the merger in the second half of 2008 and look forward to sharing more details on the integration process at that time

1732398 you think that everyone outside yourself demands your sacrifice but you do not see that only you demand sacrifice and only of yourself yet the demand of sacrifice is so savage and so fearful that you cannot accept it where it is the real price of not accepting this has been so great that you have given god away rather than look at it for if god would demand total sacrifice of you it seems safer to project him outward and away from you and not be host to him to him you ascribed the egos treachery inviting it to take his place to protect you from him

1732728 im glad my husband has a life and interests and its why i fell in love with him over the past year ive lost my life almost entirely beyond making sure this baby is healthy and happy
1732729 my spouse sits in the living room on his laptop ignoring the family
1732730 niemand kann sich vorstellen wie das ist alles zu verlieren
1732731 its a lesson everyone who wants a piece of the action at the olympics figures out its sead dizdarevics world the rest of us are just guests
1732732 since sarajevo dizdarevic has perfected the art of what he delicately calls the advanced royalty paying off olympic pooh bahs for the ultimate service monopoly on the ultimate destination event
1732733 by the mid 80s separate floors in hotels offended many women who were traveling on business
1732734 they were trying to be c e o s but were looked on as the weaker sex womens floors became a kind of sexist thing instead of a polite offer
1732735 obviously what i show the public is my positive side but this isnt the flu its cancer
1732736 when i have downtime days when theres not much going on its on my mind constantly i cant help that thats how its going to be when im behind those blocks theres nothing on my mind except racing its just me and the pool
1732737 i wasnt feeling ill but i discovered what i thought was a potential lump so i went to the family doctor an initial scan showed nothing but the ultrasound did so i was referred to a specialist who dropped the bomb
1732738 its one of those days that im never going to forget my immediate reaction was to go numb then i got angry i asked myself why is this happening to me why now to be honest with you i wanted to reach over and knock the doctor out
1732739 i made an educated decision that i could compete and have surgery afterwards
1732740 my family his father was diagnosed with lung cancer last year and girlfriend are 100 behind my decision they know im not being stupid i had the last round of blood tests a week ago but theres nothing else scheduled until after the olympics because ive reached the point of no return in terms of competing
1732741 nah its been pretty easy actually a lot of the time you can put too much pressure on yourself but cancer gives me an out
1732742 no it helps me take ownership of it having cancer is nothing to be ashamed of i cant help that i was diagnosed with it i then had a decision to make about competing i made it
1732743 anyone who makes the us olympic team has a great chance to make the podium

1732794 had some thoughts which were shall we say of an alarmingly depressing nature
1732795 evidently that loss of control is a big thing for us suicide starts to seem like such an attractive option because its something we can control even if we cant control anything else in our lives

1732797 you get pretty messed up when you see people burning and cant do anything about it

1732804 with the fearful strain that is on me night and day if i did not laugh i should die

1732895 since 2001 al qaeda has conducted a greater number of attacks across a larger geographic area than at any time in its history
1732896 we find it hard to agree that al qaeda has been significantly weakened since sept 11 2001
1732897 increasing intelligence collection and partnerships with law enforcement agencies around the world
1732898 groups whose attacks on civilian targets outnumber attacks on military targets systematically fail to achieve their policy objectives in part because they fail to communicate their policy objectives well
1732899 focus on minimizing overt military action and increasing intelligence collection and partnerships with law enforcement agencies around the world
1732900 the war against al qaeda in iraq has been won
1732901 in the end the iraq war has been won not by the sheer muscle of of our force but by the indirect methods used in helping the awakening among the sunni arabs
1732902 yes you got to hold out being tortured and raped for just 20 more years then it will all get better

1732904 as you may know not long ago a couple a hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day any day my friend
1732905 they submitted a package and we responded by submitting our own package
1732906 for more than 50 years now the policy of american statesmen has been to confront the iranian people and our people to a large sense have become acclimated with this situation and we have tried to work around it today we see new behaviour shown by the united states and the officials of the united states my question is is such behaviour rooted in a new approach in other words mutual respect cooperation and justice or this approach is a continuation in the confrontation with the iranian people but in a new guise
1732907 but if the approach changes we will be facing a new situation and the response by the iranian people will be a positive one
1732908 giving your enemy everything he wants so he doesnt attack you
1732909 how much clearer does this have to be the us does not want to resolve this issue with iran rather the us wants to keep this conflict alive as a pretext no amount of iranian concessions will therefore suffice
1732910 what is your problem why do you have to push me all the damn time i keep telling you im a busy man why do you need to force the issue

1732915 on saturday though mccain released a new television advertisement in which the announcer says that on his trip obama
1732916 it seems to me that obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
1732917 he was a 11b a light weapons infantryman for those who understand that says a lot a whole lot
1732918 it seems to me that obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
1732919 a fascinating unique love triangle evolves between sams real in the moment friendship with annie his longing to get back to maya and the fantasy of what could be
1732920 is not a time travel show we are not going back and forth between 2008 and 1973
1732921 dna evidence and all sorts of technology and here he is thrust into a world where theres a whole other kind of ethos to everything and so those stories i think will be sort of endless for us
1732922 you should lower your expectations then you will love it
1732923 i hope people know that everything i do is just about people
1732924 why does the female black widow spider eat the male after mating
1732925 you boys and girls in a state of suspended adolescence you sicken me
1732926 this is like bringing a banjo on stage after the stones play
1732927 it wont be a guest star it will be somebody who has graced your television screen on our program before
1732928 i dont think it should be seen as an artistic triumph i think it should be seen as someone who as ocd
1732929 its very hard to make things look dirty on tv we do it all the time and its extra effort
1732930 i like to make my own stuff as much as i can i dont like to page through magazines and say oh heres a corner of a room lets replicate that id rather look around and see materials from a bunch of different sources and then put that research aside and just think about stuff
1732931 occasionally i will misfire i did it just the other week
1732932 i had gone off in a direction that was too fancy for one of the sets it was simply a matter of having to paint it back down to a duller color and tear it up a little bit
1732933 right now we have a scene where need a particular kind of vehicle and whats written in a script i think didnt exist then
1732934 ill have a remembrance but ill have to go back and check research and say is this right or is this a unique thing i saw when i was young
1732935 im literally waiting for the first person to talk about how overrated it is
1732936 matt lays a lot of track like he did in season 1
1732937 and the payoffs come fast and furious as they did in season 1
1732938 you get to see what you dont get to see on most tv shows
1732939 you get to see them with these different faces and then finally you get to see them alone loneliness is part of the show because i think its part of the human condition
1732940 its sort of nefarious but its dignified theres no one going on maury povich and saying i slept with my mother and her sister secrets today are given no value because everything is exposed whereas then everything was secret and on three martinis too
1732941 a lot of the information that the audience gets right away no one else has
1732942 that was the suspense is this situation going to explode how could she not know does she know
1732943 to me the mystery and suspense on the show and almost everything on the show comes from the tension between the different people we are the different selves we are
1732944 an ambitious charismatic assistant district attorney who comes from one of miamis most politically powerful and beloved families
1732945 he and dexter set something in motion neither can pull back
1732946 hes going to own the code and become more of his own mad this season
1732947 itd be funny if i was called in for a csi case and all i did was help them solve a crime
1732948 the torchwood team has never been in this much jeopardy
1732949 executive producer michael green read the profanity spiked text messages from mcshane aloud to the crowd which responded with waves of laughter
1732950 the fact is there are echoes of what happened before with firefly so some people are worried
1732951 my response to that is first of all thanks im glad you care and also you can be worried the show could have all the support in the world from fox and still not be successful theres no guarantees in this business the fact is their support hasnt wavered but they did sort of view what id done as a little bit different from what id sold
1732952 i looked at the first pilot with a very cold eye an executives eye and said ok i know what they want that they dont have
1732953 i asked them do you want a new pilot earlier and they said no no no we just want to figure out how to make this work i said heres how youre going to make this work im going to write you a new one they were very grateful
1732954 no matter how free they feel coming and going from the dollhouse in essence they are completely tracked
1732955 we wanted a very nurturing environment and thats why we went with spa spa spa in the d cor
1732956 we wanted natural elements we wanted to do anything that would say this is not anything but a happy harmonious home dont ask any questions
1732957 coming back but may not have the ability to speak
1732958 oh is this too much hype will there be a backlash
1732959 for adrianne and jesse if you guys had to commit another crime and cover it up what would it be and could you get away with it again
1732960 i think we should start robbing stuff bonnie and clyde style
1732961 i hope landry is done with his criminal ways but i dont really know how to respond to that i would like to see just the fact that its still with him if thats subtle or whatever it is but i hope he doesnt kill anyone else that was rough
1732962 i dont want to know because if i know then ill blab it out to somebody like you
1732963 caprica follows two rival families the greystones and the adamas as they grow compete and thrive in the vibrant world of the 12 colonies enmeshed in the burgeoning technology of artificial intelligence and robotics that will eventually lead to the creation of the cylons the two houses go toe to toe
1732964 look to do this justice we probably need it to be longer than two would you be willing to do that
1732965 im not saying what hes doing there overnight let me tell you itll be by far the most provocative lady heather episode weve ever done
1732966 if a story line creatively needs grissom then hes totally willing to come back and do it
1732967 what cbs president nina tassler was really getting at when she talked about the character was that the new character has a genetic complex a number of different genes and elements that have been correlated with criminal behavior
1732968 hes an academic he has a background in clinical pathology
1732969 he decides that this might be an interesting way to explore himself he feels that if he has these genetic tendencies maybe a way to see if he has the ability to become a criminal a way to look at it is by understanding and studying violent criminals what they do and why they do it in a sense its like holding up a mirror to himself but in an exciting and interesting way its a new career thats really the angle were going with
1732970 you know we havent gotten to that level of really kind of nailing down the guy its really about a guy exploring who he is trying to use the world of solving murders and violent killers to understand his own soul
1732971 doherty will reprise her role as brenda walsh who was last seen headed to london to study acting
1732972 as previously announced jennie garth returns as kelly taylor now a west beverly guidance counselor tori spelling returns as donna martin now owner of an upscale boutique and joe e tata returns as nat owner of the peach pit
1732973 remember that one time when you were on the stoop
1732974 i was like just tell me more about the wire
1732975 its just this off network continuation of the barney legend
1732976 we have sarah booked for four episodes at the beginning of the season and possibly more and on how i met your mother you never know whats going to happen
1732977 shes great and the more we fall in love with her you never know there will be a fantastic stella arc at the beginning of the season that im ridiculously excited about and i think people will love it regardless of tasslers statement i do feel like people will not know which way were going and thats intentional and it could go either way
1732978 were hoping the show will go a while longer and its a good mystery well milk it a while longer
1732979 we have not made it clear to anyone other than ourselves quite yet who the mother is
1732980 we always talked about it ever since the episode zip zip zip which is the episode where barney and robin play laser tag and smoke cigars and all that stuff all the fans picked up on the unbelievable chemistry
1732981 that was always break glass in case of emergency story line and you know what this is now an emergency
1732982 i got an e mail from joss that said gang we broke the internet thats all it said which is awesome
1732983 we had this home baked idea that we love and were proud of
1732984 we made this on the understanding that wed never make a dime but its blown up beyond our expectations
1732985 w e were just hoping it would build over time people would start to spread the world and people would enjoy it
1732986 we didnt expect everybody to try and see it at once
1732987 once i actually downloaded jed singing the unfinished tracks i had trouble not listening to it
1732988 i listened to it all the time partly because i had to sing it partly just because i think the songs are really really catchy ive watched the three parts probably seven or eight times each and i was in it i gain nothing by doing that except i think that theyre really clever
1732989 while we were filming it i thought we were sitting on something unique and good and i know that joss cared about it enough that he wouldnt mess it up in editing or change its trajectory
1732990 joss has some strange giant master plan that includes much more than a sequel
1732991 joss thinks on a great many levels so when he was pitching it to us he said and this will take over the world and there will be sequels and musicals on stage and feature films and well get our own television network and theyll name awards after us and things like that
1732992 i think were all giggling like little schoolgirls for about a week or so then hell figure out what he wants to do next
1732993 well i would suspect that barney would be very dismissive of dr horrible
1732994 hes a bit nerdy but i think dr horrible would probably win the fight just because barney probably represents all the guys that laughed at him when he was younger and hes got a freeze ray gun so that probably gives him a leg up on his foes
1732995 dr horrible on a scale of one to 10 is a 10 and barneys like 27
1732996 i can say and i have said that its not true
1732997 ultimately is going to work his way up within the team and ultimately become the head of the unit
1732998 a very interesting dna that is going to inform the duality of the character
1732999 he has an interesting genetic profile that in certain sort of medical contexts theyve noticed that many times serial killers have that same genetic profile
1733000 right now its not a problem per se its something hes curious about in terms of his own sort of his own genetic code
1733001 i can see headlines would be serial killer joins csi i mean how would you phrase it
1733002 tempted to ask a questions about jericho just to drive up traffic on our web site
1733003 i would put her in a coma thats what i would do
1733004 izzie is toast izzie is toast izzie is toasty mctoasterson
1733005 well be done writing the show approximately at the end of february and the first episode premieres shortly before that
1733006 theres not really an opportunity there to get any feedback it will be sort of more of a traditional cable model which quite frankly scares the expletive out of us
1733007 while i enjoy the ambivalence of what world am i in and how can i maintain my integrity i think that we need to see nick give into some more temptation and that i would say is the change of course for the character of nick that rather than standing back from it and seeing it and weighing it theres going to be a few times when he makes the choice in a direction where its going to make him a little dirtier and its going to cost him
1733008 i think last year nick sometimes was dealing with a lot of ambivalence and this season rather rapidly nick is going to sort of dig into being an active part of this family in a way that he wasnt last season and its going to happen in a number of very concrete plot ways
1733009 its really more dirty more sexy and more money than it was ever before
1733010 this season were honing in on really making it a show that the stories tell more of the ethical dilemmas that our doctors have to face
1733011 there is surgery in it because addison is a surgeon and she gets back to doing that
1733012 i think when it just became kind of a soap opera about those peoples lives there was a lot of talking a lot of time in the coffee room taking about the angst thats not that show
1733013 the idea of letting anyone else take the show from me kind of makes me sad and sick to my stomach i would rather just its my thing and im going to take it through seven years and you know i think were going to get out while people still like us
1733014 the congress shall assemble at least once in every year
1733015 wearing of this garment does not enable you to fly
1733016 do not attempt to stop chain with your hands or genitals
1733017 fallen no more to rise is the virgin israel forsaken on her land with none to raise her up
1733018 theres something going on everyday and most of the time its fun
1733019 we dont brag too loudly to others about how good we have it here
1733020 we dont want a bunch of other people vying for our jobs
1733021 when issues come up i let them make decisions theres rarely an issue that is life or death
1733022 sometimes staff will come over and close our door because were laughing so loud
1733023 do something you love and youll never have to work a day in your life
1733024 they not only derived benefits from the workshops themselves but also succeeded in building a greater sense of teamwork as a consequence of their interaction
1733025 you can hold your breath until youre blue in the face but without the cord youre not an infantryman
1733026 truth is generally acknowledged to be the first casualty of war
1733027 mr obama is now the worlds most recognisable phenomenon there were by 11 yesterday morning hundreds of fans standing in king charles road round the corner from downing street cameras and phones held high there were banners mr b obama you are hope 4 billions of young men and women around the globe there were tears really crying logos slogans hope the woman on the clapham omnibus quite literally rose to her feet a big old belching red number 88 was the first vehicle stopped at 12 44 as obamas convoy fled the gates of westminster to head back to illinois she stood up earrings and sunglasses bouncing shouting through the glass furiously snapping away on her phone ecstatic the woman on the clapham omnibus is our how will it play in peoria in america i almost tried to find her we like to have names but the bus was going for once too fast leaving on the retina only the shimmering slick of an advertising flyer for i assume a film called space chimps go bananas there was a cartoon monkey disappearing fast perhaps you want to provide the bush metaphor and now mr o with his wickedly easy smile has been flying home and very possibly listening to leonard cohen and smiling first we take manhattan then we take berlin
1733028 obamas most brilliant trait is that he absorbs the environment
1733029 theres something about a charismatic leader rallying huge crowds of germans in a large public square
1733030 hai fatto lattioni che fanno le janare e streghe sei andata de notte con altre streghe in diversi lochi e tempi

1733033 ich bin durchaus in der lage amerika zu f hren
1733034 er ist der ber hmteste prominente der welt aber kann er auch ein land f hren
1733035 hey amerika ich bin paris hilton und auch ich bin eine ber hmtheit nur stamme ich weder aus alten zeiten noch verspreche ich wandel wie der andere typ ich bin einfach hei
1733036 paris hilton ist vielleicht nicht eine so gro e ber hmtheit wie barack obama aber sie hat offenbar das bessere programm f r die energiepolitik
1733037 at first i would have been happy to make the quarter finals
1733038 but ive been playing better and better and i feel pretty confident right now i just want to be the best that i can be
1733039 i was a little concerned going into the match because those unseeded players can be tough
1733040 if youre not careful and dont take them seriously enough they can surprise you

1733044 pretty nice upgrade but most definitely not everything we wish it was
1733045 its extremely exciting to be so close to the known location of the theatre and then find remains that look to be associated with it
1733046 as well as allowing us to walk in the footsteps of shakespeare himself the remains help us to start uncovering one of londons enduring secrets
1733047 we can now start to work on the detail of what the building here might have looked like and expand our knowledge of the playhouses of elizabethan london
1733048 our findings suggest that the effectiveness of hiv interventions was adversely affected by alcohol use
1733049 to develop more effective hiv interventions for alcohol using adolescent females requires also directly addressing the important role of alcohol use
1733050 victimization may not only reinforce the negative self concepts that a risk factor for victimization such as obesity may cause but a risk factor for victimization such as obesity will also make it more likely that the adolescent will be victimized indefinitely in other words the risk factors that strengthen the links in this pathway will also keep the pathway intact because it is also a risk factor for being victimized
1733051 the current study suggests that a risk factor for being victimized such as obesity may play an important role in the long term effects of victimization by making it more likely that the adolescent will be victimized over the long term but also that victimization can reinforce the negative self perceptions that the adolescent already has
1733052 it is important to go beyond using obesity as a predictor of long term adjustment and examine the processes and experiences of obese individuals that might cause depression or changes in health
1733053 we have seen first hand what the lack of tummy time can mean for a baby developmental cognitive and organizational skills delays eye tracking problems and behavioral issues to name just some complications
1733054 new parents are told of the importance of babies sleeping on their backs to avoid sids but they are not always informed about the importance of tummy time
1733055 ideally babies should be placed on their tummies after every nap diaper change and feeding starting with 1 2 minutes
1733056 since the early 1990s we have seen a significant decrease in sids cases while simultaneously witnessing an alarming increase in skull deformation
1733057 increasing the amount of time your baby lies on his or her tummy promotes muscle development in the neck and shoulders helps prevent tight neck muscles and the development of flat areas on the back of the babys head and helps build the muscles baby needs to roll sit and crawl
1733058 its important to get our infants out of devices that constrain mobility and onto their tummies so they can focus on neck muscle balance as they interact with their caregivers
1733059 security around the entire country of iraq continues to improve for the 11th straight week violence continues at the lowest level in four years
1733060 will be compared to each other along with those of the mummy of king tutankhamun
1733061 the cost of the occupation the cost of the military administration and providing for a provisional civilian administration all of that would come out of iraq oil
1733062 violent incidents and casualties have declined and we have witnessed the improved performance of iraq security forces during a series of operations
1733063 the u n has been doing all it can to urge practical compromises
1733064 a failure to come to agreement on a law at this time would be a major setback not only for the prospects of elections this year but for the larger process of national reconciliation in iraq
1733065 the federal aviation administration already bans cell phone calls during flights and the hang up act would make that ban permanent
1733066 the military commission system is a fair and appropriate legal process for prosecuting detainees alleged to have committed crimes against the united states or our interests
1733067 we look forward to other cases moving forward to trial
1733068 zealously represented by his defense team the jury made their decision based on the law and the facts presented in court we respect that decision
1733069 i know of no planning or initiatives to move the convicted war criminals to anywhere other than where theyre at in guantanamo
1733070 but nobody else at ge had so i knew it was important that these scientists had an idea as to what the market was going to look like
1733071 basically ge bought a molecular imaging contrast franchise that was very strong and gave us a footprint in the life sciences
1733072 he had 1093 patents you have some impressive numbers too
1733073 we can segment it now the next step is what to do with this information what can you do if you can identify cell populations what can you do if you measure the density of cells in certain areas
1733074 these are the sort of things where we go one or two steps ahead and we say this is possible
1733075 pathology people are using 100 to 150 year old technology
1733076 people are doing a great job but its mechanical they have to look at every slide one by one its a slow process labor intensive and its in black and white
1733077 if you generate a slide today somebody at another site cant look at it
1733078 this is unique because we generally dont work on such collaborations with such a large company on the other side
1733079 we suspect that youll have more robust information if you think about an entire pathway of signaling and look at not only the first signaling event but also two three four or five in combination
1733080 we can not only look at what happens within the tumor but also look at endothelial cells and understand signaling within epithelial cells and tumor cells
1733081 heres the screw up you made a promise that youd deliver this and you missed three weeks later
1733082 all in all in life sciences the integration in ge has been good the big benefit is we have gotten the resources we wanted
1733083 it would surprise me if the deal had been a big success
1733084 these are the sort of things where we go one or two steps ahead and we say this is possible
1733085 what happened when amersham centralized research to new jersey is they ended up with something like 12 people
1733086 they are growing some capabilities but that was a hiccup
1733087 those guys are great at making step changes in technology but the secret to doing this well is to nurture that research development and at the right stage move it into product development
1733088 what we are able to learn from our interactions with ge energy and ge water we are able to apply immediately to ge healthcare problems
1733089 in terms of assembly and demonstrations china has related laws and regulations
1733090 we hope that foreigners will respect the related chinese laws and regulations
1733091 use the platform of the olympic games to draw attention to their causes
1733092 the ioc are confident beijing city authorities will assess the situation reasonably and act with tact and understanding
1733093 it was important for us that there be a clear voice speaking out against the chinese governments abuse of human rights
1733094 if the 2008 olympic games take place then they should stand for freedom and peace as a tibetan i have neither freedom nor peace therefore i dont want these games
1733095 asia y europa del este son los impulsores de crecimiento y por ello vamos a crear en taiw n una empresa de distribuci n propia como ya se ha hecho en canad australia y corea
1733096 businesses are asking more questions against ever growing volumes of data from multiple sources so we are excited about our relationship with apatar
1733097 verticas analytic database enables companies to store terabytes of information with blazingly fast query response times with apatars visual designer and integration tools it becomes extremely easy to extract and load large volumes of data into vertica quickly for rapid analysis
1733098 most data integration projects fail after they exceed allocated budgets or cannot be delivered in time and never get built
1733099 combining verticas revolutionary performance and ease of use with apatars visual data quality and integration features enterprises can accelerate decision making and provide the quality and completeness of their most critical information timely before its too late

1733101 its not productive for our football team you have to be a productive part to be an nfl player there are responsibilities of being an nfl football player its not a right
1733102 chris is presently under nfl suspension and until such time as he may be reinstated we are not in position to comment
1733103 even in the event he is reinstated he is no longer our player and rarely if ever do we comment on any player who is not under contract with us
1733104 i guess the world is divided up between redeemers and non redeemers i happen to be a redeemer i think people can be made better and right if thats a fault so be it these guys misstepped they made mistakes and they paid prices for it verging on ruinous but that doesnt mean i dont like them personally i like them as people i regret whats happened to them and i regret theyre no longer here as far as going forward we dont want that kind of behavior weve tried to be more conscious of the guys we bring in than maybe we were before in all honesty if you look at their records contrary to some of the things you hear they were not as difficult cases in college as some make them out in hindsight things just conspired to undo them they were at least in one case tragic thats all history now were going forward and well try to go forward with the kind of guys we can count on the kind of guys who are not just good players but good citizens
1733105 we keep spending all this time on the knuckleheads instead of on the good guys thats a problem
1733106 when you spend all your time coaching knuckleheads and not spending the right amount of time with the right players in the right direction because youre putting out fires over here putting out fires over there i think weve tried to work through that this spring and i think were over it because weve had that kind of attitude were not going to waste time or fool with you if youre a knucklehead weve got to move on

1733247 many actors instead of performing in several shows with a single theatre company in the same season construct year round employment by performing in different theatres throughout the year
1733248 if actors manage to create community and continuity in spite of the institutions no credit for that reflects back on theaters that refuse to support artists in a meaningful fashion with staff positions with health insurance with a modicum of respect and dignity earned by working craftsman anywhere dribs and drabs of roles given when artists can jump for them are no substitute for real institutional support and to claim otherwise is absurd

1733258 the tombs broke open and the bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life
1733259 did they have to be buried again lisa if the saints can hear millions of prayers a day then they are gods or you are just wasting your time plus you are taking the chance of offending god by ignoring he who died for you john 11 26 jesus said
1733260 i am the resurrection and the life he who believes in me will live even though he dies and whoever lives and believes in me will never die do you believe this
1733261 after this manner therefore pray ye our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name

1733274 think most educated christians agree that when a baby dies it goes to heaven
1733275 what is particularly important to notice is that the nt canon was not demarcated by the arbitrary decree of any church council when at last a church council the synod of carthage a d 397 listed the 27 books of the nt 3 paul when he stated we must remain faithful to the things we have been taught was certainly refering to what the holy spirit was teaching through paul and was being written down in scripture not something in the ether someplace i think they called it sacred tradition later revealed by the roman hierarchy nicole the point you say i gave it to you you said the church brings us to jesus
1733276 what is particularly important to notice is that the nt canon was not demarcated by the arbitrary decree of any church council when at last a church council the synod of carthage a d 397 listed the 27 books of the nt it did not confer upon them any authority which they did not already possess but simply recorded their previously established canoncity

1733285 see where you are baptized see where baptism comes from if not from the cross of christ from his death there is a whole mystery he died for you in him you are redeemed in him your are saved
1733286 that christ is the way the truth and the life and that no one come to the father but through him

1733328 did you really think gods kingdom consisted of a small hut
1733329 in my fathers house are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you
1733330 my father has many mansions and i go to prepare a place for you
1733331 for whoever would draw near to god must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him
1733332 draw near to god and he will draw near to you
1733333 all scripture is inspired by god and profitable for teaching for reproof for correction and for training in righteousness
1733334 to you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of god but to the rest it is given in parables that seeing they may not see and hearing they may not understand
1733335 those who are well do not need a phyisican but the sick do go and learn the meaning of the words i desire mercy not sacrifice i did not come to call the righteous but sinners
1733336 throw away and disregard because of what they believe in
1733337 15 moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone if he shall hear thee thou hast gained thy brother

1733342 if this were october 26 instead of august 6 we probably wouldnt have this many toss ups states on our map florida missouri and nevada would move into the lean mccain column while michigan new mexico and pennsylvania would move into obamas
1733343 it would leave us with four pure toss ups colorado new hampshire ohio and virginia and under that scenario mccain would need to win all three of colorado ohio and virginia to win or break a 269 269 tie
1733344 is the world made of plastic is the city buried in dreams
1733345 i never said we were pen pals i was mearly trying to communicate how excited i was that obama has such a hands on approach with his supporters which was unfortunately exploited in a silly media frenzy
1733346 they media love to match you with any guy thats older than you thats your new man well you know im spoken for so i think it has nothing to do with that at all and never did whatever im a huge supporter

1733364 we are pleased with the decision because we have worked closely with the clubs in this legal matter
1733365 it was always our opinion that under fifa regulations we were not committed to allowing our players to go freely
1733366 fifa failed to realize the legal implications of this decision early and the preparation of the clubs ahead of the new season has been affected

1733368 in no other city did this show touch the zeitgeist as it did in berlin
1733369 i enjoy kicking but i love football more and i love playing and getting involved in tackling and throwing the ball running i enjoy that a lot
1733370 honestly if i had it my way i would have played another position rather than kicking even though kicking is an important part of the game no matter how you look at it its separate kickers over the years have developed a certain stereotype back in the day when now eskimo assistant coach dan kepley was playing or in the days when kickers were linebackers i think i would have enjoyed myself more playing in that era than i do now because of the separation
1733371 im doing a little bit each year and always looking to do more
1733372 i enjoy that aspect of the game and i enjoy the fact that i understand the game of football not just from the kicking side of it but the entire game ive been around kickers who are like ah another fake i dont want to do that
1733373 the facilities in edmonton are phenomenal we had to share facilities in toronto all the years i was there shared with the university
1733374 i dont know if you want to say the cfl is embraced more in the west but in some cases it is its unfortunate that toronto is still trying to get an nfl team and they dont embrace the cfl like they do in the west
1733375 richie scares me more than any other quarterback in this league
1733376 you cant game plan for him because he can run the ball and he can throw the ball i think he has everything that you want in a quarterback its just all about him getting a shot
1733377 with richie back there its like having another running back
1733378 nothing against caseys running ability but richie runs a lot better so we have to be more prepared and ready for him
1733379 theres no difference between the two of them except for maybe 300 000 but theyre basically the same guy
1733380 im a little surprised because im one of the younger guys in the league but it makes you feel good to hear that
1733381 were not necessarily going to go out there and run run run well go with that when the opportunity arises but were not really focused on just the run or the pass for us its all about making the right calls at the right time

1733393 the company need to improve the offer in regards to basic pay and the gmb is prepared to work with them to achieve this
1733394 we feel to achieve the efficiencies the company clearly want to achieve this year they need the support of our members and therefore need to be more realistic with their pay offer
1733395 this research can benefit parents teachers and other individuals working with children as it can allow them to set realistic expectations for and better interpret childrens everyday behavior
1733396 this study demonstrates how remedial instruction can use the plasticity of the human brain to gain an educational improvement
1733397 focused instruction can help underperforming brain areas to increase their proficiency
1733398 any kind of education is a matter of training the brain when poor readers are learning to read a particular brain area is not performing as well as it might and remedial instruction helps to shape that area up
1733399 this finding shows that poor readers can be helped to develop buff brains a similar approach should apply to other skills
1733400 we are at the beginning of a new era of neuro education
1733401 our hypothesis was that certain non toxic dietary agents that had the ability to promote reactive oxygen species ros would break down pancreatic cancer cell resistance to therapy following administration of mda 7 il 24 and be safe for human use
1733402 we are very excited at the prospect of this chemoprevention gene therapy as a means of both preventing and treating pancreatic cancer and it has significant potential to move rapidly into human clinical trials
1733403 the last 10 to 15 years have seen particularly dangerous declines in rainfall in sensitive ecosystems in east africa such as somalia and eastern ethiopia
1733404 we wanted to know if the trend would continue or if it would start getting wetter
1733405 we can be quite certain that the decline in rainfall has been substantial and will continue to be
1733406 this 15 percent decrease every 20 25 years is likely to continue
1733407 it raises some real concerns with the tactics of the nra if theyve got one person maybe they have more if theyve done this dirty trick what else have they done
1733408 the annual state of the union on independent film began 30 years ago with ifps founding event now known as independent film week
1733409 since then weve expanded our mandate to give the public a greater opportunity to experience the films we nurture through our programs and meet the innovators who are shaping the future of independent film
1733410 before we put the fake flies in they were taking the occasional pot shot at overhanging leaves and other objects around their display but you could see their hearts werent really in it
1733411 our first attempt was to stick pieces of food to the side of the glass and that seemed to catch their attention they would position themselves directly below and take it in turns to spit until it fell into the water
1733412 it was then we decided to take the experiment one stage further by devising the fake fly mobile and now its in place theyre really going for it
1733413 this is our beach people have used it for a hundred years and more
1733414 they heavily resent having it taken away from them particularly in a community thats relatively poor and doesnt have a lot in the way of amenities
1733415 we hope that the port authority would cooperate with us
1733416 if the application is successful it would mean that the public use of the beach is confirmed and that the owners would not be allowed to close it except in an emergency
1733417 bringing further awareness and attention to the link between animal cruelty and other forms of societal violence
1733418 unfortunately this sort of behavior by mexican military personnel has been going on for years
1733419 they are never held accountable and the united states government will undoubtedly brush this off as another case of oh well they didnt know they were in the united states
1733420 it is fortunate that this incident didnt end in a very ugly gunfight
1733421 humans seem to be wired to look to faces to understand the persons intentions
1733422 people are always asking themselves does this person have good or bad intentions
1733423 if you can think of an emotion being communicated by the face as a kind of signal you can understand that we can amplify that signal into what was almost a caricature to see if we get the proper effect
1733424 like humans monkeys benefit enormously from being actively involved in learning instead of having information presented to them passively
1733425 these figures show that northern republic of congo contains the mother lode of gorillas
1733426 it also shows that conservation in the republic of congo is working this discovery should be a rallying cry for the world that we can protect other vulnerable and endangered species whether they be gorillas in africa tigers in india or lemurs in madagascar
1733427 we knew from our own observations that there were a lot of gorillas out there but we had no idea there were so many
1733428 we hope that the results of this survey will allow us to work with the congolese government to establish and protect the new ntokou pikounda protected area
1733429 we hope that these results will speed up the classification of the ntokou pikounda zone into a protected area
1733430 we have yet to achieve bias free health care this has serious public health implications as we know that higher levels of screening lead to lower levels of mortality clinicians need to be aware that they may be sending signals even unintentionally that lead minorities to believe they are being discriminated against
1733431 respondents answered yes or no to was there ever a time that you would have gotten better medical care if you had belonged to a different ethnic group however we were not able to ask why they felt discriminated against
1733432 this contradicts the general assumption in public health that having a usual source of care is a cure all
1733433 if men felt discriminated against by their regular health care provider they did not receive screening so there is something else factoring in
1733434 for example african american men may be stereotyped as being more violent which would affect how doctors respond to them and thus create a potential for discrimination
1733435 the longer someone delays screening the worse the outcome perception of discrimination may be driving the differences we see in outcomes among minorities
1733436 a key step in the durable control of hiv infection requires enhancing the development of memory immune responses and the stimulation of potent cytotoxic t cells through therapeutic vaccination
1733437 working with our colleagues at the universit de montr al we have shown that argos approach of transfecting dendritic cells with autologous hiv specific antigens effectively activates dendritic cells and enhances the hiv specific t cell response we believe that these results support our methods of developing potent immunotherapies that help patients immune systems more effectively fight hiv infection
1733438 we have identified a key connection of signaling pathways in the cascade of events leading to sepsis this defines a crucial point where the immune system spirals out of control to cause severe sepsis and where there is an opportunity for therapeutic intervention
1733439 rather than being dominated by rural farmers tropical deforestation is increasingly driven by major industries especially large scale farming mining and logging
1733440 although this trend is pretty scary its also much easier to target a handful of global corporations than many millions of poor farmers
1733441 green groups are learning to use public boycotts and embarrassment to target the corporate bad guys
1733442 and it already seeing the global soy palm oil and timber industries beginning to change their approach theyre realizing they cant run roughshod over the just too risky for them
1733443 in addition some massive financial firms including goldman sachs jp morgan chase citigroup and bank of america have altered their lending practices after coming under fire from environmentalists
1733444 many multinational corporations are developing greener products because theyre more profitable for example the market for eco friendly timber products is expected to be worth tens of billions of dollars in the u s by 2010
1733445 we argue that the public and green groups need to send a loud clear message to the corporate sector
1733446 polonius thinks this curtain looks like a good thing to hide behind
1733447 these states are ones you learn about in introductory quantum mechanics classes but no one has been able to controllably create them before
1733448 in quantum mechanics the energy or amplitude of motion of this pendulum only comes in finite steps in quanta we first carefully prepared the resonator in these quantum states and showed we could do this controllably and then measure the states then we kicked the pendulum directly a method where the amplitude can take on any value and appears to not be limited to these quanta but when we look at the resonator with our qubit we see that the amplitude does come in steps but that the resonator is actually in several such states at the same time so that on average it looks like it is not limited to the quantum states
1733449 this resonator once you excite it has to swing for a very long time
1733450 the first samples i fabricated stopped oscillating very quickly we had to work to rearrange the fabrication method to get the resonator to oscillate longer
1733451 harmonic oscillators might allow us to get a quantum computer built more quickly
1733452 i think if they really build one of these quantum computers there will definitely be resonators in them
1733453 neuropathy is a chronic and significant problem in hiv patients as there are few existing treatments that offer adequate pain management to sufferers
1733454 we found that smoked cannabis was generally well tolerated and effective when added to the patients existing pain medication resulting in increased pain relief
1733455 this study adds to a growing body of evidence that indicates that cannabis is effective in the short term at least in the management of neuropathic pain
1733456 and because it winds itself up to the forest canopy and spreads it can cover as much canopy area as a community of trees
1733457 it appears to be true that lianas grow more rapidly at higher levels of c02
1733458 but there could be other explanations for the increase in lianas too weather could be a factor
1733459 if lianas can grow far more than trees during seasonal droughts then global increases in drought from such events as el ni o or la ni a may be responsible for the documented increases in liana abundance
1733460 if you cant figure out whats going on in the ecological system then look at the oddball the deviant something that doesnt fit the model
1733461 some advice get rid of all the things you dont need and wont bring with you
1733462 our method allows us to more efficiently find the beetles so that they can be controlled especially when their populations are low or when the beetles are difficult to survey
1733463 for invasive species it is much easier and cheaper to detect and try to eradicate invaders when they are still localized and their numbers are small before they have a chance to disperse widely
1733464 before our project little was known about the chemical ecology of cerambycid beetles or their use of attractant pheromones and the pheromones of only a few species had been identified
1733465 our longer term goals are to gain a better understanding of which subfamilies tribes and genera are likely to use pheromones and within those groups to determine the types of chemicals that are used as pheromones
1733466 conversely if we can predict which species do not use attractant pheromones there would be no point in looking for such compounds and we could focus on finding the chemicals that attract these species to their host trees
1733467 these morphological features and specific behaviors are reliably associated with pheromone use by cerambycid beetles
1733468 specifically for a large group of species we found males have a particular type of glandular structure to produce pheromones these males adopted a very specific stance when they were releasing their pheromones akin to doing pushups thus from simply checking for the presence of the glands or observing the behavior of a new invasive cerambycid species or both regulatory personnel can reliably predict whether a new species uses attractant pheromones that can be identified and exploited for its detection and management
1733469 this is critically important for lure design because lures must release 5 000 to 25 000 micrograms of pheromone per day to be effective
1733470 this is in marked contrast to pheromone baited traps for other insect species where release rates from the trap lures are typically a few micrograms per day we are working to develop lures for field use that are capable of these high release rates for extended periods such as weeks
1733471 foreigner became synonymous with enemy there was all this animosity directed towards any foreigner and at the same time there was an extraordinary outpouring of brotherly love within america we had this paradox that 9 11 led to intergroup harmony inside the united states while leading to intergroup conflict outside the united states
1733472 to the best of our knowledge this line of research is the first to document these relationships
1733473 our initial studies conducted during the week of the six month anniversary of 9 11 had americans read a u s senators policy on intergroup relations during this period of national challenge americans endorsed multiculturalism more as a domestic policy and assimilation more as a foreign policy
1733474 most recently we discovered that americans primed with 9 11 a foreign threat revealed higher levels of national identity than those primed with the columbine massacre a domestic threat
1733475 this represents the first demonstration that kidney injury in membranous nephropathy can regress after selective depletion of b cells thus the present data provide a strong rationale for using rituximab to treat patients with membranous nephropathy
1733476 as head of the largest aids center i dealt with a large number of ethiopian hiv and aids patients and through them became aware of the magnitude of this problem in ethiopia
1733477 ntds are one of the most evident hallmark signs of poverty and neglect significantly contributing to the persistence of this situation in a very large number of countries in africa asia and south america
1733478 they have been largely neglected by the western developed countries since they are practically nonexistent there
1733479 it costs much less than what it takes to fight the more recognized epidemics like aids tuberculosis and malaria
1733480 food allergic individuals need to increase the awareness of their food allergy among the people around them
1733481 this would include not only telling them that they are food allergic but also showing them how to treat them and how to recognize signs of an ongoing reaction
1733482 there are serious issues that need to be addressed in terms of educating these young adults that it is of utmost importance to not only maintain emergency medication but to have it with you at all times
1733483 until all students who display symptoms of a severe reaction are receiving epinephrine i would say that theres a significant gap that needs to be closed
1733484 in the current study we focused on preexisting psychiatric risk factors for postpartum suicide attempts resulting in hospitalization most importantly a prior psychiatric or substance use diagnosis among postpartum women significantly increased the risk of a serious postpartum suicide attempt one implication of this study is that screening for past history of psychiatric and substance use diagnoses as part of routine prenatal care may be a means of identifying women at high risk of postpartum suicide attempt although a recent review of prenatal screening for depression cited insufficient evidence to recommend screening as a way to improve outcomes
1733485 its almost like winning the super bowl i am the majide grand champion
1733486 the grand prize makes everything worth it but those memories of what ive done thats priceless
1733487 i love justin he did an amazing job he definitely showed his sportsmanship hes a good person he deserves to win im happy for him and i love him to death
1733488 my homeboy won my homeboy from alabama beat me today im proud of him i wish i could have done a little bit better of course but its the name of the game majide its crazy im sad to leave tokyo im sad that i lost this has been one of the best experiences of my entire life
1733489 this has been the most amazing experience something that i never dreamed of
1733490 i feel comfortable in knowing i that i did my best in all the challenges what better opportunity could i have asked for i was in the final 4
1733491 this is my absolute low point its kind of a bummer to just be last
1733492 you feel on top of the world and then you just are crushed because youve done the worst and now i have to go home because of it i had a lot of faith in myself going into this and tried so hard to stay i think i did pretty good i am the last girl standing thats really cool but just like getting the rug pulled out from under your feet you fall hard
1733493 some of the cast are already starting to work out and train even though they wont meet their dance partners for a few more weeks its shaping up to be the most fun season yet
1733494 we are not at liberty to confirm any casting rumors or details prior to the official cast reveal taking place on good morning america august 25
1733495 importantly we discovered that this fibrosis occurs more rapidly and to a greater extent in the portion of the gut the largest lymphatic tissue in the body containing the t cells compared with other immune tissues
1733496 the fibrosis stops cells from returning to immune tissues especially in the gut
1733497 this has been the iranian strategy for years to bide their time and continue with their enrichment

1733499 we have no clue who his celebrity partner is going to be im hoping its someone whos like 70 80 years old
1733500 when youre both busy and youve got your own things its great because nobodys sitting around moping waiting hoping something will happen
1733501 our producer always tells us that you never know what the american public is going to decide so were all kind of prepared
1733502 i had this peaceful strong feeling that i would be going home and i was okay with it
1733503 i was always myself on the camera and that always mattered to me the most is just being who i am and staying true to who i am
1733504 im feeling great right now im very grateful and so blessed to be even a part of this show and to make it this far was awesome the biggest thing is i feel like i put everything into each of my performances and i feel like i really did the best that i could so at that point its out of your control what else happens i cant control the public so im very happy with myself and thats the most i could ask for so im feeling fine right now im feeling great
1733505 im just so glad that i got to share what i love to do with everyone and that everyone got to see my talent because thats what im here for
1733506 thats what i believe ive been blessed with so i can share that so im just grateful for all of them for watching and appreciating it
1733507 just doing your best at all times no matter what kind of shape youre in physically and that was the big thing for us because we were always so tired and so worn out
1733508 but it really helped us to really do our best every time in every performance
1733509 im so so so excited the tour is going to be awesome
1733510 it does not preclude life on mars in fact it is a potential energy source
1733511 it is my burden to prove that he was insane at the time of the commission of the offense
1733512 it is absolutely critical a mental health expert see him now at this critical stage
1733513 jury has never found a defendant not guilty by reason of insanity in a contested case there have been times when defendants have been found not guilty by reason of insanity but that is usually by agreement with the prosecutors

1733531 the mobile phone is inherently an inferior entertainment platform compared to other media devices like tvs
1733532 however the mobile handset is inherently a superior portable communications platform it allows for tv advertising outside the home as well as enabling new forms of advertising including call to action advertising call to action leverages the handsets built in return channel to deliver advertising beyond the capabilities of the living room tv experience

1733534 really you dont need anything from me no passport no photographs
1733535 they are lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is they are making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by three to four percent
1733536 could i mention that senator obama a couple of days ago said that we ought to all inflate our tires and i dont disagree with that
1733537 the american automobile association strongly recommends it but i also dont think that thats a way to become energy independent
1733538 if obama really wants to identify with middle america and its appetites he should have chosen a different german city as the venue to declare

1733564 i was sitting in a jail cell not understanding if id ever play again
1733565 now that im here and i have this opportunity im really embracing it
1733566 this battle over obamas image as a black man is arguably the central front of the presidential campaign right now once sharp lines between the candidates on issues such as withdrawing u s troops from iraq or allowing new offshore oil drilling are becoming blurred the democratic partys structural advantages going into the election are formidable its hard to imagine how mccain could possibly win unless he generates doubt in voters minds about obama one way to do that would be to fabricate the impression that obama is demanding special treatment and privilege because he is black in other words turn a self made man into a stereotypical beneficiary of affirmative action

1733571 the authors also tell the story of angelo mozilo whose father was a butcher of italian descent mr mozilo outsmarted and outhustled countless rivals to make countrywide the no 1 mortgage lender only to be done in by his own hubris grasping for even more market share just when mortgages were turning toxic
1733572 the authors reveal in gory detail just what went wrong at countrywide and how so many chuckleheads made so many bone headed decisions
1733573 as gains on hedges and a reduction in loss reserves more than offset 1 06 billion in mortgage related write downs
1733574 hey lets tie into this older women cougar demographic im hearing about by calling it puma
1733575 we are studying this issue so we can put an end to this phenomenon
1733576 there are different religious opinions regarding the marriages which is why we need the government to settle the issue through legislation
1733577 islam has stipulated that both parties agree to the marriage contract
1733578 the woman must express real consent to the suitor and a guardian must not impose his choice of husband on her or force his son to marry someone he doesnt want
1733579 can enter a marriage contract with a 1 year old girl not to mention 9 years 7 years or 8 years
1733580 this is just a contract indicating consent and the guardian in this case must be the father
1733581 isnt it better to marry his daughter to a man with whom she can stay and who can protect her and support her and when she reaches the proper age have sex with her who says all men are ferocious wolves
1733582 a marriage official should not conclude a marriage contract without the womans agreement and without her signature
1733583 when girls are married off at a young age they will be deprived of education and of enjoying their childhood
1733584 their bodies wont be able to tolerate pregnancy and delivering children

1733597 there is perhaps no psychological skill more fundamental than resisting impulse
1733598 the leadership has to be held accountable regardless of their race
1733599 we do not as a matter of course engage in the traditional kinds of protests and marching we do it through direct interaction with whoever we feel should be held accountable we do it through writing and by bringing issues to the attention of the media
1733600 i had the honor of spending years with one of the most important figures in american history
1733601 when rosa parks would visit washington i would stay at the hotel with her i was her chauffeur i fixed breakfast for her helped her get dressed and combed her hair the gifts she gave me have great sentimental value
1733602 you see young uns riding three four deep you know whats about to happen
1733603 if we continue to accept the rule of thumb that we should not stand up for our communities then we should not complain
1733604 id be lying if i said i knew only mother nature does
1733605 maybe its because we didnt have a late frost at a critical time when they were teeny tiny or maybe there are fewer predator birds we just dont know what we do know is that the caterpillar population is getting bigger and bigger people are going crazy because the caterpillars are now in a migratory phase looking for safe places to spin their little cocoons
1733606 the tent moth is primarily a nuisance although these guys have been implicated in a serious disease affecting horses in kentucky
1733607 the gypsy moth on the other hand is an invasive species that gorges on tree leaves especially oak by the end of the summer youll be seeing a lot of defoliated trees
1733608 the search appliance offers an easy plug and play solution that brings a lot of benefits
1733609 a lot of seniors didnt plan well for the retirement years
1733610 they relied too heavily on social security and when the roof starts to leak they cant afford to fix it
1733611 in my whole life i never saw anything like this
1733612 to get someone just to put in the door would cost him 250 plus the door
1733613 if i can help him get something as simple as a screen porch where he can sit comfortably and enjoy his remaining years im happy to do it seniors get taken advantage of too often as it is
1733614 were talking hundreds of thousands of low income homeowners mostly the elderly and the disabled who cannot afford to make repairs on their homes
1733615 some have had leaking roofs and no heat for years and now weve had to expand our services to include an increasing number of veterans and victims of natural disasters
1733616 its not just the condition of the house but all of the stuff that he let pile up over the years
1733617 darkness cannot drive out darkness only light can do that
1733618 hate cannot drive out hate only love can do that
1733619 the idea is to make sure that the victims of homicide are not forgotten
1733620 the tree symbolizes a growing recognition of the need to stop the violence and start the healing
1733621 someone just pulled up next to him and started shooting
1733622 he tried to drive himself to prince georges hospital but he died before he could make it
1733623 if a jobs program is going to be part of an economic stimulus package its got to be set up within a few months and paychecks dispersed quickly
1733624 the jobs will have to be obvious with social benefits and not require a lot of planning and recruiting
1733625 who knows if such a program would have a long term effect on increasing employment but we do know that in the short term jobs programs for youths keep them out of trouble
1733626 selling drugs and the violence that surrounds that the increase in robberies and burglaries all have to do with getting money
1733627 i dont condone their behaviors but these are crimes of economics
1733628 i just want to work and be with my children
1733629 i want him to be a father and to recognize these two children but both of these women want him thats a lot of pressure and ernest doesnt handle pressure well i dont want him using drugs to cope with the situation or selling drugs to make money to keep those mothers happy
1733630 as you get older you start to realize that life is precious
1733631 theres a white guy who does work on my house in the country
1733632 rides a motorcycle wears a leather jacket lives deep in republican country hes an army ranger and his dad is a retired colonel and hes sick of this war so he says to me doug im voting for obama obama has stirred something in me to the extent that i am alive to see this i am thoroughly amazed
1733633 i believe obama can win because america needs fresh eyes
1733634 he doesnt browbeat the white man with the racial issue but he hits on universal themes in a way that lets blacks and whites know that a better u s will be better for all of us
1733635 and speaking for myself and not for the whole committee that drafts these things im certainly interested in being able to gauge to what extent race was a factor in how people vote in democratic primaries
1733636 obama has the ability to elevate our thinking beyond the chicken yard scratching and biting he calls on us to soar like eagles and if he cant always take you there he can sure dare you to go
1733637 the big challenge for obama was not to be portrayed as the black candidate and not to be perceived as denying his blackness it would not have worked if he had done like tiger woods and called himself a cablinasian it worked because obama came off as a renaissance man
1733638 he spoke frankly about the racial divide the gap in black and white perceptions of reality and because of his personal story rooted in having a black father and white mother he was able to offer himself as the bridge
1733639 even for those blacks who did make it questions of race and racism continue to define their worldview in fundamental ways
1733640 the memories of humiliation and doubt and fear have not gone away nor has the anger and the bitterness that anger is not always productive indeed all too often it distracts attention from solving real problems but the anger is real it is powerful and to simply wish it away to condemn it without understanding its roots only serves to widen the chasm
1733641 many of the disparities that exist can be traced directly to inequalities passed on from an earlier generation
1733642 what you have here are a lot of women who have banded together to pull in the kids
1733643 i was at one community meeting and there were only two men in the room the rest were women mostly grandmothers safety is their main concern
1733644 i think of everything i do with the challenges my mother faced raising me in mind and i was a bad teenager
1733645 so this safe homes program is a way of giving single mothers and grandparents another option when they need help with those tough kids
1733646 i can only think of what its like to be a grandmother that is scared to death for her son or grandsons safety and she doesnt know how to get the gun away from him
1733647 i think about the virtual prison that the grandmother is living in worrying that someone is going to get hurt or killed so we go in and get the gun but we are also freeing the grandmother
1733648 if a surveillance camera is put up in an area where violence is prevalent that can be the voice of the victim
1733649 when i talk about the safe homes initiative with community groups there are some who stare at me with crossed arms some who are not sure where im coming from
1733650 but there are always two or three nodding in agreement
1733651 approval from the european commission for the merger is another important step toward completing our pro competitive merger with northwest
1733652 we continue to work closely with the u s department of justice and remain confident that we will be able to finalize the merger by the end of the year
1733653 carriers are battling for those high arpu customers the most succulent fruit
1733654 now the prices for the two categories are ridiculously close
1733655 when you hit a sub 200 price it broadens the appeal and even allows for impulse purchasing
1733656 the million dollar question is whether u s consumer spending on handsets will continue through the second half of the year
1733657 are they more willing than their european counterparts to shrug off their economic woes and keep spending
1733658 motorolas domestic stronghold in the u s has been in play for about 18 months
1733659 every operator has one or two high end phones with big subsidies will they extend those subsidies to other models
1733660 the special courts set up by sudan to try alleged rebels who attacked khartoum are a charade
1733661 the special courts dont meet even minimal fair trial standards and yet they have the power to sentence people to death
1733662 if the normal evidence procedures were used in these trials the prosecution would have no case
1733663 right now those detained are suffering one of two fates held incommunicado mistreated possibly tortured or sentenced to death in an unfair trial
1733664 international law is clear they must be charged and tried fairly or released
1733665 pretacci storie di uomini che portano il vangelo sul marciapiede
1733666 to see a black man stand on stage with his wife and two children and all of those white folks supporting him has already been a sea change for me about how far white people have come
1733667 my mother was born in sioux city in 1913 the changes that have occurred since then tell me that america is beginning to acknowledge that there are many black talented people out there talented enough to run this country
1733668 im blessed i still have my family and i still have a job
1733669 what youre doing now is a full time job trying to get it without getting caught doing it without being seen getting more before you get sick
1733670 i mean i can stop i just cant stay stopped can you help me get into a treatment program detox a methadone clinic anything but this
1733671 instead of addressing the symptoms of addiction such as giving them clean needles telling them about how to shoot up without blowing a vein recommending that addicts abuse with someone else in case one of them stops breathing we should break the bonds of their addiction and make them free from needles and pushers and pimps once and for all
1733672 we use the syringe to engage in conversations with those people nobody wants to talk to we believe in meeting people where they are treating them like human beings and helping them avoid catching and spreading diseases
1733673 since i became mayor getting rid of guns and closing down this store have been high on my list of priorities
1733674 theyve got to come to us for business permits and well be taking a close look at their role in the gun violence that is killing so many of our people
1733675 when we were campaigning in greenleaf a city owned public housing complex in southeast two three times in a row residents would pull me into their homes to look at ceilings falling down ceilings leaking
1733676 they were not getting any response from the city so i got on the phone to the city right then it was a weekend but i stayed on the phone until i got someone from maintenance to come out and fix this stuff
1733677 in the past three to four weeks there have been approximately 10 to 15 unsolved acts of vehicular vandalism and theft against members of our community
1733678 our members have been car jacked and robbed at gunpoint as they exit or enter their homes trespassing alcohol and drug use and sexual activity occur on our property with increasing regularity
1733679 during one episode i see these kids standing outside the fence throwing rocks through my windows and the windows of my neighbors homes
1733680 when i yelled at them they ran into a church on the corner i found them in a room with their football coach getting ready for practice so i confronted them and the coach and a lot of it stopped after that
1733681 my name is mike do you know that we dont have air conditioning and i have asthma
1733682 my name is desiree im nine years old and we dont have air conditioning and im baking up like bacon and eggs in every classroom can you please help us
1733683 weve got lots of schools that are not air conditioned
1733684 everybody knows we have lots of schools that need renovation and our parents know that and understand that we have done everything we can to accommodate the students and keep them comfortable nobody wants the children to suffer absolutely nobody but we are working with some old buildings and we have had to learn how to adjust and adapt and our parents and students have learned how to do that as well
1733685 dear city leader can you please give us some air i cant take it i dont want to pass out please help us today is 100 degrees outside martin luther king helped you he helped save your life he died for you now its your turn to help us my name is kenya send us air
1733686 were talking children as young as 4 and 5 years old spending up to 10 hours a day in antiquated buildings that heat up like a sauna when the heat index is 105
1733687 nobody could believe that dcps did not close on code red on july 18 we had children throwing up from the heat getting bloody noses having difficulty breathing because of their asthma having terrible eczema outbreaks underneath their sweaty skin and just being generally irritable and lethargic
1733688 after her mother and grandmother died she tightened up stopped talking and started holding everything in
1733689 what she needed was somebody to talk to about her feelings but she didnt know how to seek that kind of help
1733690 she wanted to be an entrepreneur and she had everything it took to become a great one
1733691 she had her whole life ahead of her and now its come down to this

1733696 i had never really traced my family history particularly on my fathers side since my parents separated when i was going on 10 years old
1733697 you think about the distance youve come you think about how brutal it was you think about how life must have been like for him
1733698 and then you start wondering whether or not he would be proud or disappointed in what we have done
1733699 when i stand in the mirror i see somebody who is compassionate but with a strong desire to help people do whats right to help maintain that line between right and wrong
1733700 sometimes its a balancing act i feel just as compassionate when i see someone involved in criminal activity something caused that person to be in an environment that contributed to the criminal behavior i feel sorry and empathetic even though what they are doing is wrong we have to get them off the streets but i have to keep the compassion because thats what keeps us from policing in the way we shouldnt
1733701 ive been feeling a bit frustrated because i thought more people would be interested in the new police chiefs policies and crime fighting strategies than in her race and hairstyle
1733702 if i cant get a computer with xp on it im going to get a mac
1733703 they totally got it wrong the interface is not as user friendly as xp i dont want all the funky colors and little drawings its not meant to be pretty its meant to be useful and thats how i use it with vista you dont have that option
1733704 on the several occasions that we tested vista we found that it performed poorly in comparison to xp and that it was incompatible with much of our existing hardware and software
1733705 xp on the other hand is working well as the core of our pc environment and i dont see any need to replace it
1733706 after six months on my desktop server i still cant get my laptops to find the scanners and printers
1733707 did i mention that i am now in the market for a new imac
1733708 throughout the south among all classes the preoccupation with ex slaves became obsessive the hatred fear loathing and horror of afro americans attained levels of emotional political and religious intensity that are hard to imagine
1733709 we will no longer describe failure as the result of vast impersonal forces like poverty or a broken bureaucracy
1733710 i dont think anybodys ever going to educate anyone in washington
1733711 middle class children are going to come back into the school system and as they do test scores are going to improve people are going to think educations improved but all they will have done is displaced poor children in the citys schools
1733712 our present educational structure was designed to benefit affluent white anglo saxon protestants
1733713 we should not expect it to work well for those who differ we must design a system that makes everyone start out equal
1733714 i think before going i did not really have a strong sense of like korean identity i think learning how to read and write in korean and connecting with all of my relatives for the period of time was incredibly valuable for me
1733715 if you have the aptitude and the discipline you can go a long way in this sport
1733716 most people dont know that you can pull down 80 000 just changing tires on a pit crew
1733717 we get at risk kids who completely turn their lives around
1733718 we had one student whod pretty much dropped out of high school but got into our program and through racing became quite excited about school again he got his diploma and is now at stanford
1733719 not every kid will be able to slam dunk but nearly every one of them will be able to drive weve found that kids from every background love the idea of auto racing so much that they are willing to go to school on saturdays and to study throughout the summer to be the best at it the next thing you know their mind set has changed
1733720 when im out in the community like i was out in the bloomingdale neighborhood last night people dont ask me about the race or gender of the people i appoint
1733721 most people are telling me that they want officers walking the beat more aggressive community policing and reductions in crime nine out of 10 people i meet want the schools fixed they are not asking for one type of person for the job the issue is getting the job done
1733722 yes his perception of race is different then again hes from a different generation comfortable working with people across a wide spectrum more trusting of whites than some of the older residents who grew up during racial segregation theres something about him that makes people think he can deliver
1733723 im not saying that no one in the world thinks those thoughts but maybe because im mayor people will not come up and say those words to me
1733724 a lot of guys i went to howard law school with are working on a lot of different things and weve got a ton of howard graduates in my administration african american men in their 30s and 40s my chief of staff among them
1733725 but having grown up in the city having seen years of a school system not working and a police department being inconsistent and the budget unbalanced i believe that the average citizen is concerned foremost with getting the services they deserve
1733726 once a person is in the booth and says well i dont know who to vote for they might remember your sign
1733727 i noticed that some candidates will position their posters close to certain other candidates in hopes of benefiting from the association
1733728 its like im with this person or its a were all together type of thing i have to laugh because then we get complaints from candidates who dont want people thinking that they are all together
1733729 i prefer to have my campaign posters placed on lawns that way neighbors can see that i have been endorsed by people they know but signs are just part of an overall strategy signs get the conversation started but we do an awful lot of knocking on doors to keep it going
1733730 but once they started seeing rappers like puff daddy and jay z getting into the fashion business their attitudes began to change
1733731 people come up to us and say hey where did you get those pants or that shirt
1733732 they look surprised when we say we made them people are always asking us if we can make stuff for them
1733733 because they are working with sewing machines razors pins and scissors there is no tolerance for clowning around in class
1733734 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence

1733753 bioethicists who generally hold the values of patient autonomy and informed consent to be preeminent tend to be skeptical about compulsory vaccination laws because hpv is not casually transmissible they argue there is less compelling rationale for requiring protection against it than against measles or pertussis in the absence of potential harm to a third party such laws may be considered unacceptably paternalistic
1733754 requiring hpv vaccination by law will almost certainly achieve more widespread protection against the disease than will policies that rely exclusively on persuasion and education
1733755 the only way to ensure that as many girls as possible receive the hpv vaccine is to require it before they enter middle school
1733756 during the past two decades in the face of a sharp increase in the number of recommended pediatric vaccines unproven theories alleging connections between vaccines and illnesses such as autism diabetes and multiple sclerosis have been spreading a social movement involving diverse participants has challenged the safety of vaccinations and mounted attacks in courtrooms and legislatures on compulsory vaccination laws

1733760 you can walk more than a block and not worry about crossing into somebody elses turf
1733761 compared to the life he has in d c cape cod is utopia
1733762 it just shows what can happen when youre surrounded by loving people whether its your family or somebody elses
1733763 he hardly ever goes outside around here mostly just stays in his room with his door closed
1733764 the only time i see him really smile is when miss brogioli invites him to visit her family
1733765 allowing people to be homeless is a choice that society makes it costs 22 000 to 25 000 a year to provide housing and services for a homeless person but the cost of emergency medical services incarceration and maintaining temporary shelter during the winter can cost three to four times as much
1733766 few care about their broken spirits i sometimes wonder if america has gotten so big and rich that it lost its soul
1733767 wed like it better if the nations capital was moved to denver
1733768 and everybody presently in washington could just stay where they are
1733769 we think the whole thing ought to be started over from scratch
1733770 thats what we do around here take care of one another
1733771 i think some of us just overbought into the american dream
1733772 its true that prince georges is the wealthiest predominately black county in the united states but you have lots of first generation college graduates who arent the most sophisticated when it comes to money theyve got good government jobs and wanted nice homes nice cars and private schools for the kids but some of them didnt figure out how much these things would cost in the long run and ended up getting in over their heads
1733773 what blows my mind is the number of people who end up giving away their homes because they did not take time to read the fine print
1733774 they just saw a check being offered to them and they grabbed it not only that you have people that will go through a major transaction and not even get copies of the documents theyve signed they have no idea what theyve done and arent likely to find out until its too late
1733775 i went to law school and still have difficulty making sense of some of these documents so i know its going to be rough on someone who only finished high school
1733776 in virginia beach where i grew up blacks didnt have a place where we could learn to swim
1733777 everything was segregated we even had a problem getting to the beach
1733778 were running up against a social situation that we must overcome
1733779 and a couple of months later i was a lifeguard
1733780 id always wanted to learn to swim and even if there hadnt been an instructor at the pool i believe i would have taught myself
1733781 we teach the importance of having choices and caring about outcomes
1733782 we address risky behaviors by helping students understand who they are and what they can be
1733783 we see our kids as being at promise not at risk
1733784 in the midst of this crisis students should be getting information in school that will help prevent infection for the rest of their lives
1733785 i never said i dont enjoy your mothers day tributes as much as i used to
1733786 when you were born i thought you were the most perfect baby in the world until i realized you werent
1733787 we did the best we could with what we had and thats that
1733788 dont forget to say your prayers before you go to bed
1733789 its the simple everyday pleasures that make life worth living
1733790 no meat no salt no sugar no coffee and no cheating
1733791 i gave up on telling you what to do a long time ago
1733792 there came a dutch man of warre that sold us 20 negars
1733793 self sufficiency through the sweat and pain of an enslaved race
1733794 we are not interested in pointing a finger of blame
1733795 can a nation rise above the injustices of its origins and by its moral purpose and performance atone for them in the judgmental scales of history such grievous wrongs must be balanced by the erection of a society dedicated to justice and fairness has the united states done this has it expiated its organic sins
1733796 utah is republican in part because of the partys emphasis on individualism and the sense that you need your gun and your space
1733797 many people in utah believe that washington does not understand what its like to live in the west and is oppressive in its attempt to govern an area that it doesnt know or care about
1733798 there is also a sense that utah doesnt benefit from social programs
1733799 so when republicans talk about cutting taxes and welfare queens that resonates
1733800 many utahans live below the poverty level and rely on government programs
1733801 like soldiers we continue to work on the front line sometimes feeling unarmed in hopes that our health and safety needs are met and that the culprits are apprehended
1733802 we are not offered an apology from our government leaders for their hesitant reactions during the anthrax attacks putting the mail first and leaving many still wounded
1733803 and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us
1733804 its easy to have bitterness in your heart when you believe life has been unfair
1733805 some find it difficult to let go some never forgive but now is a time for healing we must learn to forgive and to love one another
1733806 i cant believe that we still dont know who is behind these attacks
1733807 you have our condolences which may sound like empty words given all that has happened the government has failed you to this day we bear a measure of guilt
1733808 five years later the alarm i and many others experienced on that dark day has been replaced by a deep discouragement and dismay the investigation trail has gone cold physical evidence that might have been gathered in the first days and weeks after the attacks is long gone while the fbi has made gains in its scientific capabilities and understanding of anthrax its slowness to move and its lack of direction in the early stages of the investigation led to missed opportunities
1733809 we want to do our jobs and do them well
1733810 its a 20 minute boat ride compared to nearly an hour by car if you have to cross the wilson bridge in rush hour
1733811 getting all the federal and state bureaucrats to work together is like herding cats
1733812 education is something that we do in the schools and most importantly in our communities and in the pediatricians office
1733813 how do we do it old fashioned legwork we make sure the right people have the right information we have people who go out at the regional and local level sit down and talk to health care providers and ask what can we do for you cervical cancer is a huge issue for us and now we have this tremendous opportunity to educate and protect women even more
1733814 we are at the beginning of the process but from the anecdotal evidence there appears to be a great demand from parents
1733815 we know that there are parents who have expressed concern about children and childhood vaccines
1733816 our program was designed with an emphasis on education and addressing whatever concerns parents might have
1733817 i would probably be in the camp of those who say we could have gotten a better deal
1733818 advise the county on legislation and attend committee and task force meetings
1733819 the peer pressure is more intense students must become even more focused and disciplined if they are to succeed
1733820 dont think you can sit on your bottom and wait for someone to help you
1733821 it takes a village to raise a child and our village has prepared us to reach new heights
1733822 if we took the world and we re sorted the neighborhoods to be in random locations so that most of the neighborhoods that you would live next to would reflect the average living conditions in the world at large then these problems would get addressed theyd get addressed on pure humanitarian grounds
1733823 there is something intrinsically degrading and demeaning about philanthropy a society in need of philanthropists is one rooted in inequality in which the deprivation of the many is supposedly addressed by the largesse of the few no one can seriously suggest that social problems will be solved in this manner especially in america where an aristocracy has taken shape before our eyes over the past decade and the bush administration is taking blind reckless measures to eliminate all restrictions on the accumulation of personal wealth
1733824 every weekend the dumpster overflows and the boxes get scattered all over the place
1733825 several of us have complained about the smell and asked that the trash be removed more often but nothing happened so all of that cardboard ended up getting wedged between the dumpster and the door thats why the fire ignited so fast
1733826 the rats come in underneath the doors and in between the cracks and hide under the floors
1733827 we have an exterminator who comes in every week but all he can do is run the rats and roaches from one end of the market to the other
1733828 weve always had a problem with parking theyll ticket you just for stopping to unload
1733829 were going to do everything humanly possible to make you whole again
1733830 they say to get something done in the district you need an act of congress or the hand of god
1733831 id say they were between 10 and 13 years old
1733832 in those years ive had a dozen azaleas dug up and stolen downspouts and copper pipes stolen a brass lamp stolen from out front a bicycle stolen off the bike rack on a car in my garage a cadillac deville stolen from in front of my house and air bags stolen out of a honda the houses are nice the lawns well kept but we still have our share of crime
1733833 d c should be careful to not put all of its safety eggs in one basket and should invest in a more balanced public safety approach that includes the kinds of employment and youth development programs that have been shown to reduce crime in other jurisdictions
1733834 weve seen youth violence exaggerated before and were still suffering from poor decisions made in reaction to fear and hype
1733835 its not unusual to go to a park or a playground and find older guys who are smoking and using the foulest language and engaged in behavior that is chilling
1733836 and there are usually younger boys looking up to them imitating them its like a rite of passage
1733837 es dif cil distinguir los c mulos globulares de las estrellas y galaxias usando telescopios de suelo
1733838 nuestro estudio muestra que la eficiencia en la formaci n de los c mulos estelares depende de su entorno
1733839 las galaxias enanas cercanas al abarrotado centro del c mulo de virgo contienen m s c mulos globulares que aquellos m s alejados
1733840 encontramos pocos o ning n c mulos globulares en galaxias dentro de los 130 mil a os luz de messier 87 sugiriendo que la gigante
1733841 en messier 87 hay una deficiencia tres veces mayor de elementos pesados como el hierro que en los c mulos ricos en ellos esto sugiere que muchos de los c mulos estelares pobres en metales han sido robados de galaxias enanas vecinas que tambi n contienen deficiencia en elementos pesados
1733842 la formaci n estelar cerca del n cleo de virgo es muy intensa y ocurre en un peque o vol men a lo largo de una corta cantidad de tiempo ser a m s r pido y eficiente que la formaci n de estrellas en las afueras la alta tasa de formaci n estelar podr a estar generada por el colapso gravitacional de materia oscura una invisible forma de materia que es m s densa y colapsa antes cerca del centro del c mulo messier 87 reside en el centro de una larga concentraci n de materia oscura y todos estos c mulos globulares cerca del centro probablemente se formaron en la historia temprana del c mulo de virgo
1733843 unfortunately this sort of behavior by mexican military personnel has been going on for years
1733844 they are never held accountable and the united states government will undoubtedly brush this off as another case of oh well they didnt know they were in the united states
1733845 it is not an incident that we are aware of
1733846 yeah i heard saw smelled that too whaddaya goin to do
1733847 why doesnt a company of your size have a spare airplane available in case there is a problem
1733848 i booked my tickets three weeks in advance just to prevent this sort of thing from happening
1733849 why dont they have a you are here button on this map
1733850 i have never been to a gas station where someone does their grocery shopping thats why i stopped going other places
1733851 im a mom with two kids if you think this is grocery shopping you should go with me sometime and see what its really like
1733852 yes i will try to get home tonight yes i know you have a meeting tommorow etc etc
1733853 how can there be no more flights well check reagan what kind of service is this
1733854 we pride ourselves on our ability to adapt to our customers changing needs and deliver the services expected of a true business partner and the egencia brand reflects who we truly are as a company
1733855 having led innovation in the corporate travel industry we see this as an opportunity to further define ourselves in the marketplace and set a foundation for further advancements in the years to come
1733856 expedia corporate travel has had a huge impact on the corporate travel industry
1733857 as egencia the company has the platform to grow its position in the marketplace and further evolve to stay ahead of the competition with expedia inc s strength and support this change elevates the company to a whole new level a true win win situation for egencia its customers and partners
1733858 we led a paradigm shift within the industry five years ago when we launched our powerful self booking platform showing companies that they should expect more from their travel management company
1733859 that was just the beginning with todays news i want to send another loud and clear message egencia will continue driving innovation within the industry not because of trends or the latest headlines but through a focused and strategic approach we never lose sight of the fact that were in this business to deliver results that matter to our clients
1733860 expedia corporate travel has been a key partner for continental in reaching additional business travelers around the world allowing us the opportunity to promote our quality service and products to ects very valuable client base
1733861 as egencia the company will continue to be an integral part of our long term distribution strategy particularly in light of their strong management team superior technology and ability to provide true value to our mutual customers
1733862 believing in the honesty goodwill and commitment of others and acting consistent with that belief
1733863 oh crap i wonder if i transferred enough into the personal checking account to cover that key bank automatic payment
1733864 oh i cant afford a luxury like that i dont make enough
1733865 stores look shabby next to those of rivals like target and jc penny dozens of products were sold out much of the commodity merchandise that was in stock was more expensive than nearby competitors people are simply going elsewhere for their shopping experience
1733866 at first we had no idea what it was it could have been in our solar system or at the edge of the universe
1733867 we think that in the recent past the galaxy ic 2497 hosted an enormously bright quasar
1733868 because of the vast scale of the galaxy and the voorwerp light from that past still lights up the nearby voorwerp even though the quasar shut down sometime in the past 100 000 years and the galaxys black hole itself has gone quiet
1733869 from the point of view of the voorwerp the galaxy looks as bright as it would have before the black hole turned off its this light echo that has been frozen in time for us to observe
1733870 its rather like examining the scene of a crime where although we cant see them we know the culprit must be lurking somewhere nearby in the shadows
1733871 the strange hannys voorwerp looks like it could be the nearest example of a luminous quasar
1733872 ic 2497 is so close that if the quasar was still shining today on a good night you could probably see it with a small telescope
1733873 the nearest active quasar called 3c 273 is 1 7 billion light years further away
1733874 this discovery really shows how citizen science has come of age in the internet world
1733875 hannys attentiveness alerted us not only to a peculiar object but to a window into the cosmic past which might have eluded us for a long time otherwise trying to understand the processes operating here has proven to be a fascinating challenge involving a whole range of astrophysical techniques and instruments around the world and beyond this has also been some of the most rewarding astronomy ive done in years
1733876 when we launched galaxy zoo we were overwhelmed as was the internet portal initially with the outpouring of public interest and volunteer input
1733877 its amazing to think that this object has been sitting in the archives for decades and that amateur volunteers can help by spotting things like this online
1733878 it was a fantastic present to find out on my 25th birthday that we will get observational time on the hubble space telescope to follow up this discovery
1733879 so long as a spirit does not rise above tile body consciousness it remains a stranger to the spiritual realms beyond
1733880 in roman catholic theology the beatific vision is the eternal and direct perception of god enjoyed by those who are in heaven imparting supreme happiness or blessedness while humans understanding of god while alive is indirect mediated the beatific vision is direct immediate thomas aquinas defined the beatific vision as the ultimate end of human existence after physical death aquinass formulation of beholding god in heaven parallels platos description of one beholding the good in the world of knowledge

1733887 an animal with his head downwards may well think of eating and drinking all the time but fie on man with his head erect if he were not to look upward
1733888 as the spirit transcends the physical plane it has to pass through various realms characterized by stars the sun and the moon
1733889 the spirit as it withdraws from the body proceeds by degrees from one plane to another until it reaches sat naam or haq from what has been said it should be clear that so far the spirit is an entity quite apart from sat naam the over lord of all is called khasum lord of all swami hari raj maha dayal or nirala unique in himself and indescribable the spirit gets merged in him just as a drop of water loses itself in the ocean or a ray of light in the sun
1733890 as water mingles with the water so doth light merge in the light
1733891 as a ray of light gets absorbed in the sun and a drop in the ocean
1733892 for the last three years the entire team at mythic has poured their hearts into making warhammer online the next great mmorpg
1733893 i watched the 2000 election and i was stunned that we didnt know how to count ballots
1733894 this was conceived as a pilot project for sacramento county calif in december 2000
1733895 we have some of the best legal minds in the nation working to resolve our issue just as soon as possible so that we can return to normal operation
1733896 until its resolved keep the faith if god be for us who can be against us

1733910 the map is the most precise depiction yet of the limits and the future dividing lines that could be drawn across the arctic region
1733911 the results have huge implications for policy making as the rush to carve up the polar region continues
1733912 its a cartographic means of showing and an attempt to collate information and predict the way in which the arctic region may eventually be divided up the freezing land and seas of the arctic are likely to be getting hotter in terms of geopolitics the durham map aims to assist national and international policy makers across the world

1733914 the berger foundation understands the rotation adjustment for the 50th anniversary and is anticipating added events for the classic club that will add financial support for valley charities along with the bob hope chrysler classic event
1733915 we are looking forward with great anticipation to our 50th anniversary tournament
1733916 we are excited about the courses in our 2009 rotation and we know they will offer excellent competitive conditions for our professionals and amateurs
1733917 classic club is a wonderful challenging course donated to the tournament by the berger foundation
1733918 it provides the bob hope chrysler classic organization with significant flexibility now and in the future because the tournament format includes the use of private clubs the rotation is set annually thus in 2010 and beyond the rotation will be reviewed for the good of the tournament
1733919 this is another one of the guys who is a big piece of what were building here its going to be great to see him get the experience and get it started right here
1733920 i think hes still coming back from the problems hes had
1733921 i know hes given up a lot of runs but i still believe hes there hes getting there anyway
1733922 while the chinese government gets ready to invite the entire world for a big celebration theyre using their other hand to repress six million tibetans
1733923 theyre using tibetan people as dancers in the opening ceremony theyre using all kinds of propaganda to let the world think that the tibetan people are happy under chinese rule were here to tell our side and the truth
1733924 we demand that authorities and mps take effective measures immediately and punish the violation of law
1733925 so many policemen are there but they are unable to do what they should do they should immediately remove these people from our entrance
1733926 the fighting phase is over in this area and now negotiations are being held with the people
1733927 we will definitely capture all those posts vacated by the fc in ladha and saam
1733928 armed conflicts in which peoples are fighting against colonial domination and alien occupation and against racist regimes in the exercise of their right of self determination
1733929 execution of prisoners of war is a breach of the international law and considered an act of assassination and another murder in cold blood
1733930 this is a butchery of justice in sudan and yet another example of an impotent judiciary that is under the influence of the executive branch this proves there is no genuine judiciary in sudan to prosecute anyone let alone perpetrators of genocide and war crimes
1733931 why would the kurdish freedom movement do something which would be so damaging to it
1733932 all of the dimensions of the attack have been revealed
1733933 its time to work on inheriting political stream in lebanon without a rude entrance or through iranian and syrian intelligence networks as did fatah al islam last year in the palestinian refugee camp of nahr al barid such a wrong approach inflicted a double loss on the lebanese sunnis
1733934 the reason for speaking indirectly was that the brothers in fatah al islam were being accused by the agents of america of being a branch of al qaida and the brothers were denying that so i feared that if i supported them openly i would cause difficulties for them at a time when we were unable to extend to them a helping hand
1733935 what shaykh kabbani said about the struggle being between hezbollah and the sunnis is false the struggle is political between a u s zionist project and forces of resistance extending beyond lebanon some insist on giving this struggle a religious nature to please washington or some arab rulers
1733936 lebanon is not one country but rather many countries at war with each other shiites have their state maronites have their state and the u s spies pretending to belong to the sunnis have a state the army cant touch any of them but because the mujahideen in our arab world dont have a state to protect them it was necessary to eliminate any pure islamic jihadi movement that wouldnt acquiesce to oppression
1733937 there is a limited and very small number of the mujahedeen brothers who fought in iraq that came back and joined us

1733940 trabajos que jam s hubiera imaginado como negociar mano a mano con las compa as que dise an los carteles de las pel culas o las que los colocan en los taxis de nueva york
1733941 es dif cil pero no imposible nos dimos cuenta que pod amos hacer lo mismo que hacen las grandes distribuidoras se trata de contratar a las mismas personas que trabajan para ellos y es algo que se puede hacer por menos dinero del que se piensa
1733942 por menos dinero del que un estudio dice porque son los estudios los que suben los precios
1733943 ha sido como una ultramarat n pero hacer una pel cula no es barato y qu menos que lograr una distribuci n digna podr a decir que distribuir una pel cula es m s dif cil que dirigirla
1733944 lo m s complicado es que la gente se entere de que una pel cula existe y eso es lo que vale m s dinero pero parece que hemos encontrado a los mejores profesionales en ese sentido
1733945 hemos aprendido mucho en el a o que hemos invertido en este proyecto hemos estudiado mucho para saber qu pasos dar as que ahora vamos a seguir ese camino

1733962 there is a substantial bid on the table for zheng zhi which our board are considering
1733963 for us it is a disappointment we would have hoped these issues would be clear to our social partners who have been part of the process of negotiations in terms of the electricity and production issues
1733964 the reality is that all countries are affected by higher food and fuel costs and there is unfortunately very little the government can do in the short term to address these problems

1733967 the presidency categorically rejects all allegations made in the so called report the presidency denies categorically that mbeki facilitated any money
1733968 obviously in the presidency we have decided to take legal advice and once the legal advice is given the president will take the necessary steps
1733969 these are rehashed allegations time and time again there is this assertion that it must be inherently the case that if we are dealing in arms there must be kick backs

1733977 your world frightens and confuses me sometimes the honking horns of your traffic make me want to get out of my bmw and run off into the hills or wherever sometimes when i get a message on my fax machine i wonder did little demons get inside and type it i dont know my primitive mind cant grasp these concepts
1733978 a close race down to the wire only one winner thanks i accept
1733979 we think were probably only using 30 or 40 per cent of the power of the ps3 right now and theres this great untapped potential
1733980 all third party developers can get the edge libraries for free and are going to be able to use them in their own ways to get more and more and more out of the ps3 over the years
1733981 were always trading war stories with insomniac and evolution and sucker punch were just one block away from sony santa monica the guys who made god of war and we get our designers together with theirs for formal lunches and just talk about tools design approaches and so on
1733982 i am happy to welcome werner because i know him well and i know he can be a good second coach
1733983 now we have a technical team and i dont think well make any other changes for the moment we must focus on achieving success
1733984 we put a lot of work into the appeal and i am very happy we secured the work permit
1733985 but we did not believe that he deserves a better contract what we want is to see performances from him commensurate with his quality
1733986 he already has a good contract and has received the loyalty of the club who pays him to play for valencia
1733987 ive not been forwarded an offer for joaqu n but well talk at length until the 17th then well see
1733988 joaqu n is not angry at valencia and we must understand in the last two years issues have been very rare
1733989 we might well start 2008 09 with largely the squad we had last season and after all they didnt do too badly
1733990 we have not brought in the kind of top quality player everyone seems to be expecting
1733991 we are still researching and looking but it is not easy and certainly we are not desperate
1733992 we have the right balance of youth and experience thanks to the work we did in the transfer market the previous year
1733993 in terms of numbers we have been boosted by the return from loan of several young players who have the potential to go all the way
1733994 if everyone was fit and i know in a perfect world that can happen but not always in football weve got a pretty strong squad
1733995 i would still like to strengthen and im confident well bring in at least two possibly three more faces
1733996 and if those players are of the quality of the likes of gutierrez and guthrie then well take our chances
1733997 what we would define as success this season is always a difficult question to answer
1733998 but it is clear there are two trophies we are focused on the premier league and the champions league
1733999 after that the fa cup but we will never go seriously for the carling cup again this year we will have the same philosophy on the carling cup
1734000 the premier league and champions league are the trophies we will fight for
1734001 it is not wrong to call arsenal a young side still but it is wrong to call us inexperienced
1734002 cesc fabregas for example has already played in an fa cup final a champions league final and also now a european championship final so you cannot say he has no experience
1734003 there is competition for places which drives you on but until you are at the stage when you are not needed then you have to move on ive not felt like that but who knows what the future holds
1734004 its nice to have him fit because players always want to play and it will have been hard for daniel to deal with not being fit for so long it must have been devastating for him to be out for almost a whole season
1734005 it is not something i would really know about because i have never suffered that kind of thing but im sure it was very difficult for him but i am really glad that he is back and he can help the team to win trophies
1734006 i am sure the manager is happy because it means he has five centre backs to choose from now that means we all have to fight for our place but that is the way it has always been at liverpool and this season will be no different
1734007 in footballing terms i feel well as though i have life again
1734008 i made up my mind that i would leave roma at the end of the season with anything concrete in mind but psg came and sorted everything out very quickly
1734009 i wasnt well in roma i wanted to live this challenge with psg
1734010 when i arrived in paris monaco and barcelona i quickly felt the respect of the club and fans but in rome i never felt the same way

1734014 it is difficult to compare 2008 to the activity of 2006 and 2007 because they were booming years for automotive deals
1734015 with the decline of mega deals there has been a large decline in the overall disclosed deal value however deal volume has seen only a moderate decline
1734016 the automotive sector continues to restructure in response to the challenges of a changing global economy managing rising commodity costs and manufacturing footprint realignment will be keys to success in the global automotive industry in the next decade m amp a continues to play a major role and serves as a catalyst to help advance this transformation of the industry
1734017 historically transactions in the second half of the year represent a larger proportion of full year deal value
1734018 therefore the total disclosed deal value for the first half of 2008 may not accurately project year end figures
1734019 by establishing a local presence in south africa we are making a commitment to expand our production and service capabilities in this growing market
1734020 we believe customers will benefit from faster response time and direct access to all of wabtecs products and services
1734021 oil marketing companies will resume imports for the period when indeni will be shut down
1734022 we are extremely pleased with these contracts as this indicates that our turnaround in security is giving us traction in terms of securing new business
1734023 your world frightens and confuses me sometimes the honking horns of your traffic make me want to get out of my bmw and run off into the hills or wherever sometimes when i get a message on my fax machine i wonder did little demons get inside and type it i dont know my primitive mind cant grasp these concepts
1734024 when you meet a man dont you always idly wonder what hed be like in bed i do
1734025 terrifying at first but now shes so good she can take me to my gigs
1734026 love i asked him what hed like to do next
1734027 i want to do it all in the next three months
1734028 women will say to me they dont know what is in fashion anymore that their body is completely different after having children and that they dont have the time to shop
1734029 some compensate by wearing baggy clothes others give up on the idea of fashion because it seems too overwhelming
1734030 when the kids were in preschool i never left the house without makeup
1734031 at the beginning of my career i could never write for women but after beginning working and ultimately cohabiting with diane keaton during the first stage production of play it again sam by some kind of socratic osmosis or something i found that i could write for women then i sort of only wrote for women i wrote more and more for women and i wrote for them all the time
1734032 i get a big kick out of them and for some reason i find them interesting to write about men occasionally but really my heart is in it more when im writing for women and i dont know why
1734033 i dont care how many statues of him there are or how many people dress like him for halloween he is a person after all hes simply very shy
1734034 we took pictures with the statue hugging him he allen asked for the pictures i dont know if we gave them to him i think scarlett has them
1734035 when i look you in the eyes my boner gets head strong and can take on anyone
1734036 to have come from last season to this the sublime to the ridiculous is very sore we did not do enough on the night
1734037 i thought it would bring out the best in them because of what was at stake
1734038 we should have won the home leg its just not good enough
1734039 i dont think we would have lost that game last season we were a harder team to beat maybe we thought that because we played in a uefa cup final we dont need to do the nasty bits of the game anymore
1734040 im not picking out any individual its as a team collectively we need to get back to basics and start pulling in the one direction again
1734041 maybe it was my fault because of the chance i had you have to score those chances i cannot think of a worse night its a catastrophe
1734042 its definitely the worst night of my career and its so disappointing
1734043 its easy to blame the manager or other things but the players need to do a little more
1734044 there is a substantial bid on the table and i think the board are contemplating that
1734045 there are one or two clubs who have expressed an interest in zheng zhi and i dont think it is fair on us or the clubs to name them there are some decisions im afraid i cant dictate and one of those decisions is the finance they need to keep this clubs head above water
1734046 im never going to interfere with that because it is the club which has to survive not me as a manager or any individual player
1734047 the bottom line is the security of this club and if they say these players have to go for the security of this club then they have to go

1734053 they are very hard to find its like archeology it takes a huge amount of research to come up with something that will fit
1734054 he made a very brave stand a resolute stand in which he decided that he wasnt going to blab everything to the press
1734055 and in the meantime while he kept it quiet he was buying time from the terrorists to get all that stuff out of the country so thats what was done he just very quietly kept his mouth shut
1734056 were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government i should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter but i should mean that every man should receive those papers and be capable of reading them

1734075 im excited to be a part of the bad boy team and i will do my best to represent them well
1734076 in the best interest of the military and the u s taxpayers
1734077 i have a lot of arab business partners i do a lot of business in the middle east ive got a lot of friends
1734078 i ask my friends to support candidates that i think are worthy of supporting they usually come through for me
1734079 a local person but i would like not to talk about it anymore
1734080 what we would define as success this season is always a difficult question to answer
1734081 but it is clear there are two trophies we are focused on the premier league and the champions league
1734082 after that the fa cup but we will never go seriously for the carling cup again this year we will have the same philosophy on the carling cup
1734083 the premier league and champions league are the trophies we will fight for
1734084 we want to give hope and belief to all our supporters ahead of the new season and we know we can only do that if we play our usual game full of quality
1734085 it is not wrong to call arsenal a young side still but it is wrong to call us inexperienced
1734086 cesc fabregas for example has already played in a fa cup final a champions league final and also now a european championships final so you cannot say he has no experience
1734087 we believe tomas could be available in september and eduardo maybe in november
1734088 if we have everybody on board and nobody injured then okay but maybe we could do to take one more experienced player
1734089 i am witnessing myself behaving this way and in spite of my best intentions i cant seem to do it differently
1734090 i dont think its a good idea i think more offshore drilling is a ridiculous idea i dont think it will do anything to help the people i think it will do a great deal to help the oil companies i think it will prolong our dependence on fossil fuels even longer unfortunately politics is all about compromise and if it takes that to get things moving well have to accept it
1734091 im not interested in the perfect being the enemy of the good
1734092 the way he described this particular compromise yes thats acceptable to me things have to move forward so if it takes that im okay with it
1734093 i think all the talk of the race card the last few days is ludicrous i believe that race can definitely be a factor in the campaign it could definitely sway someone in terms of who they like or dont like but i think obama has done a good job so far of keeping focused on the issues instead of going off on these tangents that the media likes to blow up i really wish people would take the time and do the research to really understand the issues instead of focusing on britney spears and all these ridiculous issues that dont matter the media loves to focus on those things and not on the subjects that matter
1734094 well they certainly cant say this man isnt just totally substance this nonsense about comparing him to people with no substance is ridiculous it was fabulous and a great plan for the next ten years its a marvelous doable idea and im ready to roll up my sleeves to get going

1734111 salim hamdan is not one of the worlds most dangerous terrorists
1734112 has worked as well as anybody could have asked it has been an open and fair and thorough process
1734113 may be the dumbest chip off the block but the fact is he was driving bin laden he was involved in al qaeda activities he didnt have to be a mastermind

1734119 i wish to challenge the legality of the proceedings in their entirety
1734120 so that we may ascertain whether this case is legally tenable i propose that you order that richard holbrooke appear before you and declare under oath whether or not there was such an agreement and whether the usa complied with its obligations from that agreement

1734129 the testimony of clement is very brief but altogether conclusive it is that the apostles were accustomed to settle ministers with the cordial consent of the whole church there is no fair or even plausible method of explaining away this statement it unequivocally implies that at the very least the deliberate opposition of the congregation to the person who might have been suggested or recommended as their pastor was held by the apostles as of itself quite a sufficient reason why his appointment should not take place there is not the slightest ground to doubt that this practice of the apostles was uniformly observed not only during the first three centuries but for several centuries afterwards and on the contrary there is a great deal that confirms it

1734168 i think all of us sometimes choose to hear what we want to hear
1734169 but under the parameters we were given for the federal law we didnt have a choice
1734170 it was a tough decision for all of us because the state law and the federal law are at odds
1734171 virtually none of the evidence we wanted to present was presented
1734172 in that sense its not that surprising that the jury came to the decision it did
1734173 were pleased with the fact that the jury followed the law
1734174 the public in southern california is threatened by this situation and must take this threat seriously

1734178 what troubles me is that mr ivins wasnt indicted and if he wasnt indicted how confidant are they that they had the evidence and the information that they needed
1734179 the only thing that has changed is that he has committed suicide
1734180 i think its important to give all of us victims and the american people information that they can share and some appreciation of the overall state of the investigation
1734181 but i also think its important given the mistakes made in the past that they are not jumping to premature conclusions
1734182 all of us dont think he had anything to do with it
1734183 i just have to see what theyve got you work mostly with scientists and they say show me the data you look at what youve got make a decision and then act on it

1734208 against the idea of using a dynamic equivalent translation as his main bible
1734209 always wonders if more interpreting is going on than with a more literal approach
1734210 i was also pleased to learn from esteban v zquez that all of the nlt translators had written at least a commentary on the books that they translated before this translation was produced
1734211 a functional translation that doesnt feel like it is speaking down to an adult christian

1734214 mimpi seorang mukmin adalah satu juzuk dari 45 juzuk kenabian
1734215 mimpi ada tiga jenis khabar gembira dari allah percakapan dalam diri sendiri dan ancaman ketakutan dari syaitan jika seseorang dari kamu melihat mimpi yang menggembirakannya ceritakanlah mimpi itu jika ia mahu jika ia melihat sesuatu yang dibencinya janganlah ia menceritakannya kepada sesiapa akan tetapi hendaklah ia bangun menunaikan solat
1734216 adakah orang biasa atau orang awam seperti kita layak mendapat petunjuk dari allah melalui mimpi
1734217 ayat ini menunjukkan sah harus mimpi orang kafir terutamanya jika berkait dengan urusan orang mukmin
1734218 sesiapa ingin agar mimpinya sentiasa benar hendaklah ia sentiasa jujur benar memakan yang halal menjaga perintah dan tegahan allah tidur dalam keadaan suci yakni tidak berhadas dan berzikir kepada allah hinggalah terlelap matanya nescaya mimpinya hampir tidak akan berdusta bila bila pun

1734244 i was shocked to see these walls its a new apartheid barbaric behavior how can you impose such a collective punishment and separate people after all we are all living on the same planet it seems to me the world should have already learned from what happened in south africa and a country that hasnt learned should be boycotted so thats why i dont perform in your country
1734245 im not competitive with them actresses i root for all of them because we definitely dont have equality with men in this business

1734276 his attorneys say a drug he is taking for migraine headaches could affect the execution process the drug topamax a type of seizure medication may have created a resistance to thiopental the drug used to put inmates to sleep before two other lethal drugs are administered cooeys weight combined with the potential drug resistance increases the risk he would not be properly anesthetized
1734277 he was viciously attacked by the media about jeremiah wright
1734278 it drives me nuts when people give the thumbs down just because they disagree with the comment
1734279 you got to be kidding me there isnt even a choice here you dumb are going to elect mccain arent you this is just fodder to fuel the stealing of the election by diebold and republican voter purges once again this god forsaken country ill see you in hell which should open up and swallow detroit any second now
1734280 ll see you in hell which should open up and swallow detroit any second now
1734281 i really dont understand how it could ever be this close
1734282 omg they are ratcheting up the propaganda to try to blame iraq for 9 11 so they can invade it
1734283 if it were obvious that the election was rigged people might actually educate themselves and vote for a candidate that supports the constitution
1734284 but the trip quickly became fodder for an aggressive mccain campaign strategy that included a tv ad comparing the celebrity status of barack obama to that of brittney spears and paris hilton
1734285 i don t like either candidate i guess ill go for the lesser of two evils why cant we have someone i agree with
1734286 the mccain camp seems to have turned lemons into lemonade
1734287 when drilling is increased the speculation of future oil output supply foreign dependency improves causing the price to drop alot sooner than 2030
1734288 also what of people are driving around with poorly inflated tires less than 10 for sure
1734289 more than a quarter of all cars and nearly one third of all suvs vans and pickups are driven with tires at least 8 pounds below their proper levels according to a new survey by the department of transportation
1734290 i can guarantee you that half of all drivers in the united states are not rollin on under inflated tires but i encourage you to find any fact to support that you my friend have no business voting
1734291 however obama himself voted for a 2005 energy bill backed by bush that included billions in subsidies for oil and natural gas production a measure cheney played a major role in developing mccain opposed the bill on grounds it included billions in unnecessary tax breaks for the oil industry the obama campaign has said the illinois senator supported the legislation because it included huge investments in renewable energy
1734292 so anyone who doesnt arrive at the same conclusions you do has no business voting wow is that what all liberals think
1734293 a bill of rights is what the people are entitled to against every government and what no just government should refuse or rest on inference
1734294 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
1734295 oh man obama said i should keep my tires properly inflated i guess that means i should drive around with 20 psi and 1 flat tire anymore
1734296 overall there were an estimated 250 851 833 registered passenger vehicles in the united states according to a 2006 dot study
1734297 also just because you keep copy paste ing that comment that doesnt make it true
1734298 obama a couple of days ago said that we ought to all inflate our tires and i dont disagree with that the american automobile association strongly recommends it
1734299 mccain thinks have proper tire inflation is good who doesn t but it is not a country s energy policy
1734300 no archie it will not have a quicker effect unless you make it mandatory to have properly inflated tires
1734301 we would have the same effect as mccains plan if we just filled our tires with air
1734302 mccain was making fun of the fact that obama basically stated
1734303 mccain never said filling tires with air wouldnt help at all he just mocked the fact that it would break oil independence and create as much oil as offshore drilling which it wont
1734304 u s auto makers debunk mccain on value of tire inflation
1734305 in conclusion please dont make stupid comments on subjects you dont know anything about and its not a band aid 3 is a real amount
1734306 in conclusion please dont make stupid comments on subjects you dont know anything about and its not a band aid 3 is a real amount
1734307 correct tire pressure will relieve our dependence on the middle east
1734308 it was moronic because he took it a step further and suggested that keeping tires properly inflated would save as much fuel as offshore drilling would produce that is the part he was ridiculed for and for good reason
1734309 there are things you can do individually though to save energy making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups youd actually save just as much
1734310 looks like digg is doing everything they can to try to convince people that this idiotic statement by obama holds some merit
1734311 it does say alot about the intelligence of the average mccain follower compared to the average obama follower
1734312 washington d c april 23 2006 the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa statistics show that about one in every three cars has a significantly under inflated tire and that 660 fatalities and 33 000 injuries occur every year as a result of low tire pressure related crashes aaa reports that each year they receive about 4 million roadside assistance calls due to tire related incidents not surprisingly a 2006 rubber manufacturers association rma survey found that more than 80 percent of drivers do not know how to properly check their tire pressure
1734313 the federal government estimates the nations outer continental shelf might hold 85 9 billion barrels of crude including 10 13 billion barrels off california
1734314 saying that is the equivalent of drilling hundred of thousands of extra barrels of oil is insanely wrong
1734315 what would it mean for our church to have a genuine missionary encounter with our neighbors

1734378 the video to hurt by johnny cash it only seems to make men cry the harder the man the more it gets to them
1734379 i reckon men cry at odd times because they withhold the tears at more obvious times it has to leak out some time but social conditioning frequently hinders this this possibly explains why i often feel like crying when im reading some childrens books aloud to our two floss and the secret garden can raise a few
1734380 saying goodbye to my mum for the last time when the crematorium groundsman and i scattered her ashes

1734387 pictures of the earth from space seem to make me well up it just seems to have a profound effect on me that im unable to sum up with words
1734388 the strangest thing that has ever set me off was listening to the radio and hearing concorde land for the very last time i dont even like planes but it made me blub
1734389 the last time i cried would have been at a mates wedding he got emotional during the speeches and that was it for me also anything of people showing extreme bravery especially to save others brings a tear to the eye oh and 65 000 people singing the welsh national anthem at the millennium stadium

1734401 what always gets me is the veterans on remembrance sunday in their wheelchairs shaking with old age and still making it to give respect to their old mates after having lived a compromised life for 80 years or so for some of them with the trauma of the memories and nightmares that dont go away now that is sacrifice
1734402 i cried at the birth of both my children they are now teenagers they presented me with the most wonderful handmade fathers day card filled with poems quotes of mine and endless praise and thanks for the guidance and advice i have given them i wept openly it was the best fathers day present ever i showed the card to my parents and it had the same effect i am a security officer on the outside but a big old softie at heart

1734405 after visiting my grandfathers grave in hermanville sur mer war cemetery france for the first time in august 2005 with my father i noticed that his headstone didnt have any personal message engraved i asked my father in all innocence why this was so he promptly burst into tears saying that the british government charged families in the 1940s for this service and his newly widowed mother with two young children couldnt afford it i promised him there and then that i would arrange it for him finally in december 2007 i received pictures from the commonwealth war graves commission showing that it had at last been done i got the pictures printed and rushed them to him as he lay in hospital he finally saw them on 5 december 2007 and gave my mother the thumbs up the next day he succumbed to secondary cancer that gets me every time

1734416 visiting the imperial commonwealth war grave cemetery in oosterbeek the netherlands and seeing the rows of headstones marking the graves of those who died in operation market garden during ww2 is a highly emotional experience and ones vision can get a bit watery at the thought of so many young lives wasted

1734422 our blog site immediately plugged a gap by allowing us to showcase our work every day and reach an audience who may not otherwise see it our journalists and photographers still put in the old fashioned legwork to get pictures and stories it can be frustrating when those are not picked up by the daily newspapers

1734452 el exceso o plus de la certificaci n no es marginal le otorga poderes extraordinarios al presidente de estados unidos para constituirse en un co gobernante de nuestro pa s ya que con esos poderes podr seguirle exigiendo a costa rica reformas legislativas y reglamentarias como requisito para que entre en vigencia el tratado
1734453 usted arias afirm que los proyectos no ir an m s all de los compromisos adquiridos en el tratado pero las acciones en cuanto a la certificaci n y otras reformas promovidas por su gobierno demuestran lo contrario
1734454 introducir reformas que no se derivan del tlc votado el 7 de octubre constituye un atentado contra la institucionalidad democr tica y una burla a la voluntad de los costarricenses utilizar el voto ciudadano como respaldo democr tico para hacer reformas que ni siquiera fueron sugeridas constituye una afrenta peligrosa contra los principios democr ticos m s elementales

1734457 despu s de esto c mo pueden esperar que tengamos confianza en ellos para dialogar
1734458 cu les son los factores externos que provocan que el pln y pusc se desdigan de su palabra para nosotros este asunto se debe a que despu s de que ellos aceptaron en nombre de costa rica una certificaci n que no estaba en el tlc del refer ndum del 7 de octubre agendas externas ahora les tuercen el brazo

1734472 michaels got a great record in penalty shootouts so we felt confident that if we put them away we had the goalkeeper to stop one for us
1734473 michael was outstanding when your goalkeeper is one of your best players you know youve not played your best football but you come away thinking thats not a bad team to get a result like that
1734474 its been a perfect preparation for the a league season
1734475 they look good i think they looked pretty smart actually
1734476 i was a bit concerned when they got described to me but i think they looked pretty smart i think they the swimmers like the big yellow stars on them
1734477 its nothing formal i think he prefers the informal thing more than anything else i hope that he is not mobbed like roger federer and rafael nadal have been
1734478 weve always had a very high regard for his ability hes a player of real talent
1734479 we wouldnt be different to any other club in that we would be interested if he was to become available and wanted to come home
1734480 ive got a responsibility to our members and supporters for the good of the essendon football club and what we think could strengthen our list
1734481 well discuss all options at the end of the year and you cant put anything out of the equation
1734482 alan didak thats an interesting one we havent looked at that yet so we will just wait and see at the end of the year
1734483 its all too speculative for us to have thought about it those list issues we will look at later
1734484 clearly if a player of the stature of jonathan brown is uncontracted there is always going to be speculation that comes with the territory
1734485 this has to be the next group of socceroos and one thing i am proud of is that this is an a league side more or less
1734486 two or three play in europe but not at top clubs so its basically an a league olympic team and it will be interesting to see where theyre at
1734487 a couple of them have been struggling to find time on the ball in the warm up fixtures because its such a faster pace than the a league
1734488 but thankfully weve had those games against what i believe are three medal candidates losses to china japan and south korea
1734489 of course you come here with the ambition to get a medal that has to be the goal
1734490 but look at the 2004 olympic team weve only really got three socceroos out of that group in jade north ahmad elrich and luke wilkshire
1734491 these are the next batch we need to step up because if we dont qualify for the next world cup the current group of senior players are finished
1734492 if we do qualify still most of the so called golden generation of 2000 will be done by 2010 so we need these boys to step up if we can get five or six of them to come through then its been good development
1734493 i cant get them any fitter so this week has been about freshening them up and keeping them relaxed
1734494 the fact youre out of australia and cant read the newspapers helps weve given them a good experience of two days in the village to give them a taste of being an olympian but then its been back to normal
1734495 six months ago i was sitting in a hospital bed not knowing whether id play again
1734496 theyd just found a 10cm clot in my shoulder i went home for christmas on december 24 flew back on the 25th and my arm was a bit bigger than the other one it seemed to get bigger still and then we had a game on the 28th
1734497 in the 70th minute i had to go off it was pretty bad and i got taken to hospital at 7am the next morning

1734514 the drying device known as a lyophilizer could help investigators explain how he might have been able to send letters containing deadly anthrax spores to u s senators and news organizations
1734515 the device was not commonly used by researchers at the armys sprawling biodefense complex at fort detrick md
1734516 i guess the way we solve crimes in this country is to confront people in shopping malls to see if the person in question commits suicide as a result

1734528 if the pins are on top of all these hills it could be borderline impossible to shoot anywhere near par but if you have pins down the bottom of the slopes and the tees up it will be a bit more playable
1734529 you have to be patient in majors and im definitely more patient
1734530 im just accepting what happens its frustrating when you hit bad shots or miss putts but it lasts with me for 25 seconds and its done
1734531 by the time i get to the next shot its no longer with me and i think thats why ive played better this year
1734532 sometimes you can want something too much and put a lot of pressure on yourself and thats what ive done in the past
1734533 i have decided to focus all my energy on to the relay
1734534 unfortunately when you have won before you know what it takes to be no 1 so when you know you are not there you know how far away you are
1734535 whereas in the years before i could kid myself and keep telling myself it is ok
1734536 physically every time i have gotten better this year something else has happened because i have always been pushing the envelope
1734537 i had more to lose coming out here and running bad than staying at home to be honest
1734538 i could have taken the easy option and stayed at home but i believe i have worked this hard to get to where i am now and there are five other guys depending on me
1734539 in my head i think im no 1 we all know that so for me to sit back and put all my energy into a relay where i started in 04 i mean you are meant to get better not go back but this is the way it is
1734540 this year i have had two coaching changes appendix surgery two hamstring tears and been fighting with athletics australia
1734541 i mean going to court cases with athletics australia isnt really like the best preparation for the olympics
1734542 i dont blame anyone but myself im the one doing it so all i can do is learn from it and move on i am 25 this isnt it for john steffensen this is just another chapter in my career
1734543 we have asked them to put on bigger buses like the coaches that were used to with some more padded seats to make the ride more comfortable
1734544 we expect that to happen but it takes a couple of days to sort out
1734545 lance armstrong is the guy that i looked to before i even came down with this disease and was diagnosed with this
1734546 when you look at what he did after he was diagnosed and treated for it you cant help but be inspired by that also to know i will be cured and i will beat this is a pretty inspiring thought too and that its not going to control my life
1734547 a lot of times when you get to an event like this like the olympics games you can put maybe too much pressure on yourself
1734548 i have kind of got an out in cancer in that it kind of keeps things in perspective for me
1734549 there is a lot more to life than just the olympic games
1734550 what i show the general public is obviously the positive side but i am human and this has been a rollercoaster ride
1734551 it was a physical game we expected that but it was definitely a high quality game weve got a long way to go before we see them again i look forward to seeing them again
1734552 australia is a very good team and we were fortunate to pull it out this is our third game as a unit and we have gotten better with each game and that is a good sign
1734553 we have eight more to go hopefully and as long as we continue to get better and work we will be ok

1734591 now the real nature of calvinistic soteriology becomes plain it is no artificial oddity nor a product of overbold logic its central confession that god saves sinners that christ redeemed us by his blood is the witness both of the bible and of the believing heart the calvinist is the christian who confesses before men in his theology just what he believes in his heart before god when he prays he thinks and speaks at all times of the sovereign grace of god in the way that every christian does when he pleads for the souls of others or when he obeys the impulse of worship which rises unbidden within him prompting him to deny himself all praise and to give all the glory of his salvation to his savior calvinism is the natural theology written on the heart of the new man in christ whereas arminianism is an intellectual sin of infirmity natural only in the sense in which all such sins are natural even to the regenerate calvinistic thinking is the christian being himself on the intellectual level arminian thinking is the christian failing to be himself through the weakness of the flesh calvinism is what the christian church has always held and taught when its mind has not been distracted by controversy and false traditions from attending to what scripture actually says that is the significance of the patristic testimonies to the teaching of the five points which can be quoted in abundance owen appends a few on redemption a much larger collection may be seen in john gills the cause of god and truth so that really it is most misleading to call this soteriology calvinism at all for it is not a peculiarity of john calvin and the divines of dort but a part of the revealed truth of god and the catholic christian faith calvinism is one of the odious names by which down the centuries prejudice has been raised against it but the thing itself is just the biblical gospel
1734592 i mean to live my life an obedient man but obedient to god subservient to the wisdom of my ancestors never to the authority of political truths arrived at yesterday at the voting booth
1734593 in my opinion the best thing you can do is find a person who loves you for exactly what you are good mood bad mood ugly pretty handsome what have you the right person will still think the sun shines out your ass thats the kind of person thats worth sticking with
1734594 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
1734595 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
1734596 the schools stare fixedly into the past as we hurtle pell mell into the future
1734597 they are characteristics of the spirit mood language and process of science they are operative wherever evidence of social change can be found
1734598 a new kind of person one who is an actively inquiring flexible creative innovative tolerant liberal personality who can face uncertainty and ambiguity without disorientation who can formulate viable new meanings to meet changes in the environment which threaten individual and mutual survival
1734599 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
1734600 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
1734601 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
1734602 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
1734603 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
1734604 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
1734605 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
1734606 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
1734607 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

1734610 i dont support agricultural subsidies no matter where they are
1734611 the farm bill 300 billion is something america simply cant afford
1734612 for sure he cant lose missouri and thats in the upper midwest could he lose iowa minnesota and wisconsin and still be elected president yes but i wouldnt advise him to have that strategy
1734613 i dont see any scenario in which mccain can get to the white house without carrying some upper midwestern states
1734614 ive never really understood in all my years why sen mccain has gone out of his way to speak against and vote against policies that are important to the upper midwest
1734615 the upper midwest is crucial in this election and midwestern voters value authenticity they value experience
1734616 i dont think agricultural issues are the only issues midwestern voters care about there are some bigger picture issues broader issues where hes strong
1734617 were employing close to 2 000 people right now in iowa in the wind energy industry
1734618 it does challenge him in states like iowa the no 1 ethanol state
1734619 thats where hes got a problem hes got to find his own voice and so far he hasnt had a voice
1734620 president bush and i just had a good conversation about how critically important ethanol is and how iowa is positioned so well to lead the nation
1734621 i have no idea why john mccain doesnt support it it hurts him in indiana and missouri and ohio and its not the message right now that any of us want to hear
1734622 iowa minnesota wisconsin and perhaps indiana are very important states mccain is behind and hes in danger of falling further behind
1734623 one list from someone who has not been to youngstown and seen what is going on doesnt have much credibility with me you can take data and have the data say anything you want
1734624 thanks to mary jo kilroy you the taxpayer will pay 215 000 more than necessary to build the franklin county baseball stadium

1734630 it is very difficult and is a very logistically intensive business that we have been able to specialize in

1734634 a local person but i would like not to talk about it anymore
1734635 im involved in the restaurant business my brother faisel recommended john mccain whenever he makes a recommendation we do it
1734636 why does it matter who im telling you we made the contribution we funneled it through the channel in florida because thats the contact we had i was responsible for collecting it
1734637 sometimes our light goes out but is blown into flame by another human being each of us owes deepest thanks to those who have rekindled this light

1734639 in the past four years five labor ministers have been either sacked or stood down
1734640 how could we really in western australia consider re electing for another four years a government where one third of the members of cabinet had to stand down they were ministers they had executive power they had control over the finances of the state
1734641 but can i also say that since the last election water has become the most important issue for australia

1734647 the relationship was consensual and it ended earlier this year after a period of some months
1734648 i take responsibility for my being involved in this relationship and i regret the hurt caused to anyone including my family
1734649 but what essentially those conversations came down to was a requirement by me for good government to refer the letter to the solicitor general for formal advice and any outcome would need obviously to be made public
1734650 and that obviously has precipitated the difficult circumstances that we are in
1734651 now obviously that has caused significant stress for all of us and particularly for paula
1734652 but i want to make it clear that i had not accepted or recommended her resignation
1734653 i hope that the media will respect the privacy of myself and my family as i make my recovery
1734654 i wish to thank all those people who have expressed their good wishes and offers of support
1734655 most students can complete 13 years of school and be awarded a senior certificate without having to demonstrate minimally acceptable levels of proficiency across a range of fundamental areas
1734656 some things are so fundamental we should expect all students to achieve at least a minimum standard by the time they leave school
1734657 if someone is doing maths in years 11 and 12 then you can be pretty confident theyre going to pass a numeracy test
1734658 but not all students study maths or science for example in those years and theres no way of knowing what they understand
1734659 we should set the standard at the level we hope everyone should reach by the time they finish school
1734660 theres always a risk that standards are set too low and that the focus is then just on achieving low standards so there needs to be levels beyond a minimally acceptable standard

1734680 this product represents a very big effort by the tobacco industry to produce a safer cigarette the problem is how can they say its safe when the science to support the claim isnt there yet
1734681 the prosecutors latest submission is a complete reversal of its prior position and flies in the face of the facts and the law applicable to this case
1734682 when we first planned this study we thought high levels of adiponectin would be protective but we actually found the opposite that people with the highest levels had a higher risk of heart disease than those with lower levels and then two other studies have also recently been reported showing an association between higher levels of adiponectin and all cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality our findings are in line with these studies and suggest that higher adiponectin levels do not necessarily signal a healthier population as we initially thought
1734683 our findings which are based on the largest number of first incident chd events in an elderly cohort to date are at odds with prior reports of a protective association with chd whether overall or limited to nonfatal events they also contrast with previous null results regarding fatal and nonfatal chd while failing to confirm a previously noted interaction by race
1734684 this peptide does not seem to be associated with a straightforward protective effect as we first thought it would be there has been much enthusiasm about this hormone resulting in many published studies but each study just seems to complicate the picture more while it does seem to have a beneficial effect in diabetes its associations in chd are all over the place the best summary is perhaps that in middle aged individuals free of heart disease adiponectin may be modestly protective against developing chd while in people already affected with heart disease and in older persons it appears to be a marker of harm
1734685 this leaves the possibility that in addition to its salutary actions adiponectin has direct harmful effects which could be more operative in the elderly indeed adiponectin has been shown to increase energy expenditure through direct actions in the central nervous system in mice an effect that if present in humans could be particularly deleterious in older adults by potentially accelerating sarcopenia
1734686 we had initially hoped that high levels of adiponectin would be protective against both diabetes and chd then one could set about looking for drugs to increase it but now we are realizing that we have to know more about the full range of actions of this hormone before we can think about manipulating it with drugs
1734687 it is a surprising result in a globalising world with increasingly mobile capital flows for a small open economy to have the highest weight given to the taxation of capital income
1734688 i dont necessarily find thateverything in this paper gels with everything that i have said on tax in the past and that is as it should be
1734689 but you will hurt everyone who has put savings into superannuation and all those small businesses that are accumulating franking credits
1734690 the alternative for the government is do the unpopular thing of shift the tax burden to the community and lower the tax rate on the corporate sector

1734693 we welcome anything that helps consumers make informed choices about where they shop however the grocerychoice website takes a broad brush approach
1734694 consumers are probably still better off comparing local supermarket catalogues
1734695 what weve given them today is some guidance about which are the cheapest chains in their area and their region
1734696 this has been very stressful for me as you can imagine because these allegations have been around now for many many years and i want my case finalised
1734697 specifically the australian tax authorities are investigating whether hogan evaded the payment of taxes
1734698 the australian tax authorities have reason to believe that hogan may have failed to properly report all taxable items on some or all the australian income tax returns that he filed for the years 2000 to 2007
1734699 are at the core of the australian tax investigation and are not appropriate for resolution by a us court
1734700 hogan simply misunderstands the nature of summons enforcement proceedings and completely ignores the supreme courts ruling on treaty request summonses
1734701 need only make a minimal showing that the summons was issued in good faith
1734702 thats part of a mature responsible relationship with the chinese government
1734703 weve raised concerns to the chinese in the past about human rights in general and about the falun gong in particular ill continue to do so
1734704 it is the case regrettably that we do continue to have very significant concerns
1734705 our first desire is of course to see the olympic spirit celebrated widely not just in china but throughout the world
1734706 we think thats a very good thing for the world but we will continue as we always do to raise human rights issues when we meet chinese officials
1734707 without an mret australia would run a very high risk of not meeting its emissions targets because industries would leave their run too late and then they would simply not be able to get up and running in time they wouldnt be able to get the staff or the investment
1734708 an mret does make the emissions reduction task more expensive but without it we cant meet the deadline

1734740 in addition the prevalence of hiv infection and potential risk factors differed by gender but a finding we didnt anticipate is that living in tijuana for longer periods was associated with lower hiv prevalence in men which is the opposite of what we found in women among women longer term residents in tijuana actually had a higher risk of hiv infection
1734741 with disintegrating family support networks sudden changes in a persons cultural environment homelessness and poverty were more apt to see risk behaviors such as unprotected sex with sex workers other men or sharing injection needles among male migrants
1734742 however an alternate explanation could be that deportation from the united states leads to social upheaval loss of social ties and income factors which lead to engaging in high risk behaviors

1734900 there are with some choice etf to power your own bottom line
1734901 many americans are disgusted by the fact that faced with an energy crisis the government seems to produce nothing but hot air
1734902 critics will point out that the wind seems to stop blowing when you want electricity most on hot summer days and that is a problem however a study last year by stanford university shows that wind power from interconnected farms can be used as reliable base load electric power
1734903 as one might expect not all locations make sense for wind farms but legendary oilman t boone pickens says the united states should take advantage of the so called wind corridor stretching from the canadian border to west texas
1734904 energy from wind turbines built there could supply 20 or more of the nations power by 2030 according to a new report from the department of energy
1734905 u s electrical demand is expected to grow another 39 through 2030 so wind would help fill the gap and although wind is expensive costs per unit should come down with a larger scale operation besides with the cost of coal and natural gas rising wind is already becoming more competitive
1734906 unlike wind we tend to get the most solar power when most electricity is needed during hot summer months and the technology is working now there are two general forms of solar power
1734907 the first is pv or photovoltaic which converts energy from photons directly into electricity the second is thermal which uses the suns heat concentrated to heat liquids to transfer that heat boil water and turn a turbine
1734908 a rooftop photovoltaic system is fairly expensive about 35 000 to 40 000 though the cost can be reduced through tax incentives and rebates
1734909 solar thermal is also expensive though cheaper than pv based solar power the mojave desert in the southwest is home to the largest solar thermal system in the united states
1734910 this solar energy generation system has a total capacity of 354 megawatts and new technology allows for better cheaper storage of solar energy even when the sun isnt shining of course wind and solar arent widely used to power cars but that too can change
1734911 still i want you to know that there are workable solutions right now and not only can they help our country but they can reward investors too there are a bunch of great funds in the alternative energy space
1734912 here are two etfs one that focuses on wind the other on solar the tan holds a basket of 25 stocks in the solar space and it is a fund with a global portfolio as its name implies pwnd is a basket of 32 companies also worldwide that are focusing on wind energy

1734926 we may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden 3 but god said you shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden neither shall you touch it lest you die

1735006 this is a theft involving the partys name and symbols and neither pandithan nor i have appointed anyone to be our promoters
1735007 although pandithan was upset he did not want to take action against them as they were former party members and had taken part in the partys struggle in the early days
1735008 but it is unfortunate that they continue to damage our name and reputation even after pandithans death giving us no option but to take legal action

1735018 razak was introduced to azilah by a senior police officer dsp musa safri they razak and azilah had one meeting and their meeting was consistent with that of an innocent man asking azilah for assistance in respect of altantuyas harassment and threats
1735019 in august 2006 when the deceased turned up at his office he had said this i got nothing to do with you if you want to do anything go ahead
1735020 and when the victim went to his house and caused a commotion he had only intended for her to be arrested by the police and nothing more
1735021 there is nothing illegal or improper for him to request police assistance to arrest her
1735022 razaks two laptops which were seized did not show anything incriminating against him there were also no incriminating smses found in razaks two handphones
1735023 although phone records show there were communication between razaks and azilahs phones this does not mean that the registered user of that phone line was actually using the phone at the particular time and date
1735024 if someone wants to fix me up he can call me 100 times and if that constitutes abetment then this will create an extremely dangerous precedent
1735025 we submit that there is a gap in the prosecutions case for their failure to call three witnesses lawyer dhiren norendra dsp musa safri and k suras kumar the assistant of razaks private investigator p balasubramaniam
1735026 razak was also severely prejudiced as the charge against him was defective not only did it not specify how he had abetted but it also did not state the approximate location in kuala lumpur over a period of 36 hours
1735027 irrespective of the outcome of the case razaks life and those of his loved ones have been totally turned upside down i pray to the court to give razak a chance to pick up the pieces of his life and acquit him

1735037 were done this is enough for a week no worries about vegetables because i plant cangkok manis tapioca and kangkung in our compound

1735043 i got on his motorcycle but instead he took me to an area in jalan acob estate which was some distance away when i questioned him he said he had some errands to do and would send me after that but when he rode into a secluded area i knew something was wrong
1735044 when he stopped i tried to run away but he hit me with his helmet i was bleeding from the head and passed out
1735045 my mouth was gagged and hands tied behind my back the water was at ankle level and i walked along the drain hoping to see someone but there was nobody
1735046 he was surprised that i was alive he poured the contents of a bottle in my mouth i believe it was samsu and i passed out again
1735047 i was in a leaning position against the side of the ditch and could not move then the days and nights passed i was so thirsty and hungry but could not even open my mouth
1735048 i knew that i could not last much longer and the cold was unbearable i thought i was going to die and kept thinking of my four children

1735050 yet our peoples who constitute three quarters of the global population are eking out a living for food and protesting over soaring food prices we have become the victims of our own produce
1735051 ive yet to reach 4 40m since setting the national record but ive been consistently clearing 4 30m and im still hopeful that by breaking the national record it will be good enough for a place in the final

1735059 the senior teams failure to qualify for the olympics is bad but what makes the situation worse is that we are also struggling at the junior ranks
1735060 while we agree that malaysia has in the past failed to qualify for the olympics and world cup the situation wasnt that severe as we always had good junior ranks
1735061 this goes back to the 1950s and 60s however this is no longer the case as seen by the junior team struggling to hold singapore to a draw 2 2 in the recent junior asia cup
1735062 even at the under 16 level we are struggling against the likes of austria our fear is that if left unchecked we could soon be struggling to win the sea games gold
1735063 i have always stressed that malaysian football will never improve if all the money is dumped into the league and nothing for development
1735064 many clubs in the world spend money on development which they see as an investment for the future this should also be our approach
1735065 if required the national squad will train together even during the league we must ensure this happens even if only for a couple of days

1735070 while we recognise islam as the official religion we do not want to deprive people of other faiths from practising their religion
1735071 there is a little disrespect going on because a team does not rely on one player even if he is very good pele and maradona won major games but they had help from their peers
1735072 i hope we now can be the same in athletics
1735073 i would love it if we could equal or surpass our medal total at the barcelona games
1735074 this will be one of the largest teams weve sent but above all one of the most talented

1735094 the voice and representation of developing countries in the decision making of international financial institutions should be significantly improved
1735095 the financial g20 is an appropriate forum for their endeavour
1735096 dismantle barriers and distortions especially agriculture subsidies and domestic support that affect the overall efforts of developing countries
1735097 take the lead in achieving ambitious and absolute greenhouse gas emissions reductions of at least 25 40 per cent range for emissions reductions below 1990 levels by 2020 and by 2050 by between 80 and 95 per cent below those levels
1735098 past records suggest that mew choo will have a good chance against lu lan and i am optimistic but it is not going to be easy
1735099 lu lans consistency has improved and i will still make her the favourite if she meets mew choo
1735100 mew choo has prepared well and her first task is to reach the quarter finals she cannot take petya for granted as the bulgarian is hardworking and can last in long matches
1735101 it is going to be very hard to predict as we dont know how well the opponents have prepared but the preliminary round matches will give a clearer indication on where mew choo stands against lu lan
1735102 if there is one player who can deny china the gold it is going to be tine rasmussen of denmark and that will also depend on whether she is free of injuries

1735110 i hope the igp will investigate his men without fear or favour
1735111 the case is ongoing and he should stop playing politics so as not to jeopardise the hearing
1735112 when dr hilmi admitted that the case occurred during his tenure he did not admit to the claimed quantum
1735113 i have so far refrained from making comments on the matter it is not because i do not want to take responsibility for what happened when i was the chief minister
1735114 it is because i do not want to jeopardise the ongoing court case
1735115 i am not at home most of the time and i wanted to ensure that my husband and children had a balanced diet of white meat and vegetables
1735116 my husband likes to eat pork but red meat is not on the dieticians list and he realises that a lot of red meat will not be good for his health in the long run
1735117 the list has become a general food guide for us to ensure we do not suffer malnutrition
1735118 our breakfast staple is bread with butter milo and traditional black coffee but sometimes we pack thosai lunch and dinner is rice with stir fried dishes

1735123 throughout our talks we have reiterated to our counterparts that the issue at hand is the welfare of the tibetan people and is not about the personal status and affairs of his holiness the dalai lama or that of the tibetans in exile
1735124 the contacts and dialogues were about dalai lamas personal future not so called china tibet negotiation or dialogue between han and the tibetan people
1735125 there is a growing perception among the tibetans among friends of tibet that the whole tactic of the chinese government in engaging us is to stall for time
1735126 my colleague and i told our chinese counterpart candidly that we ourselves are beginning to inch towards this school of thought
1735127 curb the violent terrorist activities of the tibetan youth congress
1735128 not to support any argument and activity to seek tibetan independence
1735129 his holiness not to support violence terrorism and sabotaging the olympics

1735133 jajajaja en die suskind is de eerste die dit roept
1735134 i have always believed in making myself accessible to people and in developing meaningful relationships with my clients i never stopped doing that even after my business developed into an international enterprise the last thing i want is for people to face hurdles just to reach me
1735135 in the 80s people were not so willing to spend on herbal based treatments and the awareness about going natural just wasnt there unlike today i invested rm15 000 to open that salon in brickfields and i was so afraid that i would never get that money back
1735136 my favourite channel is cnbc people do ask whether i have time to watch movies but the only time i catch a movie in full is when its an in flight movie
1735137 people have said that i should update my hairstyle or stop wearing the bindi the red dot on the forehead worn by indian women because it doesnt suit western attire but i will never change who i am
1735138 people have to believe in you personally i only use my own range of products and only go to the hair salon to have my hair trimmed nothing else i dont go for hair treatments or any other procedures they advertise
1735139 we will try to attack chinese central cities severely using tactics that have never been employed
1735140 research shows that early integration of music into a childs daily routine improves ability to think reason create and express the shared learning experience creates a unique bond as the child associates learning with fun and musical play
1735141 it all comes down to mental stimulation through music targeting various parts of a childs brain namely musical skills language development physical development cognitive development social development and emotional development
1735142 i travel a lot overseas for business and therefore i feel this will help me bond with her the activities are fun and best of all we get to do them together
1735143 one important thing to remember is that every parent is the childs most important teacher
1735144 yes we cannot afford to be lax in this area after all the children are here to play learn and socialise the environment therefore has to be really clean
1735145 we are a nuclear weapon state we know it the world knows it we should not be worried about definitions
1735146 we have included fuel guarantees corrective action and building of a strategic fuel reserve in the preamble and general considerations in the text of the agreement
1735147 this is a unique feature which has been attempted for the first time
1735148 no rupture is a permanent one an occasion may arise again we have to fight imperialism and communalism
1735149 we have failed to transform economic aid into political influence
1735150 there are real issues relating to ageing and all of them have to do with the very end of life
1735151 typically about half of the medical costs involved in a persons life occurs in the last two years of his or her life
1735152 this is quite aside from whether it is desirable or not i think that the policies have to adapt to that situation
1735153 resources would be diverted from investment into consumption which could have a significant negative impact on the countrys economic growth the older generation dis saves they live on past savings which erode with time
1735154 weve got a double dilemma in that people have to take care of their own children and their old parents
1735155 the government needs to tap the potential of retirees and consider how best to harness their unused talents senior citizens can contribute their talent and experience to national development
1735156 the issue ought to be addressed in the annual budget and developmental plans
1735157 i dont think it would be sensible to view the problem in any sense as a crisis
1735158 it is an emerging pheno menon that needs to be planned for and dealt with

1735160 we will provide more than 3 000 hours of coverage of the olympic games sports fans will be able to enjoy action packed and real time updates on the games direct from beijing
1735161 think now of the russia that prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitri medvedev are shaping
1735162 no matter how well you plan there will be something extra the family wants or some last minute problems to fix anyone who thinks this is a glamorous job better think again
1735163 do you know how difficult it is to restrain two squawking chickens under a bed in the end both chickens came running out together
1735164 theyre more likely to fly out make a u turn and head for the buffet line rather than float gracefully into the sky
1735165 can you imagine pulling that off but when we try telling people that they will say we are being difficult or are only interested in the big clients
1735166 every time we meet a couple we do wonder whether their relationship will stand the strain of the wedding sadly some do not
1735167 its sad but they marry for all the wrong reasons as a wedding planner sometimes youre there as a shoulder to cry on
1735168 we somehow managed to tie her saree and get her ready she could hardly move and the poor girl was in so much pain that the priest had to cut short the ceremony
1735169 after a visit to the doctor the fever would subside for a day or two before recurring it happened every week
1735170 it is the first of its kind for annexe gallery we were fortunate enough as fashion inc a fashion event management company gave us rm50 000 to start this project
1735171 we want to take the arts to the streets kampung and even back to nature and not restrict it just to the galleries
1735172 we had a hard time choosing the recipients we took at least seven hours non stop to select the best seven
1735173 i want to bring together all artists regardless if they are visual artists or architects while surrounding ourselves with nature it is a great way to have a discourse regarding our work and things we can do as a community
1735174 sungai chilings serene environment is a lovely location for a great gathering
1735175 we want to look at malaysia from 1948 to 1960 the events which occurred and the repercussions on the society these include rundingan baling the penetration of communism and establishments of the new villages it also marks the 60th anniversary of the declaration in our country
1735176 these children seem to be invisible in the eye of malaysians we have at least 10 000 of them and the figure merely covers those who are registered
1735177 this grant will be used for the children to share their stories with the people here
1735178 it is totally different from what i normally do so i am nervous
1735179 i love musicals they give a different sense of satisfaction compared with dramas
1735180 we are trying to get the actual uniforms and weapons used during the war for this play
1735181 indie youth fest gt music art spoken word fashion video games design digital stuff
1735182 cartoonists and hard core console players 3d artists and cartoonists
1735183 utterly fail to meet the basic due process standards required for a fair trial under international humanitarian and human rights law
1735184 when we went to emi it was actually not an audition but more like an job interview
1735185 edry was still in his school uniform through a friend emi got hold of our demo and when they met us they asked us questions like where do you see yourself in five years
1735186 we told them that someday we would like to have our own studio
1735187 we wanted a studio because we were so much into music and the production process but they said we have to first be artistes so we said lets do it
1735188 usually boy bands only sing songs but we were involved in the creative process as well to be honest norman was the only one who enjoyed being onstage all these years we never did like the limelight if you remember when we started it was me and edry at the back with our music instruments
1735189 we will celebrate with a bang previously we organised ballroom performances but they were boring its better for us to get close to our fans and so a showcase is more relevant what better place than the venue for our first concert in 1993 the life centre in kuala lumpur
1735190 at the time when we performed there we thought we were on top of the world wow so many people came of course now the place feels much smaller
1735191 we will showcase talents under our label they are from sweden indonesia malaysia and singapore altogether we have seven artistes its a great platform to recap what has happened throughout the years
1735192 the whole idea is to remember how it all started about living the dream and believing in it as well
1735193 the company is still a teenager so it will be a sweet 16 birthday its important for us to organise this event i hope people will look at krus success beyond being singers actors or whatever look at the substance behind it and by the way edry will also perform for the first time as a solo artiste
1735194 once in a while i do enjoy performing its not something that we hate but at the same time its not something we love that much either both me and edry prefer to be in the background while norman is more of a people person just look at the way he talks like a politician
1735195 i prefer going on tours and doing all the fun stuff
1735196 we bought a keyboard with our first payment yes it was invested back into the company we still have it
1735197 we started the group first and by default we managed our own career
1735198 but we never saw ourselves as serious businessmen until 1996 when we started our own record label which incidentally was prompted by datuk tony fernandes i totally admire him
1735199 assisted living is already a popular concept overseas particularly in america but in malaysia people only know of nursing homes or the type of old folks homes that many of us are afraid we will end up in
1735200 we have set this up as a place where you should want or choose to spend your retirement years because you have the atmosphere and privacy of your own home but the facilities of a hotel
1735201 with my manor janet and i see a place that we ourselves would like to spend our retirement years
1735202 in those days what was available didnt inspire confidence only fear a place like my manor will help to throw a different light on the issue
1735203 currently i have to be at the pool by 5 30am and i train for two and a half hours then i go to school and after that i take a nap next thing you know i am back at the pool at night i attend tuition before heading home to revise some more
1735204 my parents dont pressure me to do well at the pool or to do well in studies they let me set my own pace i guess their confidence helps a lot
1735205 my older brother and sister were also national swimmers and they often advice me on how to divide my time between school and studies
1735206 im just a normal person and my friends are those who i meet in school i also enjoy shopping but usually do this with mum

1735212 most companies would call themselves innovative and would claim theyre delivering an above average service to their customers yet their customers opinions might differ if you drill a company on their innovation practices they would probably mention two approaches they employ 1 their research department meets with target groups compiles presentations for the upper management which then occasionally hands those reports over to the development department 2 their research or marketing department comes up with competitive matrix of the products available from competition in a meeting then executives see that their product is missing a feature and hence the development department is assigned the task of adding an internet enabled installer to the product since everybody else offers them thereby creating market expectations
1735213 google and yahoo once technology companies are now media players and their advertising based business models mean they compete more with los angeles and new york than their silicon valley brethren

1735231 but when we got here and saw people boarding up the windows my wife got a little nervous
1735232 the winds were blowing too hard out of the north
1735233 that intersection has flooded all my life but with the new drainage project kicked in it didnt flood
1735234 in terms of feedstock we do have a supply of crude in tanks that will enable us to continue running for the foreseeable future
1735235 we had very little rain and a breeze of 5 to 10 mph
1735236 weve had worse thunderstorms than this like the squall that came through sunday night
1735237 we make sure no one is growing too much and that our coca is being sold to people who sell it for traditional uses and not for cocaine
1735238 a small number of people can cause a great deal of damage
1735239 immense bureaucracy whose aim is not to engage foreigners but to build a reassuring but fictitious image for domestic consumption of global admiration for their country
1735240 the countdown has officially begun mark your calendars september 18th is the day of reckoning
1735241 for the last three years the entire team at mythic has poured their hearts into making warhammer online the next great mmorpg we are so excited to open up this world and share it with the fans that will live in it quest in it go to war in it and make it come alive
1735242 the tags primarily consist of naturally occurring pollen a substance that evolution has provided with extraordinary adhesive properties
1735243 it has been given a unique chemical signature by coating it with titanium oxide zirconia zirconium dioxide silica or a mixture of other oxides the precise composition of this coating can be varied subtly from one batch of cartridges to another enabling a firm connection to be made between a particular fired cartridge and its user
1735244 were currently focusing on understanding the precise requirements of the police and cartridge manufacturers
1735245 but our work clearly could make a valuable contribution not only to solving gun crime but also to deterring criminals from resorting to the use of firearms in the first place
1735246 companies that claim to help people start a business need to live up to their promises
1735247 if not they should expect to hear from my office
1735248 a term used to describe how pertinent connected or applicable some information is to a given matter
1735249 the ch04 st address table corresponds to at most one row in the ch04 st person table
1735250 judge karas is taking his own guilty pleas at this time
1735251 and i realized god didnt want me to do that and i turned myself in
1735252 the best source for that information is through testing and measuring the performance of company online marketing campaigns
1735253 i would rank the periodic or ongoing consultation of an outside agency higher than many other sources since it s their job to test and measure online campaigns for a multiple companies on an ongoing basis the cumulative knowledge experience and insight that comes from working with many different web sites and their associated challenges is of benefit to each web site client individually
1735254 we are seeing signs of progress from our efforts to improve the customer experience rebuild the sprint brand and increase our profitability
1735255 there are clear signs of improvement at sprint yet there remains no clear answer on how the company can ever return to growth or reasonable profit margins
1735256 while i was running an experiment at the caltech brain imaging center a group of students happened to pass by on a tour and i volunteered to explain what i was doing
1735257 as part of the experiment a moving display was running on my computer screen with dots rapidly expanding out somewhat like the opening scene of star wars
1735258 does anyone else hear something when you look at that
1735259 i queried a few hundred people and three more individuals turned up
1735260 do you hear sounds when you see things move or flash
1735261 people with auditory synesthesia may be even less likely than people with other synesthetic associations to fully realize that their experience is unusual these individuals have an enhanced soundtrack in life rather than a dramatically different experience compared to others
1735262 synesthetes had an advantage because they not only saw but also heard the visual patterns
1735263 this translation might result in actual sound perception in synesthetes perhaps due to stronger than normal connections says saenz who has begun brain imaging experiments to study this connectivity in synesthetes and nonsynesthetes
1735264 we might find that motion processing centers of the visual cortex are more interconnected with auditory brain regions than previously thought even in the normal brain
1735265 at this point very little is known about how the auditory and visual processing systems of the brain work together understanding this interaction is important because in normal experience our senses work together all the time
1735266 conformally wrapping surfaces with stretchable sheets of optoelectronics provides a practical route for integrating well developed planar device technologies onto complex curvilinear objects
1735267 this approach allows us to put electronics in places where we couldnt before
1735268 we can now for the first time move device design beyond the flatland constraints of conventional wafer based systems
1735269 optics simulations and imaging studies show that these systems provide a much broader field of view improved illumination uniformity and fewer aberrations than flat cameras with similar imaging lenses
1735270 hemispherical detector arrays are also much better suited for use as retinal implants than flat detectors
1735271 the ability to wrap high quality silicon devices onto complex surfaces and biological tissues adds very interesting and powerful capabilities to electronic and optoelectronic device design with many new application possibilities
1735272 the public security authorities are currently investigating with their utmost effort
1735273 i think japan and china will further cooperate on this matter to find out the truth as soon as possible
1735274 i suspect that a lot of people are unaware that their identifying information has been compromised
1735275 computer networks and the internet are an indispensable part of the world economy
1735276 but even as they provide extraordinary opportunities for legitimate commerce and communication they also provide extraordinary opportunities for criminals where criminals are able to breach computer security systems as alleged here they have enormous ability to cause harm
1735277 these stores just did not take the right precautions and the bad guys said cool we can sit in the parking lot and break into the retailer through the wireless network
1735278 this was a failure by the companies cited it was the equivalent of if your bank didnt lock the door to the vault
1735279 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1735280 the uk quarterback situation is unfortunate each of your articles in this mornings paper treated it most appropriately however here is a thought that merits some consideration why are college athletes referred to by coaches and sports writers as kids
1735281 use of the word has a connotation of someone who is somehow not of an age to be responsible for their individual actions
1735282 i guess that is because they are still playing games the maturation process has been slowed and
1735283 our goal is to make early stage digital assets resemble their final on screen forms as closely as possible starting with accurate models makes the production process more efficient and provides a higher quality end result for example youd want to know early on whether a prominent brow will shadow a characters eyes thats why autodesk mudbox 2009 has texture painting tools and on target display features these will help artists build and refine better 3d models
1735284 the introduction of autodesk mudbox 2009 sparks a revolution in computer graphics tools bringing about a paradigm shift in how designers and artists do their work
1735285 time is money an autodesk mudbox session begins with its artist friendly intuitive interface this is sculpting at the speed of thought with the greatest of fidelity in a business where new ideas with impossible deadlines are commonplace mudbox never lets me down
1735286 oh well they didnt know they were in the united states
1735287 it will take some time to fully resolve our challenges
1735288 we are far from satisfied we are not in a position to deliver sustained revenue growth but we believe we have a good plan in place and are seeing traction and have clear goals and measurements and accountability throughout the organization
1735289 while im pleased with the pace of progress it will take some time to fully resolve our challenges

1735293 raising taxes in a bad economy is about the worst thing you could do because it will kill even more jobs when what we need are policies that create jobs
1735294 you cant be a maverick when politically its working for you and not a maverick when it doesnt work for you when you received your partys nomination
1735295 if senator mccain wants to talk about how washington is broken thats a debate im happy to have because senator mccains energy plan reads like an early christmas list for oil and gas lobbyists its no wonder because many of his top advisers are former oil and gas lobbyists
1735296 its time to retire these old policies and bring new energy to america
1735297 im prot specced but ill be able to heal fine
1735298 i am very excited to represent tour edge golf which is one of the best companies in the game
1735299 the proof of anyones products is in the results they produce the fact that i just enjoyed my best tournament of the year and shot all four rounds in the 60s for the first time this season by using their irons and fairway woods says it all
1735300 exotics fairway woods are extremely well balanced provide tremendous ball flight and feel natural as soon as you put them in your hands
1735301 the irons deliver the control and distance that players search long and hard to find as the name implies tour edge gives you an edge
1735302 we are pleased to welcome stacy prammanasudh to our family we are confident she will add prestige and stature to the tour edge brand
1735303 we expect that her solid game will be elevated even further by using our products at the same time her constant presence on the lpgas leaderboard will give tour edge the additional exposure our company is seeking with consumers

1735325 there is a perception unfortunately sometimes based in truth that business people are working only in their own self interest that theyre greedy and selfish
1735326 with this course we hope to prepare our future business leaders to be concerned about the world around them and to understand that as future business leaders they can change that world for the better
1735327 business 101 is an ambitious new course into which we have poured our best insights
1735328 by better preparing students early on they will do better as they progress through the college and throughout their careers
1735329 they need to understand the impression they make should reflect their personal integrity and that theyre representing not just themselves but the companies they work for
1735330 they need to know that the so called soft skills are every bit as important as the theoretical and conceptual material theyre going to learn in classes over the next four years
1735331 this is really going to open up the conversation about responsibility in business
1735332 thats whats so exciting to have professional responsibility as the foundation of education in students formative years will serve them very well both in school and beyond
1735333 experience such as what young people get through involvement in these activities brings meaning to what they learn in class
1735334 graduates of our programs will be better equipped to recognize and respond to challenges in the workplace
1735335 critical thinking skills and sound judgment coupled with the willingness to act are complex and multi dimensional attributes that must be nurtured in order to be attained and business 101 is the beginning of that journey for our students
1735336 water as we know it does not exist within our bodies
1735337 water in our bodies has different physical properties from ordinary bulk water because of the presence of proteins and other biomolecules proteins change the properties of water to perform particular tasks in different parts of our cells
1735338 while it is well known that water plays an important role in the folding process we usually only look at the motion of the protein
1735339 this is the first time weve been able to look at the motion of water molecules during the folding process
1735340 water can be viewed as a designer fluid in living cells
1735341 our experiments showed that the volume of active water was about the same size as that of the protein
1735342 we previously thought proteins would affect only those water molecules directly stuck to them
1735343 now we know proteins will affect a volume of water comparable to their own thats pretty amazing

1735350 it was a great way to highlight all the amazing local agriculture available in this county and it was a huge hit
1735351 and weve decided to grow it into something that can really make an impact creating more outreach for our small farmers to both the community at large and chefs at local restaurants
1735352 introduce small farmers to local restaurants and help facilitate a working relationship that is mutually productive and financially rewarding
1735353 its about getting food to people and to restaurants about education about the health benefits of fresh food and about supporting our local communities and economies
1735354 the whole idea initially when we opened was to serve fresh food that was affordable and interesting
1735355 we really wanted the menu to be a reflection of our beliefs and philosophies on eating
1735356 one regulation effective in april requires all citizens over the age of 40 to have their waists measured every year if a mans waist is more than 33 5 inches or a womans more than 35 5 inches they are considered at risk and referred for counseling and close monitoring the government is also requiring companies to slim down their workers or face higher payments into the national insurance program

1735370 i am truly honored for this distinction best casino affiliate
1735371 in the past i have received awards from players magazine editors and industry folk but to be awarded by my peers is a significant event for me i am very appreciative for this
1735372 its not just about who you know but who knows you so maintaining a strong profile is important networking is the process of nurturing building and leveraging relationships in order to maximize opportunities for yourself and others i find that men will quickly leverage the connections they have with others whereas women tend to avoid leveraging a relationship until it is better established this difference often results in men getting what they want more quickly than their female counterparts
1735373 think of it as informing rather than boasting if you dont tell people who else will

1735421 as working families across the country continue to battle the effects of a slowing economy and record high energy prices it is absurd for congress to turn their backs on the american people and shut down the institution for a month long vacation
1735422 with the driving public groaning under high gas prices it is embarrassing that the house leadership wouldnt even schedule a vote on expanded drilling and increasing refining capacity
1735423 american workers and manufacturers are fighting for their livelihoods in the face of chinese mercantilism while congress takes a month long siesta
1735424 we clearly have unfinished business and if we are serious about getting the american economy back on a growth path we have got to tackle the most prominent economic challenges of today volatile energy costs and chinese trade abuses

1735437 this seems a good time to acknowledge a little history about one of the countys oldest arts organizations the art center the story is one of impressive achievement considering that for close to its first 30 years it operated with all volunteers chief among these was arne nybak
1735438 arne an accomplished painter accepted the job of curator when the art association built the building at broad and monterey streets for 30 years he coordinated the calendar for the nine major shows a year in the gray wing selected artists designed the installations and was a mentor to many who served on the board of directors or in other capacities as docents and volunteers
1735439 arne was never paid a dime his contributions of leadership financial support and skill proved to be a lifeblood for the art center many many others joined forces in the dedicated effort to make the art center a thriving organization the grassroots foundation upon which it stands speaks triumphantly to the power of community

1735483 i wasnt riding under perfect conditions as we definitely had a few issues this weekend
1735484 but we were able to get them sorted for the most part i spent quite a bit of time on the phone with eric dorn from edr performance trying to find solutions and we were at the track till late on saturday night wrenching but all in all it was a good weekend
1735485 and i wanted to focus on the supersport race so i opted out of fx it was a good decision on my part
1735486 i was hoping to have someone to really race against but it was fun regardless i worked on staying nice and relaxed and on some of the techniques keith code was helping me with over the weekend
1735487 im extremely happy with a 23rd place finish and want to thank my fianc e john parker who worked tirelessly all weekend all of our team sponsors and all of our fans
1735488 we had a tough qualifying and it hurt us in the race
1735489 i was working my way up and was catching danny eslick and garrett carter when the red flag came out the race was stopped and that left us in eighth place the bike ran pretty well and we were a bit unfortunate that we didnt get to run the full distance
1735490 we learned a few things on saturday and i was pretty fast in warm up but i crashed in the race we had a good race with some young kids tommy aquino and michael beck we had good battle but we wanted to be closer to the front we had a little problem on the last lap that kept us from finishing 12th
1735491 the bike seemed to have the speed we were at the top of the speed chart in fx most of the time and right there with everyone else in supersport we have that but we need to work on the handling a lot of people had chatter in the front so maybe it wasnt all related to our setup the race track was changing dramatically from day to day were ready to go to vir and see what we can do aaron and all the mechanics are working hard and were to the point that we expect really good results each time out weve made a lot of progress this year and we are hoping for more

1735590 i was so mad i asked him what he was doing even though i already knew to be honest i was hoping he would lie to me and say that he was studying the haftorah on the computer or something like that
1735591 but instead he just smiled and said manny being manny what can you do mannys a free spirit i grounded him for two weeks thats what i can do still i dont think it will be enough
1735592 i know hes trying to emulate his favorite baseball player manny ramirez samuel my husband told me all about it but you take one look at manny ramirez and you realize that that guy really is a free spirit with his crazy hair and loose pants this little pisher who lives upstairs thinks he has the chutzpah to be like the real manny ramirez hes lucky if he can eat a blintze without spilling it all over his shirt

1735713 wise are those who look at others with the same generosity they offer themselves and who look at themselves with the same critical eye they have for others
1735714 judge not and you will not be judged condemn not and you will not be condemned forgive and will be forgiven
1735715 for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved
1735716 i can of mine own self do nothing as i hear i judge and my judgment is just because i seek not mine own will but the will of the father which hath sent me
1735717 therefore you are inexcusable o man whoever you are that judges for wherein you judge another you condemn yourself for you that judge do the same things and do you think this o man you who judge those practicing such things and doing the same that you will escape the judgment of god
1735718 who are you to judge anothers servant to his own master he stands or falls indeed he will be made to stand for god is able to make him stand but why do you judge your brother or why do you show contempt for your brother for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of christ
1735719 for if we would judge ourselves we would not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world
1735720 therefore judge nothing before the time until the lord come who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts and then shall every man have praise of god
1735721 when i planted the fern and the bamboo seeds i took very good care of them i gave them light i gave them water the fern quickly grew from the earth its brilliant green covered the floor yet nothing came from the bamboo seed but i did not quit on the bamboo in the second year the fern grew more vibrant and plentiful and again nothing came from the bamboo seed but i did not quit on the bamboo
1735722 in the third year there was still nothing from the bamboo seed but i would not quit in the fourth year again there was nothing from the bamboo seed i would not quit
1735723 then in the fifth year a tiny sprout emerged from the earth compared to the fern it was seemingly small and insignificant but just 6 months later the bamboo rose to over 100 feet tall it had spent the five years growing roots those roots made it strong and gave it what it needed to survive i would not give any of my creations a challenge it could not handle
1735724 did you know my child that all this time you have been struggling you have actually been growing roots i would not quit on the bamboo i will never quit on you dont compare yourself to others
1735725 the bamboo had a different purpose than the fern yet they both make the forest beautiful

1735860 alegar a que esta decisi n la toma para dejar a los grupos que se preparen son excusas rid culas torticeras e infantiles impropias de un alcalde todos los concejales de este ayuntamiento deben estar lo suficientemente preparados para hablar del presente del pasado y del futuro de los barrios en cualquier momento quiz s el problema est en que los concejales del psoe incluido el alcalde no tienen ni idea de lo que est n haciendo con el pueblo

1735862 en vez de estar intentando coaccionar y amedrentar a los concejales de la oposici n le sugiero a los sres rojas y pecino que convoquen a la junta de portavoces para que se alcance un acuerdo de los tiempos y las formas en las que se va a desarrollar el debate esto es lo que habitualmente se hace en otros ayuntamientos donde el clima permite llegar a acuerdos en los barrios lo nico que se le ocurre a su alcalde y a su ac lito mas aventajado es insultar y demostrar un talante democr tico brillante por su ausencia

1736027 if we continue to sit by and let others define effective teaching we will always be reactors not actors on the school reform stage where the policies that control our daily work play out

1736038 and while it is the washington democrats who are refusing to vote to allow expanded oil drilling tennessee democrat leaders like tennessee democrat party chairman gray sasser democrat gov phil bredesen and a host of elected democrats across the state have endorsed the presidential campaign of barack obama who also opposes increased oil drilling
1736039 a few weeks ago i and the tennessee republican party echoed the sentiments of millions of tennesseans by joining the chorus of drill here drill now pay less
1736040 in sharp contrast tennessee democrats have remained stone silent about moving their members of congress to act to allow more domestic oil production

1736047 barack obama has been consistently clear that he believes we should have withdrawn unconditionally from iraq two years ago when withdrawal would have meant a defeat for america and a victory for al qaeda
1736048 incredibly obama insist that even if he had known the surge which has brought america to the brink of victory in iraq was going to succeed he still would have opposed it
1736049 tennessee has seen tens of thousands of military personnel from the state be deployed to iraq including three deployments for the 101st airborne division housed at fort campbell and the 278th tennessee national guard whose personnel served along the iranian border and helped safeguard iraqs first democratic elections in 2005
1736050 while it is heartening that barack obama after 143 days in the senate and more than a year on the campaign trail was able to spend a few hours in iraq and come away realizing that john mccain was right america shouldnt risk their countrys security and the success in iraq on such an untested candidate who clearly lacks the judgment and experience to be commander in chief at a time of war
1736051 theres a connection between the house of prayer being hit with a tax bill over its charity yard sale and the love gov phil bredesen and his fellow democrats in the state legislature have for increasing taxes and growing government faster than we can afford
1736052 a government that cant live without 30 in tax revenue from the sale of some old clothes and toys at a church yard sale is a government that has grown too big too expensive too fast
1736053 families across tennessee and america are seeing their budgets hammered by high gas prices and by rising food prices driven by the cost of fuel and yet sen reid wants to divert attention from that issue
1736054 while a proposed shield law for journalists and a piece of tax legislation are both important we believe the american people wont mind if the senate delays working on them until it first addresses the present energy cost crisis
1736055 it would lift the ban on offshore oil drilling while also increasing the production of american energy on federal lands in the western states and in remote parts of alaska encourage conservation and efficiency and promote development of alternative forms of energy such as biofuels and nuclear power all of the above strategy for energy independence but tennessees democrats have sided with nancy pelosi harry reid and the rest of the d c democrats to block the legislation while republicans are calling for congress to stay in session and make it a priority to pass meaningful solutions to americas current energy cost crisis
1736056 the american people understand that democrats are more focused on raising peoples taxes than on lowering the cost of fuel at the pump indeed many suspect that democrats secretly prefer high gas prices
1736057 but high fuel prices damage family budgets hurt the economy and cost jobs its shameful that tennessees democrat congressmen wouldnt speak up for the people of tennessee and demand congress act on the issue before taking a vacation

1736362 in previous simulations this region came out smooth but now we have enough detail to see clumps of dark matter
1736363 some of those clumps are so dense they will emit a lot of gamma rays if there is dark matter annihilation and it might easily be detected by glast
1736364 there are several candidate particles for cold dark matter and our predictions for glast depend on the assumed particle type and its properties
1736365 for typical wimps anywhere from a handful to a few dozen clear signals should stand out from the gamma ray background after two years of observations that would be a big discovery for glast
1736366 it simulates the dark matter distribution from near the time of the big bang until the present epoch so practically the entire age of the universe and focuses on resolving the halo around a galaxy like the milky way
1736367 we see a lot of substructure even in the inner part of the halo where the solar system is
1736368 every substructure has its own sub substructure and so on there are lumps on all scales
1736369 we can make comparisons with the dwarf galaxies and stellar streams associated with the milky way the appearance of these stellar systems is closely linked to the substructure of the dark matter halo
1736370 this technique is a clean probe of the microscopics in this system and it allows us to see interesting things like a very large energy gap that seems to appear before the superfluid state

1736438 is the biggest proponent of george bushs tired failed policies ready to bring about change another day brings another dishonest attack from john mccain while senator mccain knows that senator obama has proposed cutting taxes for 95 of american families what hes not telling us is that he wants to give 4 billion in tax breaks to the oil companies continue giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our job overseas and provide no direct tax relief for more than 100 million middle class families its time to retire these old policies and bring new energy to america
1736439 they dont want to understand the policy they want to talk about britney spears
1736440 i am announcing that i will be a candidate for president of the united states
1736441 i really wonder whether the obama camp should be confronting the
1736442 sen mccain apparently has nothing better to do than spend his time looking at the entertainment rags and rating whos the current celebrity he turns page while the economy goes down the toilet gas goes up jobs go overseas and peoples homes get flushed switch to a picture of the portland primary rally while thousands of americans are looking for a leader
1736443 while the mccain campaign continues to focus on nonsensical things sen

1736449 yes unfortunately at this point in time my wife of 17 years will not be making the trip to heaven
1736450 how can i say that she is vocally not a christian and has no relationship with god nor does she desire one
1736451 i have a team of christian couples scattered around the u s four active couples and one alternate
1736452 they are scattered to protect us from having the team wiped out by attack natural disaster or epidemic they are couples in case one is sick injured or killed if three out of four fail to log in to the website for three days the system figures the rapture has taken place
1736453 one team member is located near the server bank with access in case the net goes down or malfunctions
1736454 i do believe that the internet will be up and running
1736455 eventually god will take it down as he destroys the world system
1736456 that wont be until the second half of the tribulation though
1736457 there are those that think we only set this thing up as an elaborate ruse to get personal information
1736458 most of those calling it a scam are only repeating what someone else said they didnt look into it for themselves
1736459 it has been interesting just how much this thing has turned into a ministry

1736469 my agent was even crazy enough to try to get jim cameron to direct it
1736470 its not so much social networking its having a social experience around things that we care about so pets are just such a great example of that
1736471 social networks like facebook and myspace are sort of about you and your friends and these very direct connections but theres all sorts of other types of connections
1736472 theres a lot of people out there with their dogs and were busy and were all working in the office all day long and this is a way for us to bring our pets with us
1736473 its been a goofy thing to do at the end of the day when you get home from work and you just want to talk to somebody in your dogs voice and say hey how was your day
1736474 i think were getting into better territory ive been very much focused on the fall in oil prices as a necessary ingredient to avoid recession to the extent that were getting that thats just great

1736478 this is my beloved son i am fully pleased with him listen to him

1736492 actualizar la legislatura en base a los avances que se registran en otras zonas
1736493 la propuesta que se ofreci ayer con un panel debate
1736494 si se implementara los nosocomios cabecera de departamento podr an atender las cuestiones importantes como una biopsia y dejar en poder de los m s peque os el resto de la investigaci n con lo que se evitar a el traslado de pacientes a zonas lejanas
1736495 cuando los municipios avanzan con normas sobre estos temas es necesario dar un marco y legislar
1736496 en el consenso y la conciencia de la gente el abandono progresivo y el respeto a esas decisiones
1736497 tenemos que trabajar para el gobierno y para la provincia desde que asumimos hemos defendido todo hemos aprobado leyes pero hay preocupaci n por la manera de actuar queremos que a la provincia le vaya bien pero las diferencias existen
1736498 que la educaci n rural en contextos de encierro y domiciliaria hospitalaria es una educaci n com n pero el mbito de desarrollo es diferente por lo tanto hemos incorporado como mbito de la educaci n a estos cuatro subsistemas
1736499 creemos que tendr mayor legitimidad luego el 19 de setiembre la comisi n central har una nueva sistematizaci n para que a mediados de octubre estemos presentando el proyecto definitivo de ley al ejecutivo provincial y su posterior env o a las c maras
1736500 estamos encantados de la decisi n un nime del jurado a favor de la atp tanto el jurado como el juez han reconocido y defendido nuestro derecho fundamental a establecer y realizar cambios en el calendario de la atp los cambios son necesarios para aprovechar todo el potencial de nuestro deporte
1736501 vamos a intentar ganarlo todo pero va a ser dif cil
1736502 vamos a intentar ganarlo todo seguro que va a ser m s dif cil ganar porque todos los equipos van a poner muchas m s ganas y m s fuerzas cuando jueguen contra nosotros
1736503 es la primera vez en quince a os y la verdad es que he descansado
1736504 hecho algo de deporte varios partidos de baloncesto y de f tbol con mis amigos
1736505 despu s de las vacaciones volver a trabajar y volver a tu forma f sica es dif cil pero es primordial para hacer una buena temporada y buenos partidos
1736506 no he tenido estas temperaturas ni en la sauna cuando baje del avi n casi me muero ahora no salgo a la calle hasta las diez de las noche para tomar algo de aire es un infierno
1736507 ya s que llevo siete a os aqu pero no me acostumbro a este calor me cuesta mucho trabajo correr empezamos a las nueve de la ma ana y ya hace un calor tremendo soy sueco
1736508 bien la pretemporada como todos los a os est siendo duro pero es importante la preparaci n f sica
1736509 todav a no he hablado con todos pero estoy seguro de que poco a poco ir n entrando en el equipo y lo har n muy bien
1736510 vamos a luchar por todos los t tulos pero necesitamos un poco de suerte
1736511 la decisi n ha sido tomada de manera conjunto y no tiene nada que ver con el estado f sico de ljungberg algo que el jugador ha demostrado durante la eurocopa
1736512 tenemos que ir paso a paso como siempre tenemos que luchar por meternos en liga de campeones y cuando est s metido en esa pomada si tienes opciones de algo m s pues mejor pero no tenemos que desviarnos que el objetivo es estar entre los cuatro primeros
1736513 el sevilla se ha caracterizado por ser un equipo no uno u otro mientras sigamos as seguiremos haciendo cosas importantes
1736514 ojal podamos seguir con el nivel del a o pasado peleando con los mejores que creo que es el objetivo aunque los equipos nos van a tener un poco mas en cuenta
1736515 ya llevamos tiempo entrenando lo f sico ya se ha acabado y ahora vamos a estar con el grupo normal y poco a poco entraremos en los partidos cogiendo el ritmo que tiene todo el equipo y con ganas de entrar ya con ellos porque desde fuera es peor
1736516 creo que tenemos una gran plantilla muchos jugadores en todas las posiciones
1736517 aqu si destaca algo es el grupo el bloque que hay y la forma en que se juega no hay nadie que sea imprescindible como se vio la temporada pasada
1736518 son m s que nada rumores pero tambi n es un halago que un equipo como la roma te quiera pero soy feliz aqu y no me planteo marcharme
1736519 para un deportista es bonito ser reconocido por su labor individual pero debo decir que para m lo m s importante fueron los t tulos obtenidos por el equipo la temporada pasada
1736520 queremos que su rendimiento deportivo vaya acorde con su calidad

1736527 adem s lleg ronald koeman que lo que primero que hace a los tres d as de llegar es sacarlo de una convocatoria junto a manuel fernandes y no voy a decir que hubo una especie de persecuci n pero quiz s se le pareci mucho

1736529 por ello vamos a dar un poco de tiempo a las personas que acaban de coger esto que tienen un problema muy grande delante para reunirnos con ellos
1736530 haga bien todo lo que se ha hecho mal hasta estos d as
1736531 no s lo venga refrendada con dos palmadas en la espalda pues joaqu n es un jugador que se debe valorar en su justa medida y a todos los niveles

1736535 mr trump sees it as a business and no more than that he understands that and theres nothing personal to it at all and thats what the ufc has problem with the ufc takes the work they do very very personal and in any business once you let your personal feelings get involved with it everything goes to crap mr trump is a strict businessman who respects the fighters this is going to be one of the biggest losses the ufc has ever had to date and one of the worst mistakes theyve ever made

1736556 i hope to get my team ready to perform at the highest level to win a gold medal thats my only desire here and ill be ok with that

1736641 sales have been steady for the past four months and have not dropped off as they usually do in july
1736642 near record setting july sales demonstrate that sellers have accepted the market realities and have adjusted their listing prices to attract buyers prices are still relatively stable without any evidence of dramatic up or down swings
1736643 average days on market is still 55 days but the strong sales numbers reflect the robust and dynamic economy in edmonton

1736654 ok we proved our point now we dont have to try to win for the next ten years
1736655 when i studied they taught you nothing they didnt tell you how to draw they didnt tell you what to look at they didnt tell you anything
1736656 sometimes when you are drawing you think of another design for another project it was like a snowball effect it is a very strange way of working but for me it is very exciting
1736657 i felt the biggest impact you can have on architecture is how to re organize a plan and how you inhabit a plan how you move through the plan also this notion that there is another force this whole idea of liberation from gravity is not because you are flying around in the air but because you are freed from existing orders
1736658 there is another aspect to architecture which people forget architecture should be pleasurable it should be a pleasure to be in a wonderful space a nice room it does not matter how small or big it is what people misunderstand about luxury is that luxury has nothing to do with price i mean copacabana beach is very luxurious very nice pavement very nice sand but it does not cost anything to go up there and this is what architecture should do it gives you the idea of luxury on a bigger scale
1736659 the most important thing to take a project and to think how all these things the programme of the building the location on the site the function of the building and how it rests in the surrounding the structure how they can all operate well within one composition
1736660 the fax does not tell you the scale scale is operation
1736661 exchanging ideas even if they are silly i think you have to have perception of people you have to be able to understand them otherwise you might not as well become an architect because you cannot make your architecture for the dolly you have to really know how people would feel about things
1736662 theres no clubs here so you can only play for free if people dont like you theyll tell you you cant suck

1736664 you can expect to save about 5 percent on your cooling bill for each degree you raise your thermostat above the recommended 78 to 80 degrees
1736665 the airflow from the fans creates a wind chill effect that helps you feel cooler and can even lower temperatures by as much as 7 degrees of course there are no real energy savings if you dont raise the thermostat in tandem with the ceiling fan

1736675 were going to organize every day were going to talk to the american people and were going to demand that nancy pelosi comes back and we have an open and honest debate on american solutions for american people when it comes to energy
1736676 my message to democratic lawmakers is this if youre really for increased american energy production then prove it by putting it in writing sign the discharge petitions house republicans are circulating that will force votes on energy legislation speaker pelosi refuses to bring to the floor and sign onto the american energy act our all of the above plan to increase conservation innovation and american energy production instead of doing the speakers bidding by voting against bringing it to a vote you arent willing to put it in writing youre fooling no one youre siding with the speaker of the drill nothing congress and radical special interests that favor higher gas prices at the expense of energy strapped american families
1736677 this cynical strategy is disgustingly dishonest without any real solutions to help americans who are struggling with record high gas prices it appears the democratic leadership has hit on a new plan deceive deceive the press deceive its members and deceive the american people democratic members have a pass from their leaders to talk about drilling at home while the liberal democratic leadership which is beholden to special interests that want higher gas prices plays rope a dope back in washington ensuring there is no vote to help the american people before november its cynical dishonest and wrong and it wont work
1736678 since friday the republicans in congress have been playing to the television cameras with theatrical stunts because speaker pelosi blocked their offshore drilling plan the republican plan will not lower gas prices but it will line the pockets of big oil executives the same people donating millions of dollars to republicans
1736679 there are things you can do individually though to save energy
1736680 making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups youd actually save just as much
1736681 i think he misjudged it i was quite surprised that in their statement they had chosen to draw attention to arguably a negative to their service poor dan
1736682 were going to have to provide them with logistical support intelligence support
1736683 were going to have to have a very capable counterterrorism strike force were going to have to continue to train their army and police to make them more effective
1736684 i do think thats entirely conditions based its hard to anticipate where we may be six months from now or a year from now or a year and a half from now
1736685 by handing out 4 billion in tax breaks to the biggest oil companies and proposing gimmicks like offshore drilling that wont produce a drop of oil for seven years senator mccains energy plan fails to provide short term relief to consumers or long term independence from foreign oil said campaign spokesman hari sevugan
1736686 sergeants kite and federmann displayed exceptional teamwork and uncommon valor over the course of a four hour engagement while outnumbered by enemy insurgents
1736687 everyone did what they were supposed to do to make it out alive thats the best part
1736688 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there
1736689 our troops have performed brilliantly in lowering the level of violence
1736690 iraq has met all but three of 18 original benchmarks set by congress last year to measure security political and economic progress
1736691 if you had to do it over again knowing what you know now would you support the surge
1736692 i congratulate you maliki on the achievements of your government i am supportive and committed to preserving the gains the iraqi government achieved under your leadership
1736693 did not anticipate the convergence of not only the surge but the sunni awakening in which a whole host of sunni tribal leaders decided that they had had enough with al qaeda in the shiia community the militias standing down to some degrees
1736694 so what you had is a combination of political factors inside of iraq that then came right at the same time as terrific work by our troops

1736715 i used an islamic archetype but the actual stories dont show any islam because they are based on values that we all share
1736716 are based on religious archetypes like the prophets from the bible they are all orphans superman left his parents on the planet krypton and batman sees his father and mother gunned down in front of him
1736717 even though there are approximately 50 female superheroes only five will be covered in that way
1736718 i want to send the message out that there is not only one way to be muslim

1736793 the president offered the usual reassurances last night about the healthy state of the union but the state of his presidency has never been worse
1736794 a euphemism for hoping for the best less a strategy than a wish
1736795 it was i think the most effective democratic response in the bush years and he said it with testosterone and authority more authority than this president now has
1736796 this bill shows the american people that even in an election year republicans and democrats can come together to support our troops and their families
1736797 this law will play a critical role in helping to prevent another attack on our soil
1736798 the bill will allow our intelligence professionals to quickly and effectively monitor the communications of terrorists abroad while respecting the liberties of americans here at home
1736799 they think they know whats right and everyone else is wrong on everything
1736800 we have a great relationship with the obama campaign and work closely with them on everything from message strategy to on the ground coordination in states where we have races
1736801 at least bush waited until he was in the white house before they started ignoring everybody
1736802 i will give our military a new mission on my first day in office ending this war
1736803 let me be clear we must be as careful getting out of iraq as we were careless getting in we can safely redeploy our combat brigades at a pace that would remove them in 16 months
1736804 if we reduce our consumption of oil thats what will reduce gas prices
1736805 we cant drill our way out of the problem because theres just a finite amount of oil out there and you have got increasing demand from countries like china and india
1736806 and so the way we are going to see gas prices reduced is when we start using the oil that we get more intelligently than we are doing now
1736807 id love gas to be free but its not the fact is we cant wish our way out of the problem the price of gas is what it is
1736808 we have to find a replacement or a set of replacements for fossil fuels
1736809 wed all like to see u s troops get out of here at some point in time
1736810 however from a military perspective i need the laws and the regulations and the agreements from the government of iraq in order to continue operations beyond the 31st of december of this year
1736811 i dont think maliki is very keen to set a timetable for withdrawal
1736812 they the govt still know very well how much u s support they need for military operations
1736813 conditions and the circumstances that the country would be undergoing
1736814 we dont have a specific date in mind but we need to agree on the principle of setting a deadline
1736815 at this defining moment in history a moment when were facing two wars an economy in turmoil a planet in peril we cant afford to give john mccain the chance to serve out george bushs third term
1736816 gee is he a centrist just masquerading as someone whos a transformational progressive figure or is he really the opposite
1736817 no no you know what im going to refine my position
1736818 were in the midst of a struggle and we want to continue that struggle and give us the support and ammunition and the supplies and the popular support necessary to continue it

1736840 police had carried out an investigation on a sexual crime involving intercourse against the order of nature involving anwar based on existing legal principles and procedures
1736841 its a non bailable offence but it is normally granted except in the case of anwar
1736842 so many sodomy cases go on in malaysia so many rape cases so why should anwar be denied bail
1736843 i hold the prime minister personally responsible for the damage that is about to be done to the nation and to the integrity and dignity of the malays
1736844 i have thus far constrained my criticism of the prime minister to his failed policies and general incompetence in leading the nation
1736845 but now it is clear that his vendetta against those who would seek his early dismissal from office knows no boundaries and will transgress all limits of the rule of law
1736846 this is a man under siege he sees no way out but to deflect the attention of the malaysian people with a sham trial against me he is now burning the forest to save his own tree
1736847 the real criminals will in their efforts to humiliate me and to derail the peoples aspirations for transformational change in malaysia hide behind a smokescreen created by the government controlled mainstream media
1736848 the evidence proves that the accuser lied in his initial report
1736849 other witnesses in this case have been threatened and harassed in order to fabricate evidence doctors appear to have been pressure to violate all norms of medical ethics
1736850 senior ministers in their comments about the case have demonstrated their consistent interference in the investigation
1736851 whether bail for me tomorrow is denied or not the campaign for permatang pauh will continue my sarong and songkok can even appear on my behalf at the constituency
1736852 manoharan won while he was under detention of course i dont want to pre empt that
1736853 until today ive not seen the police report dated june 28 by accuser saiful and the medical report where is sanity and rule of law
1736854 if anwar is denied bail the very morality and legitimacy of the abdullah premiership will come under question nationally and internationally which will be a very sad end for a prime minister who had started his administration with such high hopes and great mandate from ordinary malaysians less than five years ago
1736855 are we a nation which deserves international trust and respect for our high and unquestioned regard for the rule of law and a judiciary of independence impartiality integrity and meritocracy

1736857 i hold the prime minister personally responsible for the damage that is about to be done to the nation and to the integrity and dignity of the malays
1736858 if you ask me what kind of image i want
1736859 all the time he tried to poison my mind on anwars character he claimed to know anwar inside out
1736860 i joined umno because of anwar ibrahim and left umno because of anwar ibrahim
1736861 i hold the prime minister personally responsible for the damage that is about to be done to the nation and to the integrity and dignity of the malays

1736870 prophecy from planet clarion call to city flee that flood
1736871 a belief must be held with deep conviction and it must have some relevance to action that is to what the believer does or how he behaves
1736872 the person holding the belief must have committed himself to it that is for the sake of his belief he must have taken some important action that is difficult to undo in general the more important such actions are and the more difficult they are to undo the greater is the individuals commitment to the belief
1736873 the belief must be sufficiently specific and sufficiently concerned with the real world so that events may unequivocally refute the belief
1736874 such undeniable disconfirmatory evidence must occur and must be recognized by the individual holding the belief
1736875 the individual believer must have social support it is unlikely that one isolated believer could withstand the kind of disconfirming evidence we have specified if however the believer is a member of a group of convinced persons who can support one another we would expect the belief to be maintained and the believers to attempt to proselyte or to persuade nonmembers that the belief is correct
1736876 prior to december 20 the group shuns publicity interviews are given only grudgingly access to mrs keechs house is only provided to those who can convince the group that they are true believers the group evolves a belief system provided by the automatic writing from the planet clarion to explain the details of the cataclysm the reason for its occurrence and the manner in which the group would be saved from the disaster
1736877 december 20 the group expects a visitor from outer space to call upon them at midnight and to escort them to a waiting spacecraft as instructed the group goes to great lengths to remove all metallic items from their persons as midnight approaches zippers bra straps and other objects are discarded the group waits
1736878 12 05 a m december 21 no visitor someone in the group notices that another clock in the room shows 11 55 the group agrees that it is not yet midnight
1736879 12 10 a m the second clock strikes midnight still no visitor the group sits in stunned silence the cataclysm itself is no more than seven hours away

1736967 although nothing can erase the scars of a rape hopefully the courts action will help the victim feel safer knowing that the perpetrator is behind bars for life
1736968 our research shows that the rough has become less of a challenge for the highly skilled professional and that driving accuracy is now less of a key factor for success
1736969 we believe that these changes will increase the challenge of the game at the tour level while having a very small effect on the play of most golfers
1736970 the scientific research on the effect of grooves on spin and the ability of highly skilled professional golfers to control shots from the rough was very compelling
1736971 the usga and the r amp a took additional time to consider fully the potential ramifications for all levels of golfers in particular we took care to minimize the impact on amateurs who actively compete in club and local competitions as well as other golfers who do not want to replace recently purchased clubs
1736972 ultimately we came to the conclusion that the path forward was to get the top level professional tours under the new groove regulations as soon as possible and to phase in the next level of amateur competition four years later in 2014
1736973 this means that clubs you own today will still be conforming for top level amateur competition for another 5 1 2 years and for other competitions conforming until at least 2024 if not indefinitely

1736979 oh yeah she was really nervous and licking herself all weekend
1736980 when i picked the dogs up on monday it was pointed out in passing that one of my dogs had bitten on of my other dogs on the nose
1736981 i called good dog to find out and had to wait for a manager to call me back i told the young lady who answered the phone that i had already called the owners cell phone and left a voice mail she informed me that ownership had changed a couple of weeks ago
1736982 when the manager called i asked why i was not told about the injuries when i called to check in on the dogs on friday and sunday
1736983 when the manager called back he was extremely apologetic for his previous tone and told me that the staff had seen one of my dogs biting the other dog while they were in their suite i asked why we werent notified or told when we called in to check on the dogs he said they didnt think it was that bad i have photos from two and three days later it was bad enough that it needed vet attention at the very least we should have been called and given the option to have our other dog placed in a separate kennel
1736984 i learned yesterday that good dog has not changed ownership that there has been a kind of hostile take over and that the previous owner founder has been locked out of the facility for over two weeks this explains the change in feeding routines dogs were previously taken out and fed starting at 7am i was told by the new manager that 9 30am was the normal feeding time in the morning the staff told me afternoon feedings were at 4 30pm this was worrisome to me as one of our dogs is on medication that needs to be taken every 12 hours she was given her pills instead at feedings which were not even close to 12 hours apart

1737001 lasting impacts of the crisis will be observed in economic growth politics and regulation and central banking
1737002 credit quality across many loan classes has begun to deteriorate with declining house prices and slowing economic growth
1737003 although banks have succeeded in raising additional capital balance sheets are under renewed stress and bank equity prices have fallen sharply
1737004 the underlying problem is not just subprime us mortgages but excess lending to all private sectors of the economy
1737005 debt was too high and growing too fast and risk aversion was too low in particular the price of liquidity had reachedabsurdly low levels as usual a general excess had its outstanding folly in this instance it was subprime debt just as the crazy overvaluation of world stock markets in march 2000 had its particular folly in the high techs
1737006 growth will slow on a trend basis particularly in the uk and us which have been under saving and under investing but getting by in the short term through the boom in financial services and by financing consumption with large external deficits
1737007 disappointed expectations by voters will lead to populist measures which will tend to hinder world trade and increase regulations these will make matters worse and further impede growth
1737008 equity prices are likely to go down in waves the first one is complete and the next wave is likely to start in october a lot of people have made money from clever financial engineering and that is now being unwound
1737009 looking forward a uk recession is fast becoming our central case scenario
1737010 any hope that a buying opportunity in uk cyclical stocks would be in 2008 now appears to have been extinguished
1737011 when you have a credit crisis the currency must go down to boost external demand to replace domestic demand so you lower interest rates you put on a very steep yield curve to allow the banks to recapitalise you try to recapitalise the banks through rights issues or new capital as fast as you can so if you look at what the us government has been doing for the last year since the crisis erupted they have done a pretty good job
1737012 so the fed has been able to manage the credit crisis without increasing the money supply
1737013 that has huge implications since inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon and if the central bank is not printing money and if commercial banks are not able to lend bank lending in the us is plummeting as we speak then exactly how are we going to find the money to finance inflation
1737014 inflation is going to be waning pretty soon as a lot of commodities are rolling over
1737015 the credit crisis is suddenly almost as big in europe as it is in the us
1737016 the policy there is exactly the opposite of what should be done the european economy is going to fall literally out of bed its staring at a huge recession
1737017 in spain you have more empty houses than in the us for an economy which is not even one tenth of the size german exports are starting to collapse because of the overvalued euro and the global slowdown
1737018 they are at the tail end of the crisis the real issue is what is going to happen in europe
1737019 the latest consensus survey of economists forecasts shows further downward revisions this month to euro area and uk growth expectations for both this year and next
1737020 the two big shocks hitting the european economy as in the us are the income shock from surging food and energy prices and the credit shock there is a debate as to which of these is the most important
1737021 but if that is wrong and it is the credit shock that is the main factor behind the drop off in growth then the fall back in oil prices while welcome is unlikely to offer much relief
1737022 a simple look at the data across europe points strongly in the direction of the slowdown being driven by the credit shock
1737023 as mentioned earlier this does not seem to be the view of most forecasters
1737024 neither it seems is it the view of equity markets which have rallied strongly as the oil price has dropped back or central banks
1737025 within europe at least the economies that have fared worst in the situation the uk spain and ireland are also the ones experiencing the most significant credit shocks the food and energy shock by contrast has been broadly comparable across economies
1737026 the asian financial system has so far proved to be fairly resilient to the us subprime crisis asian exposure to opaque asset backed securities has been well below that of other primarily western economies
1737027 the region remains vulnerable to asset price volatility in general in addition policy options for asian central banks are increasingly constrained by domestic inflationary pressures and slowing external demand
1737028 well within regional capital buffers and are also a lot lower than losses in other parts of the world
1737029 nevertheless asia has not emerged completely unscathed global financial turbulence has manifested itself in the form of sharp equity falls across the region

1737209 right foot left foot faster faster umm go home shower
1737210 what exactly do i think about when im running i dont have a clue
1737211 as i run i dont think much of anything worth mentioning i just run
1737212 i run in a void or maybe i should put it the other way i run in order to acquire a void the thoughts that occur to me while im running are like clouds in the sky clouds of all different sizes they come and they go while the sky remains the same sky as always the clouds are mere guests in the sky that pass away and vanish leaving behind the sky the sky both exists and doesnt exist it has substance and at the same time doesnt and we merely accept that vast expanse and drink it in
1737213 runners can detect each notch in the seasonal shift in the feel of the wind against our skin its smell and direction in the midst of this flow im aware of myself as one tiny piece in the gigantic mosaic of nature im just a replaceable natural phenomenon like the water in the river that flows under the bridge towards the sea
1737214 i placed the highest priority on the sort of life that lets me focus on writing not associating with all the people around me
1737215 i know that if i hadnt become a long distance runner when i became a novelist my work would have been vastly different
1737216 most of what i know about writing fiction i learned by running every day
1737217 how different hard to say but something would have definitely been different
1737218 there is no one else in the video game industry quite like fatal1ty and were thrilled that he wont be attending our show
1737219 seriously if he even tries to come well kick him out
1737220 much like humans female guppies produce relatively few eggs and give birth to live offspring they dont lay their eggs for a seasonal spawning but keep them inside their bodies where they are fertilised by the males because they are not reliant on seasons the females have a continuous battle to keep the males at bay so they are resorting to extreme measures to avoid unwelcome attention

1737233 i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it
1737234 we found that players are always looking for bragging rights and recognition of their past accomplishments
1737235 its more to feel like you got a trophy for doing something special but in no way would this increase your character power we didnt want to force you into weird sorts of gameplay that you wouldnt be doing anyway we wanted it to more be sort of a reflection of what players were already doing
1737236 at first we were coming up with other names like accomplishments goals medals anything to not call them achievements
1737237 we sort of came around to the conclusion that all players call them achievements steam has a great achievement system xbox has a great achievement system its almost just like this weird game at a certain point to
1737238 we wanted to focus on getting the user interface in a good presentable form and things that other achievement systems havent done a good job of
1737239 a lot of things weve done in wow are sort of evolving different game systems and making them accessible
1737240 we wanted to focus on getting the user interface in a good presentable form and things that other achievement systems havent done a good job of
1737241 part of that is a reaction to a lot of achievement systems that are currently out there where they ask you to do things but you dont know if youve done them yet
1737242 youll be playing a game and itll say destroy all the billboards out in the city or whatever and you think youve done it all buy the achievement didnt fire off and youre like okay which billboard did i miss and the only way to get it is to go back and do it all over again so we just wanted to give players some visibility
1737243 we retroactively track any quest achievements or any achievement for an item which is either on your character or in your bank
1737244 there are a lot of achievements based on stuff like honorable kills or reputations we have all that tracked
1737245 theres a quest associated with killing onyxia like the turn in her head quest
1737246 we know if youve done that but the problem is not everybody whos killed onyxia has necessarily gotten the head and turned it in so theres a fairness issue its like well i raided with these guys but bob got the head and then he turned it in and then when the achievement goes live his achievement will be filled out but mine wont so there might be understandability issues there like well how come he got it but i didnt so thats something were actually feeling out in the beta im torn on that right now
1737247 we fully expect that people will come up with their own achievement browsers and comparison systems
1737248 as far as the actual rewarding of achievements all of that is completely secure
1737249 our user interface guys went out of their way to build the achievement system so that the mod community can completely rip it apart and do whatever they wanted with it the look and how the information is presented to you we fully expect that people will come up with their own achievement browsers and comparison systems
1737250 with kaplan hoping to offer 700 achievements by the time the game ships and as

1737253 the arbitrator is now working on the file so we cannot speculate on the outcome
1737254 we respect the process and we want to wait for the decision
1737255 if this happens in quebec this will be a big shot in the arm for wal mart workers everywhere
1737256 if this had been a regular file we would have had a collective agreement in 2005
1737257 a few years later we wouldnt even be talking about it any more
1737258 we want you to play at the bataclan in paris

1737263 among the unique features of this event is the opportunity for the talented entrants to be bold and creative

1737363 my past experience in helping entrepreneurs implement marketing and sales distribution strategies designed to match innovation to new users tells me that this aspect of business planning is sometimes overlooked by startup firms
1737364 i also like the idea of strengthening the marketing plans of existing small manufacturers who are engaged in new product development because it raises the acquisition value of the company
1737365 we are trying to put together the pieces of a new type of private sector initiative for a regional economic development strategy called innovation economics
1737366 my research on the american economy indicates that our rates of innovation are way too low and that much of the american technological innovation capacity has been outsourced
1737367 our best remaining innovation asset is the existing base of small manufacturing enterprises but even if we are successful today in stimulating innovation in the existing rtp manufacturing value chains it would take about 3 years before the increase in jobs would be noticeable
1737368 we are way behind the economic growth eight ball in helping our small manufacturing community with innovation in new products
1737369 the larger corporations have already moved their product innovation operations offshore and our regional economy is in economic jeopardy of losing an entire generation of innovation potential if the existing small manufacturers lock their doors turn out the lights and go out of business
1737370 our regional economy has a network of great sales and marketing consultants who i hope to call on to help teach many of our classes
1737371 we have seen growing excitement for the asia auctions as the hot or not contest reaches its final stage contestants and auction participants alike are logging on each day to think asia to check out the latest development we believe that the asia auction process has been a great success not only in providing a fairer process to compete for domain names but also in building a solid foundation for adoption investment and growth value of asia domains
1737372 we are energized by the adoption of the asia domains exemplifying our philosophy from asia for asia businesses and initiatives embracing the asia domain are coming from asia as well as from around the world who are targeting services for asia the asia market and the asian audience
1737373 the usage of asia domain names by small and large companies alike demonstrates the value of an asia centric internet web address

1737378 above all couples want their wedding day to be special and unique
1737379 this fantastic move forward will not only bring our entrepreneur business community closer together but will also allow high speed communication for entrepreneurs who need immediate answers or who have a need to engage other million impossible entrepreneur members with easy and accuracy although we are a young network and have built our sites with limited funding we are starting to prove that during a recession and worsening financial climate our entrepreneur members are in fact realising that by uniting together we are all growing stronger and wiser above all our members are learning about the importance of being honest honest in sharing their successes and their mistakes our raw honesty is vitally important if we are as a community going to help to protect each others businesses this is great news for our existing members and our future members

1737417 we may think we live in a fast moving hectic world but statistically our environment moves around us slowly
1737418 apart from the odd speeding car buildings landscape and walls around us all move past us at slow and predictable speeds our brains are constantly building up a statistical picture of the world around and based on experience it is a statistically slow world
1737419 when an object moves quickly be it a football cricket ball or for our ancestors a spear our brains have to interpret the movement rapidly and because our brains draw on experience its often biased by what it already knows the less certain we are about what we see the more we are influenced by the brains statistical assumptions which means in some circumstances we get it wrong
1737420 just as the eyes are the window to the soul the eyes are also a window into social development
1737421 the earlier we are able to identify children the better it is because early interventions make a difference in optimizing childrens outcomes

1737423 prophylactic mastectomy is problematic and has a number of grey areas the best one can say is that it may be acceptable for competent adults who have given informed consent free of any force coercion manipulation or undue influence from any source prophylactic mastectomy cannot be sanctioned on infants or children who have not yet attained legal competence or the age of majority

1737425 patients may not be learning this information from their health care providers and information regarding colon cancer prevention is not as well publicized as it could be
1737426 in the context of busy clinic visits it is in some ways efficient for patients to be reminded that physical activity is good for their health in general going through each specific health benefit of physical activity would take considerable time
1737427 sedentary people should first set such moderate achievable goals more benefits could accrue from higher levels and more intense exercise such as jogging running or tennis to some extent more may be better but it is important to note that a little is much better than nothing

1737432 we found that smoked cannabis was generally well tolerated and effective when added to the patients existing pain medication resulting in increased pain relief

1737457 we have invited the best of the best this year and i look forward to seeing which lites riders step up in the way that jake weimer did last year when he won saturday nights main event
1737458 year in and year out the u s open has proven to be one of the most competitive races and 2007 was no different as the two nightly winners chad reed and weimer were beat out by the more consistent grant langston
1737459 but i think i only slept about five hours the whole weekend i had a lot of difficulty concentrating when i was on the track
1737460 i think i would have had another shot at the podium if we had gone the full race
1737461 me and patrice we tested two weeks before the race in 05
1737462 and i really started to enjoy the track and after that ive had some strong results there
1737463 at mosport for example we already had a good base set up to work with and we just had to make little changes from there its a lot easier to go through a weekend when you have that
1737464 i always had a good relationship with benoit even when he was racing against me
1737465 he understands what its like to be a rider and what a rider wants
1737466 pascal has a lot of experience and when he helps us with set up he usually sends us in the right direction

1737469 we have lots of options in terms of investing across the globe
1737470 and at the moment in australia it is just getting tougher i am annoyed at the possibility of copping another 24 million hit because of the industry we are in when in other countries they wont do that because they know it will destroy their industry
1737471 ten years ago independents were in disarray market shares were dropping rapidly to the benefit of the chains
1737472 our focus was on stopping any further erosion of independent supermarkets market share by making them significantly more competitive and repositioning them as viable consumer alternative to the chains
1737473 today independent grocery retailers and in particular iga have seen significant gains in sales market share and brand recognition comparable with the majors all crucial factors that are missing from this report
1737474 the agreements that metcash has with independent retailers and suppliers restrict choice in dealing with players other than metcash

1737494 serious violations of corporate standards and inappropriate conduct on the part of three senior individuals martin rey christian terberger and artus pourroy
1737495 the outcome of the internal audit review is that the allegations could not be substantiated and the outcome of the external review affirmed the appropriateness of the internal review process
1737496 and made allegations that the named persons had in the context of these issues engaged in serious violation of corporate standards and inappropriate conduct we took and continue to take allegations such as those expressed in the email extremely seriously a review of those allegations was conducted by our internal audit department last year and we commissioned an external review of that internal audit to confirm the appropriateness of that review
1737497 outrageous and inappropriate behaviour towards colleagues or subordinates people have left the company for that reason only
1737498 schemes were discussed and pushed which were even from a laymans perspective illegal
1737499 there is hardly any financial incentive to follow through on a deal just completed in other companies the acquired projects are actually required to generate a certain benchmark return before bonus payouts take place you do not get paid until the project is working well for the company that should be the standard instead we have created an environment where senior people are rewarded for building and ginning up rosy projections to justify their rewards
1737500 it is widely acknowledged that both the facts and the numbers in board papers have been consistently on the optimistic side of things in some instances you might call manipulated
1737501 including their favourites who cannot do any wrong are often allowed to set absurdly optimistic assumptions for models or not disclose material facts
1737502 we are seeing very positive news for retailers on the lower oil price and it also looks like interest rates have peaked
1737503 its always hard to measure sentiment which can turn on a dime but many feel we are close to the bottom of the market for the consumer
1737504 there has been much publicity about the uncertain macro economic settings including higher interest rates higher fuel costs and the uncertainty in capital markets
1737505 many of our business units operate in markets that still exhibit growth despite these factors
1737506 hills is not heavily exposed to the domestic housing cycle and as such we expect a satisfactory result in the year ahead

1737510 i remember the happening had just came out and i walked into the editing room with it the looping stage with john moore director and he showed me some shit and i was just fucking screaming with excitement i was so happy that my career was saved my life my credibility my ability to walk down the street was in a hood again i was fucking screaming at the top of my lungs for like five fucking minutes
1737511 if you ask judd apatow he sees this as an anti weed movie i dont know what movie hes watching i cant imagine any outcome for this movie other than people watching it and wanting to smoke weed
1737512 the whole time bob and i were doing full house he was also hosting americas funniest videos his entire job consisted of saying take a look at this which is what he used to say to mary kate in her dressing room
1737513 if this record doesnt sell im kind of screwed i dont know if i can ever do this again this might be my last record if it doesnt get some attention or doesnt pay off in some way now im just hoping i can get some choice licenses im actually praying to get my song on a car commercial or something movies or tv thats the only way for someone like me to make music these days
1737514 its just silly because the way people are talking about it youd think it was a bertolucci movie or something people are saying its woody allens steamiest movie im thinking woody allens steamiest what
1737515 i have an idea to make shia labeouf the lead character next time and have harrison ford come back like sean connery did in the last movie i can see it working out
1737516 indiana jones is indiana jones harrison ford is indiana jones if it was shias character mutt williams it would be mutt williams and the search for elvis or something

1737521 i would be quite happy to have walked over that stockpile
1737522 from the viewpoint of science the north pole is just another point on the globe but symbolically it is hugely important there is supposed to be ice at the north pole not open water
1737523 the issue is that for the first time that i am aware of the north pole is covered with extensive first year ice ice that formed last autumn and winter id say its even odds whether the north pole melts out
1737524 indeed for the arctic as a whole the melt season started with even more thin ice than in 2007 hence concerns that we may even beat last years sea ice minimum well see what happens a great deal depends on the weather patterns in july and august
1737525 theres a good chance that it will all melt away at the north pole its certainly feasible but its not guaranteed
1737526 last year we saw huge areas of the ocean open up which has never been experienced before people are expecting this to continue this year and it is likely to extend over the north pole it is quite likely that the north pole will be exposed this summer its not happened before
1737527 the costs being incurred by organic producers are rising much faster than for conventional production
1737528 the price we get currently for organic milk is not high enough to cover the cost of production there will have to be an increase in the price that producers receive
1737529 in this context it is no longer attractive for conventional farms to convert and we are seeing producers undergoing conversion exiting that process the concern is that the relatively small number of leavers becomes a mass exit among existing producers
1737530 there is a real danger that a supply shortage could take hold rather quickly if just 30 of our larger organic farms revert to non organic production we will lose 10 per cent of our supplies
1737531 perhaps it is inevitable that we might see some decline in demand among less deeply committed organic consumers
1737532 it is a bitter irony for us but after so many years of talking about the virtues of growing your own and british produce people are doing it and it is resulting in a fall in trade
1737533 we normally see a 20 per cent drop in sales in summer which lasts from july to september but now that period is being extended to from june until november
1737534 we were basically hiring terrorists the u s signed up legions of sketchy iraqi fighters to help stop sectarian violence now most may lose their security jobs but remain armed and angry
1737535 freddie mac reported a second quarter loss of 821 million
1737536 julys announcements layoffs rise to 103 312 led by airlines
1737537 i am hopeful that the australian government and the opposition will see that their policy positions today are very similar to each other and all they need to do now is bridge that gap and make it a bipartisan policy
1737538 because we dont want the minor parties in the senate determining the shape of climate policy in this country if they do then fund managers are going to have an interesting way home picking up the remains of the australian economy over the next few decades
1737539 undermine the credibilty of a long term price of carbon
1737540 i would have waited for the political compromise to come once it went to the legislation
1737541 the current debate in australia about using the revenue to change income distributions is a very bad idea the revenue from any climate policy should go straight back into solving the climate problem not to implement some other agenda
1737542 neither we nor anyone else can predict when the housing market will recover and it will be folly for anyone
1737543 theres still a large amount of inventory to work through the system and record foreclosures
1737544 during the second quarter freddie mac continued to perform its mission manage risk and add long term value through expanded business opportunities
1737545 while market and credit conditions remained very challenging during the second quarter as demonstrated by our increased credit related expenses and impairments on non agency mortgage related securities our credit guarantee business and mortgage portfolio both saw strong high quality growth
1737546 we are confident the actions we are taking are strengthening freddie macs financial and competitive position as well as its ability to serve the american homebuyer and will generate value well into the future
1737547 we are in a unique situation profitable able to utilize nols and the tax savings number is big enough that it is material to the overall value of the company

1737553 we have a lot to learn from their success too they did some very innovative things to keep people going and their experience rewards system was something that we paid a lot of attention to i think its a great game and single player obviously is fantastic they did a hell of a job with their set pieces of scripting certain moments that they were really sure the player was going to actually see and experience first hand the way that they use those moments to craft the player experience halo has a lot to learn from

1737575 it has been more than a year since the housing market went on a tumultuous skid yet the hangover from bad lending practices and tighter credit has housings two primary sponsors fannie mae and freddie mac still unable to step in and fully provide support
1737576 given the likelihood of a prolonged housing slump and the uncertainty of government support investors should remain extremely cautious of lenders like freddie mac or fannie mae
1737577 while we expect continued housing and economic weakness will affect our overall performance this year we continue to maintain a surplus over all regulatory capital requirements
1737578 we remain committed to raising 5 5 billion dollars of new capital and will evaluate raising capital beyond this amount depending on our needs and as market conditions mandate

1737585 we are talking 90 million barrels of oil nearly 17 hundred trillion cubic feet
1737586 i suppose for any state control over hydrocarbons is significant as other resources dwindle
1737587 the other factor is the melting of the polar ice and that is making it easier to explore the area which is why the oil and gas industry is looking at it
1737588 it is now becoming a potential area of development rather than a hypothetical one
1737589 it is vulnerable and extracting oil and gas is not an environmentally friendly activity

1737604 this report contains unacceptable accusations made against french political and military officials
1737605 gather evidence showing the implication of the french state in the genocide carried out in rwanda in 1994
1737606 our determination to build a new relationship with rwanda moving beyond our difficult past remains intact
1737607 this report is an important step of which france should be happy
1737608 for diplomacy it is a very good basis the relation between rwanda and france should be based on the truth
1737609 the government has asked the courts to use this report we hope that legal proceedings will follow
1737610 in the past few years we have seen an insidious attempt to rewrite history it aims to turn france from an involved party into an accomplice to the genocide

1737616 we are very pleased with where we are now positioned
1737617 we are seeing strong interest in the optocooler upf4 and upf40 products and anticipate design wins in the telecom industry this year with financing in place and production up and running we can concentrate fully on making that happen
1737618 customer adoption is always a risk for a new product

1737893 it is the location of the property the land which abuts conservation land and that we are building custom homes

1737902 what attracted us most to the home was the location
1737903 we were living in a small condo in newburyport and wanted to be close to our grandchildren we were very impressed with his quality and have found west newbury to be a very close knit community
1737904 once prospective buyers visit the model home and tour the community they realize the value of their investment here

1737913 this will provide sufficient liquidity to run the business until the company can finalize a deal for a new debtor in possession credit facility which we expect to ask the court to approve on august 27
1737914 the resource analysis report concluded that the resource is much larger than anticipated and we expect that as the wells continue to heat up it will actually provide temperatures in excess of the 280 degrees f experienced during testing
1737915 we believe the issuance of the report puts us in a position to finalize and close in a timely manner on the funding for the thermo project pursuant to the financing commitment previously announced we are excited about the progress to date on our first wave of projects and have a number of projects being prepared for additional waves we expect to start setting the generating units for operational purposes at the thermo site in the august to september time frame so that the plant will be operational later this year we expect to be active in this resource field well into the future as we plan the development of additional projects in the same area

1737939 de stocking getting rid of the store stock to protect the breeding animals they are pretty heavy decisions to make when you consider these animals should be your main source of income but now we have a good store of grass coming into lambing
1737940 it tastes like meat and it can look like meat but we can actually change the composition of the product quite a lot so we can mask the meaty flavour

1737947 this marketing guy came in and really thrashed the table they had been able to make three roasts out of the lamb legs they had been getting but then suddenly the leg sizes changed and they were getting only two and half this is crazy what do i do with half a roast he wanted to know
1737948 you can see why theres been a big exodus from the industry
1737949 we decided we would never be dependent on the store market again so we borrowed a million dollars and bought a finishing farm
1737950 given us a sniff of what can be achieved if we can do this well we want to work smarter not harder focusing on doing the simple things well
1737951 the hill country is where the sheep breeding operations should be and the flatter more fertile land is where the finishing should happen
1737952 in southland we have lost a lot of land to dairying we dont want to go down that pathway
1737953 fit lean and hungry and above all else well framed
1737954 both the breeder and the finisher must be completely clear at the outset what is expected of them it is no use a cheerfully mixed line of lambs appearing to be finished then when a cheerfully mixed outcome is achieved expressing disappointment
1737955 they must have a degree of confidence in each other and in the ultimate outcome for the product they will know each other be well informed and a part of a chain of information that travels both up and down they will have a share in the rewards that is commensurate with their input into the product
1737956 its sitting down with a group of farmers and saying how do we make this thing work theres synergies and efficiencies to be gained how does my lamb class fit with your lamb class and can we match them up rather than letting the market sort it out because it hasnt
1737957 if we can turn up to them with 300 to 500 thousand lambs those are lambs they dont have to worry about going to the market for it underwrites a proportion of their kill every week thats valuable to them
1737958 we really have to make substantial improvements in our value chain as an industry weve got to sort our marketing our processing sector and theres plans afoot to do that
1737959 i suggest we get in behind that by committing our supply to it but lets focus on what we can control behind the farmgate we have to improve productivity with a small ruminant theres a quantum lift we can make through maximising our output through genetics better feeding a streamlined system and by monitoring our costs
1737960 its on farm in the hill country breeding factory that is in our power to fix

1738026 develop reforms for a substantially or wholly elected second chamber
1738027 for this reason we will develop reforms for a substantially or wholly elected second chamber and will explore how the existing powers of the chamber should apply to the reformed chamber
1738028 if conference approves this document in autumn it will mean labour at last deliver on a hundred year old commitment to end patronage in parliament the forum rejected spurious arguments calling to halt reforms and instead showed the clear support across constituency party trade union and other representatives that a wholly elected second chamber is the way forward
1738029 the campaign is delighted that labours national policy forum has followed the lead set by ministers and taken a clear line in favour of democratic reform of the lords the campaign was closely involved in lobbying the npf at warwick against a last ditch attempt by some labour peers to commit the party to support for a nominated house a letter was circulated by two leading supporters of the campaign in the lords baroness glenys thornton and lord ivor richard which strongly supported the need for the party to support a democratic second chamber especially in the light of the recent white paper the campaign was delighted that the amendments for a nominated house were heavily defeated in fact the npf went further and passed amendments supporting a 100 elected second chamber while the campaign remains supportive of a second chamber which is wholly or mainly elected it warmly welcomes the fact that the npf has shown its unequivocal support for a democratic outcome on this issue now we need to get to work on the detail i hope that as many clps and individual party members as possible will take the opportunity to respond to the white paper over the next few months watch this space
1738030 incredibly cheap awesome shit that you didnt think you needed until you walked through our crazy doors
1738031 its sort of a non stop thing these assets are very attractive to all sorts of parties whether theyre strategic financial or sovereign funds
1738032 ive got no idea really those ones in particular use the merchant banks to facilitate introductions
1738033 the banks say they have a mandate and you dont know exactly who it is
1738034 there is certainly interest from financial buyers fund interest and port operators interest
1738035 the board will keep an open mind of course for an offer of the whole company that reflects fair value
1738036 however our primary focus remains on delivering value to our shareholders through the execution of our plans and strategy
1738037 to gain a recommendation from the board and the right to conduct due diligence any proposal must recognise the value of our unique set of assets and must contain a sufficient control premium and this proposal did not reach the mark
1738038 the decision on which businesses to monetise hasnt been reached yet
1738039 all businesses are going through an intensive capital planning process and on the basis of finalising those well have a clearer picture in terms of which businesses well look at
1738040 john howard in his wilfulness peter costello in his dumbness decided to go ahead with the 9 per cent rate and now the labor party with our myopic view of it are doing the same
1738041 this government like the last one is doing nothing about taking super to 15 per cent theyve run around about getting fees down but pension adequacy is still not there
1738042 unless we get the adequacy back to 15 per cent and we put in there a clear incentive to go to annuities we will go to a destitution model
1738043 lack of comprehension of the economic relevance of keatings drive towards a 15 per cent pension regime
1738044 remove senator sherry and the left wing conservatism he represents from this complex task with its wide ranging implications
1738045 davids pretty hard on sherry and well he ought to be
1738046 the whole point of superannuation is producing an actuarial income in retirement and when that goes the rationale for itgoes
1738047 instead of running a current account deficit of 6 per cent of gdp wed be running around 3
1738048 our banks would not be borrowing in new york at rates of interest that reflect the risks of the american financial system to fund the current account deficit because of the paucity of savings here as it is now because they chopped the 15 per cent out anyone born in the 1940s cant be in the system long enough to get any real capital it is impossible now to look after the baby boomers
1738049 the rudd government is the first australian government to appoint a superannuation minister showing how important superannuation is to this government
1738050 the fact minus the word fact becomes the name for my test method
1738051 is the biggest proponent of george bushs tired failed policies ready to bring about change another day brings another dishonest attack from john mccain while senator mccain knows that senator obama has proposed cutting taxes for 95 of american families what hes not telling us is that he wants to give 4 billion in tax breaks to the oil companies continue giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our job overseas and provide no direct tax relief for more than 100 million middle class families its time to retire these old policies and bring new energy to america
1738052 almost three decades ago on july 15 1979 president carter one of the ants delivered an important speech knowing that our nations energy policy was unsustainable and that we were becoming increasingly dependent on oil from hostile foreign countries he proposed a bold plan
1738053 bold conservation program to involve every state county and city and every average american in our energy battle
1738054 hey there are big problems in the country right now and youre talking about britney spears is this guy mccain insane or just stupid and out of touch
1738055 all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling
1738056 yesterday he suggested we put air in our tires to save on gas my friends lets do that but do you think thats enough to break our dependence on middle eastern oil i dont think so so i believe that every energy source needs to be part of the solution
1738057 this seems to me one of the very few times perhaps the only one that a presidential candidate suggested a way that i could save some money without personal sacrifice or ballooning the federal deficit
1738058 all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling
1738059 quite frankly the second i see some idiot politician on tv giving me suggestions on what to do i change the channel
1738060 now molly may think obamas conservation methods are enough to break our independence
1738061 now you id expect to think calling your political opponent
1738062 i have a question for clinton supporters one element of mccains frustration is a palpable sense of resentment that obama hasnt earned the nomination and doesnt deserve to be elected i thought clinton and her supporters felt the same way and that it actually hurt her allowing obama to seem above the fray am i wrong about that
1738063 did you need a presidential candidate to tell you to keep your tires properly inflated
1738064 many democrats want the us government to fund health insurance
1738065 yesterday he suggested we put air in our tires to save on gas my friends lets do that but do you think thats enough to break our dependence on middle eastern oil i dont think so so i believe that every energy source needs to be part of the solution
1738066 without a candidate for president calling the other side ignorant i find that unwise and unnecessary

1738072 if youre under 40 that was a long time ago man
1738073 youre a nice guy but this eurobonus program is pretty poor
1738074 it will be interesting to watch this debate between john mccain and john mccain
1738075 i agree with the american automobile association we should all inflate our tires
1738076 my opponent doesnt want to drill he doesnt want nuclear power he wants you to inflate your tires
1738077 thats a debate im happy to have because reads like an early christmas list for oil and gas lobbyists and its no wonder because many of his top advisers are former oil and gas lobbyists

1738084 raising taxes in a bad economy is about the worst thing you could do because it will kill even more jobs when what we need are policies that create jobs
1738085 it is because of this and because of the fact that an agreement between the usa and me has been breached that i wish to challenge the legality of the proceedings in their entirety and as well as any individual step thereof

1738089 this should be clear that this report is not just going to lie down put into some store somewhere its a report thats going to be used its a report that is going to help in bringing to justice or in making attempts very serious attempts to bring to justice people that were involved in committing genocide in this country
1738090 this is a story of much greater significance than just my sister or one woman her rape and torture is a crime beyond anything she was ever accused of
1738091 everything interfaces with security influences it and is influenced by it we must remember that it will all be meaningless if israel should be weak vulnerable and surrounded by enemies
1738092 the report was aiming to assess the conservation status of all primates so 634 species and the findings of the report are very very worrying for the conservation of primates 48 percent were classified as being threatened with extinction and thats an unprecedented rate among species and groups of species that have been assessed in the past
1738093 its mixed data its bearish for distillates bearish for crude oil and bullish for gasoline one key question is how much were going to make out of the draw in gasoline when we only have one month left in the driving season
1738094 the idea is people from this camp will head down to the power station and using various peaceful methods will close it down for the day
1738095 current elevated inflation levels and risks mean that the bank of england seems unlikely to cut interest rates again any time soon
1738096 there remains a serious possibility that it could even raise them this will do little for consumer confidence and spending intentions
1738097 there is not enough water in the system to bring down the sorts of quantities of water youd need to fill the lower lakes and to handle the evaporation in the lakes and transmission loss that is what youd lose along the way
1738098 the water is there but evidently the political will to fix this disastrous situation isnt
1738099 there is water available in storages in both nsw and victoria including menindee lakes
1738100 we watch our competitors prices across about 16 000 products this survey looks at about 500 and were still confident of the value that were offering across the board through the year
1738101 in our industry month old information is of limited value for consumers because prices change daily
1738102 iga stores and especially the bigger supa iga stores deliver substantially lower prices to consumers than the vast majority of other independent supermarkets in australia
1738103 the relationship was consensual and it ended earlier this year after a period of some months
1738104 i take responsibility for my being involved in this relationship and i regret the hurt caused to anyone including my family
1738105 but what essentially those conversations came down to was a requirement by me for good government to refer the letter to the solicitor general for formal advice and any outcome would need obviously to be made public
1738106 and that obviously has precipitated the difficult circumstances that we are in
1738107 now obviously that has caused significant stress for all of us and particularly for paula
1738108 but i want to make it clear that i had not accepted or recommended her resignation
1738109 i hope that the media will respect the privacy of myself and my family as i make my recovery
1738110 i wish to thank all those people who have expressed their good wishes and offers of support
1738111 it is a surprising result in a globalising world with increasingly mobile capital flows for a small open economy to have the highest weight given to the taxation of capital income
1738112 i dont necessarily find thateverything in this paper gels with everything that i have said on tax in the past and that is as it should be
1738113 but you will hurt everyone who has put savings into superannuation and all those small businesses that are accumulating franking credits
1738114 the alternative for the government is do the unpopular thing of shift the tax burden to the community and lower the tax rate on the corporate sector
1738115 were not afraid of them us were definitely not taking backward steps
1738116 with what theyve done just seeing them can intimidate a lot of people
1738117 if you come into a game like that youve given up before you start we didnt feel like we did that we tried not to give them too many uncontested shots
1738118 theyre the best athletes in the world so we tried to make them beat us on the perimeter
1738119 it was clear to me they were an extremely well coached team they executed extremely well
1738120 we had a new patch put in place in the affected areas by midday last friday but we now have a re emergence of a similar problem in the brisbane area
1738121 were not sure how long it will take to fix this problem again but we hope soon
1738122 nokias latest version of the software was in effect contaminated we had a bug in the software so we have had to roll it back
1738123 the issue for us is that we have put the upgrade in other areas and have had no problems whatsoever so its a bit of a lottery
1738124 there was extensive testing on both our parts and we were also assured by nokia siemens that the software would work in different network environments
1738125 but when we went live it was a different story
1738126 now were just hoping the patch will hold we cant say for sure whether or not we will have more issues over the next week in brisbane
1738127 were proud of both companies shared goal of providing a superior mobile service in australia experts from both companies are working in partnership to resolve any remaining network issues as is always the case when any outage occurs
1738128 we have told nokia to fly out some engineers because we certainly wont be flying them here
1738129 we do have some service level guarantees with them and we will clearly be looking at whether in fact the software they have given us is up to scratch
1738130 we are not looking to sue them on this what we are doing is looking to work with them to fix it
1738131 the p5 1 major powers are discussing next steps in the un security council and beginning to consider possible outlines of another sanctions resolution

1738138 boys are exposed all the time to role models girls dont have as wide a spectrum to choose from its a lot easier to be what you see so we want to make sure these women get as much exposure as possible

1738155 he should not have gone when the prospect of talks with the dalai lama on behalf of 7 million tibetans and president hu jintao was simply put on the shelf
1738156 i rock up to training and folkesy steve folkes someone that to be honest has never paid any interest in my personal life he comes up to me and starts saying youre not turning muslim are you
1738157 i just laughed i said seriously youre joking and then he has a go at anthony youre kidding yourself if youre taking advice off him
1738158 i start to think who is he to question my friends
1738159 in light of what has happened my advice about sonny not putting too much credence into what anthony mundine says was probably good advice
1738160 im not speaking on behalf of the club in this area but people who have known folkesy for the last 30 years would find that extremely hard to believe
1738161 to slur folkesy like that is where this whole situation has got to and thats pretty sad
1738162 the whole things totally distorted and if people want to go down that route i feel sorry for them because theyre trying to steer people away from the real facts of the matter
1738163 the bulldogs as a club are one of the most multicultural football clubs in the nrl
1738164 if sonny bill williams is alleging that racism is a root cause of his decision to walk out then the young man has been badly advised
1738165 i think sonny might be thinking he hasnt got that much longer to go and he needs to get out of it what he can
1738166 looking at it that way i can see his point of view but i think the way he went about it and not letting us know wasnt the right way to go about it
1738167 its really punchy and such an idiosyncratic book and theres plenty in it you can disagree with but you have to admire the skill and the beauty of the writing
1738168 i kept coming back to something joseph addison had written in the 18th century words when well chosen have so great a force in them that the description often gives out more lively ideas than the sight of the things themselves

1738195 it has been more than a year since the housing market went on a tumultuous skid yet the hangover from bad lending practices and tighter credit has housings two primary sponsors fannie mae and freddie mac still unable to step in and fully provide support
1738196 given the likelihood of a prolonged housing slump and the uncertainty of government support investors should remain extremely cautious of lenders like freddie mac or fannie mae
1738197 while we expect continued housing and economic weakness will affect our overall performance this year we continue to maintain a surplus over all regulatory capital requirements
1738198 we remain committed to raising 5 5 billion us dollars of new capital and will evaluate raising capital beyond this amount depending on our needs and as market conditions mandate

1738214 the military commission system is a fair and appropriate legal process we look forward to other cases moving forward to trial
1738215 we fully intend to move forward with additional prosecutions on the 20 other cases that are currently in the military commission system
1738216 this military commission finds you on charge number one conspiracy not guilty of charge two material support for terrorism guilty
1738217 is material support a war crime the defense believes it is not
1738218 a good outcome for the government in arguing that this was a fair trial
1738219 the fourth factor the ability of the defense to mount a full defense is where the criticism of the process likely will be levied
1738220 the verdict was in long before the jury began to deliberate
1738221 the military commission system is a fair and appropriate legal process for prosecuting detainees alleged to have committed crimes against the united states or out interests we look forward to other cases moving forward to trial mr fratto said
1738222 hamdan was alleged to have committed serious war crimes involving terrorist activity
1738223 hes an al qaeda warrior he has wounded and the people he has worked with have wounded the world murphy told the jury
1738224 we will capture or kill osama bin laden some day you should not punish the generals driver today with the crimes of the general the yemeni mans court appointed military lawyer navy lieutenant commander brian mizer told the court
1738225 a trial that depends on handicapping the defence cant possibly be fair said jennifer daskal senior counterterrorism counsel at human rights watch

1738228 i think you have a good description for gaza and the worsening conditions since the israeli siege
1738229 mainly im talking about the issue of fuel of which we are receiving just small quantities
1738230 the water supply is operating on fuel and the electricity
1738231 and not to forget that we live in gaza where its summer now humid hot conditions living in this weather is a killer without electricity and sometimes without water
1738232 so the life here is very bad although there is a cease fire because israel didnt respect the cease fire and still continue violating the agreement to a cease fire between hamas and israel

1738269 using taxpayer funded state employees to manipulate an election is unethical and a betrayal of the public trust

1738271 has truly sunk to a new low using state employees to try and buy people directly off the ballot
1738272 this latest stunt is another sad attempt by tom craddick to cling to his absolute power his attempts to urge qualified candidates off the ballot are just plain wrong while there is little doubt that he is desperate to save his own political hide this saga raises further questions about tom craddicks misuse of state resources and his taxpayer funded staff to pursue his personal political agenda

1738326 the 2008 atlantic basin hurricane season has gotten off to a very fast start
1738327 although global surface temperatures have increased over the last century and over the last 30 years there is no reliable data available to indicate increased hurricane frequency or intensity in any of the globes other tropical cyclone basins besides the atlantic
1738328 in a global warming or global cooling world the atmospheres upper air temperatures will warm or cool in unison with the sea surface temperatures
1738329 we should not read too much into the two hurricane seasons of 2004 2005 the activity of these two years was unusual but well within natural bounds of hurricane variation

1738368 i truly believe that even after we possess our land zionism will not cease to be an ideal for zionism as i understand it includes not only the yearning for a plot of promised land legally acquired for our weary people but also the yearning for ethical and spiritual fulfillment
1738369 ensuring the future and the distinctiveness of the jewish people by furthering jewish hebrew and zionist education fostering spiritual and cultural values and teaching hebrew as the national language
1738370 for it is that which drives us the ideal is for the community what bread and water are for the individual and our zionism which led us hither and which will lead us still further to yet unknown heights is but such an ideal an infinite endless ideal

1738394 further expand ibms commitment to linux and open source by enabling the next generation of linux
1738395 we see the next real growth in the linux market coming from five main directions
1738396 these include big green linux linux for business critical operations linux desktop mid market solutions and emerging technologies on linux
1738397 ready to use fully integration solution that can be delivered on dvds or usb drives
1738398 ibm has been investing in enterprise linux from the beginning
1738399 and we have this humongous portfolio of software available to support it but as we have watched linux mature weve seen a couple of areas that are on the brink of opening up opportunities for us for customers for partners and for the industry
1738400 weve long believed that one of the best ways to deliver technology to this market is through what is popularly known as an appliance
1738401 opens new opportunities for domino software vendors to deliver their applications on a software appliance to the smallest businesses
1738402 until now there really hasnt been a good integrated enterprise ready choice for small business besides this microsoft offering

1738404 on the organized crime side they have gotten better organized the bad guys have continued to grow up

1738410 this scheme is designed for any first time buyer from students moving through further education to people in their 20s and even 30s who have been unable to buy a home indeed it can make a real difference in peoples circumstances on getting onto the property ladder or not
1738411 not only will the double your deposit scheme allow more people to be able to afford a deposit for a new home it actually encourages young people to save instead of spend we are delighted that halifax is supporting this as the uks number one savings provider and leading brand for first time buyer mortgages they have experience in helping this purchaser group onto the ladder which is the ultimate aim of our campaign
1738412 this is a great deal for first time buyers by opening a new halifax account and saving regularly potential home owners are planning for the financial commitment of buying their first home doubling their deposit in this way should be a major incentive for first time buyers
1738413 we are pleased to be back at the top of the tree particularly as new life has very clear transparent and easily calculated early redemption charges

1738434 these figures reveal a basic lesson that could be key to the survival of many developers in the current market location
1738435 investland went through a similar experience when we first entered the residential market in the early 1990s putting a great deal of effort into identifying areas that we felt would become popular for home buyers a few years down the road
1738436 our experience has shown that building high specification projects in locations that we believe in will deliver results in any market
1738437 good locations can also be fashioned so if a developer shows enough commitment to an area and works hard at being a regenerative influence it is possible to create the kind of location that the study suggests home buyers are looking for

1738494 the return on investment roi for the franchisee is somewhere around 60 65 it will allow us to expand our presence and enter deep into the cities
1738495 customer experience and pricing is the crux of this business therefore we provide stock management professional training for the in store sales team and an after sales customer support at all our franchised stores the role of the franchisee is restricted to the operational level
1738496 we are concentrating on a co co model based on pricing we dont think franchise model is the way to go since the business already accounts for low margins expanding through franchise would dent the margins further
1738497 there is the risk of our brand value being diluted this is a business where you cannot allow your service proposition to get diluted
1738498 its a win win situation since it allows rapid expansion and presence in local areas for the franchiser and an opportunity for the traditional retailer to enter the newfound trend of organised retail moreover the operational costs in case of franchise model is low in comparison to co co model giving both the parties a better roi

1738597 edgar k browning professor of economics at texas a amp m university has a new book aptly titled stealing from each other its subtitle how the welfare state robs americans of money and spirit goes to the heart of what the book is about the rise of equalitarian ideology has driven americans to steal from one another browning explains that certain kinds of equality have been a cherished value in america equality under the law and within reason equality of opportunity is consistent with a free society equality of results is an anathema to a free society and within it lie the seeds of tyranny browning entertains a discussion about when inequalities are just or unjust for example college graduates earn income higher than high school dropouts some people prefer to work many hours and earn more than others who prefer to work fewer students who spend 25 or more hours a week on classroom preparation earn higher grades than students who spend five hours most would agree that these inequalities are just there are other sources of inequalities that are unjust such as when incomes result from fraud corruption stealing exploitation oppression and the like such sources of inequality play an insignificant role in producing income inequality in america most economists agree that income is closely related to productivity
1738598 much of the justification for the welfare state is to reduce income inequality by making income transfers to the poor browning provides some statistics that might help us to evaluate the sincerity and truthfulness of this claim in 2005 total federal state and local government expenditures on 85 welfare programs were 620 billion thats larger than national defense 495 billion or public education 472 billion the 2005 official poverty count was 37 million persons that means welfare expenditures per poor person were 16 750 or 67 000 for a poor family of four those figures understate poverty expenditures because poor people are recipients of non welfare programs such as social security medicare private charity and uncompensated medical care the question that naturally arises is if were spending enough to lift everyone out of poverty why is there still poverty the obvious answer is poor people are not receiving all the money being spent in their name non poor people are getting the bulk of it brownings concluding chapter tells us what the welfare state costs us he acknowledges the non economic costs such as infringements on liberty and strains on the political process but focuses on the quantitative economic costs the disincentive effects of social security have reduced the gdp by 10 percent the federal income tax as opposed to a proportional tax by 9 percent and past deficits by 3 5 percent for a total of 22 5 percent he guesses that welfare programs have reduced gdp by 2 5 percent the overall effect of redistributionist policies has created incentives that have reduced gdp by a total of 25 percent without those our gdp would be close to 18 trillion instead of 14 trillion

1738662 qualsiasi verdetto elaborato da un sistema cos sbagliato rappresenta un tradimento dei valori americani le norme che regolano le commissioni militari di guantanamo sono talmente sbagliate da non poter servire il fine della giustizia dallinizio alla fine questa vicenda ha rappresentato una sconfitta colossale per la giustizia americana

1738664 if our era could have its own coat of arms it would be a yak against a background of mush this must be the golden age of endless and pointless talk every sports events seems to be preceded by all kinds of talk whether by athletes repeating cliches that we have heard a thousand times announcers making pseudo profound sociological observations or fans rambling on incoherently then after the contest come the childish celebrations the second guessing and still more cliches even when the action is going on at grand slam tennis matches there are interviews with celebrities who happen to be in the stands while the play on the court is ignored by both even though it is shown on the screen theatrical hype on the part of both the interviewer and the celebrity are common does it ever occur to media chatterboxes that people watch tennis because they want to see tennis not hear about some celebritys latest movie or tv series if those who lived during world war ii were the greatest generation this must be the gratingest generation its not just the constant meaningless chatter that grates there is the incessant self dramatization
1738665 like so much that went wrong in american society the new style of loutish self dramatization began in the 1960s when muhammad ali became heavyweight champion in 1964 it marked the end of the era when boxers simply did their job collected their money and went home usually after a few brief words over the years football players began carrying on with elaborate celebrations after every touchdown baseball teams developed pre game rituals and post game celebrations while this trend of self dramatization is most visible in sports it extends well beyond athletes parents give their children off the wall names mary has long since lost its place as the perennially most popular name for girls there is a high turnover in what names are hot and which ones are not apparently everybody has to try to outdo everybody else even when it comes to naming children here as in sports superficial attention getters have replaced achievements that speak for themselves indeed the whole notion of achievement is downplayed if not swept under the rug people who have achieved success are often referred to as privileged especially by the intelligentsia achievements used to be a source of inspiration for others but have been turned into a source of grievance for those without comparable achievements

1738697 following our arrival on tuesday we offer our sincere apologies to bocog beijings olympic organizing committee the city of beijing and the people of china if our actions were in any way offensive that was not our intent the wearing of protective masks upon our arrival into beijing was strictly a precautionary measure we as athletes chose to take and was in no way meant to serve as an environmental or political statement we deeply regret the nature of our choices our decision was not intended to insult bocog or countless others who have put forth a tremendous amount of effort to improve the air quality in beijing u s olympic team and feel privileged to represent the united states abroad both on and off the field of play we look forward to putting this incident behind us while we prepare for our competition next week
1738698 since it wasnt late october it probably wasnt the best most opportune time for the athletes to wear those masks
1738699 they were a little bit over conscious when they went through the airport

1738704 israeli orders are instructing land confiscation and the demolition of houses
1738705 israeli forces are setting a dangerous precedent by removing palestinians from their homes and emptying jerusalem of their presence the abu eisha house in beit hanina was comprised of five floors all of which were fully licensed except the last floor however israel used still this as an excuse to demolish the whole house
1738706 the demolished building was previously occupied by 10 families who are now homeless
1738707 israels intention is to judaize jerusalem and establish an israeli settlement on the ruins of the palestinian houses in silwan
1738708 israel makes it very difficult for palestinians to acquire building permits and the process costs them enormous sums of money up to 30 000 usd settlement activity and the targeting of palestinian existence have increased significantly since annapolis especially since the beginning of this year
1738709 israel issued the order to evacuate the house in sheikh jarrah and has threatened 27 other houses in the neighborhood in order to join israeli settlements
1738710 sheikh jarrah is near to the hebrew university and french hill
1738711 the plan is to isolate jerusalem from the ancient town of beit hanina where the shikh jarrah neighborhood is located thus linking the settlement of maaleh adumin with jerusalem
1738712 this issue is still ongoing today and we have witnessed a significant escalation in israeli attempts to take over districts of jerusalem
1738713 there are currently 250 000 palestinians in east jerusalem in comparison to the 190 000 settlers that have made their homes there
1738714 there are no palestinians in west jerusalem where israel has full control the apartheid wall which israel began constructing in 2002 isolated approximately 120 000 palestinians from the city of jerusalem many palestinians have lost their identity their property and their land

1738726 the nature and extent of chemical contamination found at these sites in ghana is similar to that previously exposed by greenpeace for e waste open burning sites in china and india
1738727 unless companies eliminate all hazardous chemicals from their electronic products and take responsibility for the entire lifecycle of their products this poisonous dumping will continue
1738728 electronics companies must not allow their products to end up poisoning the poor around the world
1738729 i am willing to die for this and im certain you are as well this faith and devotion will be upheld forever hold your heads high be proud of our tradition and safeguard jerusalem

1738743 three years ago for x rays and mris we were printing film and putting that in a library
1738744 radiology images were our initial foray we have since followed that up with all of our cardiology ultrasounds and ekgs
1738745 all of the images from our medical records are also on there
1738746 when its space within the hospital we want to reclaim as much of that as we can
1738747 with the growth that we have experienced we would have overflowed the dvd and optical libraries
1738748 before in the best case scenario youre talking about a 20 to 30 minute process to get a file to a radiologist
1738749 now we take the x ray and its mounted straight into the pacs so we have cut a 20 to 30 minute process down to three to five minutes
1738750 it can cost about 7 per film for printing x rays and mris the cost just goes through the roof
1738751 part of it was the relationship that we had with hp but the mas also has multiple options for input whereas the centera had one option we had to write to an api
1738752 when it was a film in someone elses department i never had to worry about it
1738753 it has become my responsibility now that its in the data center but the plus is that theres very little management required
1738754 because it has got that density we can start reclaiming data center space now
1738755 that goes to the whole power and green issue being able to do more in less space

1738768 buckingham palace has always maintained that members of the royal family have a right to privacy particularly in relation to their personal health
1738769 for this reason we have always refused to confirm or deny the persistent rumours that circulate about their health particularly during the quieter news months
1738770 but on this occasion because the damaging story is now being reported widely the duke of edinburgh has authorised us to confirm that the claim made by the evening standard that he has received a diagnosis of prostate cancer is untrue
1738771 the satellite integration is almost complete and we would be entering the thermovac in about a weeks time it takes about 45 50 days for the launch after thermovac after which we would declare the date
1738772 we do not have the flexibility of launching the mission on any date
1738773 the payloads have been integrated at the satellite centre in bangalore you can see the full spacecraft there
1738774 it is going with good speed soon the process will be completed
1738775 we are open our policy allows that but not many players are prepared to invest such a large sum in space
1738776 we should go for new things we should not be afraid to take bold steps if we think that they are in national interest

1738781 the contingency is an amount of money built into any construction project
1738782 its set aside in case there are any pitfalls or change orders for the middle school there were very few change orders so almost all of that money is intact
1738783 id like to recommend that you look at what possibilities there are for using that funding as we move through the completion of that project
1738784 until we get the building opened and live in it for a little bit were not going to make any hard or fast decisions
1738785 but if we know what direction we want to take we will be able to do that more quickly when the time comes
1738786 for the past two weeks weve used a crew from the department of corrections to move in the old furniture from the middle school and the new equipment coming in
1738787 right now our custodial staff is scrubbing sealing and waxing all the floors before any furniture can be placed
1738788 the last phase of the building is working on the office areas
1738789 the assistant principal and other administrators are already moved into middle schools front office
1738790 probably our only pitfall has been the thermostats for the heat and cooling pumps
1738791 we were supposed to get them on july 18th or 19th but hopefully well be getting them this week
1738792 in the nine months since we got preliminary approval the governor declared a statewide drought theres been a water state of emergency in nine counties in northern california and the agricultural industry in san diego has had 30 percent of its water cut
1738793 things are getting bad theres no silver bullet here but were also not going to conserve and recycle our way out of this water crisis
1738794 i think a lot of people if ive told them about it and theyve not seen it would quite like to see me do it collapse so they try to make me laugh
1738795 quite a few people have thought im still strange and is she making it up and if i collapse a lot of people have thought im just putting it on

1738799 it is a common cry from the idiot right that we liberals are really totalitarian communists in disguise just as it is a common cry from the idiot left that we liberals are really iron fist authoritarian conservatives who have discovered and put on velvet gloves in the forms of certain devious social mechanisms markets elections and i am thoroughly sick of both waves of garbage
1738800 those aspects of his thought that contemporary liberals find congenial often flowed from precisely the sort of premises that gopnik deplores as reactionary and medieval
1738801 of the nine buses were buying five will be replacement buses while four will be for growth
1738802 we have a 13 year replacement cycle which means that we only use a bus for 13 years before getting a new one
1738803 theyve begun to build the equipment to our specifications and theyre good about working with us
1738804 especially the replacement buses every time we buy a new piece of equipment to replace an old one were increasing the safety for our passengers
1738805 in the last 48 hours we got a 5 000 match donation from a man named rick ramsey
1738806 this means that he will match all donations from the community up to that amount
1738807 it costs 6 000 just as an entry fee to the competition
1738808 thatll get you all the basic materials you need to build the robot
1738809 if we have a lot of extra money we would probably spend it on new parts
1738810 thats why you have to buy a new robot kit every year
1738811 you have to program which controls you want to do what
1738812 and maybe even create some kind of mentoring program for the elementary and middle school teams but for right now were just focusing on funding
1738813 basically it exposes you to all aspects of news writing
1738814 we made several trips to the richmond times dispatch building and we got to see what goes on in the news room
1738815 you have to write a 300 word essay on why youre interested in journalism and how the program can help you pursue your goals

1738825 it was a good deal it needed some repairs but my band director mr kent gall got the repair shop to make them for free
1738826 last year we held a barbecue and we sold brunswick stew we also sold fifty fifty raffle tickets at the football games
1738827 the ones we use now are for concerts so they can be really uncomfortable to march with
1738828 the new ones are shaped differently and have a bigger sound
1738829 whenever we can develop another option in the continuum of residential services we support it
1738830 my mom and dad had always wanted to make our home more handicapped accessible but i realized it would be less expensive to build a house from the ground up than to install all that equipment
1738831 i know i wanted to stay with a christian organization
1738832 so i approached goochland powhatan community services to help me find an organization interested in building a facility on the property
1738833 they provide a variety of services basically whatever our residents need we work with the residents to become more independent as far as daily living skills such as cooking and cleaning and bathing and dressing but our primary focus is to integrate our residents into the community as fully participating citizens
1738834 so its not uncommon for our residents to be involved in an activity almost every day of the week it can be basketball bowling church groups whatever it is that they individually like
1738835 some people come in and they really do want to become more independent
1738836 they want to cook and clean and do things like that so they can eventually move out and live in their own apartment really its a quality of life issue our primary goal is to increase their quality of life however they define that and it can be very different
1738837 what well do is well have a house meeting and determine what people want to make for meals for that week
1738838 and well determine what their health needs are if they have diabetes or high cholesterol and from that well come up with a shopping list and residents will take turns going shopping with the staff
1738839 my dad was the music teacher at goochland and powhatan high schools and was the choral director for the schools for 25 years
1738840 when we first moved there there were only four other houses around us
1738841 but right now im just grateful that my sister will have a home to stay in that will be able to address her needs
1738842 i feel like im being pulled in so many directions
1738843 she was not a top shelf recruit in terms of visibility hebert said
1738844 she was kind of hidden away in a small club she was terrific just not a heavy ink kind of recruit
1738845 we spotted her in a tournament in northern california and i didnt see her until the winter of 1997
1738846 it was pretty clear right away she was a spectacular athlete she could really jump and hit the ball and that was about it i knew she could become something special i just didnt know whether anything like this could have been expected
1738847 first of all its just two people so youre responsible for 50 percent of the court she said
1738848 the beach crowd is a little more easy going and you hire your own coach so you have a lot more control over training and strategy
1738849 and you are really linked to your partner you spend a lot of time together
1738850 ive been so fortunate to pair with holly and ey branagh said
1738851 theyve both been great to learn from ey asked me to play with her at the end of our season it was a good opportunity
1738852 i dont like the whole breakup thing i dont like that at all i was new so i hadnt done much of that breaking up with the partner dumping or whatever you want to call it
1738853 it was very hard for me but at the end of the day i learned that its a business and you make a friendship and you commit a lot of time together but at the end of the day it is a business and this was the best decision for me
1738854 one of the reasons i wanted to play with nicole is shes really athletic really physical moves really well i thought playing alongside someone who attacks and hits the way i do would be a great advantage
1738855 we had a good year so were fortunate enough to be able to call this a job branagh said
1738856 were not making millions like nba players but were doing what we love and focusing on growing beach volleyball
1738857 home sand advantage and the preeminent u s team of kerri walsh and misty may treanor
1738858 the olympics have always been a dream of mine branagh said
1738859 the olympics are probably the single most important sporting event in the world johnson said this summer at an olympic media summit in chicago
1738860 ive played in europe ive played in japan and a lot of places outside this continent and the one thing that brings people together is watching a sport watching guys from different countries compete
1738861 its very crucial for us to make a good showing over there
1738862 hes a great manager and a great guy said twins manager ron gardenhire who played for johnson when he managed the mets
1738863 he ruined my career though he put me on the field he exposed me he believed in me which was a mistake
1738864 but really he really knew how to run a team and he was a lot of fun to play for
1738865 thats something you aspire to and it makes you want to win even more
1738866 i know a lot about my players before they get to me johnson said with his usual confident smirk
1738867 sometimes theyll surprise me but well bond pretty quick and its fun to see them grow as we go along
1738868 back in 04 the olympic teams performance in athens left a great deal to be desired
1738869 i had no idea at that moment that i would be asked if i would consider taking over the program but i did have a prerequisite full autonomy
1738870 i was aware of how things were structured in the past and i felt we needed to change the culture
1738871 with this program weve asked them to be committed to playing for their country and not just to play
1738872 these guys have done that over the last two years weve seen this program develop to where whether it be lebron james kobe bryant or jason kidd they feel like theyre part of a team part of a movement and theyre very proud to represent the united states
1738873 i think in some respects over the years weve been pretty arrogant saying its our game its not our game its the worlds game and the respect weve shown to international basketball over the last two years will pay dividends
1738874 when were with our teams we complain i wish i had chris paul in the backcourt or i wish i had dwight howard
1738875 i want this guy i want that guy because we all want to win
1738876 well everyone is in the room everyone is here theres no excuses now we have to get the job done
1738877 obviously the most talented team without a question in the world
1738878 ive learned a lot about these individuals getting to talk with them and look them in the eye
1738879 as far as garnett is concerned we never got any positive feedback
1738880 it was more about ive been there ive done that its time for someone else to do it
1738881 i think we have a unique opportunity right now in representing our country and not just by going for the gold medal in beijing
1738882 we can set a standard for how the game should be played right now in our own country with teamwork with camaraderie with enthusiasm with an attention to detail that makes basketball such a great team game
1738883 this team is showing all of that hopefully well show it at an even higher level and that will serve as an example for the kids growing up where basketball wont be all about a sound bite or a highlight dunk
1738884 state pension costs as a percentage of gross domestic product are edging steadily upward in france for example they will reach 14 8 percent in 2050 from 13 3 percent today according to the european commission that would put french pension costs on the high end of the european average it would also be more than three times the portion of the united states economy devoted to federal retirement programs
1738885 youve got to acknowledge that the current setup isnt working very well for most americans

1738896 congressman davis believes that while some alabama voters both black and white would cast their votes based on race the overwhelming majority of voters are more open minded as he travels around the state he is increasingly convinced that alabamians are prepared to make a fair minded judgment on the governors race in 2010
1738897 congressman davis has demonstrated in his 6 years in the house that he can successfully work with his republican colleagues and even our states republican governor on a range of issues including support for domestic oil drilling and support for stronger enforcement of our immigration laws he has built a reputation in alabama as a thoughtful leader who puts our state ahead of party or ideology
1738898 we are not surprised that polling shows that congressman davis has a much better chance of winning alabama than our partys presidential candidate alabama voters have a history of voting for moderate to conservative democrats from bud cramer to james fields to sue bell cobb whom they get to see and touch in their own communities

1738989 what is so special about jesus that i should expend the time and energy to study hebrews
1738990 for example in the books first four verses which one commentator ceslas spicq has called the most perfect greek sentence in the new testament the author of hebrews uses periodic style a crafted configuration of clauses and phrases that concludes with a majestic ending effectiveness compactness contrast poetic structure omissions figures repetition alliteration and rhythm all features extolled in the rhetorical handbooks of the day his use of the greek language ranks at the top of new testament authors his rich vocabulary reveals the background of one widely read
1738991 because hebrews begins like a sermon without any mention of sender addressees or words of greeting the author opens with a majestic overture rhetorically eloquent and theologically packed
1738992 in these last days he has spoken to us by his son
1738993 so god has spoken through the son why should i listen to him
1738994 nevertheless you will be thrust down to sheol to the recesses of the pit
1738995 you are worthy our lord and god to receive glory and honor and power since you created all things and because of your will they existed and were created
1738996 i will grant the one who conquers permission to sit with me on my throne just as i too conquered and sat down with my father on his throne
1738997 you are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals because you were killed and at the cost of your own blood you have purchased for god persons from every tribe language people and nation 10 you have appointed them as a kingdom and priests to serve our god and they will reign on the earth
1738998 what the son was to possess he had been instrumental in making moffatt
1738999 the lord our god has shown us his great glory and we have heard him speak from the middle of the fire it is now clear to us that god can speak to human beings and they can keep on living 25 but now why should we die because this intense fire will consume us if we keep hearing the voice of the lord our god we will die 26 who is there from the entire human race who has heard the voice of the living god speaking from the middle of the fire as we have and has lived 27 you go near so that you can hear everything the lord our god is saying and then you can tell us whatever he says to you then we will pay attention and do it
1739000 i will make all my goodness pass before your face and i will proclaim the lord by name before you i will be gracious to whom i will be gracious i will show mercy to whom i will show mercy
1739001 you cannot see my face for no one can see me and live
1739002 here is a place by me you will station yourself on a rock 22 when my glory passes by i will put you in a cleft in the rock and will cover you with my hand while i pass by 23 then i will take away my hand and you will see my back but my face must not be seen
1739003 do not be afraid i am the first and the last 18 and the one who lives i was dead but look now i am alive forever and ever and i hold the keys of death and of hades 19 therefore write what you saw what is and what will be after these things revelation 1 12 19
1739004 have i been with you for so long and you have not known me philip the person who has seen me has seen the father how can you say show us the father
1739005 put your finger here and examine my hands extend your hand and put it into my side do not continue in your unbelief but believe
1739006 just as the glory is really in the effulgence so the being gk hypostasis of god is really in christ who is its impress its exact representation and embodiment
1739007 what god essentially is is made manifest in christ to see christ is to see what the father is like
1739008 but in those days after that suffering the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light 25 the stars will be falling from heaven and the powers in the heavens will be shaken mark 13 24 25 in reading hannahs prayer this past week i noted that she associated gods power as creator with his power as protector and provider he raises the poor from the ash heap to seat them with princes and to bestow on them an honored position the foundations of the earth belong to the lord 9 he watches over his holy ones but the wicked are made speechless in the darkness for it is not by ones own strength that one prevails 1 samuel 2 8 9 he who created the universe sustains it and it is he who also created me physically and spiritually surely i can trust him to sustain me just as he does his cosmic creation the first major event after creation is the fall of mankind sin enters the world along with its deadly consequences the old testament law and the sacrificial system did not solve the sin problem it merely served to put off the consequences until a permanent solution arrived 38 with respect to jesus from nazareth that god anointed him with the holy spirit and with power he went around doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil because god was with him 39 we are witnesses of all the things he did both in judea and in jerusalem they killed him by hanging him on a tree 40 but god raised him up on the third day and caused him to be seen 41 not by all the people but by us the witnesses god had already chosen who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead 42 he commanded us to preach to the people and to warn them that he is the one appointed by god as judge of the living and the dead 43 about him all the prophets testify that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name
1739009 i see the heavens opened and the son of man standing at the right hand of god
1739010 thus he became so far better than the angels as he has inherited a name superior to theirs
1739011 i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me 7 if you have known me you will know my father too and from now on you do know him and have seen him
1739012 lord show us the father and we will be content
1739013 have i been with you for so long and you have not known me philip the person who has seen me has seen the father how can you say show us the father 10 do you not believe that i am in the father and the father is in me the words that i say to you i do not speak on my own initiative but the father residing in me performs his miraculous deeds 11 believe me that i am in the father and the father is in me but if you do not believe me believe because of the miraculous deeds themselves 12 i tell you the solemn truth the person who believes in me will perform the miraculous deeds that i am doing and will perform greater deeds than these because i am going to the father 13 and i will do whatever you ask in my name so that the father may be glorified in the son
1739014 if we claim to serve jesus christ as the unique son of god do our lives demonstrate it
1739015 in these last days is a literal rendering of the hebrew phrase which is used in the old testament to denote the epoch when the words of the prophets will be fulfilled and its use here means that the appearance of christ once for all at the consummation of the ages 9 26 has inaugurated that time of fulfillment
1739016 christ is gods greatest prophet with a distinctive message for these last days his coming inaugurated a new era in him the last days have certainly begun the phrase conveys the superiority of the message and the urgency of the times

1739063 no est incluido en el calendario coordinado de partidos internacionales y no hay una decisi n espec fica del comit ejecutivo de la fifa que establezca la obligaci n de los clubes de liberar a los jugadores menores de 23 a os para este torneo
1739064 se hizo mayormente sin diego y est tan avanzada que no tiene mucho sentido traerlo a esta altura
1739065 nos complace que el tas haya confirmado nuestra interpretaci n legal
1739066 aqu no hay vencedores porque se cre una situaci n imposible como resultado de la demora en resolver el asunto cinco minutos antes del inicio del torneo tenemos que decidir si traer de vuelta a un jugador o no
1739067 nuestra decisi n hubiera sido muy distinta si la posici n legal hubiera sido aclarada antes en ese caso
1739068 no hubi ramos permitido que rafinha viajase bajo ninguna circunstancia
1739069 la fifa est sorprendida y decepcionada por la decisi n pero la respetamos
1739070 no obstante les pido a los clubes dejen que sus jugadores participen en los juegos ol mpicos
1739071 ser a un acto solidario que armonizar a perfectamente con el esp ritu ol mpico ser a maravilloso tanto para los jugadores como para los aficionados y el propio deporte
1739072 las relaciones entre la fifa y los clubes no est n tan bien como deber an y parece que hubo una falta de clarificaci n por ambas partes ahora vamos a trabajar con la fifa para que las reglas ayuden a los atletas en un futuro a participar en los juegos ol mpicos
1739073 este es el momento de sentarse en la mesa y encontrar una soluci n razonable
1739074 no creo que sea en el inter s de nadie destruir el que podr a ser un torneo extraordinario este a o
1739075 la fifa y la confederaci n brasile a de f tbol estaban al tanto de la situaci n desde hace meses creo que demoraron deliberadamente su resoluci n para poner en una situaci n inc moda a los clubes
1739076 los jefes del ej rcito entraron al palacio presidencial llevaron al presidente y al primer ministro a un cuartel del estado mayor cortaron todas las comunicaciones y no permitieron a los funcionarios del palacio presidencial llegar a sus oficinas
1739077 en colombia no respetan a los dolos aqu se volvi un delito tener 40 a os hay muchos que me odian por ser frentero decir las cosas y defender al pa s por encima de cualquier cosa
1739078 me dolieron mucho los cinco goles pero m s que me hayan llamado
1739079 ill go ahead and let you in just come back at 5 and pay
1739080 this allegation is obviously wrong it could weaken the cbis case
1739081 another important fact which needs to be brought to the attention of the supreme court is that despite its order dated march 5 2008 staying all further proceedings in the ghazipur court the judge in gross violation of its order has proceeded to hear the bail applications of the accused
1739082 nos place que el tas tribunal confirm nuestra interpretaci n legal
1739083 por lo que llamarlo en este momento no tendr a sentido desde el punto de vista deportivo
1739084 la fifa y la cbf sab an de esta situaci n desde hace meses creo que el asunto se retras a prop sito hasta justo antes de la olimpiada para poner a los clubes en una posici n comprometedora
1739085 se hizo mayormente sin diego y est tan avanzada que no tiene mucho sentido traerlo a esta altura
1739086 los equipos est n en el derecho de pedir a sus jugadores que regresen a europa
1739087 no est incluido en el calendario coordinado de partidos internacionales y no hay una decisi n espec fica del comit ejecutivo de la fifa que establezca la obligaci n de los clubes de liberar a los jugadores menores de 23 a os para este torneo
1739088 los requisitos que justifican una obligaci n legal de los clubes para liberar a los jugadores sobre la base de la tradici n no se cumplen
1739089 lionel quiere quedarse con el plantel y yo lo tengo para la formaci n
1739090 a la buena voluntad y el buen juicio de la fifa y los clubes para que encuentren una soluci n razonable respecto a los jugadores que desean representar a su pa s en los juegos ol mpicos
1739091 la fifa est sorprendida y decepcionada por la decisi n pero la respetamos
1739092 no obstante les pido a los clubes dejen que sus jugadores participen en los juegos ol mpicos
1739093 ser a un acto solidario que armonizar a perfectamente con el esp ritu ol mpico ser a maravilloso tanto para los jugadores como para los aficionados y el propio deporte
1739094 las relaciones entre la fifa y los clubes no est n tan bien como deber an y parece que hubo una falta de clarificaci n por ambas partes ahora vamos a trabajar con la fifa para que las reglas ayuden a los atletas en un futuro a participar en los juegos ol mpicos
1739095 no afecta el status de eligibilidad de los jugadores que de manera correcta fueron inscritos por sus comit s ol mpicos nacionales y que siguen siendo elegibles para competir en los juegos
1739096 el sabe que tienen un compromiso que deben cumplir tarde o temprano
1739097 guty se gan el derecho en una pelea avalada por el cmb y en la que estuvo presente su presidente jos sulaim n eso compromete a larios
1739098 no quisiera decir que no va a pasar porque en el boxeo las cosas cambian de un momento a otro pero en este momento creo que deber a ser en canc n donde
1739099 no hemos recibido respuesta de la comunicaci n que enviamos a la gobernadora ivonne ortega pacheco y hasta ahora no hemos tenido la cortes a de tenerla con nosotros en alguna de sus funciones a las que el gobernador de quintana roo f lix gonz lez canto es asiduo asistente
1739100 por lo tanto como no ha habido esa respuesta y alg n contacto creo que es dif cil plantearle y explicarle la log stica promoci n publicidad proyecci n televisiva que entra a una funci n de ese tipo aunque esperamos que su jefe de deportes la pueda aconsejar
1739101 los gemelos est n en beijing y venimos dispuestos a cargar cada uno con una medalla
1739102 estamos muy felices de estar aqu de ni os so bamos con ir a una olimpiada y los dos lo logramos
1739103 yo ten a menos peso que mi hermano mcwilliams en esa poca pero se me hizo m s f cil ganar m s peso y mantenerlo
1739104 el boxeo es as nunca se sabe los resultados pasados s lo sirven para especular
1739105 nos fogueamos con equipos que van a participar en beijing y ganamos
1739106 gemelos y carlos negr n en la divisi n de los 81 kilos en primer lugar creo que este grupo puede hacer historia
1739107 venimos con humildad sabiendo lo dif cil que es repetir estos xitos
1739108 el a o para el deporte espa ol ha sido fant stico venimos con humildad sabiendo lo dif cil que es conseguir lo que hemos hecho ser dif cil repetir una temporada como esta a veces cuando ocurre esto nos acostumbramos demasiado a las victorias y dejamos de valorarlas nos olvidamos de lo complicado que ha sido
1739109 para m el n mero uno es un triunfo bonito pero no tengo tiempo de disfrutarlo porque estoy en los juegos y esta es una experiencia nica y ahora s lo pienso en intentar hacerlo lo mejor posible
1739110 es una experiencia inolvidable estar aqu estar en la villa ol mpica con deportistas a los que ves por la televisi n es una experiencia maravillosa
1739111 el calendario de este a o es terror fico no he tenido tiempo de descanso s lo una semana despu s de wimbledon es un a o duro y dif cil y espero que los d as de entrenamiento sean suficientes para afrontar la competici n tengo que asimilar un cambio horario de doce horas pero los ltimos esfuerzos de la temporada son aqu y en estados unidos porque despu s la temporada vuelve a europa
1739112 nadie piensa en los puntos que hay en juego para el circuito sino en representar a un pa s y conseguir una medalla para tu pa s
1739113 la parte israel liberar a presos palestinos hacia finales de agosto como gesto de buena voluntad
1739114 enfrentar al real madrid es un orgullo es una parte de las cosas buenas que dios le da a mi vida pero enfrentar a uno de los equipos grandes del mundo eso da miedo
1739115 cosech muy buenas amistades y a pesar de no haber jugado mucho y haber tenido algunos problemas de racismo creo que fue una muy bonita experiencia en el club me trataron muy bien
1739116 hemos intentado mostrar todas las reivindicaciones conocidas los l mites acordados y algo que no ha aparecido en otros mapas que son las reas que podr an ser reclamadas por canad dinamarca y estados unidos
1739117 la mayor a de los mapas que he visto en los medios de comunicaci n eran muy simples
1739118 muchas tonter as sobre qui n puede reclamar soberan a sobre qu
1739119 supongo apunt el director de la ibru que para cualquier estado el control de los hidrocarburos es importante dado que otros recursos se agotan
1739120 otro aspecto importante es la fundici n del hielo polar que hace m s f cil la exploraci n de la zona y por eso la industria del petr leo y el gas est interesada
1739121 nunca pensamos que llegar an a pisar el estadio el camp n jugadores de la talla de ra l o de ruud van nistelrooy pero vea ma ana estar n aqu y podremos observarlos contra nuestro equipo es como un sue o
1739122 me toc de las m s baratas no hay para m s
1739123 desde que mi pap me llev al estadio a los ocho a os es decir hace 38 a os
1739124 esto no se ve todos los d as y ah est n los vecinos hinchas de millonarios el otro club de bogot muertos de la envida porque ellos se creen los hist ricos pero nosotros somos los que jugamos contra el madrid
1739125 son boletos costosos pero los grandes espect culos son as si usted va a ver a madonna pues sabe que la entrada est a la par con el espect culo
1739126 definitivamente el madrid como la selecci n brasil argentina o alemania es un sue o que no podemos perdernos y por eso estaremos alentando a nuestro santafecito en el estadio
1739127 enfrentar al real madrid es un orgullo es una parte de las cosas buenas que dios le da a mi vida pero enfrentar a uno de los equipos grandes del mundo eso da miedo
1739128 cosech muy buenas amistades y a pesar de no haber jugado mucho y haber tenido algunos problemas de racismo creo que fue una muy bonita experiencia en el club me trataron muy bien
1739129 antichrist is often portrayed as the leader of a world government who will probably emerge from the united nations or some other multilateral institution loathed by the right
1739130 the bible says that such a leader the antichrist will soon make his appearance on the scene it wont be barack obama but obamas world tour provided a foretaste of the reception he can expect to receive
1739131 a beast coming up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten diadems and upon his heads names of blasphemy

1739133 wenn ein lagerleiter dann bei uns anruft und die anderen flei ig k pfe kontrollieren kommt es schon mal vor dass aus ein oder zwei befallenen k pfen in einem drei igmin tigen gespr ch zwanzig k pfe werden

1739140 i must be given the reports of my dope test which says i flunked the test you declared me positive and you must prove it now
1739141 i cannot give it to any player i can give it to the federation and then they decide how and when to convey it to the player
1739142 you dont want to make india proud you want to bring it down

1739145 we have 44 stations across the country and at the moment over 90 percent of the stations would hold this our first target is to achieve 92 7 hours of continuous radio jockeying and then depending on the well being of the rjs the show will go on
1739146 the rjs depending on their need will take an hours break for food and and all that the highlight would be that his fans here are expected to come with food to the studio the central theme here is fight against drugs
1739147 estoy seguro que ser n los primeros juegos con tres atletas en 9 7 soy el plusmarquista estadounidense usain bolt tiene el r cord del mundo y asafa powell es el anterior plusmarquista creo que va a ser una de las carreras m s excitantes de la historia
1739148 por eso es por lo que le respeto al m ximo en este momento
1739149 podr a ser el favorito pero ha sido el tapado y eso le gusta ahora no tiene presi n en su pa s creen que bolt ganar el oro pero es un gran competidor y va a hacer grandes cosas
1739150 mi estado de nimo bastante es relajado fue un rev s sobre todo mentalmente pero al mismo tiempo pienso esto me ayud estando lejos de los medios de comunicaci n un tiempo ninguna entrevista durante tres o cuatro semanas realmente me ha mantenido relajado no he tenido la ansiedad sobre los juegos
1739151 creo que el partido del s bado va a ser similar al de hoy tanto suecia como canad son m s fuertes que nosotros as la estrategia m s importante es que mantengamos el control del partido desde el principio
1739152 lo hicimos lo mejor que pudimos yo no pienso que nuestro resultado negativo de esta tarde vaya a tener influencia en nuestro pr ximo partido
1739153 en lo que se refiere a la zona del cbd chaoyang business district las autoridades ten an un plan maestro para desarrollar el rea para corporaciones internacionales de primera fila con lo que pek n se parecer a a par s

1739155 nos han intentado comprar varias veces pero les hemos dicho que tenemos normas muy estrictas en la empresa y eso nos ha hecho ganar prestigio
1739156 los juegos han sido un catalizador para solventar el incre ble d ficit de infraestructuras y transporte que todav a padece pek n y que no se solucionar en 30 a os pero la demolici n de las comunidades dentro del segundo anillo ha sido un deterioro cancer geno de la ciudad antigua

1739161 estamos en contacto regular con las autoridades chinas y simplemente no nos hab amos planteado acudir
1739162 es un rival accesible no lo miramos en menos pero no es boca ni river ni san lorenzo ni independiente ni palmeiras ni sao paulo
1739163 son rivales de menor categor a y la cat lica tiene la obligaci n de seguir adelante
1739164 este es el d a m s emocionante de mi vida y es un gran orgullo para m que mis compa eros me hayan elegido la ceremonia inaugural es el mejor momento de la vida ol mpica y yo ahora voy a ser el embajador de mi pa s espero dar lo mejor de m para ser un digno representante
1739165 tomamos conocimiento de la decisi n del tribunal de arbitraje deportivo tas pero tenemos plena certeza de que los dirigentes del werder ser n comprensivos y dar n un parecer favorable a mi permanencia en los juegos ol mpicos
1739166 ser un partido dif cil pues tendremos enfrente a un equipo muy fuerte muy bien organizado y de mucha marca pero estamos confiados porque hemos tenido una excelente preparaci n
1739167 es triste para los deportistas ten an el sue o de participar en unos juegos ol mpicos y ahora su sue o no podr hacerse realidad
1739168 el objetivo general de espa a es lograr m s medallas que nunca a ver si podemos superar lo de barcelona y que el tenis contribuya a ello
1739169 nuestro objetivo es ser competitivos y dar lo mejor en el tenis hay veces que se dan los resultados y ganas torneos y medallas pero otras veces acabas con derrota si damos lo mejor ya ser un triunfo
1739170 es importante para el tenis espa ol y para nosotros poder coincidir con el mejor jugador espa ol de la historia y que tenga s lo 22 a os
1739171 es una motivaci n no tanto para estar a su altura que es dif cil sino para hacerlo lo mejor posible
1739172 adem s de el mejor de la historia es una gran persona y un ejemplo
1739173 tiene la pega de que acapara toda la atenci n
1739174 el contrato de ortega es por once meses y quedamos de acuerdo en mantener en reserva los detalles econ micos
1739175 creo que la situaci n que l va a vivir en mendoza es distinta a la que vive en buenos aires aqu no hay tantas tentaciones y adem s vendr con su familia
1739176 ortega va a colocar al independiente rivadavia en una situaci n especial frente al f tbol no creo que esto complique la tarea del entrenador roberto trotta
1739177 trotta est contento de contar con semejante jugador vamos a ayudarlo a resolver el problema que tiene resuelto esto es una buena persona humilde y simple

1739179 the government on a whim put out these 26 laws smuggling in the night a group of measures that the venezuelan people clearly said no to
1739180 basically the state is defining what the venezuelan consumer should eat how much to eat and where to acquire the brand of their preference
1739181 es un rival dif cil de buen f sico y r pido
1739182 si ganamos el primer partido vamos a tener gran parte de la clasificaci n asegurada
1739183 estar en la villa con todos los dem s atletas mundiales que uno ve por televisi n no todo el mundo puede decir que ha estado con esos atletas
1739184 es bueno tener a rafa en el equipo y en la villa lo nico malo es que todo el mundo se la pasa tomando fotos todo el tiempo
1739185 es un triunfo bonito me siento muy feliz de ascender al n mero uno pero ahora no hay tiempo de disfrutarlo porque estoy pensando en los juegos ol mpicos
1739186 me siento bien no de maravilla porque he tenido un calendario terror fico ha sido un a o duro dif cil cuando piensas que s lo he tenido una semana libre luego de wimbledon
1739187 tengo unos cuantos d as para recuperarme antes del lunes y conf o en que voy a estar bien tambi n voy a tener que superar el jet lag porque este cambio de 12 horas no es nada f cil

1739192 fue inmensamente superior en la primera parte sobre un adversrio cicatero y temeroso que al final cedi ante la presi n local
1739193 vendaval con buen toque marca presi n y amor propio
1739194 desesper comenz a fallar y termin jugando en su rea defendi ndose y quemando tiempo
1739195 el torneo ol mpico no figura en el calendario oficial de la fifa y no hay una decisi n del comit ejecutivo de la fifa que establezca una obligaci n de poner a disposici n a jugadores menores de 23 a os para este campeonato
1739196 en consecuencia el schalke 04 el werder bremen y el fc barcelona no tienen obligaci n de liberar a los brasile os rafinha y diego y el argentino lionel messi
1739197 la fifa est sorprendida y decepcionada por la decisi n pero la respetamos no obstante pedimos a los clubes dejen que sus jugadores participen en los juegos ol mpicos ser a un acto solidario que armonizar a perfectamente con el esp ritu ol mpico
1739198 pero por ser el primer partido no est mal el resultado

1739207 est solucionado el problema los atletas tienen sus acreditaciones sus habitaciones y tienen asegurada su alimentaci n y el transporte
1739208 there are in this report unacceptable accusations brought against french political and military leaders
1739209 of course we cannot be surprised by the commissions conclusions given its title
1739210 the independent commission charged by the rwandan authorities of gathering proof showing the involvement of the french state in the genocide perpetrated in rwanda in 1994
1739211 in response to a request by abu mazen abbas the israeli side will be releasing palestinian prisoners towards the end of august as a sign of good faith and a confidence building measure towards the palestinians
1739212 from a political standpoint olmert is looking for an honourable way to get off the stage trying to create an atmosphere that shows he did all he could
1739213 talking about a palestinian state now is like selling illusions to the people
1739214 the totalitarian regime fell thanks in large part to him thanks to him the people understood that they themselves could oppose evil
1739215 this is a man i had always wanted to see
1739216 it is just too bad it was only after his death

1739221 pero por ser el primer partido no est mal el resultado
1739222 alemania domin el primer tiempo y jug mucho mejor que brasil en el segundo en cambio impusimos nuestro estilo y generamos m s oportunidades de anotar
1739223 un buen partido la defensa estuvo perfecta marcamos muy bien a marta
1739224 quiere quedarse con el plantel y yo lo tengo para la formaci n
1739225 nos transmiti el deseo de quedarse est muy tranquilo y pide que la gente del barsa entienda su situaci n
1739226 sabemos que todos queremos contar con messi en el equipo y sabemos bien lo que se juega el barcelona pero no creo que se enoje con la decisi n que pueda tomar el jugador no creo que pase a mayores
1739227 esa es una decisi n que toma el jugador de quedarse
1739228 en mi caso yo transmito el deseo de lionel y nuestro deseo de que l se quede
1739229 tenemos que meter la cabeza en el partido pero entendemos que es una situaci n dif cil para leo a nosotros nos toca solidarizarnos y darle todo el apoyo

1739235 it is our goal to develop a multi product barrier for women that will inhibit several steps in the process of hiv infection suppress the transmission of both wild type and resistant viruses and which will only need to be applied once per week or even once per month
1739236 we are highly honored that the nih has seen fit to fund this important microbicide development program and we look forward to working closely with our team of academic collaborators and the nih to successfully achieve our goals

1739241 california deserves more from its legislators than pursuing flawed legislation state employees are facing pay cuts californias services are being scaled back and anxiety is rising in sacramento to find funds rather than tackling real problems affecting californians they chose to waste time money and state resources it is shameful that legislators pursued personal agendas in spite of the facts
1739242 participatory budgeting engages people in taking decisions on the spending priorities for a defined public budget in their local area this means engaging residents and community groups to discuss spending priorities make spending proposals and vote on them as well giving local people a role in the scrutiny and monitoring of the process

1739250 some restraints on competition imposed through the bargaining process where the alleged anticompetitive conduct is anchored in the collective bargaining process concerns only the parties to the collective bargaining relationship and relates to wages hours and conditions of employment or other mandatory subjects of collective bargaining
1739251 it is a thin fiction to pretend that the mrp does not represent a combination between labor and non labor groups
1739252 case for the applicability of the nonstatutory exemption is strongest where the alleged restraint operates primarily in the labor market and has only tangential effects on the business market
1739253 other circuits have found that job targeting programs similar in structure and implementation to the program at issue here do fall within the bailiwick of the nonstatutory exemption

1739476 buckingham palace has always maintained that members of the royal family have a right to privacy particularly in relation to their personal health

1739499 before you learn how to fly learn how to crawl and walk first ok

1739506 have you ever noticed that you are not romantically attracted to five people at the same time sometimes you might be attracted to a couple of people for a very short time but the tussle in your heart doesnt last long and one person emerges as the one you are interested in
1739507 you do not have to be in love with anybody this notion that love is something that hits us is a lie
1739508 there are times in most romantic relationships when we will have to remind ourselves to stay in love with the person we have chosen feelings come and go sometimes we can feel head over heels about our spouse and other times everything seems dull but if we stay committed through the dull times the feelings of love return
1739509 in addition to the all important need for faith and forgiveness and personal holiness there are other needs that isaiah and jesus are passionately concerned about

1739514 i do not think there is a universal description of a woman who has it all
1739515 a woman who has it all has achieved her major goals and ambitions from the outside looking in the only way one can gauge whether another woman has it all is whether the woman looks content and happy genuinely happy with her life that is not looking like she has just settled with what she has though such women may be sobbing into their pillows all night long in public they look content they dont pull ridiculous stunts for attention purposes read britney spears they are doing what they love to do names despite her yo yo weight issues to me oprah winfrey has it all what holds women back the societys gross underestimation of the female potential capacity and ability
1739516 a woman who has it all is courageous able to fight it out in a male dominated field selfless and brave names ms esther passaris and myself what holds women back fear of the unknown everybody is able to be such a woman but understand that you do not succeed alone you need someone or some power backing you up for me it is my belief in god
1739517 a woman who has it all thinks is there one if you have chumms money you dont have a spouse if you have a spouse he is beating you up i would say she has to be financially independent be in emotionally benefiting relationships have a balanced family and be spiritually okay there is never perfection in anything names mama nyiva mwendwa and the md of skynet express ms jane babsa these are people who are rich enough in their heart have confidence in their achievements and they wish good for others what holds women back poor education fear and cultures that discourage women if you are not fearful you will work around issues even when culture discourages you
1739518 she has her life goals is on target about meeting them and is seeking balance most women look for satisfaction they should seek to balance things in their lives rather than seeking to satisfy everything when you try to have it all you end up frustrated she may not have accomplished everything but is on track getting there names cant think of any at the moment what holds women back situations outside of themselves most women have more hurdles to jump than men then within them there are fears they look down upon themselves women are also emotionally oriented rather than reason oriented this may not always work for them when we see a woman who has achieved we forget where they have come from we need to find out what they have been through to arrive there it takes a lot of perseverance if we persevere we can have it all our problem is that we want it now
1739519 i dont have it all it is all a balancing act a woman who has it all has to be fulfilled a at a personal level b at a global level at a personal level she has to be fulfilled mentally physically and spiritually her mind soul and body need to be fulfilled at a global level this is how she relates with her environment how people around her live she avoids negative karma and engages the positive i do not like staying around negative people they have walls of darkness about them envy jealousy there is goodness in helping other people succeed she needs to be financially independent and have a stable family names muthoni likimani she was able to achieve so much when the glass ceiling was not open for women and she is generous gina din she has personality and is gracious rahab karoki a friend she has worked so hard to get where she is now esther passaris what holds women back unequal status in society women are treated as second class citizens the culture and the legal framework discriminates against the woman
1739520 when a woman has it all she knows that when she dies today everything will be the same kenya is unsettled and poverty is at its highest rate we are a nation of consumers where there is stagnant infrastructure and little investment you cannot say you have it all and ignore your surroundings
1739521 no woman wants a man who treats her like trash she wants to feel precious like a valueless asset
1739522 a man who is not able to keep his word is not found attractive by a woman she knows she will get hurt
1739523 ladies also want a man who is courageous and protective she needs to know you can stand up for her
1739524 what you are saying is that you want a girl who will not nag you yeah
1739525 no we hate it when you nag but we also hate it when you talk too much a man wants to come home and find some peace not a chatter box
1739526 the typical scenario is a man comes home from work at night has used 6 850 words and with 150 left over just wants to relax and not talk and the woman welcomes the husband with about 7 856 words left over and thats where all the problems start she wants to talk when you want her to listen
1739527 never tell a woman that shes ugly stupid short or fat not even when youre joking
1739528 i always had too much faith in men but they always disappointed me i am yet to meet a man who makes me happy i am starting to think he does not exist
1739529 i realized men will never be exactly how i want them and neither will i be what they want it is about being patient with him and him with you

1739533 if you dont have anything to say then dont say anything
1739534 the average woman today feels as though her life is like a giant jigsaw puzzle there are lots of important pieces she is even convinced there is a beautiful picture but she is looking for the puzzle box lid because she is not sure where to start or what she is really aiming at
1739535 do you wonder if god is pleased with your life
1739536 because we all long for respect we can fall into the false trap of looking in the wrong place for our affirmation we cannot depend on our husband children friends parents or boss to give us the validation affirmation and reassurance we are looking for even if we are surrounded by positive and affirming people their words will help some but they will still not fill the void in our hearts
1739537 think up goofy shit and notice funny things that happened to you that you forgot to laugh at
1739538 the cover for the red album was kind of a happy accident
1739539 we had a whole nother set of photographs that we wanted to be the cover and nothing that we were looking at ever matched up to what we felt that album sounded like and represents for us our art director got that photo the official album cover which originally was a fun photo ok everybody go as your alter ego and well take a kooky picture he said he put the red background behind that and thats what felt like the strongest image that matched how we feel the album sounds

1739561 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1739562 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques breaching security systems and installing programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly sold to others or used themselves and in total they caused widespread losses by banks retailers and consumers
1739563 aim for six to seven bullet points points per slide and six to eight words per point

1739565 so in the old view you have hundreds of kids blowing off high school thinking theyre going to be one of the 10 kids who is going directly from high school to college now believe it or not not everyone is lebron james and not everyone is going to be able to play at that level so you have hundreds of kids who get disappointed and they blew off high school and theyre not going to graduate from high school theyre not prepared for college and once they dont get into the nba what are they going to do flip hamburgers at best
1739566 it took 13 years for one of these hs guys to be the principle force on an nba champion meanwhile duncan wins four titles and a team of low first round college guys detroit makes six straight conference finals thats no accident
1739567 if you let one person into your circle they can mess everything up they would tell me i had a good game im a good player and they want to start helping me out basketball wise
1739568 some observers compare a coach who purports to guard a players best interest with the fox guarding the henhouse
1739569 controversial figure in local basketball circles is quick to acknowledge that hes not affiliated with any rules
1739570 that his comments might be construed as an admission he had engaged in wrongdoing
1739571 hey look at me i follow the rules i dont jeopardize an athletes eligibility
1739572 overwhelmingly 95 of the time theres a third party involved if agents could get players in a fair representative way without paying money they would because everyone is a bottom line businessman but they cant
1739573 most of the time the runner tells a kid im just taking care of business so that we can do what we need to do
1739574 the unions investigation into whether bill duffy associates sports management engaged in wrongdoing during its recruitment of mayo should serve as the litmus test for whether the league is willing to get tough
1739575 jennings is not ready for the culture shock of playing overseas for the challenge of playing grown men as opposed to over matched high schoolers for the huge drop in the nba draft stock yet that might not be enough to deter him from skipping school and in the long run he might end up a lower rated nba prospect but a better player and more well rounded grounded person
1739576 why risk being the next o j mayo the usc one and done er done in by sloppy espn reporting a former opportunistic friend ex drug dealer and antiquated ncaa rules
1739577 college would be a bunch of nobodies tv interest would drop and the overall product would suffer
1739578 jennings is only doing it because hes desperate he wants to be a one and done player so he doesnt sit out a year some place he wants to go play im not even sure hell be that wanted in europe hes a thin little guard and european basketball is pretty good these days its not like hes going to go over there and be a star
1739579 before the rule took effect and we had some young men jump from high school to the pros we had a successful game and march madness pulled in millions of dollars after the rule weve had some success and march madness has pulled in millions of dollars either way for us is fine its up to the young man
1739580 any idea if this david bauman fellow was living in singapore or something from 1995 2005 a period during which college basketball missed out on kevin garnett kobe bryant and lebron james and still landed a 6 billion tv contract for its postseason tournament alone
1739581 i found every guy around him is a former coach or player and he runs a league of youth football and provides opportunities for young people
1739582 i defend his music and am much more a fan of the person
1739583 that shit was my natural calling and once i got involved with it it became fun it was like shootin layups for me i was makin em every time
1739584 representatives of an institutions athletics interests are prohibited from making telephonic communications with a prospective student athlete or the prospective relatives or legal guardians
1739585 but the whole time he talked to me he talked about my son he was just talking to me a little bit about john calipari and the program and then he was telling me about the fedex forum and how he goes to a lot of games and sits on the floor
1739586 elmore suggests that the nba should raise its age limit requirement to at least three years out of high school so that
1739587 practice more responsible paternalism and remove the pro option after high school
1739588 only worries about the thousands or tens of thousands of pretenders who without the riches of nba stardom or the promise of an education are left with few viable options
1739589 is neither a pioneer blazing a trail for other young men to follow nor a hero
1739590 simply another impressionable young man susceptible to the hawkers and hangers on who tell him what he wants to hear instead of what he needs to hear
1739591 its no secret that the top college football and basketball players often come from low income single parent inner city situations students from those environments often dont make it to college not because of their misguided hoop dreams but because of lack of opportunity and preparation even if the colleges wanted them to succeed academically most of them wouldnt be able to because the education system they were funneled through failed to prepare them to achieve academically at a top university this has nothing to do with chasing a hoop dream and everything to do with socio economic inequity
1739592 mark my words kevin love will be the best player in this draft

1739751 there was a period when i thought this isnt gonna work
1739752 there was no way to kind of enforce discipline because there was nothing we could ever do as parents that compared to what happened to them in the orphanage
1739753 their lack of ever having anything on their own caused them to just grab and steal anything they could from other children from the restaurant from the store
1739754 they come to new families with less of a sense of trust with more of a sense of fear and less confidence in themselves and so theyre more likely to be more angry more afraid and sadder
1739755 they may be grieving the loss of people who are familiar perhaps the loss of their town or perhaps the loss of a particular lifestyle

1739757 it was worth it because they are such a blessing

1739764 then it becomes a part of your lifestyle and thats what were trying to do were trying to change our lifestyle to not being sedentary but being active and making better choices
1739765 i wish wish there was some kind of a magic pill you could take but there isnt you just gotta struggle through it
1739766 its really important for parents and schools and kids to work together r to think about the optimal balance between homework and extra curricular activities and time with friends and then just time to hang out and veg
1739767 by the time i get home its like eight oclock or so
1739768 and i eat and do my homework and take a shower and talk to my parents about how the days gone and then i go to bed
1739769 almost by definition a schedule of free time sounds kind of paradoxical to all of us
1739770 but i do think planning for free time or for down time is very very important for children
1739771 with all these activities and schoolwork theres tremendous pressure to perform often to compete to excel
1739772 and that leisure time and free time doesnt have those demands

1739870 back wheels of the bus overcompensated and crashed into the house
1739871 oh no anna couldnt you have dawdled a bit you know how he gets with caffeine overload
1739872 and you know how he gets when i dawdle youve got maybe three minutes before he asks me to get cup number four
1739873 circle eat rest repeat with the occasional head bang into a window to keep us lawyers on our toes
1739874 thanks anna its been good knowing you i wonder if you might coax this little guy back to life
1739875 tandy how many times do i have to tell you youre a danger to plants
1739876 you taking them in isnt an act of kindness you leave the greenery to us old chicks
1739877 i just took in cup four i doubt hes taken a sip yet though hes slowing down
1739878 youre welcome honey take care of yourself and you call me if you need anything hear
1739879 and he says hes ready to sue this firm for inadequate representation unless i do something about it
1739880 ive assured harry that there must be some misunderstanding since youre one of the most capable attorneys this firm has seen in quite some time so please tandy explain to me how one of our biggest clients someone for whom you serve as lead counsel suddenly finds himself facing jail
1739881 well mr beasley i appreciate your belief in my professional abilities but it seems mr simons has some rather extreme positions regarding personal values that led me to determine he is in fact guilty of the crime for which he has been accused when i asked him directly he admitted as much to me
1739882 yes sir i advised him i could not put him on the stand since i would be suborning perjury but he refused to listen it was either let him lie to the court or remove myself from his case i chose the latter
1739883 stupid junkie probably lost his job because of some drug habit
1739884 bet he chooses to live like that easier than getting a job and working for his money like the rest of us
1739885 oh probably not harry youd be amazed what some of the people living on the streets have been through
1739886 dont be na ve tandy that man could get a job flipping burgers at mcdonalds just as easy as sit out there with a cup in his hand begging me to part with my cold hard cash that i worked very hard to get
1739887 harry how would he get a job i doubt he owns any clothing other than whats on his back what would he wear to a job interview where would he get enough sleep in one sitting to be awake for an entire shift what address would he even put on his job application
1739888 why tandy i didnt know you cared so much about our fair citys homeless degenerates
1739889 id think with such convictions you would have a hard time taking my case
1739890 why is that harry you didnt embezzle from hope house which means you didnt take money from the mouths of homeless people which means my awareness of the plight of the homeless works in your favor
1739891 i certainly hope not because if youre confessing to taking money from a homeless shelter i cant put you on the stand id be suborning perjury
1739892 im in a predicament tandy harry simons brings a lot of money to this firm been with us for years that must count for something yet i find myself struggling with the thought of firing you since i understand the ethical dilemma you faced
1739893 and yet i see no course of action but to terminate your employment with meyers briggs and stratton anything less would cause serious repercussions in our relationship with harry simons
1739894 youve got to call somebody about these hawks anna theyre ruining my concentration
1739895 right right well i dont think we have to be that drastic how about a leave of absence
1739896 yes i think that will mollify our good friend harry
1739897 ill let him know youve taken some time to think through your behavior and will come back to the firm when youve gotten some perspective say two months
1739898 its the least we can do youve been a good employee i just wish this mess hadnt occurred
1739899 good luck tandy well see you back here in two months
1739900 well not me ive got eight weeks of a sudden vacation
1739901 ill tell you all about it when i get there
1739902 youre coming home to stars hill yes when will you be here wait what happened did you get fired did something happen at work
1739903 seriously ill tell you when i get there call kendra and joy breakfast at joys 9 a m
1739904 youve got it sister james get down off that table
1739905 go keep your kids from tearing down the house ive got to get home get all my scrapping stuff packed call the rental company to let some crazy tourist in my place for a couple of weeks and get on the highway
1739906 sheesh sis are you ever going to stop with the songs
1739907 james put your sister down i am not kidding with you mister
1739908 ms patterson you of all people should not be abusing time restrictions a one hour lunch is a one hour lunch not an hour and 25 minutes
1739909 you knew we needed to get started on the yomahama account first thing after lunch
1739910 obviously you dont care about this account as much as you say you do
1739911 im sorry i thought i could make it home and back again but with the snow and the traffic and the way im
1739912 i tried to kick something all weekend i guess im just not feeling up to par
1739913 mr lynch mr yomahama is on the line shall i put him through to miss pattersons office or your own
1739914 ill take it in my office doris give me a minute to get there
1739915 im giving you two weeks to change your attitude im tired of the mind games the flirting with clients and the way you insist on making proposals before discussing them with me weissler and schuler should present a united front to all our clients not a sense of division and indecisiveness you have two weeks to get on board assume your position as my assistant and change your i can top that attitude if you choose not to you will give me no alternative than to let you go
1739916 i know what youre going to say so ill save you the energy
1739917 youll have the files for the yomahama account on your desk by the end of the day and ill clean out my things you can do what you want with the furniture i dont want it
1739918 heres something for your headache a decongestant and a bi carbonate they should do the trick
1739919 i cant take pills they knock me out and make my head swim besides i still have too much work to do i dont have time to pass out
1739920 the way i see it youre already wasted youre no good to me like this take these and in an hour youll feel a lot better i guarantee it well work on the yomahama account then
1739921 i should have known you wouldnt let me die quietly
1739922 then ill have to assume the yomahama account isnt as important to you as i gave you credit for and ill get jerry to work on it with me instead
1739923 theres no way im going to let jerry take all my research and screw it up
1739924 okay then i guess youll have to do it my way
1739925 take these dim the lights and allow yourself some sleep dont worry about watching the clock ill come and get you in about an hour
1739926 ive got to get working we have the yomahama meeting tomorrow we cant waste any more time
1739927 you need to rest your body is obviously trying to fight something you have a fever
1739928 if you have a fever youre supposed to keep at least one foot and one shoulder exposed to cool air
1739929 you look miserable you need to go home this is ridiculous theres no way youre going to be able to get any work done under these conditions
1739930 id be fine if my head would just stop pounding and i wasnt so hot
1739931 let me call you a cab you need to go home
1739932 no i can beat this let me just rest a little bit longer if i could just get rid of this headache i know i could finish our proposal please give me another hour
1739933 mr lynch im concerned about miss patterson i know she was awfully sick this morning when she came in and she didnt look any better when she returned from lunch i havent seen her since you well since you spoke with her this afternoon
1739934 i gave her some medicine earlier today and it made her pretty sleepy thats why you havent seen her
1739935 will she be okay to drive herself home the road conditions have gotten pretty bad
1739936 dont worry doris ill make sure shes okay before she leaves
1739937 okay i was just concerned she really is a sweet girl she just comes off a bit harsh sometimes

1739984 pour rossi va voir sur le site mentionn cest expliqu
1739985 you remember dont you it was just five years ago
1739986 i remember the wizards coming and the pretty tents in the meadow
1739987 they were shouting because no one was listening twenty one wizards came for the castle raising each had their own idea about what we needed so they each constructed their fragment of the castle structure according to their whims
1739988 i dont think its funny the chunks of castle were erected juxtaposed with the others but not as a whole unit i thank wulder that at least my parents had some sense my mother and father connected the tads bits and smidgens together with steps and short halls when nothing else would work they formed gateways from one portion to another
1739989 as long as i have known you youve appeared to be the same age are you ever going to grow up
1739990 im growing up as fast as i can but i dont think im the one in charge if i were in charge i would be big enough to have my own dragon instead of searching for yours
1739991 gally and mince have been missing for a day and a half we must find them taylaminkadot said she heard an odd noise when she came down to the storeroom
1739992 gally and mince may be down here and they may be in trouble
1739993 you have hundreds of minor dragons in the castle and more big dragons in the fields
1739994 im a dragon keeper i know when any of my dragons have missed a meal or two
1739995 i think we should take a dozen guards with us
1739996 i dont think theres anything scary down here toopka after all as you reminded me this is our castle and we certainly havent invited anything nasty to live with us
1739997 it would be better if they were bigger and carried swords
1739998 with your love of learning im surprised youre not in the library with librettowit
