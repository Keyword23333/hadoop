860000 voters are clearly responding to my message of change and a new direction for upstate new york
860001 they are tired of the policies of the past that have hurt hard working men and women and caused this area to lose thousands of jobs we can do better we must do better in order to make our region a place where people can stay and raise their families
860002 its a lot of points its not a drop in the bucket
860003 what dan maffei neglects to mention in his ad is that he worked as a capitol hill staffer for the author of the very tax policies that crippled businesses in his own hometown
860004 i think it is safe to say that he is out of touch with the interests and values of the district he wants to represent
860005 there is an incredible mountain that we have to scale
860006 in all my years on campaigns i have never seen radio or tv spots come out right after the fourth
860007 its surprising but its a good sign that they are concerned
860008 he really hasnt experienced the struggle a lot of us have
860009 none of us believe that government can solve all of our problems but we all demand that government create a system in which we can solve our own
860010 a congress who over the past years have rubber stamped this presidents agenda to the point where america now almost 3 to 1 is saying its time to go in a new direction
860011 i believe careers in public service whether it be teaching nursing or serving in the military are vital to keeping our communities strong and helping move new york forward
860012 republican candidates continue to post impressive fundraising numbers in some of the most competitive races in the country
860013 the bridal party and all the guests being taken by horse drawn sleigh into the bush where three huge bonfires blazed waiting to warm them
860014 we know whats best for you and whats best for society
860015 your personal interests and talents tend toward orthopedics sorry right now the system needs podiatrists youll do your residency in the field we need where we need you
860016 ja ve vill hold him in jail for the rest of his life or until you forget about it vhichefer kommt first
860017 press 1 for mandarin press 2 for arabic press 3 for cantonese
860018 the selection of lockheed martin and thales alenia space is a major milestone for us
860019 this program reflects our commitment to the expansion of our amazing and very unique network and to making our services even more powerful and cost effective for our customers as we replace our technical marvel of a network with an even more powerful one
860020 we are extremely impressed with our finalists technical and creative design recommendations as well as with their ideas for important enhancements to our existing service offerings
860021 both are identifying ways of meeting our iridium next requirements using advanced technology concepts these concepts will help us realize cost effective ways of providing enhanced products services and capabilities for our current customers as well as for those new customers we plan to serve in the future and the finalists are showing us they know how to do it in an affordable way
860022 the way to continue our fight now to accomplish the goals for which we stand is to take our energy and our passion our strength and do all we can to help elect barack obama the next president of the united states
860023 i think we will see all of new york follow because the republicans under george w bush and it would continue with john mccain its been horrendous for new york particularly for upstate new york
860024 if they believed in hillary clinton as a candidate then once theyre over feeling hurt that senator clinton didnt make it to become the nominee i think she can rally them in support of senator obama
860025 senator obama has to show that hes very pro small business that hes very pro economic development that were going to see a lot of public private partnerships and cooperation with business and government
860026 almost 25 percent of what we pay today goes to someone other than the oil companies and we could lower those taxes and that would be short term relief
860027 on the other hand if oil companies are taxed more heavily they wont just say well suck that up and we wont pass that on to all of us at the gas pump
860028 my plan takes the power away from big oil by taxing their huge windfall profits and eliminating the unconscionable subsidies they receive
860029 it would reinvest the money into alternative and renewable fuels so we can end our dependence on foreign oil
860030 here in onondaga county we can say from experience that these schemes simply do not work
860031 congress should have done it years ago so that supply would be there for us today
860032 i dont think you can have a solution to the energy crisis without standing up to the oil companies
860033 what benefit have we gotten out of our ridiculous ethanol initiatives
860034 we are in the perfect position to be the leaders in getting ourselves off of the addiction of oil
860035 the most important thing about memorial day is that we do honor our fallen but also our living veterans one of the best ways we can do that is pass a full gi bill that would do that same kind of thing for our new veterans as we did for our world war ii and korea veterans
860036 last week my opponent announced his support for big oil and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge
860037 companies like exxon mobil are not interested in lowering gas prices as their actions clearly demonstrated yesterday its time to make a choice are you for big oil or are you on the side of consumers i choose the consumer
860038 the rockefeller family recognizes the need to move in a different direction why cant my opponent
860039 drilling in anwr would be great for companies like exxon mobil but would do nothing for you and me its time to give people real solutions including developing alternative and renewable fuels we as a region are uniquely positioned to capitalize on investments in these technologies
860040 this bad idea would do nothing to lower gas prices anytime in the foreseeable future and is a clear example of why our current energy policy has failed us so completely its time to break our dependence on foreign oil and on fossil fuels in general by investing in alternative and renewable fuels that hold so much promise and would help drive the future of our local economy
860041 i think walsh made the right decision we need to use all the tools that we can a comprehensive plan needs to be put together we know there is oil there i believe we can drill responsibly we can be environmentally safe we can lay out a plan to sensibly go about drilling in anwr and then add to that the alternative energy industry and other technologies to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
860042 it is an affront to the bill of rights in particular the 10th amendment to prohibit alaska from tapping into its own natural resources beyond the adverse effect to the alaskan economy this violation of the constitution has driven gasoline prices to unbearable levels causing economic strife to every american i think it is appalling that we allow cuba and china to drill in the florida straits meanwhile forbidding our own selves from seeking the common good in this case a way to lower the price of gasoline
860043 is he says do what the oil companies want and somehow thatll help consumers i dont believe we can do that any longer we cant be both with big oil and with consumers
860044 windfall profits of oil companies yeah and oil companies are making a lot of money on the other hand i dont think any of these folks behind me will disagree that if oil companies are taxed more heavily theyll just say ok
860045 it was one of the very rare times i missed a legislature session
860046 as far as i know i was ill or out of town for my regular job
860047 the war in iraq is a shame if i had been in congress at the time i probably wouldnt have voted to go to iraq
860048 this is one of the single most important issues facing the country and the voters of this district deserve to know where the candidates running for congress stand in clear unequivocal terms
860049 if somehow people think the way to force the withdrawal is to not fund supplies and equipment to the troops thats the wrong thing to do
860050 ill look to the military leaders for advice on whether the job in iraq is done whether weve accomplished all we can accomplish how do we withdraw when do we withdraw and what gets left behind
860051 the question is whether or not our leadership in washington in the political arena will listen to them
860052 for too long the federal government has short changed our schools districts forcing local property taxes to skyrocket
860053 its time congress stepped up and did the right thing to make our schools safe modern and efficient so our kids can get the education they need to succeed
860054 the only energy policy they have is to drill for more oil we need a whole new approach to energy in this country and the green schools initiative is a good start it will help our schools it will help us use energy more efficiently and it will save us money its a new way of dealing with an old problem and thats why i support it
860055 all my former colleagues in the local media must be wondering where did he go wrong
860056 how can someone say they support the troops and then vote against those troops when the come home
860057 its time for all the politicians who pay lip service to supporting our troops put their money where their mouth is we owe a debt to our nations veterans and we are currently in default that is why this legislation is needed now
860058 were pouring billions and billions of dollars into iraq every month the least we can do is allocate a tiny fraction of that money to make sure our returning veterans have access to college
860059 after world war ii we recognized the huge debt we owed to our veterans and provided them with a g i bill that allowed them to get a good education and good job it ensured our economic prosperity for decades and for us to do less for veterans today is shameful
860060 give me the children for twenty years and socialism will never be reversed
860061 no daddy believes global warming is a hoax and the polar bears are not going to all drown
860062 jimmy does your daddy smoke does he keep any bad guns in your home doesnt that worry you where are they hidden
860063 several years ago we made the decision to serve vietnam from our various offices in the asean region because of vietnams accelerated growth in manufacturing we have now decided to open an office in ho chi minh city to better serve our rapidly expanding customer and supplier base there
860064 building on our strength as being a leading international distributor in the region we will continue to explore the growing business opportunities in vietnam and leverage our global network world class technical expertise and extensive supply chain capabilities
860065 this is one of the single most important issues facing the country and the voters of this district deserve to know where the candidates running for congress stand in clear unequivocal terms
860066 i would have voted in favor of continuing to support our troops in iraq and give them what they need but i would have also voted for the other key parts of this bill to begin the withdrawal of our troops to force the iraqi government to shoulder more of the costs of this unending war and to give our returning troops the kind of educational benefits they deserve
860067 our veterans deserve whatever help we can give them as they return to civilian life
860068 there always seem to be some politicians who support our troops when theyre heading off to war but dont want to do anything to help them when they come home i think thats wrong
860069 how can you say this is the most important battle of our time and then not even bother to vote yes or no on funding the troops
860070 the republicans cant even figure out where they stand on the war anymore they need to have the courage of their convictions vote to fund the war or not fund the war but dont vote present thats a cop out
860071 we keep pouring billions of dollars into that country and at some point we have to turn the spigot off
860072 we need that money here at home its long past time the iraqi government stepped up and shouldered their fair share of the costs of this unending war
860073 america is at a tipping point and central new york is at a tipping point we in this room have been talking about and fighting for change for so many years well ladies and gentlemen change is here it is happening now it is inevitable
860074 i have not signed up 2 do britney spears music
860075 i believe the middle class are the engine of americas economy and when they prosper and have confidence in the future we succeed
860076 george bush and his allies still think the economy is doing fine and they are dead set against any change i recognize that our economy has changed and that even the basic rules for middle class prosperity and security have changed with it my plan is aimed at getting our economy moving and to restoring prosperity and confidence
860077 we felt that if we get in there early and were able to explain to our working men and women what the issues are what the candidates stand is on the issues that candidate has a better chance of getting the vote of union members in this district
860078 the working people of this community know that because of this endorsement they know that i am the candidate thats going to really create jobs and make sure that there are really good jobs in this area good jobs that will attract young people attract new business in the future thats the key and the earlier that message can be delivered the better
860079 if you see a fork in the road take it
860080 well why are you here you have a good education and a lot of opportunities to do something somewhere else
860081 i am honored to have the support of so many people who share a vision that brings new ideas for the people of upstate new york
860082 for too long central new york has suffered a slow and steady economic decline and our elected leaders have been unable to find solutions its time for this to change i was born and raised right here in central new york and i know firsthand the issues we face and the need to bring good paying jobs with benefits to our region
860083 at the end of the day this race is going to be about making sure central new york has a new economy regardless of how much money is raised
860084 i dont think its a game to say who can raise the most money
860085 in the end its a method of spending the money wisely and making a connection with voters weve seen races before where people have been outspent and somebody has surprised them
860086 being able to raise money is going to be very important i have experience raising money
860087 this government really is failing its veteran and has been for a number of years now and something needs to be done about it
860088 between 2005 and 2006 the number of veterans returning seeking primary care nearly doubled from 15 000 to 30 000 wait times are longer than 6 months some for soldiers with ptsd that is unacceptable
860089 i send numerous e mails and make numerous phone calls on a weekly basis just trying to manage my healthcare if you dont have the time or the measures to do that a lot of people just give up
860090 mandatory full funding of the veterans administration this is a legislative concept that takes the funding of the va out of the discretionary budget and makes it mandatory
860091 rep jim walshs retirement gives democrats a chance to continue to consolidate their death grip on the northeast in the fall
860092 it looks like syracuse mayor matt driscoll wont run a classical political hamlet and that decision should clear the democratic field for maffei
860093 theres an obligation on the environment agency to have to review these combined sewer overflows
860094 the problem is that the sewer system was designed for a climate which is different from the one we have got now
860095 because of the effects of climate change we are having a lot more rain
860096 the combined sewer overflows are starting to discharge a lot more often than they should their environmental impact is greatly increasing
860097 it amounts effectively to a licence to pollute because there are no restrictions on how much and how often these pipes can discharge
860098 what we want to see is these 3 500 pipes reviewed quickly so that if any of them are causing serious environmental problems it can be dealt with
860099 what we would like to see from the courts are greater fines handed out to water companies for pollution offences
860100 we have identified around 3 500 remaining temporary consents for cso discharges
860101 these are mainly for storm overflows that are operating without causing problems
860102 as youd expect our priority has always been to focus on those consents that are a problem
860103 we expect companies to be proactive in identifying intermittent discharges such as cso and emergency overflows from pumping stations that are at risk of becoming unsatisfactory
860104 i never thought i would stay in washington this long ever
860105 for the last four or five years ive wrestled with the idea of retirement
860106 a lot of people are disappointed and a lot of them are shocked
860107 its going to take awhile for someone else from this area to be able to do these types of things
860108 what will happen is that people will realize these are the golden days and theyre gone
860109 i suspect theres going to be a lot of interest on both sides
860110 i will be very generous to the republican party locally and nationally i will try to be very helpful to our candidate here and to the party
860111 i voted to go to war and not to go to war i voted to impeach a president i witnessed our capital under attack i will never forget as long as i live seeing the pentagon on fire outside my office window
860112 this is going to be a tremendous campaign this is going to be a campaign for change a new direction in central new york the fact that all of you are here today on a cold snowy day having left your televisions and the carrier dome just minutes before just honors me tremendously
860113 actually some other people have come down theyve talked to me i havent heard anything yet this has been in the last three weeks but like i said its an open process
860114 i have great respect for governor spitzer but i do not
860115 i think people saw maffei beating walsh in onondaga county and thought they could do it a lot of people are running where no one would try before
860116 i want to come up with a plan now because i want voters to know what i intend to do in washington and want to be ready to act on a plan the moment i get there
860117 for far too long congressman jim walsh has been playing politics with this failed war and our troops have suffered the consequences
860118 this forum will give central new yorkers a chance to discuss their feelings and to show jim walsh there is true opposition to this failed war
860119 scientists are usually a fairly reserved bunch but even they are starting to sound frantic about whats happening with the climate
860120 thats not surprising given that if we carry on treating the planet like a cheap boil in the bag dinner we risk causing catastrophic climate change thats probably a bad idea
860121 weve neglected our rivers across the state for so long theres only one or two rivers in the state that are actually receiving their environmental flows at the moment
860122 everywhere else the environmental flows have been suspended and thats not a good situation to be in given that we know climate change will bring further pressures on those rivers
860123 these jellyfish near shore are a message the sea is sending us saying look how badly you are treating me
860124 human caused stresses including global warming and overfishing are encouraging jellyfish surpluses in many tourist destinations and productive fisheries
860125 we need to take care of it for our tourism industry but the big problem is not on the beach its whats happening in the seas
860126 the prospect of going to prison is a daunting one but e ons proposed new coal fired power station poses such a threat to the climate that its something were willing to face
860127 never has this much sediment been released at once into such an active and hungry river
860128 marmot is certainly one of the best documented and most spectacular examples of dam removal in the sense that the river was allowed to process the material itself
860129 that is a very different river system h said the dam was built in 1913 to generate power but pge decided in 1999 that updating it to help declining fish runs would cost more than its energy value a question was whether pge should scoop out the sediment behind the dam or simply blow it up and let it go they blew it up just in case teams took wild fall chinook salmon from spawning areas to a hatchery where the fry were raised to be released into the river to keep the stock going the dam never blocked salmon passage a fish ladder allowed fish to get past the dam and some fish advocates were disappointed to see the dam go because it kept hatchery raised fish from mingling with wild salmon above the dam biologists could sort the fish as they entered the fish ladder allowing the wild fish upstream past the dam but keeping the hatchery fish out making the upper reaches effectively a sanctuary for wild fish but bill bakke executive director of the native fish society said the upside is that it lays more groundwork for a lot more dam removals which have value for our rivers

860135 if we can work to enhance the food sources and help people to do a better job in raising more crops they can improve their economic situation and they can improve their nutrition and have healthier families
860136 the mission societys chief goal is to win others to christ
860137 we have seen in some instances that some people will say yes to christ when they think theyre going to get something
860138 im working in some restricted countries that are some of the poorest nations on the face of the earth and food shortage is a very series issue we work to develop a system where 2 1 2 acres can completely feed two families and provide an income for them
860139 we currently have more requests for countries than we have both personnel and finances there are only two of us right now so were also looking for agriculture workers were looking for people to agriculture missions
860140 real passion but as a hobby when i was very young i wanted to play cricket for india i wasnt good enough though but i still play cricket occasionally and it remains fun
860141 we have a special campaign that we just launched its called the peace against violence campaign were airing spots on the air right now encouraging people to find peace through jesus christ and also challenging them to take steps to promote peace in their communities
860142 so plant the seed of peace water it and spread it its all from the lord of peace
860143 its about promoting the idea that if we have jesus in our lives we can have peace no matter what situations we may face
860144 jesus said in the world you will have trouble but take heart i have overcome the world thats one of the scriptures that were presenting through this peace amidst violence campaign were hoping it will challenge peoples thinking that theyll think about jesus about seeking him about having him in their lives about what they can do to build peace in their own communities
860145 one of the places where my heart really is is to work with the pastors and help prepare them
860146 knowing that if you work with a pastor youre indirectly reaching thousands of people through their ministry life so were pretty excited about that
860147 many of the pastors that we will be dealing with will be men with wives and children and they are working on a five or ten dollar per month income
860148 thats just absolutely so far below poverty level theyre barely surviving and theyre trying to do ministry on a full time basis
860149 and im looking for good study bibles im looking for commentaries other kinds of good resource material bible dictionaries etc and those kinds of things that will be a great resource for helping a pastor with messages etc
860150 i really have sort of robbed other programs our shelves are not as full as i would like them to be
860151 ive kind of created a bit of a vacuum by sucking them all up for this particular trip
860152 if we had an additional four or five people to help that would be tremendous
860153 it would be a great opportunity for somebody to be involved and they could have a really meaningful impact in ministry with us

860176 it is a disgrace that in new zealand men have no right at all to get a simple dna test to confirm whether they are the father or not
860177 presently if the mother says no to a dna test then the man and child are left in the dark as to whether they are in fact related
860178 the british situation is comparable to here and the numbers are simply staggering
860179 in one in five cases of disputed parentage the wrong father has been fingered but in new zealand they have no right to clear their name
860180 all this could be fixed if the government introduced dna testing

860223 the opening ceremonies are more of ritual and the closing ceremonies are more of a going away party for the athletes you will see more popular music that the athletes can relate to

860239 children who are abducted have experienced traumatic disruption and a loss of faith and sense of security in the adult world the world that is supposed to protect them
860240 the abduction of a child even by their own parent is a traumatic event because they are not expecting it the child feels that people who should be trusted cannot be trusted
860241 the child is definitely going to have trust issues and is going to remember the abduction for life
860242 they will certainly experience increased levels of anxiety and fearfulness in future they may also suffer sleeplessness
860243 if the child was expecting to visit the father and go home with the mother then fearfulness and mistrust of the father will occur

860246 the lincoln mkt concept offers the comfort of a luxury sedan the spaciousness and flexibility of a full size utility and the performance of a sporty roadster executed with new technologies and materials that make it as environmentally friendly as it is elegant
860247 the lincoln mkt concept is understated but powerful inside outside and under the hood
860248 we envisioned this concept as a modern grand tourer really a learjet of the road
860249 with the lincoln mkt concept you find a premium utility that could as easily accommodate a businessperson slipping into the back seat on the way to his or her next meeting in the chaos of manhattan as a family packed up for a weekend getaway to the coast
860250 i was sweating and shaking i couldnt catch my breath and i thought i was going to die
860251 when i got home i forced myself to drive again but in less than a mile i felt uneasy here i go again the next day i was at the library looking up phobia i read about panic attacks then searched the internet for a psychotherapist
860252 then one day i arrived for my appointment and my therapist was wearing her winter coat
860253 she told me we were going for a ride and i was the driver she wasnt afraid to drive with me
860254 one in 50 people arriving in the emergency room has chest pains due to a panic attack
860255 when i see a young adult with chest discomfort complaining of tingling in the fingertips an episode of hyperventilation and stating he had an upsetting event such as a heated conversation with a girlfriend
860256 but they can be managed people have panic attacks all the time theyll feel an uncomfortable level of anxiety and not pay any attention to it
860257 when that happens if the person starts avoiding places and situations that may trigger another attack agoraphobia
860258 if you shy away from a situation every time you feel anxious or panicky your brain learns to avoid rather than confront
860259 you have uncomfortable symptoms but youre not scared its annoying but you know its not dangerous or life threatening the goal is to understand and accept that a panic attack is not dangerous or life threatening
860260 the treatment of choice is cognitive behavioral therapy with or without medication
860261 expose yourself to anxiety producing situations and learn that while panic attacks can be alarming theyre typically short lived and harmless
860262 is part of a program designed to help our incoming freshmen students to transition into our building and the mhs culture
860263 also included is a chance to ask a panel of sophomore students about high school life and what to expect
860264 this increase in attendance indicates that both parents and students alike have found value and importance in how these events help prepare the students for a successful start at mhs

860267 i was in the crews mess waiting for the party to start
860268 what do you know you dont have to do shit you just use me like all the rest you dont care about me nobody does if i dropped down dead now no one would give a damn dont tell me to calm down they should know what the fuck to do by now i aint no teacher everyone just wants a piece of me sing this do that smile nina its all bullshit you know
860269 i was more than angry when i wrote goddam i was violent but im not violent all the time most of the time im the same as everyone but i know my people need me and i wont let them down

860273 weve located a site that is optimal for the development of a new stadium building at the old arena site would be extremely problematic
860274 this could cost us an additional year if not two years right now time is not our ally because the marlins lease at dolphin stadium expires in 2010 and the arena site does not present a viable alternative to us
860275 it is our view that the careful negotiations for the stadium were the product of literally years of work among baseball dade county and the city of miami
860276 we looked very hard at that arena site when we were looking at downtown sites more land would have to be acquired the general obligation bond of 50 million wouldnt be available so even if the costs were exactly the same wed be short 50 million
860277 theres difficulty there with utility buildings and power lines that would have to be relocated theres a railroad line cutting through there that would also have to be relocated and finally the community is committed to developing little havana and the orange bowl site and we want to be part of that development
860278 the marlins are an important part of the fabric of south florida
860279 if the marlins continue on the current pace they will draw approximately 1 5 million fans this year more than the combined attendance of the dolphins and the heat this past year moreover the teams television ratings consistently rank in the top 10 of all baseball markets
860280 how can one forget the over 500 000 fans that attended marlins home games during the playoffs and world series in 2003 an average of 65 000 fans per night i believe south florida loves the marlins and with the appropriate facility they will thrive over the long term
860281 foregoing another year or more of the new stadium revenues plus the losses in the old stadium are something that is very troublesome and something that is being carefully monitored
860282 the folks in spokane claiming to be liberian diplomats wrote to the university of illinois at urbana champaign threatening to sue me threatening to sue the university
860283 the university really freaked about this and we had a bit of a dust up
860284 with his help it became clear to us that it was a criminal enterprise
860285 we had this huge data pool out there which is this intricate criminal enterprise and he was able to make some sense out of it and connect the dots
860286 there are degrees in areas where you really dont want the practitioner to be incompetent because it would be dangerous
860287 we had to recuse ourselves because a deputy united states marshal obtained a degree and allegedly attempted to use it to get a promotion in this district and he was prosecuted for that in this district

860294 the estimated decline of the illegal population is at least seven times larger than the number of illegal aliens removed by the government in the last 10 months so most of the decline is due to illegal immigrants leaving the country on their own
860295 indicates that illegal immigrants respond to changing incentives and that many would return home on their own if they felt enforcement was a real possibility
860296 it is sometimes argued that illegal immigrants are so permanently attached to their lives in the united states that no amount of enforcement would ever make a large share of them return to their home countries the findings of this report contradict that
860297 washingtons wake up call last summer to beef up enforcement from plugged leaks in the border to cracking down on employers who hired illegal workers

860333 too bad boss wants me at work i need time off
860334 i was a very young player and got my first taste of the olympics in 2000 at sydney i played in athens in 2004 and now this is my home country and the highest special honor in 2008 enough i think why would i need to play in london in 2012
860335 for me he was a good buddy at the park and away from the park we always had a lot of great laughs he will be very sorely missed
860336 the braves family and braves fans everywhere will sadly miss him our thoughts are with his wife paula and his children
860337 hes had some medical issues but youre never ready for something like this
860338 were all very shocked by the timing its a very sad day for family and for braves fans i think the braves fans feel theyre part of skips family
860339 he had a huge impact on a lot of peoples lives and he had a huge impact on my life
860340 during the season we spent more time together than we did with our families and our lives
860341 i really didnt feel like it was a bad inning per se
860342 he didnt throw strikes but theyre hard to lay off and ive seen veterans do the same thing
860343 i think glaus did a good job with the fastball that was a mistake and then these guys did a good job of putting the bat on the ball
860344 with the bases loaded and those two guys coming up i felt confident i was going to get out of it
860345 you kind of have an idea of what he has by watching video and i was just trying to hit a ball i could drive
860346 it was a fastball thats what i think it was
860347 about the only pitch i had to go with was my cutter and i didnt really figure that out until i had already given up the runs
860348 ive pitched a lot of innings when ive been a little tired and it was just more of an execution thing
860349 i had tears running down my face when i heard about it
860350 i think this is what the majority of green bay wants
860351 it is also decided that if the government moves with the ipo proposal the entire bsnl workforce of three lakh will get into direct action including indefinite strike
860352 say i want to model a chess opponent in rest how do you do that in rest by modeling states
860353 ive not seen any good aiuthentication mechanisms for rest how do you use this in the real world enterprise where you have to authenticate and authorize
860354 but at the end of the day you are still sending requests back and forth as xml
860355 but if you use transition links in your state payloads its definitely harder to get wrong by accident
860356 my question and point is say i have an application with a function like int foo string int bool meaning a function that takes many arguments and returns some value how can you model that in rest
860357 2 how can someone discover rest web services since rest doesnt have anything like wsdl thats the beauty there is nothing to discover rest is about keeping the number of verbs to a minimum to achieve truly loose coupling here are the methods for http get post put delete head options trace connect data are represented as uris and you manipulate them using these methods
860358 taking my first snap i went to the line took a deep breath and thought to myself just have fun out here tonight
860359 more than his throws what i was pleased with is how he was looking to the right guy when he was backpedaling
860360 he knew the plays knew the routes he should feel very good about his performance
860361 i didnt know how long i was going to play but that first series was a long one
860362 coach said that was enough to get my work in i was happy to get to play with a lot of the more experienced players
860363 we did a lot of good things a lot of things to be pleased about
860364 theres always the mistakes and thats what weve got to work on
860365 for the first game i dont have anything to be disappointed about
860366 i was excited to have a big turnover for a touchdown at the end that shows the guys playing it all the way through

860409 we are extremely excited to be part of a project which encourages the growth and development of macaus tourism industry
860410 with world class hotels like the wynn macau here and brands like four seasons and shangri la on the way an expo like this has never been more important
860411 our partnership with macau com is an ideal one as we are both strong supporters of macau as a premiere destination for travel and business not only can we be assured that all participants of the hotel expo will be well taken care of but together we can confidently showcase macau as a vibrant city with top notch facilities and limitless potential
860412 wayne has been under doctors care at the clinic and is reported to be doing well the doctors say that when he gets a heart he would have to remain there for two and a half weeks then return to yuma to recuperate for two months
860413 everyone is keeping a positive outlook and want him to get a heart soon friends and groups in yuma are banding together to raise money for expenses wayne and his wife of 36 years sherry are facing
860414 sherry is a paralegal at the sheriffs office and has been staying in phoenix for the past month while wayne has been hospitalized
860415 that will be from the first ticket drawn at 5 p m sept 2 at the sheriffs office 160 s 3rd ave
860416 the second ticket will be a gift bag valued at 300 and the third prize is a 200 gift bag the winner does not need to be present to win
860417 laminacks trysts are both a well known and established part of the firms lore
860418 so many people were acting as paralegals without proper training insurance or a code of professional ethics
860419 at the time the firm engaged in the bonus policy it was not abundantly clear that it was an improper practice by any means
860420 otherwise unblemished careers and their exemplary service to the community
860421 its regrettable that so much of the past decade has been consumed with fighting these charges
860422 when you keep taking prices up so much consumers are more likely to switch out of the category
860423 in trash bags they can switch to a private label which has a fairly large size market share
860424 certainly faced some serious challenges in its fourth quarter what was surprising however was how well the top and bottom lines held up despite this
860425 theyre now able to ask questions like how do we enable new applications like broadband and mobile video
860426 were going to take the economy and scale and form factor that youre used to in a cellphone iphone blackberry and allow that to communicate to a satellite
860427 some insurers can make a decision in the same day or right on the spot
860428 as health care moves into the digital age there are more and more companies holding vast amounts of patients health information
860429 most people dont even know these organizations exist unfortunately the federal health privacy rule does not cover many of them the lack of transparency with how all of this works is disturbing
860430 there is a fundamental physics issue we can no longer get around
860431 if we kept going as we had been the heat density on a chip would have equaled the surface of the sun

860436 i really dont care this trip is about how many people i can help and how many lives i can touch
860437 i can tell you about every person i have hugged and who i have met
860438 im a man driven by passion but i am really not doing much
860439 im simply riding a bike going to a couple of places and working for a day
860440 she probably e mailed about 6 100 times and i answered each one back personally
860441 she always said that if i was near galveston i should come by
860442 after meeting me you cant go back and think everybody is a piece of expletive

860444 the eclipse had a convertible top was pretty much a two seater and got about 18 miles per gallon
860445 the prius is getting about 45 mpg and that allows us to go to dallas to visit relatives again affordably
860446 i have a beautiful cadillac sedan deville an 89 with 19 000 miles on it
860447 i chauffeured a friends niece to her prom in this white cadillac it cost me 44 11 just for gasoline

860449 i stayed the whole day and read a nice book in their coffee shop area
860450 my friend rick brought me lunch and i stayed until closing then i arrived saturday morning at 11 minutes after six
860451 i think the point of this article is that in 2009 analog broadcasts are going bye bye
860452 someone being told that since they are on cable they have nothing to worry about is wrong all the time the local cable provider could be planning a switched digital video system or just a 100 digital service or a digital service with analog of just the local channels
860453 any tv whether analog or digital will operate when connected to charters service without the need for a converter box charter will be downconverting the new digital broadcast signals back to analog so analog tvs can view them without the use of any converter box or digital receiver
860454 weve made a verbal promise to the senior citizens that they will always have a place to hold their lunches

860458 a lot of seniors donated their time to build this center
860459 every big town i know of has a community center

860686 todays worker is mobile and needs one solution to manage their voicemail email and calendar from any location at anytime
860687 the convenience of having emails read while on the move and using voice commands to call contacts and manage calendars makes it incredibly easy for users to communicate collaborate and share information
860688 hosted unified communications represents a fundamental shift in the way business people communicate

860690 unlike other accelerometer based performance meters dynolicious uses the advanced data handling and display capabilities of the iphone to make the most of your performance testing
860691 as far as the voip landscape goes we feel strongly and we believe that the future of voip is not going just be based on price and bundling price our experience has told us does not equate to loyal customers our customers are loyal if we help them communicate and if we offer them feature rich offerings that fit into their lifestyles our product strategy is that everything we do is customer centric and customer focus
860692 vonagepro currently has about 1000 beta testers our marketing team went out and did a study of the prosumer which is basically the professional consumer those are folks who are comfortable with technology they embrace technology they want to use technology to make their lives easier
860693 webex is an example of that right we can have conference calls where we do demos if you arent able to make it to the office to see the demo you can still function and work through webex thats an example of a prosumer somebody who is comfortable with technology theyre not afraid of it and they want to use it to help make their lives better vonagepro is a new product offering that includes some new components and some existing components it includes vonage digitalvoice which is their traditional home landline replacement 24 99 month unlimited local long distance service vonage access numbers simulring and more
860694 thats something that our customers have been asking for a very long time
860695 what sort of technical challenges did you have having the same callerid and the same phone number obviously you are leveraging sip and the ata that sits at the home residence logs on with one set of sip credentials and vonage companion logs on with different sip credentials but its mapped on your back end to the same phone number
860696 thats really a great question because we actually had to put almost a whole new infrastructure in place with a lot of new equipment and we actually have proxies that are just dedicated to companion to handle those calls we do differentiate between the home ta did credential and we do have flag for companion that way we know as you said on the back end its all mapped and then we know where the call originates we know if a call originates from companion versus originating from the ta
860697 that was a lot of work for our call processing team
860698 what were some of the challenges in developing vonage companion
860699 one of the challenges was making sure that all the back end scenarios work seamlessly for example if you logon from another location if you logon and the other instance is not on a call it would automatically logout the other instance but if the other instance is on a call we want to present the user with the option the other user is on a call are you sure you want to login at this time we want to be sure that we cover all the use scenarios properly
860700 vonage revolutionized the communications industry when we launched our digital phone service eight years ago
860701 today our customers lifestyles dictate more demanding communication needs and we are again driving the industry forward by providing customers with innovative communication solutions that are designed with their lifestyle in mind vonage pro provides consumers with services they dont just need but they really want
860702 in a competitive communications landscape voip services need to differentiate themselves on more than price
860703 advanced flexible features that allow consumers to communicate anywhere will continue to grab market share
860704 vonage pro is the voip offering that prosumers have been asking for to help them stay connected while on the go
860705 weve already received feedback from beta users that indicates vonage pro will be a success both in the quality of the phone service and the unique features it offers
860706 i thought you might like to learn the we did not go down but fought back t mobile germany not only bans voip im and vpn usage but also caps data on their iphone plans funny enough one could say that t mobile germany is blocking t mobile usa still we felt t mobile is misleading their customers as they hide this fact in their fine print and found supporters for this claim
860707 on our request the regional court of hamburg landgericht hamburg has issued a preliminary injunction against t mobile germany apples exclusive german partner
860708 while this might look like round 2 of sipgate vs t mobile the issue at hand here is much broader t mobile is spearheading a movement of networks to undermine the generally assumed principle of net neutrality such broad restrictions on the accessibility of internet services are frightening in particular since t mobile chose to specifically ban those services they are selling at a premium voice chat and vpn
860709 you made us drive two and a half hours out of our way for this
860710 we were ahead of schedule anyway besides i really wanted to come here i mean isnt it great
860711 yeah a bunch of rocks surrounded by trees in the pocono forest its what they call a national natural landmark
860712 wanna walk across it with me to the other side
860713 lets just get back in the car we dont want to be late with the shipment
860714 look growing up my parents brought me to the poconos every summer
860715 i always thought it was the coolest thing when i tried explaining it to my friends id say it was like a piece of mars here on the planet
860716 ive seen pictures of mars this looks nothing like mars
860717 but all these boulders all these rocks just sequestered to this one little piece of land up on this mountain surrounded by trees i mean where the fuck does that come from
860718 sign over there says it came from the ice age
860719 it was back when i was nineteen i brought this girl maryanne up here for some camping we brought booze and weed and got shitfaced and just well we had a good time
860720 anyway i was telling her about this place and she didnt believe me so we came up here we hopped from rock to rock the entire way across to those trees over there and then we came back and it was crowded just like it is now a bunch of tourists taking pictures and shit and this little kid had to have been like five or six was jumping from rock to rock his mom didnt want him to but his dad was letting him walking him sort of holding his hand you know and the mom kept yelling saying they should come back and the father kept laughing and encouraging the boy and the boy he just sort of slipped on one of the rocks and because his dad was holding onto his arm he fell at a weird angle and he came right now on the side of his head fuckin broke his neck
860721 what the fuck do you think i did absolutely nothing i just stood there watching the father grab for the boy but the boy had gone limp and there was all this blood and the mother was screaming and all these people were trying to hurry over to help but its difficult hopping from rock to rock especially if youre not being careful and a lot of them kept slipping themselves scraping their legs and stubbing their toes and i it just wasnt a good scene man so me and maryanne split
860722 because i could never get that family out of my head i mean that used to be my family my mom always yelling my dad always trying to piss her off and when i was kid and they brought me up here my dad would help me jump from rock to rock and i mean i sometimes think what if that had been me what if i would have slipped on that rock and broke my neck
860723 yeah but what about my parents what about that kids parents where are they now do you think
860724 how the fuck do i know look lets just get going
860725 i tried getting it back i did but i just i couldnt
860726 so i just you know i wanted to see this place just one more time
860727 you are one big fucking idiot why didnt you tell me before
860728 i appreciate it frank but nobody can help me now
860729 what that i dont have the money no he thinks im bringing it with me

860886 many of us whove experienced international twenty20 cricket and the ipl are convinced that cricket should bid to become an olympic sport in time for the 2020 olympic games wherever theyre held
860887 with twenty20 cricket here to stay now is the time for the 10 full member nations of the international cricket council to plan for the development of the sport over the next 100 years
860888 the challenge for all of us who love the game is to spread the word of cricket to parts of the globe that have never heard of it and currently dont play our sport
860889 i believe the olympic games is the vehicle the sport should use to aggressively sell the message of our sport to all 202 competing olympic nations
860890 take it from someone who has won almost everything cricket has to offer the olympics is the absolute pinnacle in sport

860901 kita lihat lah besok tapi tidak menutup kemungkinan kita lihat saja ya
860902 kita akan pantau terus setiap waktu tapi intinya kita lihat sekarang ini proses pembalikannya belum datang mestinya kan harus membalik pada bulan kedua setelah kenaikan bbm

860907 wherever you find something getting done you find a monomaniac with a mission
860908 a double minded man is unstable in all his ways
860909 what is the most valuable use of my time right now
860910 it doesnt matter which side of the fence you get off on sometimes what matters most is getting off you cannot make progress without making decisions
860911 give whatever you are doing and whoever you are with the gift of your attention
860912 formal education will make you a living self education will make you a fortune
860913 to solve any problem here are three questions to ask yourself first what could i do second what could i read and third who could i ask
860914 the major reason for setting a goal is for what it makes of you to accomplish it what it makes of you will always be the far greater value than what you get
860915 success is not to be pursued it is to be attracted by the person you become
860916 if it is to be it is up to me
860917 specifically these rules cover the following in no particular order
860918 the composite application guidance for wpf can help you split the development of your wpf client application across multiple development teams each responsible for the development of a piece of the application and help you seamlessly compose those pieces together into a client application the guidance includes a reference implementation reusable library code called the composite application library documentation quick start tutorials and hands on labs

860925 its very sorrow that certain ulfa leaders and the jailed leaders are pulling the peace process back its a very good time that 28th battalion of ulfa has came out among the people they are saying that they want peace
860926 public will support this type it is very good symptom it is to be continued
860927 he dejado mi familia a mis amigos y a mi tierra por este sue o y nos los voy a defraudar
860928 me empezaron a llamar de clubes de atletismo y as fue que me quede y surgi lo de nacionalizarme para competir por espa a
860929 a pesar de ser negro y ser ecuatoriano me respetan porque he demostrado que valgo
860930 this is a mere accident the explosion occurred in an abandoned shell there is no terrorist involvement i would tell the residents of this city not to panic unnecessarily
860931 in the evening some of them tried to break the shell with a hammer when the explosion occurred this is very sad
860932 many of us whove experienced international twenty20 cricket and the ipl are convinced that cricket should bid to become an olympic sport in time for the 2020 olympic games wherever theyre held
860933 with twenty20 cricket here to stay now is the time for the 10 full member nations of the international cricket council to plan for the development of the sport over the next 100 years
860934 the challenge for all of us who love the game is to spread the word of cricket to parts of the globe that have never heard of it and currently dont play our sport
860935 i believe the olympic games is the vehicle the sport should use to aggressively sell the message of our sport to all 202 competing olympic nations
860936 take it from someone who has won almost everything cricket has to offer the olympics is the absolute pinnacle in sport
860937 cricketers wont care about the money the chance to stand on top of the olympic podium to wear an olympic gold medal and the pride of belting out your national anthem would be a life changing money cant buy experience
860938 my continuing passion is to part a curtain that invisible veil of indifference that falls between us and that blinds us to each others presence each others wonder each others human plight
860939 au bout de tout savoir et de tout accroissement de notre savoir
860940 anyone can make a baby but not everyone can be a parent
860941 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
860942 thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
860943 the message that needs to be communicated to these people is your problem is not global warming
860944 your problem is not global warming your problem is your nuts
860945 theyre going to the gore movie an inconvenient truth and being fed all this its ridiculous
860946 well look back on all of this in 10 or 15 years and realise how foolish it was
860947 the human impact on the atmosphere is simply too small to have a major effect on global temperatures
860948 it bothers me that my fellow scientists are not speaking out against something they know is wrong
860949 but they also know that theyd never get any grants if they spoke out i dont care about grants
860950 this is the fastest temperature change in the instrumental record and it puts us back to where we were in 1930
860951 human rights activists everywhere to condemn this violation of mr juarezs civil rights child rape is one of the basic civil rights guaranteed by the un civil rights commission
860952 the united states our future colony refuses to recognize that child rape is an important part of our superior mexican culture
860953 mr juarez is missing work at the factory farm of one of my big campaign contributors so i have asked president bush to pardon him so he can get back to work where he belongs he will be whipped for missing work while he was fooling around with that girl
860954 because we say so since we duke professors are smarter than anyone we know
860955 mr juarez is doing the kind of raping that americans wont do we have many 10 year old girls in the us but not enough skilled us rapists my proposed legislation will grant mr juarez full citizenship upon payment of a fine of 50 00 payable to the republican national congressional committee which desperately needs the money if mr juarez doesnt have enough money to pay the fine he should go rob someone
860956 if she had taken the ride in my car that i offered her she would not have been home to be raped by this future democrat voter we offer him sanctuary in massatwochits hic
860957 the girls family didnt buy carbon rights i bought from a chinese farmer who promised not to burn a million tons of coal this year so there was a cyclone which caused this rape
860958 conservatives say that we just need to focus on maintaining free markets and let everything sort itself out through the miracle of the invisible hand but the political tide is turning against unfettered free markets and toward greater regulation
860959 this is the fastest temperature change in the instrumental record and it puts us back to where we were in 1930
860960 we talk about senator clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well in a role that is in many ways more powerful than the president
860961 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
860962 there is significant support among top mccain advisers that he make a transformative pick who would change the republican party someone who would appeal to moderate republicans and democrats this pick would be someone who like mccain has taken the unpopular stands made the hard calls and stood firm on principle a person who fills that bill these advisers say is joe lieberman
860963 you know something the republicans dont want to win this election they dont mccain may want to win but these people around him that are giving him this advice they must not want to win this election
860964 there is a reason the american people the past 100 years elevated only two sitting senators into the white house jfk and warren harding its because they believe most senators adept at compulsive compromise have no political compass and will sell them out
860965 were mad as hell and were not going to take it anymore
860966 if president bush had pursued the right energy policies and made the investments in clean coal technology that he promised eight years ago he might not be talking about the high gasoline prices today
860967 big hurdle is fund raising even among a business community that is desperate to throw out mr mcgraw
860968 10 thinks you didnt know about west virginia gov joe manchin
860969 in my 31 years of social work i dont think ive seen a crime this heinous perpetrated against a social worker in the line of duty
860970 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
860971 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
860972 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
860973 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
860974 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
860975 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
860976 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
860977 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
860978 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
860979 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
860980 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil
860981 americans hate being dependent for our mobility and therefore for our livelihoods on countries often hostile to our way of life
860982 dire national security problems inherent in our dependence on imported oil
860983 this is the reason enron and others were able to manipulate the system in deregulated california 10 years ago a manipulation that led to the near bankruptcy of the state and continues to burden the state budget
860984 dire national security problems inherent in our dependence on imported oil
860985 this is the reason enron and others were able to manipulate the system in deregulated california 10 years ago a manipulation that led to the near bankruptcy of the state and continues to burden the state budget
860986 can you please tell me what the lottery numbers will be in the next drawing
860987 i came up with one more energy related prediction the greatest self propelled vehicle ever invented the bicycle will experience a major renaissance
860988 should we ignore gore or put him in charge hes an absurd extremist says mark davis the planet does not need saving the climate is not in crisis
860989 options fade for failing schools outside managers lack of interest in texas has forced campus closures
860990 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
860991 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
860992 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
860993 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
860994 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
860995 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
860996 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
860997 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
860998 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
860999 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
861000 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
861001 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
861002 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
861003 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
861004 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
861005 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
861006 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
861007 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
861008 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
861009 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
861010 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
861011 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
861012 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
861013 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
861014 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
861015 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
861016 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
861017 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
861018 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
861019 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
861020 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
861021 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
861022 i had other priorities in the 60s than military service
861023 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
861024 the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
861025 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
861026 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
861027 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
861028 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
861029 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
861030 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
861031 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
861032 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
861033 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
861034 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
861035 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
861036 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
861037 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
861038 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
861039 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
861040 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
861041 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
861042 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
861043 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
861044 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
861045 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
861046 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
861047 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
861048 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
861049 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
861050 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
861051 i choose to reach across the aisle with john kerry to protect homeowners against foreclosure
861052 kerry advocates all kinds of additional socialism at home appeasement abroad and what that means is weakness for the future
861053 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
861054 the members have either climbed the himalayas or have gone through some hard training
861055 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
861056 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
861057 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
861058 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
861059 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
861060 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
861061 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
861062 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
861063 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
861064 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
861065 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
861066 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
861067 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
861068 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
861069 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
861070 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
861071 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
861072 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
861073 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
861074 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
861075 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses
861076 enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
861077 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
861078 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
861079 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
861080 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
861081 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
861082 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
861083 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
861084 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
861085 i had just come out of the cotton fields and corn fields
861086 i was on welfare with my family and i hated welfare i got angry and upset and told them i wanted to go to work
861087 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
861088 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
861089 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
861090 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
861091 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
861092 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
861093 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
861094 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
861095 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
861096 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
861097 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
861098 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
861099 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
861100 if hed been president we wouldnt have hadthese bush administration messes the past eight years
861101 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presencethat draws you in
861102 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
861103 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
861104 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate
861105 if the vice president says its do able i believe
861106 its a strategy that willcreate millions of new jobs and one that will leave ourchildren a world that is cleaner and safer
861107 it cannot be the basis of a soundenergy policy by any responsible official in america it seemsto me maybe i am wrong but i dont think so
861108 you win some you lose some and then theres that little known third category
861109 when we brought the organization to philadelphia and we did research with then television partner nbc polling people of the philadelphia area the awareness factor of arena football was about 1 5 percent
861110 today i dont think theres a sports fan in philadelphia that hasnt at least heard of the philadelphia soul
861111 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy
861112 if this victory can clear the way and get rid of the curse that theyve had here for a number of years i hope it does
861113 i hope the eagles now can win it the sixers mo cheeks and those guys can win it
861114 its amazing how many people have texted or e mailed or called
861115 coach tom coughlin from the giants andy reid bill belichick bob kraft doug flutie john elway al gore youd be surprised at the people who were glued to their tv sunday charlie weis
861116 so many people that weve run into over the years that just had the best of wishes for what we just accomplished it was pretty cool
861117 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
861118 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
861119 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
861120 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
861121 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
861122 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
861123 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
861124 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
861125 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
861126 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
861127 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
861128 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
861129 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
861130 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
861131 the way to bring gas prices down is to end our dependence on oil and use the renewable sources that can give us the equivalent of 1 a gallon gasoline
861132 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
861133 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
861134 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
861135 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
861136 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
861137 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
861138 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
861139 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
861140 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
861141 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
861142 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
861143 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
861144 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
861145 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
861146 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
861147 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
861148 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
861149 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
861150 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
861151 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
861152 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
861153 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
861154 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
861155 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
861156 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
861157 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
861158 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living
861159 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
861160 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
861161 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
861162 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
861163 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
861164 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
861165 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
861166 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
861167 as soon as i cross the attock bridge across the indus river i feel as if i am in central asia
861168 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
861169 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
861170 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
861171 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
861172 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
861173 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
861174 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
861175 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
861176 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
861177 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
861178 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
861179 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
861180 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
861181 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
861182 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
861183 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
861184 living like ed a guide to the eco friendly life

861187 responsible individuals throughout the industrialized world are trying to come to grips with the harm being done to the global environment
861188 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
861189 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
861190 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
861191 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
861192 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
861193 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
861194 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
861195 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
861196 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
861197 siddhivinayak temple has a huge following in mumbai and the temple trust was interested in getting the devotees involved in the film so we approached many of them and everyone readily agreed
861198 we are going to show six or seven miraculous stories authorised by the temple trust in one of them sachin has an important part towards climax of the story
861199 we decided to make this film because several devotees said more people should know about lord ganesh
861200 a scientific manner and it is not a superstitious account
861201 lord ganesh worshipped his parents a lot and devotees should implement that
861202 howeler yoon a landscape design switch in which new and old techonologies and soft and hard textures are braided together to created an integrated and interactive landscape
861203 this modern intervention in an old geneva square or actually a trapezoid by swiss firm 2b architectes is quite beautiful the design manages to be completely modern yet still evoke images of the past using traditional sandstone as well as glass blocks or cobblestones in a random pattern the architects are letting you in on a secret a lake used to occupy this land the closer you get to the location of the medieval lake the closer the glass blocks are spaced

861214 this solar public lighting pole is totally autonomous and can be placed in any isolated area where electricity is not available built with power leds which offer lighting performance and energy saving it also can be programmed it also includes a motion detector so when a pedestrian comes close the light intensity of the pole raises to full power and decreases to a third to save energy when there is nobody around it comes in two versions urban and country side
861215 created by industrial designer doron hadar ecotreecity is an ambitious public lighting project that uses integrated freestanding solar element that can produce energy even in extreme conditions like the northern countries that get less hours of light thanks to a flowing independent form the light can be randomly put together anywhere making each light unique like a real tree

861219 oh no they dont expect me to learn about this do they
861220 i want a program that will make sites like this
861221 i want a hammer which will make a house like this
861222 the use of sarangani produced bangus fry will not diminish the high quality of dagupan bangus one bit

861224 for me he was a good buddy at the park and away from the park we always had a lot of great laughs he will be very sorely missed
861225 the braves family and braves fans everywhere will sadly miss him our thoughts are with his wife paula and his children

861227 were all very shocked by the timing its a very sad day for family and for braves fans i think the braves fans feel theyre part of skips family
861228 he had a huge impact on a lot of peoples lives and he had a huge impact on my life
861229 during the season we spent more time together than we did with our families and our lives
861230 passing the exams is already a lot to me being one of the topnotchers is a bonus

861233 disclosing that tehran directed international a bomb inspectors to other places sources warned that the project poses a very serious threat to international security
861234 i thank you for the good services of the mehab qudus company and at the same time i must remind you of the following items
861235 1 all construction materials must be transported from the warehouses to the construction site in top secrecy
861236 2 as part of the doctrine of caution we reiterate yet again that during the transport of all required materials you must ensure that this transport does not arouse the suspicions of any citizen in the region through which you are moving
861237 in conclusion we say yet again that all the construction work in this project must be carried out under absolute secrecy
861238 from the aide to irgc commander in the city of al ahwaz hassan jalaliyan
861239 al zarqan nuclear reactor is in the middle of very highly populated areas making it a very difficult target due to a possibility that the iranian authorities will use civilians as human shields
861240 based on what i know its highly unlikely that those air defense missiles would be in iranian hands any time soon
861241 the s 300 could prove to be a tipping point for the united states and israel
861242 but theres an answer for every counter measure and as far as were concerned the sooner the iranians get the new system the more time we will have to inspect the deployments and tactical doctrines
861243 the minimum work up time to be comfortable with the system is six months but more time is preferable
861244 belarus is the proxy route whenever russia wants to deny it is doing the sale but nothing happens along that route without moscow saying so
861245 it gave us a good opportunity for networking and were further than we were in interfaith dialogue
861246 we were especially moved by the reference in the commentary to the churchs rejection of anti jewish teachings and by the recollection of the good friday prayer of the 1970 roman missal in the mention of our jewish brothers and sisters the first to hear the word of god
861247 they especially came because were a jewish organisation and they wanted to see something jewish
861248 they unifil should be much more proactive more aggressive in going after hizbullah in detecting and identifying arms depots they should be going in there not just relying on lebanese armed forces to do so who often work in collusion with hizbullah
861249 the unifil soldiers were not sent there to give out chocolates to children or write traffic tickets they were sent there to carry out a mandate which was very clearly defined and they are not doing so by not doing it they may be laying the groundwork for the next flare up so even in their own interest and for their safety they should be more proactive and go after hizbullah and find a way to control the israeli syrian border
861250 we have brought in experts brought in generals briefed them on the situation they know exactly what is happening we are not even asking them to change the mandate or the rules of operation because that would mean opening the whole thing today and god knows where you will end up but within the mandate as it stands today they can do much more and be more effective and if they dont they will have to regret it
861251 1701 also demanded the immediate release of reservists eldad regev and ehud goldwasser who tragically were returned two years later in coffins
861252 this was a massive explosion that was heard throughout tehran
861253 even though lots of people were killed the revolutionary guards are trying to conceal what really happened
861254 the bulldozer driver left a construction site and hit two cars
861255 a civilian who saw what was happening shot him the bulldozer continued on its way a border police patrol continued to shoot and the terrorist was killed
861256 one car flipped over and others were crushed i started running in the direction of the tractor people regained their composure within seconds a guy from susya near southern mount hebron shot him in the head and a few minutes later a border police officer shot him as well
861257 he didnt yell anything he just kept ramming into cars
861258 the driver then headed for cars waiting at a red light and rammed into them with all his might
861259 comprehensive revision to weed out disparaging remarks towards religious groups
861260 his government former president putin and now prime minister putin has taken his country down a path that i think is very harmful
861261 in the last week or so look at russias actions
861262 they cut back on their oil supplies to the czechs because the czechs made an agreement with us they have now thrown out or forced out bp out of russia
861263 they continue to put enormous pressures on georgia in many ways theyre putting pressure on ukraine they are blocking action in the united nations security council on iran
861264 we want better russian behaviour internationally and we have every right to expect it
861265 and i will do what i can to see that they reverse many of the behaviour patterns which have really been very unhelpful to peace in the world
861266 maybe this is how cafu felt when he raised that golden trophy in 2002
861267 its a great venue for players to be seen by college coaches and for young players to work and improve their games

861273 the first time i went to the philippines my rookie year the plane arrived at 2 30 in the morning
861274 i looked at a court outside and it was packed there were about 60 people playing and it was raining
861275 all the jerseys are kobe lebron james and yao now theyre wearing celtics jerseys why because thats the team that won the championship
861276 people here work so hard they dont have that commitment to get better its more whatever you can whenever you can
861277 companies have teams but its really just a reason to get people together
861278 the law firms the bankers a lot of them are europeans who come out here without knowing anyone so theyll put a team together just to create a sense of camaraderie or brotherhood so to speak
861279 the most points they score are on the fast break
861280 how they tried to not let us run every time there was a dead ball there was substitution so that we couldnt run
861281 they did a good job of calling timeouts or substituting when there was a free throw
861282 usually on a free throw we get the ball and take off and run they did a good job of offensive rebounding too
861283 and were gonna give ourselves a chance to win every night if we continue to play defense like weve been playing
861284 especially going against the zone and just the tempo of the game
861285 cuenta la tradici n dice el doctor leopoldo a rodr guez que do a marta regal una parte de su terreno a san cayetano para que le hicieran all un templo

861288 you dont really matter to us at all youre just a hand puppet who gets our greedy fingers up the ass every few years so we can line our pockets and get more control over your life the news papers print what we tell them and we ensure many hours of innuendo on television because its more dangerous then the drugs we feed you in the form of alcohol and cigarettes
861289 no i dont believe you i dont trust you and i want to see for myself
861290 besides the forecast for storms its also possible that the mccain campaign would not want to have mccain highlighting his support for increased drilling in the outer continental shelf at a time officials are dealing with a spill of an estimated 9 000 barrels of diesel fuel into the mississippi river
861291 you bring your a game every day in the big leagues or you get ambushed
861292 even teams that do not have a good record have good players
861293 the guys in here know not to underestimate an opponent
861294 we have been on the 41 60 team that someone overlooked and paid the price
861295 i almost enjoy these a little more because its a battle i get flustered a little bit things flash through my head but i step off and remind myself the only thing that matters is the next pitch and if i make the right pitch i can get out of the situation
861296 on behalf of his family and friends in galveston we are grateful for honoring dougs memory in such a wonderful way
861297 ghf is really pleased to see this type of interest in our employees and naming it for doug is a special incentive to recognize the role of volunteers in the mission of ghf

861390 our troops have made military progress in iraq but i worry about the lack of progress being made by the iraqi government the political progress is spotty and elusive despite the surge the continued u s presence and the ongoing great sacrifices by our troops on the ground
861391 recent battles in congress over troop funding as well as a significant number of members who actually vote against that needed funding demoralize the brave men and women who serve in our armed forces and their families
861392 with a strong military presence and a strong diplomatic agenda we reduce the risks to our armed services serving in the region and especially with respect to the iraqi government itself
861393 the progress that should receive primary focus consists of turning over security responsibility to the iraqi government and away from the u s military this is ongoing and the effort should be ramped up as much as possible
861394 what is critical to remember is that al qaeda declared that iraq would be the top battlefield in their efforts to assault america and they are losing we need to do a better job of articulating this message and counteracting the hatred unleashed by bin laden and his followers
861395 iran must not pursue a policy of aggression toward its middle eastern neighbors and should make every effort to return to good standing in the broader international community intensive and ongoing diplomacy is required
861396 iran continues to be uncooperative we must therefore pursue further and tougher sanctions we must aggressively promote groups in iran dedicated to democratic reform in that nation we need to improve intelligence gathering capabilities lastly we cannot remove the potential of a military response
861397 i believe that a great deal of military pressure should be put on iran and i think regional security depends on it but right alongside i believe diplomatic pressure should be just as intense and with the absolute promise that if iran or any other nation wishes to enter into a peaceful relationship that we are open to it and willing to do so regardless of petropolitics
861398 i would vote against any military action against iran unless it posed an immediate imminent threat to the security of the united states
861399 military action against iran must remain on the table but only as a last resort should other actions like sanctions prove to be ineffective and with clear intelligence of a serious threat to the united states or its allies
861400 our troops need to be in afghanistan and america needs to ramp up our efforts there we have to work with the international community to foster democracy and the rule of law in afghanistan
861401 clearly we need a surge of troops into afghanistan to stem the increasing violence in that country for the rest of the world a great deal is at stake
861402 with trust regained among our allies it may be possible to find momentum toward a renewed combined effort to bring peace and security to afghanistan
861403 there are terrorists all over the world yet the u s seems to be pursuing them only in iraq and afghanistan if this is truly a global war on terror as the president describes it why is it limited to two countries
861404 we must also make clear to our allies in nato that the war on terror is a global war and these terrorists are poised to strike member nations as they have in the u s spain turkey and england and have planned in italy and other countries
861405 a long term commitment of u s troops in an iraqi civil war is not in the interest of the u s iraq or the wider middle east
861406 we are there and we must finish what we started
861407 premature withdrawal would also open the door to mass ethnic cleansing and possible genocide
861408 the military diplomatic and political progress would be squandered if we were to withdraw before iraq was ready to secure its own borders and protect its own cities
861409 needs to listen to our generals they have shown they have the expertise to assess well the military and political situation on the ground in iraq
861410 is only one front of the global war on terrorism
861411 the way we win is by setting the tone globally that terrorism will not be ignored
861412 an iranian attack against israel would be a threat to peace in all regions of the world
861413 before i could support any military action i would need to be convinced not only that such action were in the national interest and in response to a clear threat but that there was a clear and achievable mission i have not yet seen such a mission described in iran
861414 if a diplomatic solution is not soon achieved the next congress and president may very well face a world crisis over an attack by israel to forestall nuclear weapons development in iran
861415 irans missile tests also reinforce the need to expand our missile defense system into europe
861416 the war in iraq was a war of choice not a war of necessity
861417 the rise in violence and casualties in afghanistan have made it very apparent that additional troops are needed in the country
861418 we cannot allow that government to fall to islamic radicals
861419 they have a vested interest in securing peace in the middle east
861420 the united states needs to encourage the nations in the region to have an open dialogue with each other the united states must act proactively by coordinating diplomatic political and economic solutions
861421 it will be up to nato as a whole to police itself and its member countries regarding the commitment being made to the organization as a whole
861422 congress should use its diplomatic leverage to assist american efforts to increase allied assistance in afghanistan but withholding aid to our nato allies would be counterproductive
861423 iraqis and the iraqi government must make realistic progress on reconciliation
861424 oil revenue sharing cannot be an ad hoc provincial process job programs need formal codification iraqi security forces must fill the space between peace and anarchy
861425 while the situation remains difficult our military commanders cite that al qaeda in iraq is increasingly isolated and on the defensive
861426 attacks have been reduced fatalities have been reduced iraqi citizens who left the country are returning and iraqi security forces are increasingly assuming more day to day control over areas of their country political reconciliation is also occurring through power sharing arrangements and the government confronting militias
861427 should listen carefully to the recommendations of our military leaders rather than make politically motivated decisions congress should also ensure that our troops have the resources they need to succeed
861428 with a strong military presence and a strong diplomatic agenda we reduce the risks to our armed services serving in the region and we increase the chances for greater political success in the region and especially with respect to the iraqi government itself
861429 we need to reassert ourselves as the primary broker of peace between the israelis and palestinians
861430 we need to show the leaders of the middle east that the american people are committed to peace although prepared for conflict
861431 the progress that should receive primary focus consists of turning over security responsibility to the iraqi government and away from the u s military this is ongoing and the effort should be ramped up as much as possible
861432 declared that iraq would be the top battlefield in their efforts to assault america and they are losing we need to do a better job of articulating this message and counteracting the hatred unleashed by bin laden and his followers
861433 american forces should be transitioned out of iraq and can be redeployed to areas like afghanistan in order to bring the war on terror to the terrorists
861434 we must also make clear to our allies in nato that the war on terror is a global war and these terrorists are poised to strike member nations as they have in the u s spain turkey and england and have planned in italy and other countries
861435 should explain why our military is in afghanistan to begin with there are terrorists all over the world yet the u s seems to be pursuing them only in iraq and afghanistan if this is truly a global war on terror as the president describes it why is it limited to two countries
861436 i am hopeful that such a trend will continue as our partner nations realize the importance of this effort we must continue our support for nato

861500 there were moments in this game where we showed that we can play with the top teams but there were too many moments when we were sloppy with the ball
861501 when youre not perfect in all facets of the game against a disciplined team like deerfield it can come back to bite you we played well but they just took advantage of our mistakes
861502 we just started the game too slow and let it get away from us after the first quarter
861503 but on a positive note we showed that we can play with the best and were able to put our offense together by the end of the game it was just too little and too late to change the result
861504 we definitely know we can hang with them but they are defending champions for a reason
861505 this was a game where we showed our strength at points and areas where we need to improve i think this showed just how good and how bad we can be
861506 i know its only our third game of the season but our next game against avon is huge for us because it will put us under or over 500 and you dont want an uphill climb this early
861507 we need to work on the little things like taking smarter shots and playing with a tougher attitude on defense but as long as we play as a team well be fine
861508 there were points in the game today when it felt like our youth showed a little bit
861509 teams like deerfield can intimidate younger players but the seniors on this team do an excellent job of leading by example on and off the field

861513 it is better to be tried by twelve than carried by six
861514 a good rule of thumb is if you are trying to kill someone never assume the wound is lethal unless you have hit their brain if you are trying not to kill someone but instead to incapacitate never assume that a wound is nonlethal until the person is in the care of a medical professional even a wound to a limb can prove fatal from blood loss or infection you should definitely practice with your gun and this can take the form of joining a local militia hunting or just practicing at a target range generally speaking if you are not an experienced shooter aim for the upper chest area as it is a large target with vital organs in it this goes double for shooting in self defense as a shot to the chest is the easiest way to stop an attacker

861622 by 2048 all american adults would become overweight or obese the results of the study show clearly how the future situation might become if current trends continue
861623 it will never come to pass that all americans are overweight not even in 2048

861637 cool its thousands of years later and i have a second chance at life
861638 so were packing our things were building a boat were gonna create a new master race cause were so pure oh lord were so pure god said heres your future yep
861639 lets just say i was testing the bounds of reality i was curious to see what would happen thats all it was curiosity
861640 people are afraid of themselves of their own reality their feelings most of all people talk about how great love is but thats bullshit love hurts feelings are disturbing people are taught that pain is evil and dangerous how can they deal with love if theyre afraid to feel pain is meant to wake us up people try to hide their pain but theyre wrong pain is something to carry like a radio you feel your strength in the experience of pain its all in how you carry it thats what matters pain is a feeling your feelings are a part of you your own reality if you feel ashamed of them and hide them youre letting society destroy your reality you should stand up for your right to feel your pain
861641 i think theres a whole region of images and feelings inside us that rarely are given outlet in daily life and when they do come out they can take perverse forms its the dark side everyone when he sees it recognizes the same thing in himself its a recognition of forces that rarely see the light of day the more civilized we get on the surface the more the other forces make their plea
861642 thats what real love amounts to letting a person be what he really is most people love you for who you pretend to be to keep their love you keep pretending performing you get to love your pretence its true were locked in an image an act and the sad thing is people get so used to their image they grow attached to their masks they love their chains they forget all about who they really are and if you try to remind them they hate you for it they feel like youre trying to steal their most precious possession
861643 the most important kind of freedom is to be what you really are you trade in your reality for a role you trade in your sense for an act you give up your ability to feel and in exchange put on a mask there cant be any large scale revolution until theres a personal revolution on and individual level its got to happen inside first you can take away a mans political freedom and you wont hurt him unless you take away his freedom to feel that can destroy him that kind of freedom cant be granted nobody can win it for you
861644 i offer images i conjure memories of freedom that can still be reached like the doors right but we can only open the doors we cant drag people through i cant free them unless they want to be free maybe primitive people have less bullshit to let go of to give up a person has to be willing to give up everything not just wealth all the bullshit that hes been taught all societys brainwashing you have to let go of all that to get to the other side most people arent willing to do that

861655 heres one for you lets say theres a sick person over here and you can cure him you can do it would you help him would you try
861656 but why not say that youd help a sick and maimed person if you could most of us would if we could but god doesnt
861657 thats right god made satan didnt he tell me son is there evil in this world
861658 evils everywhere isnt it and god did make everything correct
861659 if god created everything then god created evil since evil exists and according to the principle that our works define who we are then god is evil
861660 is there sickness immorality hatred ugliness all these terrible things do they exist in this world
861661 science says you have five senses you use to identify and observe the world around you have you ever seen jesus
861662 have you ever felt your jesus tasted your jesus or smelt your jesus have you ever had any sensory perception of jesus christ or god for that matter
861663 according to the rules of empirical testable demonstrable protocol science says your god doesnt exist what do you say to that son
861664 and that is the problem science has with god there is no evidence only faith
861665 you can have lots of heat even more heat super heat mega heat unlimited heat white heat a little heat or no heat but we dont have anything called cold we can hit up to 458 degrees below zero which is no heat but we cant go any further after that there is no such thing as cold otherwise we would be able to go colder than the lowest 458 degrees
861666 every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy absolute zero 458 f is the total absence of heat you see sir cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat we cannot measure cold heat we can measure in thermal units because heat is energy cold is not the opposite of heat sir just the absence of it
861667 what about darkness professor is there such a thing as darkness
861668 youre wrong again sir darkness is not something it is the absence of something you can have low light normal light bright light flashing light but if you have no light constantly you have nothing and its called darkness isnt it thats the meaning we use to define the word
861669 in reality darkness isnt if it were you would be able to make darkness darker wouldnt you
861670 yes professor my point is your philosophical premise is flawed to start with and so your conclusion must also be flawed
861671 you argue that there is life and then theres death a good god and a bad god you are viewing the concept of god as something finite something we can measure sir science cant even explain a thought
861672 it uses electricity and magnetism but has never seen much less fully understood either one to view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing death is not the opposite of life just the absence of it
861673 now tell me professor do you teach your students that they evolved from a monkey
861674 if you are referring to the natural evolutionary process young man yes of course i do
861675 have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes sir
861676 since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on going endeavor are you not teaching your opinion sir are you now not a scientist but a preacher
861677 to continue the point you were making earlier to the other student let me give you an example of what i mean
861678 is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the professors brain
861679 is there anyone here who has ever heard the professors brain felt the professors brain touched or smelt the professors brain no one appears to have done so so according to the established rules of empirical stable demonstrable protocol science says that you have no brain with all due respect sir
861680 so if science says you have no brain how can we trust your lectures sir
861681 now you accept that there is faith and in fact faith exists with life
861682 of course there is we see it everyday it is in the daily example of mans inhumanity to man it is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world these manifestations are nothing else but evil
861683 breaking dawn ok enough i had to find out what was so special about this book that was two days ago

861704 on the morning of the third day there was thunder and lightning with a thick cloud over the mountain and a very loud trumpet blast everyon in the camp trembled then moses led the people out of the camp to meet with god and they stood at the foot of the mountain mount sianai was covered with smoke because the lord descended on it in fire the smoke billowed up from it like smoke from a furnace the whole mountain trembled violently and the sound of the trempet grew louder and louder then moses spoke and the voice of god answered him the lord descended to the top of mount sinai and called moses to the top of the mountain
861705 when the people saw the thunder and lightning and heard the trumpet and saw the mountain in smoke they trembled with fear
861706 speak to us yourself and we will listen but do not have god speak to us or we will die
861707 do not be afraid god has come to test you so that the fear of god will be with you to keep you from sinning

861712 just as blood curses through our queer latino veins so does a complex and sometimes contradictory history the words captured in this volume of poetry perfectly capture a moment in time in which we all are in flux and yet still very much grounded in the moment personally these poems speak to my being my sexuality my erotic desires my future hopes and my wishes for new generations and yet they also stand for the danger that those words might also be fragile and easily forgotten it is up to the reader to make these words count for something and simply said its just an amazing and moving collection of poems that truly represents who we are as queer latinos at this crucial moment in time
861713 an 800 year old tradition of hispanic poetry gets a substantial augmentation and at the same time a wondrous makeover with the rich varied sensual often bi lingual work in this collection
861714 whether straight bisexual closeted or openly gay latino voices have made a deep mark in the poetry scene despite distinction in style dialect and customs within the latino mosaic our voices have been unified by a determination to be heard much like poetry in general whether academic or self taught the need to express ourselves cannot be restricted within borders whatever language transferred between pen and paper it is imperative to share our experiences with the world at large

862038 we want to be artists teachers doctors even get married and have kids but achieving these goals will only be possible when we receive the attention we need when we are guaranteed the medicines that we need when we are accepted in schools

862040 theres a whole new generation of young people that were born with hiv that are reaching adulthood it presents very interesting challenges
862041 they cant talk about their diagnosis in the school because they can be kicked out they cant talk about it in their communities with their neighbors
862042 we need to start getting young people involved in leadership again in hiv and aids because its easy to get kind of complacent

862057 making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups youd actually save just as much
862058 i wont support drilling for more oil that we know exists and is there for the taking but i will support short term measures that help us make each drop of what little oil we have go as far as possible until we run out of course remember the road warrior thats what we have to look forward to ka chunk ka chunk ka chunk

862089 we have been concerned about capital raising and returns on capital and this change may lead to a reduction in scope or cancellation
862090 indicates the unprecedented downturn that las vegas is currently undergoing and the extreme difficulty in securing capital
862091 we continue to believe that the downturn should continue throughout the remainder of 2008 and into 2009
862092 while this past quarters results reveal both birth pangs and significant economic primarily las vegas and competitive primarily macau pressures these should normalize over time
862093 long term we are well aware of the many opportunities las vegas sands has albeit at this point we are convinced the concerns overshadow the potentials

862100 something more positive than what they run into from time to time in other venues if you will
862101 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
862102 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
862103 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
862104 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
862105 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

862112 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men

862116 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price

862137 the environmental summit is a perfect way for us to get input and ideas from the community and elected officials
862138 by gathering ideas from the community we can continue to improve the services our dedicated staff members provide to the residents of galveston county

862151 im simply riding a bike going to a couple of places and working for a day
862152 she probably e mailed about 6 100 times and i answered each one back personally
862153 she always said that if i was near galveston i should come by
862154 after meeting me you cant go back and think everybody is a piece of expletive
862155 as a black man i know that black men need to see you dont have to be bad to distinguish yourself
862156 well her and her team are here at this resident
862157 shes not here and she wont be back for a while

862173 we try to get in guest speakers once a month to talk about senior citizen issues
862174 all we want is somewhere for the senior citizens to go monday through friday
862175 a lot of seniors donated their time to build this center
862176 every big town i know of has a community center
862177 its important for the elderly on low incomes to be able to buy a gift like spending a nickel to buy a coffee mug

862184 i have absolutely no recollection of what happened one minute i was riding along and the next thing i knew i was being loaded into an ambulance
862185 how can someone hit people with his car and just speed off not even stopping to see the damage hes done its just incomprehensible
862186 we were in single file when this car cut the corner and hit the last cyclist she was flung up into the air the driver lost control and swerved back and took three other cyclists out and threw them up an embankment two of his tyres burst as he hit the embankment
862187 i tried to get his keys out of the ignition but he started driving off with me half in he sped off on his rims you could even see the sparks
862188 when you hear the bang you just know something has happened it was like everything was in slow motion like in a movie
862189 i am very grateful to the er24 paramedics for their help the surgeon said that were it not for them my wife may have been paralysed the problem in this country is that our drivers are always speeding
862190 i remember the noise of the car hitting mary parker who was at the back of the group when i opened my eyes i was up an embankment and another woman was holding me the pain was excruciating i cannot explain how painful it was
862191 we are such soft targets and people drive so recklessly
862192 cyclists are soft targets and we need to make kzn a cycling safe area in european countries there is a mutual respect between cyclists and motorists we need to achieve that here
862193 the guilty party in van heerdens death came from suncoast casino we need to ask them to combat drunken driving
862194 we may be using webcams and internet technologies but youre still trying to find that chemistry
862195 and if it isnt there you just move on to the next person
862196 if people decide they dont like someone they usually know within 30 seconds
862197 if you meet someone you like three minutes isnt long enough if you dont like them 30 seconds is too long
862198 if you see someone you like in real life you dont go up to them with your resume and compare you just talk
862199 i wanted to be a little ridiculous and put myself out there
862200 my mom said the more places you put your resume the better chance you have for finding a job i figured id do the same thing with dating
862201 eight to 10 percent of our users have been to real dating sites
862202 were more about meeting new friends not necessarily meeting new dates
862203 the dating stories are good to hear and weve got plenty of them
862204 we want to make this message very clear we are not going to allow this country or any other country to destroy the anc or its leader comrade jacob zuma we are going to make sure that zuma becomes the next president of this country no matter what no zuma no country
862205 to make sure the judge does not make an arrogant decision
862206 they the sunday times should not be bringing this stuff and making these allegations now it is aimed at discrediting the anc president as he goes to court
862207 no why this thing has been done by the enemies of zuma
862208 they the allegations should just be dismissed we cannot allow it
862209 the nec expressed its utter distaste at the continued manipulation of important institutions of our democracy by individuals who are determined to advance their agenda which seeks to destroy the anc president and the anc itself
862210 remains confident that justice will prevail and our courts will rise above partisan political agendas in dealing with the zuma matter
862211 the presidency would like to place it on record that president thabo mbeki has never at any stage received any amount of money from man ferrostaal
862212 particularly in the context of the court process currently under way
862213 while there appears to be no evidence that mbeki took money for himself new evidence seems to be emerging that he may have taken money for his party
862214 to preach the gospel of cleanliness and economy and sanitation in every nook and corner of this city
862215 each laundry operator is instructed that besides wearing a snow white uniform they must be physically as well as morally clean when they handle the work of the customers
862216 a survey of the plant shows that over 95 percent of the laundrys owners are satisfied and not involved in any manner in the present difficulty
862217 holing it out kind of gets you all excited and juiced
862218 the first eagle was a wakeup call and i think i play better when im half asleep
862219 the course conditions changed with the rain for me and it really helped sherri because she gets more hang time than i do
862220 we gave ourselves a lot of chances we played well we just got a little too far behind saturday
862221 our program is not like most in the professional cycling world
862222 were kind of the blue collared grass roots that came up with doing all the work ourselves theres no team manager except us were figuring the logistics and were training ourselves its pretty incredible to be able to realize how weve gotten here and chosen to do it
862223 when we could join our forces together and travel together and he could help me with the mechanics and i could help him with the nutrition and the laundry it was just like this little force that when we joined we became stronger together
862224 it was a pretty solid finish to be in top 10 in the world at the olympics but i dont feel like it was my best race ever
862225 i had been working really hard all season just to qualify and the criteria was set up for qualification that made it really difficult to be on form for the actual event itself
862226 im really hopeful for good legs and also good luck
862227 i went there with this awe and respect for the games
862228 i was honored just to be there representing i was really just incredibly proud and amazed to be there

862231 chinese parents tend to be concerned only with studying studying
862232 if you look at cuba russia north korea eastern europe these programs dont change until the political system does
862233 chinese kids eat too much and too well and after meals they might be too full to exercise
862234 all too often the proverbial question among sports officials is whats in it for me
862235 theres a lot of old timers in there i think the broom may come out after the olympics
862236 my husband takes his lunch to work and we all eat a lot of sandwiches here
862237 there are things we can do to drive less but how do you eat less you dont
862238 over the years retailers realized that store brands were not just something to be floated out during hard times
862239 all of us are creatures of habit and when things are going well you just buy what you bought last week
862240 customers are much more willing to try a corporate brand when the economy gets tough and when we can get the customer to try it they like it it just makes it so much easier for us to get the customer to try it
862241 just because its a store brand doesnt mean its not the best for your family
862242 the long term implications are really cause for concern for every branded manufacturer
862243 i hear that girls suffer not just physically but psychologically
862244 but i am afraid i dont want my daughters to have uncontrollable demands for sex
862245 i dont care what everyone thinks i was really harmed and i didnt want this for my daughters
862246 when i talk about my experience many become convinced they also see how my daughters are good and religious
862247 the high number of uncontested races lack of ballot issues and a generally slow campaign cycle
862248 nixon was as good a poker player as if not better than anyone we had ever seen
862249 he played a quiet game but he was not afraid of taking chances he wasnt afraid of running a bluff sometimes the stakes were pretty big but nick had daring and a flair and knew what to do
862250 we are iraqis and you shouldnt say such a thing
862251 the situation is better but how much better and is it real
862252 my maternal uncle is shiite and before they were unable to visit us at all now they do visit us regularly but at the same time they have to be careful not to make themselves conspicuous just in case
862253 if i can get paid to do that then im in
862254 i think ordinary people have no opportunity to see the games and i find it hard to accept that everyone around the country has to adjust their lives and work for it just because this is about the countrys image
862255 this is a warning to my friends who are trying to oppose the beijing olympics be careful
862256 im fending off a cold right now and wouldnt want you to get sick too

862292 have all coalesced very quickly into a perfect storm that has forced a formerly robust business to seek the protection of this court
862293 what i hope bankruptcy is is actually the impetus to having productive discussions to solve this problem together
862294 no attorney was going to work as hard as i would
862295 the evidence was unequivocal that the officer shot the deceased in the back as he was walking down the stairs
862296 the deceased had no weapons no drugs that was never contested
862297 the case was docketed in such a way that i submitted the entire case to the jury

862299 i should have submitted to the jury either find liability and find damages or just submit damages

862466 they saw him mr cowdrey three times bobbing up and down in the river
862467 they did have contact with him yelling out screaming to him to get to the other side of the river
862468 all of a sudden he just went down and he never came back up
862469 we all look after each other thats a big thing in our team
862470 six of the boys were walking into town when three of them decided to get a run on three others including mr cowdrey were left behind and walking at their own pace
862471 he was looking down at the river saying something to the boys and they told him to get down in a split second he fell
862472 whether he was feeling the effects of that who knows bit exhausted bit of concussion there was some heavy knocks
862473 with the limited resources they police have we dont expect every man and his dog to be down here but if it was anyone elses friend im sure theyd sympathise with us wed like to see people walking along the banks and a boat on the river if possible just searching the site
862474 we never give up hope but he hasnt been found well look every day
862475 the condition of the river is a factor and with the amount of water it may affect how soon he is found
862476 after all the community upheaval following the selection process and concerns expressed about the preservation credentials of one candidate we decided to go back to square one and find a candidate who most closely fits the needs of the city of pasadena as reflected in the comments and concerns weve heard expressed over the past few weeks
862477 the least offensive candidate turned out to be mr chimp who has impeccable credentials as a pundit commentator and simian
862478 my circus experience trained me to work with clowns and should give me a unique perspective when dealing with the diverse citizenry of pasadena and the city council
862479 oooooo thats perfect no a little lower lower oh yeah thats what i wanted oh oh oh
862480 im glad we put that bodyguard provision in the contract those babes are hot
862481 anybody know how to get sand out of oh nevermind
862482 any idiot would improve the intellectual level of the council but those wrestling babes are totally fabulous and awesome
862483 that other qualified candidates might be unavailable at this time has absolutely no bearing on the councils decision
862484 anything else youd like to talk about any questions or concerns i havent addressed
862485 taking my first snap i went to the line took a deep breath and thought to myself just have fun out here tonight
862486 more than his throws what i was pleased with is how he was looking to the right guy when he was backpedaling
862487 he knew the plays knew the routes he should feel very good about his performance
862488 i didnt know how long i was going to play but that first series was a long one
862489 coach said that was enough to get my work in i was happy to get to play with a lot of the more experienced players
862490 we did a lot of good things a lot of things to be pleased about
862491 theres always the mistakes and thats what weve got to work on
862492 for the first game i dont have anything to be disappointed about
862493 i was excited to have a big turnover for a touchdown at the end that shows the guys playing it all the way through
862494 fr her war mir immer nur wichtig dass mein busen gu verpackt ist und nicht wackelt
862495 die sind f nf mal schwieriger herzustellen als die mit n hte

862499 not that guys back off in regular practice but you know what youre going to get
862500 a game isnt that way when you go into a game you feel guys out theres the unexpected
862501 practicing against other guys forces you to focus a lot more
862502 but im with a new team right now i dont really care what theyre doing
862503 hes going to be very successful in this league his style will take him a long way
862504 that depends on his relationship with the people on top
862505 last year although we werent as successful as we wanted to be it was the most fun ive had playing in my career
862506 you get used to seeing the same looks every day from our defense
862507 this will be more realistic a good gauge of where were at it will be fun
862508 but we knew if we played our ball we could shut him down but hes a great running back you cant take that away from him
862509 all their running plays were to my side the defensive left side
862510 guys that big are usually just power runners he has power and speed
862511 hes a guy whos versatile and always making big plays
862512 hes one of the best backs i faced in the sec im looking forward to practicing against him and playing against him in the preseason game
862513 my parents say it doesnt look like im affected on the field
862514 i say you taught me that show no weakness i played football i know how to pick and choose my battles when im hurt sometimes i grimace but i try not to show it
862515 thats something thats coming just wait i can see that happening just a matter of time
862516 i can see myself being that type of person one day thats the key to the game driving guys in being a run producer we need someone like that on our team
862517 sixteen years after brett favre came to the packers he is returning for a seventeenth season
862518 he has had a great career with our organization and although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
862519 its really out of my control as much as it affects our team and it affects me personally with him coming back its out of my control
862520 i wasnt really worried about it and now that hes back i guess i have a shot to compete
862521 favre is en route to green bay folks and we understand he opened a bag of pretzels at 35 000 feet
862522 there remain some difficulties but we are very pleased to see the khmer try to learn vietnamese

862525 my dear friend alfie had told me ina garten prefers pepperidge farm from the frozen aisle so thats what i got once again the organic sugar trader joes kosher salt and the cardamon powder came out i thought it would be a nice complement to the spice and the heat of the indian samosas this time success
862526 weve eaten the same meal two days in a row it was just that good i can only take credit for preparing it because the inspiration and recipes came from two fabulous food blogs what were eating and chocolate amp zucchini the snapper was the best fish ive ever made i rubbed it down with a mix of garlic canola oil cumin and smoked paprika and then cooked it in a really hot pan with just a bit of canola oil but it was amandas smooshy dressing sauce that is meant for the jicama salad that really made the snapper pop i didnt have tamarind paste so i substituted a few dried berries some fresh ginger and a splash of white vinegar i have no idea how the original tasted but this sauce dressing was so tasty i could have eaten it with a spoon
862527 this soup is very delicious too good for you to pass up because of some picky boyfriend so heres my suggestion make the soup but very very thick and pull out a portion of it for him then continue with the blending and adding broth lime juice for you to have the soup grill up a nice fat juicy sausage for your boyfriend and have him slather his portion of thick soup on it thatll convince him seriously it would work great especially if you get one of the sausage with a little fennel cumin coriander
862528 you always add the same spice mix to everything and so all your food is good but it tastes the same
862529 easy three things get a lime get cilantro make rice then well talk
862530 just take a fork and scratch scratch scratch the surface for when you want the lime flavor but not the juice
862531 the best way i find to add cilantro is to use a kitchen scissors which we have in the drawer over there
862532 dont be scared i usually just take a sprig and snip it up over the dish snip it as small as you can stand it
862533 and unless cilantro is going in the blender you want to use the leaves only
862534 and be sure and use only a couple tablespoons in fact how about you measure this first time
862535 well i was thinking of adding like a half a cup
862536 right from the mundane to the festive it is really hard to think of a traditional kerala recipe without that obvious hint of coconut but there are certain recipes which underscore the taste of coconut itself using a fresh coconut in such a recipe can be extremely rewarding kerala style stew is a celebration of the finest spices and ingredients abundant in that piece of land freshly squeezed coconut milk dashes of fresh ground black pepper crushed cardamom seeds and curry leaves blend together so well creating a stew with a characteristic dulcet aroma too complex to even describe
862537 bash and sprinkle if you have a mortar and pestle then you have a versatile kitchen tool with it you can make a slew of different rubs for meat spice mixtures for the grill and marinades to both tenderize and give flavor to otherwise monotonous chicken breasts or you can make flavored salts adding a freshness and an interest to dishes that are already great and to those that need a little something more virtually any flavor salt can be made chili and lemon grass for a thai bent basil and lime zest for a summery flavor or a blending with cumin and tumeric for an indian version once the salt is made it lasts for weeks closed tightly in a jar waiting to be used any way you choose sprinkled on a grilled skirt steak or lightly flavoring a soft boiled egg

862547 why the frick would you want an alternative to pasta
862548 trina can you think of anything about the polenta tube that our people should know about i mean how thick did you slice it were there any tricks to it things they should notice

862557 the overall trend in job advertisements continues to weaken indicative of a softening in hiring intentions across australia in 2008
862558 the level of job advertisements remains at high levels particularly internet ads and in july the overall rate of decline has slowed
862559 however recent trends in job advertisements suggest that we will see an easing of employment growth in coming quarters consistent with the slowing in domestic conditions in australia over the first half of 2008
862560 this project is a perfect example of the time cost and logistical efficiencies that can be achieved using the integrated service capabilities of the neptune marine group of companies as customers become aware of the multiple services we can offer there is also the potential for the scope of work to increase once a project is underway
862561 my direct appeal is for every employer in australia when the government delivers and when the aboriginal leaders and the aboriginals themselves deliver work mentor ready aboriginal people to you to employ we ask you to step out to your major role your major part in breaking at last the aboriginal social and monetary poverty cycle and employ these aboriginals
862562 a three to four month short course which is crammed with the industry details specific to that aboriginals future job is what has always been required and what the government is promising to deliver
862563 thats why we need a strong partnership between indigenous leadership our major companies as well as the government itself supporting this plan on the way through
862564 whether youre in aurukun or youre in hopedale youre out in the sticks
862565 we can do the welfare reform to push our people into real work but the bit i could not ever muscle together was the work opportunity part of the jigsaw

862569 apple inc has pulled its security engineering team out of a planned public discussion on the companys security practices which had been set for next weeks black hat security conference in las vegas the panel would have been a first for apple but the company pulled out of the discussion at the last minute black hat director jeff moss said in an interview friday
862570 marketing got wind of it and nobody at apple is ever allowed to speak publicly about anything without marketing approval
862571 the panel would have been a highlight of the show giving attendees an insider look at apples security response team
862572 it was them talking about security engineering and how they take security seriously
862573 due to circumstances beyond my control i regret that i will not be able to participate in black hat this year
862574 an apple spokesman was unable to comment immediately for this story
862575 this is the clearest picture weve ever had of new hiv infections occurring in the united states
862576 we have to do more as individuals communities and a nation to make sure were doing everything we can to stop the further spread of hiv
862577 the magnitude of new infections is larger than previously thought but we have the same picture of whos at risk
862578 these new cdc numbers lend credence to what public health officials have long been saying that hiv is alive and well and thriving in certain communities in the u s
862579 using these advanced methods to paint a more accurate picture of the numbers of new hiv infections is important for working out where our prevention messages have worked and where there is a need for improvement its time to take a precision strike approach towards hiv prevention in this country
862580 we believe there could be an infinite ma enuine announcements
862581 it was a high counsel that i once heard given to a young person

862583 if you want to keep asking me over and over again youre welcome to
862584 now with each bus trip everyones filing a blog report every little thing is picked up and off it goes
862585 we have to find a balance he won the primary essentially on a bus with the press hes intensely loyal to the back and forth with the press its who he is it will always be part of our mix
862586 did senator barack obama cross a political line as he and his advisers quietly feared and some republicans hoped by coming across as too presumptuous
862587 when i first heard this sort of radically optimistic speech in iowa i have to confess my american soul was stirred it seemed like the overture for a new yet quintessentially american campaign
862588 but now it is more than half a year on and the post partisanship of iowa has given way to the post nationalism of berlin and it turns out that the vague overture is the entire symphony the golden rhetoric impresses less the evasion of hard choices strikes one more
862589 the great illusion of the 1990s was that we were entering an era of global convergence in which politics and power didnt matter
862590 i still feel uneasy about it it may well be a mistake
862591 my duplicity around women was towering and chronic i conned and manipulated myself into their beds and then treated them as human jewelry something to be worn for effect
862592 the meme of abasement followed by salvation is a durable device in literature
862593 can i tell you a true story about the worst day of my life no
862594 i just thought if i tried to sandpaper some corners the whole thing would fall apart
862595 parts of it were really uncomfortable i hadnt seen the girls mom in 10 years it was scary to pull up to her place
862596 obama was off to israel where he made a quick stop at the manger in bethlehem where he was born
862597 with a fanfare typically orchestrated for a visiting head of state
862598 senator barack obama dashed through a series of meetings with leaders on both sides of the middle east conflict on wednesday pledging to protect israel and prevent iran from developing nuclear weapons
862599 tailed by camera crews mr obama created something of a spectacle on local television in newspapers and even among the government ministers who jockeyed to join in the attention
862600 obama laughingly urged reporters to tamp down expectations for the crowd hell draw in berlin this evening joking that he might have to spend the afternoon passing out fliers for the event
862601 but they gave me the meat of what it was going to say
862602 you get very comfortable speaking on someone elses behalf and thinking like they do
862603 youre engaged in 18 hour days working on a campaign and afterward you have to wean yourself off that high
862604 overnight you go from being an advocate to an analyst
862605 youre no longer out there hitting the three main points you want to leave viewers with about governor romney the worst segments are when youre faced with a democrat who hasnt worked in a campaign and is just looking to bark talking points into a camera im not burdened to stick to the party line
862606 my wife wants to make sure i mention that more often
862607 id have to investigate more bills dancing abilities before i actually judged whether in fact he was a brother
862608 there has been little humor about mr obama about his age his speaking ability his intelligence his family his physique and within a late night landscape dominated by white hosts white writers and overwhelmingly white audiences there has been almost none about his race
862609 at first blush it would seem to be a positive for obama that he is hard to mock
862610 i still feel uneasy about it it may well be a mistake
862611 my duplicity around women was towering and chronic i conned and manipulated myself into their beds and then treated them as human jewelry something to be worn for effect
862612 the meme of abasement followed by salvation is a durable device in literature
862613 can i tell you a true story about the worst day of my life no
862614 i just thought if i tried to sandpaper some corners the whole thing would fall apart
862615 parts of it were really uncomfortable i hadnt seen the girls mom in 10 years it was scary to pull up to her place
862616 a few people wouldnt talk including carrs first wife kim whom he married and cheated on before his drug use spun out of control
862617 the medias trying to get under our skin and get us off message
862618 whenever i hear scott mcclellan talking about media credibility i strain to remember who it was who admitted jeff gannon to the white house press room and called on him all those times
862619 the presidents opponents will pick it up and use it very zealously
862620 it seems journalists are more interested in vitriol than substance
862621 you all are well aware of how engaged this president is in the response efforts and making sure that were meeting the immediate needs
862622 spent most of the first week in a state of denial
862623 the ridicule was dispiriting and humiliating all i could do was go into a defensive crouch and stonewall
862624 even in the most difficult of times he never wavered or showed any signs of disagreement or doubt so to see him do this now is beyond comprehension
862625 one of the most embarrassing chapters in american journalism there was a sense a pressure from the corporations who own where we work and from government itself to really squash any kind of dissent
862626 the press corps was under enormous pressure from corporate executives frankly to make sure this was a war that was presented in a way that was consistent with the patriotic fervor in the nation the higher the presidents ratings the more pressure i had from news executives to put on positive stories about the president
862627 this weekends uproar over hillary rodham clinton invoking the assassination of robert kennedy as rationale for continuing her presidential campaign is an especially vivid example of modern journalism as hyperkinetic child overstimulated by speed and hunger for a head turning angle that will draw an audience
862628 on friday afternoon i heard my colleague politico reporter jonathan martin bellow in excitement as he called me over to his desk
862629 if my child were killed in iraq i would blame the likes of jeffrey immelt
862630 thats editorial control of bills show and we dont do that
862631 bill doesnt run topics by roger or anyone else for that matter
862632 roger doesnt control the editorial policy of the new york post
862633 is doing business right this minute with iran who are killing our soldiers that immelt man answers to me thats why im in this business right now to get guys like that
862634 the medias trying to get under our skin and get us off message
862635 whenever i hear scott mcclellan talking about media credibility i strain to remember who it was who admitted jeff gannon to the white house press room and called on him all those times
862636 the presidents opponents will pick it up and use it very zealously
862637 was so popular that it made randolph even more of a pariah
862638 it seems journalists are more interested in vitriol than substance
862639 you all are well aware of how engaged this president is in the response efforts and making sure that were meeting the immediate needs
862640 spent most of the first week in a state of denial
862641 i just discovered that im impelled to get out there and get the truth of the matter
862642 when youre in the bubble you cover every story the same way
862643 at off the bus because theyre not part of the professional gaggle they can come up with their own views of whats happening which may be different from what the conventional wisdom is saying
862644 hillary clintons biggest problem right now isnt her lack of money and it isnt that undecided superdelegates will suddenly move against her
862645 the biggest threat to clintons candidacy right now is the media and the instant and almost universally accepted conventional wisdom among the pundit class that its over wednesday clinton suffered through a barrage of political obituaries from talking head heavyweights like tim russert and george stephanopoulos to opinion columnists from across the political spectrum the cw is nearly set in stone
862646 while hillary clinton runs around west virginia doing her best impersonation of a japanese kamikaze pilot who is cognitively incapable of acknowledging defeat there is a sense that the general election phase is about to begin
862647 the obama campaign believes its already been discounted the way they do on wall street
862648 barack obama is the nominee even if he only gets 30 percent of the delegates the rest of the way
862649 anybody have a path to victory for hillary clinton in a word
862650 is there a feud between hillary clinton and michelle obama
862651 in the television age the more people who can see him in the role of commander in chief the better it is for him
862652 youre seeing him with his generation the older generation they looked like the past
862653 the pictures have dominated in a campaign thats as good as gold the pictures would have broken through whether there was a one camera pool or every anchor in the world
862654 what are you guys going to do in berlin huh dowd you got any big plans
862655 42 inch gray big screen tv very good condition i bought it 6 years ago for 2600
862656 id have to investigate more bills dancing abilities before i actually judged whether in fact he was a brother
862657 there has been little humor about mr obama about his age his speaking ability his intelligence his family his physique and within a late night landscape dominated by white hosts white writers and overwhelmingly white audiences there has been almost none about his race
862658 at first blush it would seem to be a positive for obama that he is hard to mock
862659 thats as noisy a place as there is on earth
862660 the most extraordinary thing about him maybe the most surprising is how normal he is
862661 hell read foreign policy magazine a treatise on economic policy and sports illustrated
862662 his exclusive hawaiian prep school and years in the ivy league made him a charter member of the elite
862663 sometimes a bike ride with your family is just a bike ride with your family
862664 at the point where im the nominee at the point where its appropriate i will sit down with john mccain and make sure that we have a system that works for everybody
862665 he argued that the system had collapsed and would put him at a disadvantage running against senator john mccain his likely republican opponent
862666 freed from a serious fundraising constraint barack obama is positioned to mount a general election campaign on a scale the nation has never seen fueled by hundreds of millions of dollars in private donations
862667 democrat barack obamas decision to walk away from more than 84 million in taxpayer money for the general election signals trouble for a system created to limit the influence of special interests experts say
862668 what serial exaggerator was to al gore and wind surfing flip flopper was to john kerry so will shameless opportunist be to barack obama
862669 its highly unlikely that mccain will succeed at making obama look typical or himself especially atypical
862670 likewise its going to be exceedingly difficult for mccain to fend off the taint of typicalness himself
862671 to believe mccain can nonetheless get away with labeling his opponent a typical pol without having the charge boomerang on him reflects a gross misunderstanding of campaign journalism the political press corps will gladly recite mccains typical pol indictment of obama but each time they do theyll feel obliged to catalogue mccains own offenses in this regard in fact this is already happening
862672 that was so the people who are trying to claw me every day wont get anything i expect to be kept in the dark
862673 i do like mccain and the people around him and i consider him still to be a friend
862674 but i have fundamental differences with john mccain on the issues and always have i dont have any problem criticizing john mccain
862675 it was no secret to the reporters around me that i have democratic leaning views but they said i was always fair
862676 id come home and say this guy is really impressive
862677 the thing that really made me feel at peace with the decision is this conversation we had about telling the truth
862678 he wants me to tell the truth coming from a background in journalism as opposed to pr that was really the thing i wanted to hear
862679 truth no such tape exists michelle obama has not spoken from the pulpit at trinity and has not used that word
862680 you could get into some pretty serious back and forth with tony
862681 you could make each other angry but when you walked out of there it was over he was a really genuine guy
862682 he said he was wrong he said that to me and then he said it publicly
862683 i could just never look at him the same way
862684 were both dads i was just thinking about him his wife his kids and what a decent guy he was
862685 mccain likes to say he would rather lose an election than lose a war to this i guess his campaign is now awkwardly adding that he would rather lose an election than have terrorists succeed in another attack the sad part is that now we are having this conversation we can look forward to days of cable news chatter over the issue and meta chatter about who benefits from the chatter is it a dark atwaterian rovian ploy or another embarrassing mccain campaign stumble
862686 independent presidential candidate ralph nader accused sen barack obama the presumed democratic party nominee of downplaying poverty issues trying to talk white and appealing to white guilt during his run for the white house
862687 nader a thorn in the democratic partys side since the 2000 presidential election has taken various shots at obama in recent days while ramping up his latest independent run for president
862688 theres only one thing different about barack obama when it comes to being a democratic presidential candidate
862689 there are so many reasons why tom brokaw should be the next moderator of meet the press at least on what might be called a transitional basis that the best way to lay them out is a list so here goes
862690 mccain is the classic opportunist hes always reaching for attention and glory after he came home carol walked with a limp so he threw her over for a poster girl with big money from arizona and the rest is history
862691 so water under the bridge or will the thought of a man who leaves the disfigured wife who raised his kids for a younger rich woman be a turn off for women voters
862692 if you think a candidates behavior in his or her personal life bears relevance to his merits as a presidential candidate mccains dalliances with other women and near gold digging appear fundamentally disqualifying roughly on par with anything rudy giuliani did to his spouses
862693 it was all about getting good news stories out there
862694 there was a collective impression that all the journalists were getting it wrong it quickly spread to the blogosphere and the world of punditry it seemed orchestrated
862695 seemed even more disconnected from reality because as we were seeing in baghdad the situation had deteriorated so much that many people were calling it a civil war including nbc it was more and more ludicrous
862696 dont do anything that would put you in danger so what have you got for me today whats your next story
862697 mr president you need to get involved its your vision youre the president condi doesnt have the juice
862698 does he believe that shes really going to campaign for him but does he think that shes going to help him on the ticket theres an argument obviously that she would because there is in fact a very energized female vote out there that you cant ignore
862699 i thought to myself i just cant sit on the sidelines this time
862700 once you cross over to an advocacy role of this magnitude you cant go back to being an objective journalist
862701 this is going to be an adjustment in all kinds of ways
862702 you never know whats going to happen to barack obama
862703 maybe jeremiah wright is going to come out and say something again maybe we will find some videotape evidence that he was sitting in the pew
862704 will give media critics plenty of ammunition to attack the press
862705 news about the kennedys has so often come in shocking bursts such as plane crashes and gunfire that yesterdays revelation that the senior senator from massachusetts is suffering from a deadly illness had a quiet poignancy all its own
862706 days when democrats worried that an assassin might try to remove the last kennedy brother have long since receded and ted kennedy carries a new image as the senates indefatigable warrior so it was a surprise that something as ordinary as cancer would be what slows down kennedys relentless drive to promote liberal causes build coalitions and pass legislation
862707 ive been writing these pieces so long that ive started doing nexis searches on my own sentences to make sure im not plagiarizing something on hillary getting out of the race
862708 as a normal person i think oh my god im so sick of it i can hardly stand it and then i chastise myself
862709 were just dragging across the finish line and everyone says oh okay whatever it feels redundant
862710 obama has had this virtually insurmountable delegate lead for some time
862711 the last three primary nights have been the definition of deja vu all over again pretty much since texas you kind of knew that this thing might be on its way to being over but we kept reporting on it every week
862712 we now know who the democratic nominee is going to be and no one is going to dispute it
862713 can you think of one good reason we should continue to cart you guys around the country with us given that your network has declared the entire race over
862714 if my child were killed in iraq i would blame the likes of jeffrey immelt
862715 thats editorial control of bills show and we dont do that
862716 bill doesnt run topics by roger or anyone else for that matter
862717 roger doesnt control the editorial policy of the new york post
862718 is doing business right this minute with iran who are killing our soldiers that immelt man answers to me thats why im in this business right now to get guys like that
862719 only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly
862720 the time is always right to do what is right
862721 one who condones evils is just as guilty as the one who
862722 only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly
862723 if a man is called to be a street sweeper he should sweep streets even as michelangelo painted or beethoven composed music or shakespeare composed poetry
862724 here lived a great street sweeper who did his job well

862740 forget tom daschles blog the south dakota politics blog is where you want to go if youre interested in well south dakota politics and hey who isnt
862741 bloggers like south dakota politics have done a great job of exposing the incredibly biased reporting of the states dominant newspaper the sioux falls argus leader
862742 first the nyt now the sioux falls argus leader bloggers subject their state paper to close scrutiny
862743 the influence of blogging on politics is nowhere more obvious than in south dakota
862744 a credible counterweight to local south dakota papers such as the sioux falls argus leader which too often falls into the habit of ignoring new angles to the race and uncritically running mr daschles press releases

862780 mit unserer leistung in der ersten h lfte bin ich weitgehend sehr zufrieden das lief alles relativ gut
862781 vielleicht ist es f r den einen oder anderen spieler in der ersten halbzeit ein bisschen zu gut gelaufen
862782 das war an pomadigkeit nicht mehr zu berbieten wir haben angefangen arrogant zu spielen und dann bekommt man gegen eine mannschaft wie stuttgart ruckzuck f nf gegentore
862783 he has some things he has to finish up but at this point hes on schedule unless something drastic were to happen
862784 hes risen to the challenge and done what hes had to do hopefully the next three days will play out in a positive way and theres no reason to think they wont
862785 they had some gaps there and i just took advantage of them
862786 in that kind of situation where the game is kind of seesawing back and forth we have so many weapons it could be lebron it could be d wade one of us is going to kick into high gear
862787 this is very important very important because were working hard for golf in argentina
862788 the argument came from when it started raining real hard then we were trying to blame one another for the idea of coming onto pit road
862789 bob said it was my idea and i really felt like it was his idea i had to leave the pit box because i was worried bob was going to like punch me in the neck or something
862790 its not out of the ordinary for us to argue we get mad at each other we let it out think about it and calmer heads prevail nine nine percent of the time it works out for us
862791 if it keeps raining we win it didnt and we got seventh
862792 i didnt think i could finish it there at the end the reason i practiced so much is because i miss so many of those putts
862793 im turning 63s and 64s into 70s said mickelson who tied for fourth with retief goosen 67
862794 it sounds scary to sit here and talk about it
862795 were just trying to get together a great group for the first game of the year i have every confidence it will happen
862796 both defensive coordinator will muschamp and offensive coordinator greg davis were happy about those players decisions
862797 i think everybody saw how excited d j was at the texas high school coaches association all star football game to get the ball in his hands
862798 the players will be up at 4 30 a m
862799 thats how we have to do it because weve got some guys who are in summer school and we wanted to avoid having practice in the heat
862800 this place grows on you as a place not just for the football
862801 im kind of an old school guy and there are a lot of old school ideas and thoughts here worth saving
862802 you can say no here just as easily as you can there
862803 he made sense a lot of guys can paint a picture but dont have a path to follow to get there this guys got a path and hes got a plan
862804 i hadnt had a piece of chalk in my hands in nine or 10 months but it was like riding a bike
862805 this is a guy that thinks about football when he goes to bed and thinks about it when he wakes up
862806 when you combine that with the passion he brings to the table its just a great mix for us he fits in very well
862807 that first day was about as much fun as ive had since i was a graduate assistant
862808 it seemed to me like it lasted about two minutes
862809 its like go ahead god and just take me up to heaven now
862810 he says it when we mess up we heard it all spring but hopefully we wont hear it during the season
862811 hes one of the greatest communicators ive ever been around and if you can communicate with them thats all these kids want
862812 he wont say a cuss word but when youre not doing it the way he wants it you feel like youve been cursed out
862813 the kids dont expect him to be hip and snappy with the lingo but hes not a dry guy and they eat up the stuff he tells them
862814 way back when these kids came out for football because it was fun to play
862815 somewhere along the line weve made it a business and took some of the fun out of it i hate to go through a practice and not laugh were not trying to be silly out there but if its funny laugh if its sad cry if its time to work work
862816 i thought this was one of our best offensive days we were sharp mentally as long as we dont screw ourselves up were going to be fine weve got a lot of talent on this team if we play smart well move the ball and score a lot of points
862817 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
862818 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
862819 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
862820 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
862821 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage

862828 according to the appellant he went home at about 4 40pm noticed his wife was missing and found a suicide note in the kitchen it was typed and was before the jury it started ive decided to put an end to everything
862829 another typed suicide letter referred to as the indented letter was revealed in a notebook
862830 an error of fact that provides the basis of the decision on appeal could be the subject of further appeal
862831 i would be suspicious if somebody presented me with a suicide note that was typed
862832 observing with respect rather glibly that whether a person appeared to have been happy was not a matter that required assessment by experts the court held that psychological autopsies were not recognised as having any real scientific basis and so should not form the subject of expert evidence

862834 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law
862835 this probably further complicates their ability to get to the facts
862836 for me he was a good buddy at the park and away from the park we always had a lot of great laughs he will be very sorely missed
862837 the braves family and braves fans everywhere will sadly miss him our thoughts are with his wife paula and his children
862838 hes had some medical issues but youre never ready for something like this
862839 were all very shocked by the timing its a very sad day for family and for braves fans i think the braves fans feel theyre part of skips family
862840 he had a huge impact on a lot of peoples lives and he had a huge impact on my life
862841 during the season we spent more time together than we did with our families and our lives
862842 has the unprecedented boom in biodefense research made the country less secure by multiplying the places and people with access to dangerous germs

862844 that does suggest those folks are important for the spending outlook and the overall economic outlook

862909 animal lovers should be reassured that student medical training at the university of queensland veterinary science school does not involve testing research or experimentation
862910 students perform surgery on animals that have been previously assessed by several agencies including council rspca or animal welfare league to be unsuitable for rehoming and are to be euthanized by the council
862911 no research of any kind is done on animals that are used for teaching
862912 the welfare and health of animals supplied to us for teaching is our primary concern in this teaching process
862913 veterinary graduates must be competent in the skills expected of a veterinarian including surgery and life saving techniques
862914 these include such techniques as cpr anaesthetics or relieving a bowel obstruction after an animal swallows a bone or a golf ball especially at 2am
862915 the one time use of anaesthetised live animals that are not suitable to be rehomed and are to be euthanized is a small but essential component in veterinary surgery
862916 the animals feel no pain or discomfort during the training class and are euthanized immediately after the class ends
862917 although there are lots of alternative teaching methods available which we also use no alternatives however exist anywhere in the world for that part of the veterinary training program which requires the use of these pound dogs
862918 the issue of unwanted pets is central to the debate over the use of impounded animals during the teaching of veterinary students
862919 we are working towards understanding the causes of unwanted pets through the activities of the centre for companion animal health

862925 whos better at playing with these rules that 6 fat kids with no friends and fried eyes can follow
862926 hey im not too good at this game is that ok
862927 after watching him the year before we knew he was an unbelievable football player
862928 i certainly thought he could be a great player in our scheme but hes phenomenal i think he ran our offense better than any quarterback in the country ran their particular offense hes a coach on the field he understands the whole scheme and hes an unbelievable competitor
862929 now we may throw the ball a little bit more to spread the field and get the running game going but we certainly always want to run the football thats always going to be part of our offense
862930 he was a very physical runner and very hard to tackle with his leg drive but i think the kids that we have coming back have a lot of skill and talent in that position so i feel pretty good about what were bringing back in the running game
862931 washington is a little bigger back but they both fit well in our offense and they can both do the things we ask in our offense
862932 jeremy is an explosive player one of the premier players in the country so im trying to get the ball in his hands a number of different ways
862933 the great thing about having a player like that is hes surrounded by a bunch of other great skill players so its difficult to focus on just trying to shut him down
862934 well give him the ball on kick returns like we did last year but well also get it to him by throwing the ball and running some reverses and sweeps hell get his touches every single week because he has a chance to go the distance every time he touches the ball
862935 alexander is a very big athletic receiver who could be a big playmaker
862936 perry had an exceptional spring for us filling in at wills position and he made a couple of big plays for us his true freshman year then was a spot player for us last year and tommy saunders has played a lot of football for us he probably has the best hands on the team and is a very physical kid
862937 chase coffman can play in the slot or flexed out in a receiver position and hes got maybe the best ball skills of a big guy ive ever seen
862938 he made a number of big plays for us last year and we expect him to do that again this year so there are a number of guys we can go to which makes it difficult for defenses to take any one guy away from us and shut us down
862939 i dont want to overuse the word concern because you go through this all the time with graduation but we have to replace two starters and two reserves
862940 so that means we have to replace four of 10 players thats almost half of your offensive line depth
862941 we might be as good on the offensive line as far as depth right now as weve ever been four of the backups are redshirt freshmen so we dont have a lot of experience but from an athletic standpoint and the ability to play the position were stronger there than weve been we replaced two starters on the line but we performed really well in the spring and i think two a days are going to be crucial for us weve got a number of legitimate prospects and guys who we think can help us win
862942 better to have bad luck that no luck at all

862961 during the last several years that gasoline prices posted at pumps were steadily rising i have run across a few obscure articles mostly produced by economists which claimed that the actual price of gasoline is now lower than it was back in the 1970s when we had the nuisance of all those long lines at gas stations i am no expert at this stuff but i have noticed something that seems to lend credence to the economists claim there are innumerable huge suvs minvans and similar gas guzzlers still all over the road in my neighborhood and wherever i have been doing some driving florida washington dc maryland alabama georgia louisiana and south and north carolina while the posted prices are of course huge compared to what they used to be it appears from what these economists tell us that the actual percetage of peoples income spent on gasoline is less now than it used to be some thirty years ago and given how many folks are hanging on to their gas guzzlers it looks like the economists are right

862964 spiritual entities were once said to determine what was right and what was wrong this force was thought to be god atheists and rationalists rejected this saying that the mind is best equipped for this duty in this view what is right or wrong is best judged by the smart educated people because they are most capable of being rational thus we have philosophers of ethicists and people who cruise the internet who tell us what is right and wrong if you dont believe me just look at how many posts deal with right and wrong
862965 i f the fairtax rate is 23 which is the current proposal then each household would get a monthly government check of 23 of poverty line income for a household of that size if you make less than the poverty line you get this amount which means your non credit card purchases will in essence be partially subsidized by the government and if you make a million dollars you get the same amount so if you make a million but spend only up to your household sizes poverty line income you will essentially pay no tax fair enough but heres the rub under the fair tax all households that make up to double the poverty line will be in favor of tax rate increases because this will increase their prebate checks and they will be opposed to any tax rate cuts because they will lose money on the deal

863000 the growing acceptance among muslims of halal savings and investment products over the past decade has been impressive consequently a number of conventional western financial institutions have eagerly moved into this market as the array of investment vehicles has broadened
863001 i look forward to presenting to islamic banking leaders the latest ideas on strategy execution that delivers performance breakthroughs i will present how successful organizations have built strategy maps around a common value proposi tion communicated to and motivated the workforce and installed a new office of strategy management to sustain strategy execution
863002 clearly there is expanding demand for these products and a closely associated desire on the part of banks including non islamic banks to provide islamic financial services the broadening appeal of islamic finance is also evident in the move by large international banks and other private sector financial institutions to provide islamic financial services

863005 if you put beijing olympic tickets into google this was the first site that came up and in fact it came up ahead of the official chinese olympic site so how is it that a site like that could have operated at least 11 months if not longer without anyone in officialdom taking any sort or action against them
863006 they are the only official group accredited by the ioc to sell tickets in our australian territory
863007 you can see on face value how people could be duped by it but on closer inspection the internal sections of the beijing olympic games logo are quite different and the colour schemes are different also the grammar and english is very very poor
863008 we are special for providing sold out event tickets in very economical prices for being in the ticket market since a long time we have become very popular in football fans and music lovers

863074 we decided to drop xxl in the stores and offer more units in medium and large which are our most popular sizes
863075 the decision was part of our efforts to tightly manage inventory
863076 at my size i dont have many options for shopping and this was just one more limitation
863077 the gap is making it harder for a group of people who already have difficulty shopping to purchase their product
863078 to me it says that fat people both men and women do not fit within the gaps brand image
863079 overall the majority of customers have appreciated the fact that we feature more medium or large size items in our stores
863080 all plus size customers are judged on our appearance immediately

863100 there are only four like it in all of iraq
863101 they told me dont go to the court or your life will be in danger
863102 it was an average life there is nothing remarkable in it in my case i grew up in what we considered financially a very good situation it was a very nice life my childhood was very good but everyone was affected by the sanctions in iraq and during the sanctions the regime was enjoying a really fancy life while youre not i grew up actually in what is called a fancy neighborhood but during the sanctions it was not fancy anymore during the sanctions people suffered a lot
863103 its not because we hate the iraqis its because we fear the extremists
863104 one hundred families have left haswa in the last two days
863105 one hundred maybe two hundred more are coming in the next week
863106 i was hit by crossfire in the neighborhood ten days ago i went to the hospital but left before getting treatment
863107 one of the doctors told me i should leave before the iraqi national guard came to detain me thats what happens to non iraqi arabs who come to the hospital with bullet wounds
863108 they came into the hospital and one of the soldiers placed his finger in the wound of a man we were treating i told him that if they wanted to kill the man they should have done it in the street rather than bringing him to the hospital first
863109 but the iraqi red crescent said the us has promised to help with tents and potable water
863110 where is our right of return it is in the morgue
863111 call at night the reception for the phones here is not very good since they built the wall
863112 its better to die with dignity here than die poor in syria
863113 it will not be safe there for another twenty thirty years
863114 scorpions we used to play with them snakes we used to eat them and wild rabbits they are really delicious we dig into one of their holes and surround it and capture him me myself i ate a couple of snakes
863115 the unhcr told me if i would be registered as a refugee i would have to return to and wait there for resettlement
863116 they told them why the fuck you came over here why dont you go back to iraq you could bury the kid there because of that kids death the family was allowed to go into syria
863117 we had a joke we have to kill the kids to get in
863118 i think he felt after he was tortured that he was going to die so he decided to come and see us for the last time
863119 most people dont have that chance i know how it feels when youre not sure that your beloved ones are alive or dead
863120 probably one of the biggest events of my life other than birthing two children
863121 the mommy mentality left me as soon as we got on that bus all of a sudden the marine hit me and im like all right weve got combat training im thinking were going to go up there and were going to start shooting
863122 i started getting morning sickness and i thought that was just combat stress and a lot of girls that i talked to said they didnt get their period while they were in combat so of course it was pretty sad my husband had to tell me that i was pregnant
863123 the first segeant tried to take over and i said im in control of this convoy
863124 im angry i didnt have this ptsd before i came in or before deployment and its a career ender for me im extremely angry and bitter that i was ostracized made fun of i dont think its ever going to change i mean they try to be a more caring army but its not going to change
863125 deployment for me was an amazing experience it was peaceful if it werent for families back home and things like that shoot if i could be deployed my entire army career i would because it really gives you a sense of meaning
863126 but arent these the very qualities the government wants in its mad scientists surely weve not forgotten dr strangelove already
863127 more families with children are homeless today than at any time since the great depression
863128 the u s has 5 percent of the worlds people but 24 percent of the worlds prisoners

863133 there was only one correct response to this war ahimsa principled nonviolence even at risk of imprisonment starvation and death
863134 hitlerism and churchillism are in fact the same thing the difference is only one of degree
863135 the calculated violence of hitler may result in a general massacre of the jews
863136 prime minister winston churchills declaration in a recent speech that there were millions of germans who were curable and others who were killable was comparable to herr hitlers attitude towards the jews
863137 a way of enlightening city dwellers as to the hellishness of remote battlefields by killing them
863138 there was no need to wait for the enemy to adopt such methods
863139 those who groaned beneath the hitlerian yoke would have food if and when they threw the yoke off
863140 a militarist who held that the incidental starvation of women and children was justified if it contributed to the earlier ending of the war by victory
863141 are you in such a hurry to see your towns smashed to bits
863142 you see the bombing of oxford coventry canterbury will cause such a wave of indignation in the us that theyll come into the war
863143 it would be better that the civilization of western europe with all its achievements come to a tragic but splendid end than the two great democracies should linger on stripped of all that made life worth living
863144 memory of clarence pickett and other american and british pacifists they tried to save jewish refugees feed europe reconcile the united states and japan and stop the war from happening they failed but they were right
863145 sooner or later they would make a mistake and we would enter the war
863146 the question was how we should maneuver them into the position of firing the first shot without allowing too much danger to ourselves
863147 nothing but a direct attack could have brought the united states into the war here was the break for which churchill had been waiting
863148 saw flakes of smoke blow into his cell human smoke he called it
863149 if you go one way the naxals kill you if you go the other way the police kill you
863150 dont be fooled the government says its safe because they want to hide what is really happening
863151 it must have been dark when you passed them they are packed with scared helpless people its never been worse
863152 now they understand it has always been serving its own interests
863153 their falling status in kashmiri politics is evidence that people felt their drive for a separate state had come to be co opted by pakistan
863154 on a religious pretext pakistan has projected itself into the struggle by violent means that had achieved little
863155 historically its been kashmir for kashmiris and violence has never really been considered an instrument of change among average kashmiris
863156 people have this idea that in kashmir there are militants on one side of the street and indian troops on the other shooting at each other and were caught in the middle like this
863157 that was the old kashmir right now things are looking up
863158 let us die for bodo nation but let not bodo nation die for us
863159 the one you will never find in indian history books
863160 as you know indigenous people are not to be separated from our land rights
863161 in assam profit always comes a distant second to petty
863162 even then i saw that the might of india was too much
863163 politics is a long slow process but i am still here most of us are happy with the cease fire
863164 where its not only a different century but a different world
863165 irreducible conflict with indias liberal democratic tradition in general and modernization in particular
863166 kashmiris are looking at the reality of all that is happening there thinking its too much of a bloody mess were better off over here
863167 its basically a business this is the case for most groups operating in the region
863168 the very nature of movements rooted in ethnic identity has made it impossible for them to go beyond their demographics
863169 so these movements are circumscribed and inevitably will destroy themselves
863170 these movements know they cannot really stand against the indian state which has enduring strengths
863171 the home minister has more transient political objectives in mind he says the naxal threat is fading if thats the case
863172 building up to a confrontation that is based on the exploitation of every single vulnerability and fault line within the indian system which they are already doing with great rigor and
863173 if anyone comes to take our niyamgiri we will fight them with axes and shoot them with arrows
863174 so these people can understand how the dongria kond are strong and love these hills
863175 we the maoists are confronted with the great task of providing revolutionary leadership to over a billion people at a time when the entire country is being transformed into a neo colony when the country is being sold away to the imperialists and the big business in the name of sezs when millions upon millions of people are being displaced by so called development projects when workers peasants employees students sections of the intelligentsia untouchables women tribals religious minorities and others are seething with revolt
863176 we shall be at the forefront of every peoples movement
863177 the party has drawn up plans for to mobilize the middle class
863178 there is all this talk of development as a solution
863179 but what do we offer all these people what is the developmental model that will bring them enough prosperity to wean them from violence people talk of development like its a dish that can be ordered a plate of development and a garnishing of justice please
863180 security you must first re possess the area otherwise there is no development the areas to which the maoists have moved in to fight are in almost complete administrative neglect you couldnt even keep cattle there
863181 i decided i needed a gun to fight them so i joined salwa judum
863182 the government has given us roads and schools and tries to stop them
863183 salwa judum people are coming into our villages and making problems for us they say we must choose
863184 if we dont keep up our patrols all this will be lost again
863185 this is guerrilla warfare the indian army is not prepared for this
863186 i forget to say that last week some naxals attack here they kill two spo maybe come back
863187 but we do expect some improvements once force levels increase
863188 let me first say that the northeast has always had many obstacles to stability
863189 there are hundreds of ethic groups open borders rough terrain for policing
863190 look at the statistics you speak of last year more than 450 civilians were killed in the northeast compared to about 75 security personnel
863191 that should tell you that these people are afraid to fight our forces head on they target the weak instead eventually all their support will dry up because of this
863192 make no mistake the majority of people in the northeast today are not anti indian people have accepted india as their country
863193 before the cease fire this area had no peace at all
863194 all the time there was a fear in the minds of people when and what would happen nobody knew
863195 if you fight the indian state for ten fifteen twenty years
863196 after that you dont believe you can beat the indian state
863197 the response from the indian government has been completely insincere we do not have peace instead they are killing our cadres if this is the attitude of the indian government
863198 then the ndfb is ever ready to go back to the jungle and renew our struggle
863199 what britain did to india india is doing to us
863200 we want peace here but we also want our own state peace or no peace this desire will never change
863201 as the situation has improved the overt presence of forces has been reduced
863202 maybe not to the extent that people would like but they have been brought down and we will bring it down more depending on how the situation emerges
863203 we were expecting that the indian government would have already withdrawn their forces from civilian populated areas but they have not done it yet
863204 that is the reason why the kashmiri people have a lot of questions about this peace process
863205 in the land of mahatma i could find no mahatma present
863206 at the time there was no space for a nonviolent movement so i took up the gun
863207 over the last two years the indian government has had such an opportunity as no other government has had since 1947 if the people of kashmir lose hope in dialogue then definitely they will go back to where i started
863208 the peoples army is happy to have you as our honored guests
863209 we only want to live like we always have a natural life
863210 i am prepared to stay out here and fight like this for the rest of my life
863211 and so are all the comrades of the peoples liberation guerrilla army
863212 mother in law told me you were ugly but i see you are not bad looking
863213 you are five years older than me but you look young
863214 i came to say i cannot live like this anymore you think i dont see how my husband treats me like im a puddle he has to step over every day
863215 what does this have to do with me i was here before you came around
863216 no one told me about you is it my fault everyone deceives me
863217 i thought we could get along my uncle has two wives in one house and they live like close girlfriends
863218 im not interested in your family or how you were raised
863219 to become a divorced prostitute and keep a man away from his children
863220 its a sin not to sleep with your own wife
863221 you already have a child if its not enough have another
863222 we are about to be destroyed and all you do is make fun of us
863223 in winter the mountain passes will freeze shut the streams will harden the trees will grow heavy with ice and you will be trapped and then the vultures will descend upon you and leave no trace of you behind the puppeteer sent a phantom flight of long beaked shadows to peck at the girls eyes you both must leave
863224 first they took my eyes but before losing sight i saw only the flash of iron armored soldiers in their thousands then they took my ears but before i lost them i heard the grinding of their boot steps like pounding in a mill last they took my nose but i smell even now the smoke and ash in their wake
863225 we cannot resist them many cities lie behind them broken torn to the ground their peoples enslaved we must flee
863226 but hawk where can we go we have looked everywhere and found no place suitable
863227 go north into the plains after many days walking you will find a nomads horse being eaten by vultures chase the vultures away bury the horse and make your home there
863228 weve walked and walked then we finally come to a beautiful safe place and now you want to leave no go where you please but im staying
863229 i told you little sister to leave the valley for its charms deceive why have you come back
863230 oh hawk my sister stayed and now ive come to bring her back with me but i cant find a way inside
863231 you are too late it is winter the season of the vultures
863232 and the world begins there lies the land of qin to the south at the foot of the earth is al hind protected by mountains and watered by the oldest of rivers in the north forests stretch empty to a sea of churning ice the sun sets over europe and maghreb to the west

863234 the best crowd control for such a situation would be a squad of men armed with full automatics and preferably a machine gun as well
863235 im not really that angry at the nogs they are just soldiers in an undeclared race war but any white thats in that support rally i would like to have them machine gunned

863237 there is no time more obscure than dawn in the blue dawn in the prison yard or near the pine yard a young man is executed along with his hopes for victory in the blue dawn the smell of bread forms a map of a life where summer is more like a spring and merrily walk in the waters of their dream
863238 i do not want a place to be buried in i want a place to live in and curse if i wish
863239 you will find nothing alive like its own image awaiting you
863240 i do not remember that i remembered and he sang on the bridge in another land fly under our window o dove fly and fly
863241 it is as if i had lost my emotions soon we will imitate our voices as children lisping our s s and l s sleeping like mating doves on the vine that clothes the house soon life will appear to us spontaneously the mountains remain as they are beyond their image in my mind if memory does not fail me the ancient sky remains as its image in my mind clear of hue and perception the radiant pure air remains as it is awaiting me
863242 my friend the long road has rid me of my body i do not feel its clay i do not feel its states whenever i travel i fly my steps are my visions there is work for me with legends
863243 strangers are known by the disconnected way they look in water by their introversion and their hesitant walk natives proceed with direct steps toward a perspective goal a stranger walks around bewildered
863244 every bridge is a meeting point on the bridge i enter into what is outside of me and surrender my heart to a bee or a swallow
863245 i am still alive because i feel the arrow piercing my side
863246 the old land dozes behind the touristic castles time emigrates in the star that burned the emotional horseman of earthquakes in the gazelles hoof
863247 o you who sleep do you hear the whisper of the resurrection in a grain of sand
863248 i reached the end of the dream are you still alive come let me take from you the air and your wooden stick inlaid with moroccan mother of pearl who am i who am i without a dream and a womans company
863249 we visit what remains of life life as it is let us train ourselves to love the things and ours if we look at them together from above like snow falling on the mountains the mountains may be as they were and life intuitive and communal
863250 are we now entering the land of the tale my friend i do not want a place to be buried in i want a place to live in and to curse if i wish
863251 i feel nothing my thought has turned my body except for an open death on the bridge i gaze at a rose in the distance and the grave expands
863252 gently do not die now it is an isthmus between this world and the next between exile and a neighboring land
863253 the good stuff of the kingdom is for the people its not meant to be locked up behind cultural norms and religious sanctimony its not to be kept safe from the messy masses and only used by and for the powerful elite
863254 we are told by the holy fathers that we are supposed to see in everything something for our salvation if you can do this you can be saved
863255 the true christian is a warrior making his way through the regiments of the invisible enemy to his heavenly homeland
863256 anyone who is attracted merely by glittering censors incense and beautiful vestments he first of all will fall down before antichrist
863257 when i became christian i voluntarily crucified my mind and all the crosses that i bear have only been a source of joy for me i have lost nothing and gained everything

863266 you must be becky jen mentioned you in the sumble last night
863267 at this time in the year the weather ceases to be the friend of the living we feel it as we crowd close to our hearths but what of those living spirits still in the wood the mosswives and spirits of the land crave haven as much as we do choose a side and create your mask to be part of the hunt or one of the mosswives
863268 our own ritual circle of fire will be their haven and shelter by sheltering the mosswives we show our willingness to maintain our bonds of kinship with the spirits of the land let us hope they accept our gesture and assist in the darkest nights of winter

863271 lyon have a good team but were starting from scratch and lyon might suffer for a change
863272 you have to be honest and recognise everybody would love lyon to stumble
863273 it will be hard for us to do better than last season but well try
863274 we had the feeling we needed a change for a new challenge
863275 its gut wrenching it really is its probably at the other end of the spectrum of winning an olympic gold
863276 i have won a lot of titles in my career but now i want to win some with marseille
863277 the start of the season is crucial especially at marseille where youre always under a great deal of pressure
863278 when i arrived my first job was to make sure all the fans were behind the team which was not that obvious then
863279 for this season once my players have made clear that they will do their utmost to defend the clubs colours well have 60 000 fans behind us and that will help tremendously
863280 the bosses let me have the players i wanted and i believe well have a good championship
863281 i just had to be comfortable over it i hit on the right edge and it actually started right where i aimed and went in the hole im really relieved
863282 i had a good finish there at the end i kept hitting a lot of good shots but my putting was not the best all day
863283 i struck the ball really well especially with my irons
863284 it was a hard fought day and i was fortunate enough to have that big cushion because i needed it
863285 it just feels great to have accomplished this it means the world to me
863286 it was not a good ball striking day but it really brought out my short game and just my heart
863287 i just had to gut it out sometimes thats what you got to do to get the job done
863288 when everything else fails i have 100 percent confidence that i am going to make putts and today everything else failed and i made putts
863289 i wedged it pretty good and made putts you know thats how ive gutted it out through my professional career and that is how i did it today
863290 of course i feel a bit sorry for felipe because what happened to him has happened to me a few times this year
863291 but im very happy today of course after working through all the hard times along with my team
863292 massa and lewis were very fast today but halfway through things were working better for me i just tried to put pressure on massa at the end and try to make something happen which it did with what looked like a mechanical failure
863293 its one of the most frustrating races of my career
863294 if you have a problem like that when youre in a bad position at least there is the excuse that it wouldnt have mattered anyway
863295 but to have a problem so close to the end and after such a perfect race up until that point its a really bad feeling
863296 it was not as bad as it could have been and not as good either
863297 but above all its been a great day for heikki i know what it feels like to get your first grand prix win its a very special day for him

863330 so i hear that chuck todd has been on meet the press this morning talking smack about us and saying that we were
863331 i was getting really good with it toward the end of the tournament
863332 and features my musical response to evan who spoke with us on
863333 as we approach the end of the one year mexican truck demonstration program i have introduced bipartisan legislation that will terminate the program and force dot to fully evaluate the results before it rushes to open the border
863334 all along dot has said this would be a one year pilot so im holding them to their word
863335 this administration has been hell bent on opening up our border but over the past year has failed to show they can adequately inspect mexican carriers while also maintaining a robust u s safety inspection program
863336 the safety of the traveling public must come first before the administrations fantasies about free trade
863337 when dot insisted on moving ahead with a one year pilot program it disregarded congressional objections and concerns over safety
863338 strong bipartisan majorities in both the house and senate tried to shut the program down but dot forged ahead in violation of the spirit of the law and against the express will of congress the secretary has said in very clear terms that dots experiment would be limited to one year this bill will ensure that the administration keeps its word
863339 given the record of dot without further congressional action it can be assumed they will fully open the border to mexican trucks without addressing significant safety concerns
863340 this legislation is necessary for the protection of the traveling american public

863444 bye bye bear market say hello to the bull and dont let the door hit you on the way out
863445 it seems kerry wood has won the closer role but everyone knows carlos marmol should be the closer
863446 in the four years leading up to the credit crunch wall streets big banks paid themselves 250 billion in bonuses
863447 america is finished we are going to destroy this country our economy is just going to unravel the question is how much money is the world going to lose before it writes us off
863448 the process of turning joba chamberlain into a starter has begun
863449 if everyone stays healthy joba will start the season in the bullpen
863450 assuming everyone stays healthy and joba starts in the pen the plan is to let him pitch half way through the season in the pen and the second half as a starter
863451 we get to see joba on a daily basis and we know him better than any fan media etc this guy has fantastic stuff four major leagues pitches and we feel overall he is a top of the rotation front line type of talent which is much tougher to find than a dominant set up guy
863452 everyone remembers how fantastic joba was in 24 innings late last season but what was more impressive was the 80 innings he had in the minors
863453 again i slightly paraphrase because i cant remember the exact words used as i just listened to this a few minutes ago with no pen and paper
863454 i just interviewed someone who would be perfect for your position
863455 im where im at because i made an adolescent choice
863456 why buy tickets from ticket solutions as opposed to ticketmaster
863457 his continuing receipt of hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of things of value from a private corporation
863458 his continuing receipt of hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of things of value from a private corporation
863459 to crave for happiness in this world is simply to be possessed by a spirit of revolt
863460 i can see where its going i can see that the gene is there hes got a rock star dad who has an unbelievable powerful voice and he sees his father sing to thousands of people and dance around the stage
863461 boy im telling you you put on music and he dances you put a guitar around his neck and he looks like a guitar player its just him hes a miniature chris
863462 finally a gift as lazy and thoughtless as you are
863463 the 7 but there have just been too many great posts in the blogosphere in the past week i had to do another one
863464 have our church buildings and services become our idols have we accidentally allowed them to replace the pursuit of deep biblical community with others
863465 we want to grow the business over a three to five year period we are executing against that plan and we are still doing that despite all the stuff thats happened to us
863466 i think they had an opportunity to get something done in the palm of their hand and they bungled it
863467 i am more determined and more excited than ever to see those changes through
863468 they dont get it they dont understand the realities of their business
863469 they surprised wall street with this major investment initiative if they had announced it coming out of the 100 day review it would have been more tolerated
863470 it kind of implies a lack of confidence in the plan thats out there
863471 right from the beginning we were open to doing a deal
863472 it was simply a matter of getting the right price and getting the deal terms negotiated they started backing off early on in the process
863473 microsoft diligently pursued a proposed acquisition from the day we made our offer on jan 31 to the day we withdrew it on may 3
863474 my belief is that if within a month or two there isnt something transforming in the works the major shareholders will put enough pressure on the company that he will be forced out

863485 i share my home with my husband joe our son paolo grew up here but moved to brooklyn to work as an artist after graduating from the rhode island school of design editors note how totally cute is he my own degree is in apparel design and today i experiment with printing embroidering texturizing embellishing and otherwise manipulating silk and cotton fabrics which end up on pillows apparel and in juried fiber art exhibits our house built in 1974 is an imitation colonial when i moved in 31 years ago joe was already here i lived for more than a year with green and yellow plaid wallpaper in the kitchen yellow floral wallpaper in the bathrooms a harvest gold tub toilet and appliances avocado green carpeting and heavy emerald green drapes at the time we had no money for even secondhand furniture but we could always afford a gallon of paint and the kitchen and bath colors were changed often right now our front door is bright orange the house numbers are from weston i used to dream about living in an old mediterranean style house but once i accepted that this was my home i approached it as i would designing a dress for a client a slim 510
863486 i wanted to have a store that featured less common plants so i decided to focus on succulents i also wanted to incorporate my love of modern design and my art background so i carry home accessories and have monthly art shows too
863487 my partner philip and i purchased our place around two years ago after searching for the perfect space for almost two years
863488 flattered by the attention to my work brought by this russian state prize
863489 until the end of my life i can hope that the historical material collected by me and presented to my readers enters the consciousness and memory of my fellow countrymen
863490 i started off today feeling confident but towards the end of the round i got a little nervous
863491 the five footer on 17 was a good putt went straight in the middle and the last putt i hit on the right edge and it started right where i aimed and went in
863492 im very very uncomfortable with four and five footers i practised so hard last week on the putting and at the end of the day it paid off
863493 i was really back against the wall after the double bogey five behind but i came back with a nice birdie on the next and just thought dig in there and see what happens
863494 i felt very confident i was going to make it
863495 it happened without warning with no prior notice at all
863496 we had no idea about it and it was sudden and unexpected obviously i am very disappointed but we will fight back from here
863497 the confidence is there i think after a race like that even with the bad result at the end with two laps to go it still counts what we did in the race
863498 we showed a great performance a great pace and great teamwork that is very good for the next races
863499 i think we could have done the race a little bit better but we were stuck behind alonso
863500 i was stuck behind him until the second stop so it was a bit late by that point i had a good car and i was able to catch timo glock but i had to back off in one moment
863501 we were a bit lucky with some of the other guys we have the speed but if we cannot get qualifying fixed then we will have the same problems we have to sort it out
863502 if we can be in front we can fight for wins the guys did a good job but we need to fix the problems and for sure we can be back in the hunt for wins
863503 i think i did the best of the worst if you like in the end
863504 i had no idea about the puncture and the team did a great job to help me back into that race and last year i think i lost the championship because of punctures
863505 but congratulations to heikki who drove a great race and he deserves his win we have taken points from our rivals today and made the best of things it could have been a whole lot worse
863506 im taking a lot of confidence from this win you expect to get that after winning your first big tournament
863507 its different when you play against an opponent who plays a similar game with you
863508 he was playing a lot of slice and changing pace to my forehand i just lost the rhythm today
863509 i had a great match last night i played rocket tennis but that was not possible against andy today weve known each other since we were 13 or 14
863510 we used to watch these kind of matches on television and now we are playing them
863511 it was really hot but ive played all of my matches in these conditions
863512 but by the end we were both tired it was really getting to us
863513 i played a bit more aggressive and served a little bit smarter than i had in the past and obviously it worked
863514 aids is the most complex the most challenging and probably the most demanding infectious disease humanity has ever had to face
863515 we dare not let down our guard this is an unforgiving epidemic
863516 we are going to be in this for the long haul
863517 its certainly far too early for declaring victory because the end of aids is nowhere in sight
863518 every day almost three times as many people become newly infected with hiv as those who start taking antiretroviral therapy
863519 the theory is that if gas prices go up people walk or bike more or they take public transportation which requires walking to and from stops on either end
863520 also people eat out less when gas prices are high because they would have to drive to the restaurant and they have less disposable income
863521 i found that a permanent one dollar rise in gas prices is associated with a seven percent drop in overweight and a nine percent drop in obesity
863522 achieving just the minimum 35 miles per gallon fleet wide average by 2020 would cut oil use by 1 1 million barrels a day
863523 cutting the cost of gasoline at todays prices by more than a dollar per gallon
863524 further achieving a 35 mpg fleet wide average would create 149 000 new jobs nationwide in 2020
863525 ive started taking fewer trips out to see him but i stay for longer periods of time
863526 and when he comes here next month hell be here for 10 11 days
863527 spending more time together on each visit means we spend time as a couple not as two people who are dating
863528 his intransigence his ideals and his long eventful life make of solzhenitsyn a storybook figure heir to dostoyevsky he belongs to the pantheon of world history i pay homage to his memory
863529 the officer was using the baton as he was taught to
863530 but we very much keep in mind what recordings cant do they only show part of the story
863531 one of the most aggressive police departments in the country
863532 its hard to believe that these incidents arent happening a great deal more than the ones actually ending up on video
863533 headed home after their cross greenland treks and found themselves excited and nervous to eat anything but the now familiar news russias
863534 bread tender fried chicken more applewood smoked bacon lettuce tomato sliced red onions and melted tillamook sharp cheddar
863535 i was born on 22 august 1967 at saransk the small capital of autonomous mordovia i enjoyed drawing as all children do understanding my surroundings was still far away but there were smells and feelings huge rats and headaches it was another life strongly influenced by nature i had been watching and examining for a long long time before all of this shaped itself after many years into conviction and painting it all surfaced from my subconscious mind in the meantime i finished secondary school and begun studying at technical school where i gained a secondary education it gave me nothing and did not fill even a tiny part of my brain hemispheres i felt useless rationalism and routine would have finally suppressed the psychedelic fever and fed my inferiority complexes if it wasnt for the striving of my subconscious mind taking root in my childhood it burst through the frontiers of banality 1990 was not only the year of sun eruptions but also of my brain my heart confessed to me and opened the gate of creativity i crossed it forever without looking back with no doubt lost for shadow and disbelief
863536 cinderellas sisters of step were very excited to be invited to the palace they began to plan the expensive clothes they would use to alter and enslave their natural body images to emulate an unrealistic standard of feminine beauty it was especially unrealistic in their case as they were differently visaged enough to stop a clock her mother of step also planned to go the the ball so cinderella was working harder than a dog
863537 i hate my job of spamming i hate my boss and i just dont care anymore
863538 we tell the enemies of god that god has saved those who will be even more painful for you
863539 as abu khabab has gone he left behind with gods grace a generation of faithful students who will make you suffer the worst torture and avenge him and his brothers
863540 a big name does not mean a big impact on the ground
863541 the bottom line is that those people are replaceable the organization has developed in such a way that it can survive and fill in any gap even if osama bin laden was to die
863542 al qaida might be facing setbacks in iraq but not in afghanistan and any loss will appear to its fighters as a triumph against the enemy not a defeat
863543 lets do nothing and then blame the president and the rest of the republicans that way the stupid people will vote for us and obama because they think we care
863544 realize the president cannot do a damn thing on his own he needs congress to okay it
863545 the need far outweighs the budget that we currently have
863546 the need far outweighs the budget that we currently have
863547 barack obamas official website was purged of his longstanding criticisms of the troop surge
863548 normal activity to update the site as events and situations change
863549 i think society has to act government only does what the voters want them to do in a way and i think we as a society just have to get very heavy
863550 you have no bloody reason to carry a knife out of the kitchen
863551 excuse me colonel pismo but before you make any more grievous career threatening mistakes i think you should listen to what i have to say
863552 well send an invoice not that i expect the deadbeat u p will ever pay us
863553 zij weet van niks en denkt dat je haar nu heerlijk kunt neuken zonder pijn met de dildo
863554 your courage brings me hope for the future of our church
863555 the church does not feel authorized to change the will of its founder jesus christ
863556 you are peter and upon this rock i will build my church

863560 i love the blogs name its also an appropriate moniker for middle age cyclists who i suspect use that third chainring occasionally
863561 i really like your blog going to have to add it to my daily websites
863562 it covers a wide spectrum of cycling issues european and domestic racing as well as some of the history and tradition of the sport very well written and presented
863563 lately ive been enjoying the collaborative cycling blog run in part by former chicagoan leonard basobas as someone who admittedly doesnt follow the nrc much except for when its racing nearby this fans point of view is useful for staying abreast of the various personalities and storylines
863564 i was hoping he would stand up there and say we need to make sacrifices
863565 i think what the governor is saying is if the legislature isnt going to do its job i am going to act
863566 i aint telling you that i think were going to go down to the wire
863567 sleep is forbidden if you work for me you have to roll how i roll im not really human im like a machine

863572 the next doom game will look like its built on another engine
863573 the boys and girls who live with hiv are here and we are growing up with many goals
863574 we want to be artists teachers doctors even get married and have kids but achieving these goals will only be possible when we receive the attention we need when we are guaranteed the medicines that we need when we are accepted in schools
863575 its like a little ball that has little dots and is inside me sort of swimming inside me
863576 theres a whole new generation of young people that were born with hiv that are reaching adulthood it presents very interesting challenges
863577 in this stage of life when we are getting to know our bodies and experiencing new feelings when we get butterflies in our stomachs it is necessary to be able to count on the right information about our sexuality and the changes that are happening to our bodies
863578 they cant talk about their diagnosis in the school because they can be kicked out they cant talk about it in their communities with their neighbors
863579 we need to start getting young people involved in leadership again in hiv and aids because its easy to get kind of complacent
863580 i want to congratulate all the boys and girls who have graduated and got good grades
863581 sometimes i have so much fun that i forget i have this
863582 times are still very exciting for art and the internet a whole new generation of young artists are likely to help reshape the way the art world will evolve over the next 20 years
863583 when the means of security are privatized certain mechanisms of moral hazard and adverse selection might lead firms astray just as in the rest of commerce war is business where nice firms do not always finish first
863584 said his kbr bosses mocked him for raising safety issues
863585 has not found any credible evidence that representatives from kbr were aware of imminent life threatening hazards
863586 were not the cause of any of these terrible accidents
863587 these tort based claims of civilian employees against their civilian employers can be separated from the political questions that loom so large in the background
863588 is partly determined by how closely intertwined the contractor is with the government officials
863589 one of the interesting things that i think were seeing is that courts are not willing to throw these cases out when the contractor has a fair degree of discretion
863590 bunky nuglets ninja death poke and other tales of pointless cruelty
863591 theyve been keeping the relationship quiet for months and trying to pass each other off as just good friends
863592 but theyve decided it isnt a fling its for life so they want to make their romance public dina is still working on the date of the party but its looking like towards the end of the year

863600 of course most of the women involved just want to earn money they are doing this risky job as they belong to poor families and usually have no other way to earn a living
863601 advantage of that haven in pakistan even beyond the lawless tribal realms has allowed the taliban leadership to exercise uninterrupted control of its insurgency through the same clique of mullahs and military commanders who ran afghanistan as a theocracy and harbored osama bin laden until they were driven from power in december 2001
863602 it is likely the government will come to understand finally that it has driven the motorist into sullen hostility to all this government does and stands for
863603 when you take into account the fact that oil companies have continued to make enormous profits running into billions of pounds and the government continues to take around 60 of the at the pump price in tax it is difficult to see how such continued pressure on motorists can be justified
863604 theyll call it a u turn i cant do that
863605 remember its not official policy you come out and announce that it was indeed being looked at but that youve decided that in this current economic climate it wouldnt be the right or fair thing to do you show that youve listened to and understood the people and everyone thinks what a nice guy you are
863606 and as a bonus everyone will stop grumbling about the current rates of tax and duty
863607 the government should get rid of the road tax and introduce transport taxation that is linked to fuel usage to encourage responsible driving
863608 i wonder how long itll take before the idiot says something beyond the pale and the torygraph takes it down
863609 weve mostly failed utterly to defend clinton and an alarming number of supposed progressives joined in the
863610 i should say that i give less than a single small hair on the carcass of a dead animal who wins the eurovision song contest and i have no idea whether russias entry this year was or wasnt a worthy winner we watched about half a dozen of the songs in the middle of the programme laughed laughed again laughed again and then turned to better things
863611 this phenomenon has not been really taken into account yet and we need to explore and understand it it is a new strategy by al qaeda
863612 this is now of a much greater scale than we have ever seen before the problem is differentiating who is just fundraising or running websites who is recruiting and who is a potential bomber
863613 seek to recruit women with a brother father or son already with the extremist groups
863614 we believe that there is more that the united states can do as well and that we have asked it to do
863615 we must stand and work together with other faith communities making space in our hearts for one another effective and meaningful dialogue will only take place where there is gentleness honesty and integrity
863616 made a fundamental mistake of accepting the demands of the governments

863684 capek memang meladeninya tapi ini risiko yang harus aku ambil aku kan sudah memutuskan untuk terjun di jalur entertain mungkin ini teguran dari allah untuk aku kalau beritaku bagus bagus terus nanti aku bisa lupa diri riya dan sombong berita ini aku anggap aku di sayang allah
863685 mungkin selama ini masyarakat menilai aku ikon remaja muslimah yang tak boleh melakukan kesalahan harus sempurna dan menjadi sorotan melihat aku merokok jadi kecewa padahal aku berharap aku manusia biasa juga bisa melakukan yang makruh seperti merokok
863686 aku hanya iseng sebatang dua batang di saat penat dan bete di lokasi syuting itu juga aku lakukan di tempat tertutup
863687 saya sudah memaafkan dan tak perlu ada dendam mudah mudahan hasil dari penyebaran foto foto itu bermanfaat untuk orang tersebut
863688 aku balas sms ustad enggak ada apa apa kok ustad zaskia dan mama baik baik saja lalu beliau berpesan agar berhati hati ternyata ada berita seperti itu sempat kaget juga sih
863689 aku bukan ditolak atau dikeluarkan dari film pbs justru aku yang mengundurkan diri
863690 film belum diproduksi saja tapi sudah banyak beredar gosip tentang aku dengan mas hanung apalagi kalau nanti aku terlibat dalam penggarapan film itu yang syutingnya dilakukan di jawa tengah dan jawa timur selama satu bulan aku tak ingin menimbulkan fitnah dan bulan bulanan media massa takutnya gosip tentang aku dan mas hanung lebih mencuat ketimbang filmnya padahal filmnya bagus banget sayang kalau hilang intisarinya tertutup gosip
863691 aku ingin belajar kcb diangkat dari novel kang abik habiburrahman el shirazy aku adalah penggemar karya karyanya aku merasa tertantang toh artis lain seperti dude herlino nabilla syakieb alyssa soebandono alice noorin juga ikut audisi alhamdullilah kami semua pada hari minggu 3 8 ikut pesantren kilat dikarantina selama 3 malam 4 hari di parung bersama 200 orang peserta lain dari 5 kota yang berbeda untuk memperebutkan 5 pemeran utama di kcb
863692 memang sempat ada pertanyaan apa enggak malu sudah menjadi artis ikut audisi lagi di pesantren apa enggak buang buang waktu kalau nanti sampai enggak terpilih justru aku merasa kemarin aku sudah mendapat cobaan lalu sibuk syuting siapa tahu dengan ikut pesantren kilat aku malah punya waktu untuk mendekatkan diri pada allah jadi niatnya ikut saja tak ada kata malu untuk mendekatkan diri pada allah
863693 jadi kalau dilihat dari silsilah keluarga grady masih terbilang cucu
863694 saya dan grandy biasanya bertemu saat acara pertemuan keluarga besar sesekali telepon atau sms jadi memang jarang bertemu karena kami sibuk dengan kegiatan masing masing
863695 kami syok mendengarnya kami cuma teringat grady yang sejak lama tidak pernah bertemu itu saja
863696 saya belum pernah melihat grady jalan dengan lelaki dan memperkenalkan teman lelakinya itu sebagai pacar yang pernah saya lihat grady gandengan dengan seorang perempuan di cilandak town square apakah perempuan itu pacar atau bukan saya enggak tahu
863697 selama menjalin kerjasama dengan saya dede sapaan akrab grady red sering menghilang dan susah dikontak alasannya ponselnya rusak atau hilang sempat kesel juga sih tapi setelah dede menjadi finalis vj hunt dia tidak lagi bergabung dengan looks model
863698 dia hanya mengatakan cucu dari frans tumbuhan sempat saya bertanya kok tidak tinggal bersama tante rima tapi pilih kos jawaban dede enggak mau ngerepotin
863699 badannya sangat tegap atletis wajahnya ganteng kulitnya putih tingginya 176 cm pribadinya juga sangat sederhana penampilannya tidak selalu bermerek hobinya pakai sepatu bot celana kargo dan kaos dia ceria dan mudah akrab dengan orang yang baru dikenalnya mudah percaya dengan teman saya yang mayoritas laki laki pernah kan sekali waktu dia telepon saya saat itu lagi nongkrong dengan teman yang kebanyakkan laki laki
863700 dede kan tipe laki laki yang senang diperhatikan jadi saya pikir sms itu hanya bercanda
863701 sudah tidak salah lagi itu adalah grady kasihan dia mungkin sifat baik dan mudah percaya dengan orang telah dimanfaatkan ryan dengan perbuatan yang keji
863702 suaranya cempreng sekali kalau dia datang lokasi syuting jadi ramai orangnya belum kelihatan tapi suaranya sudah kedengeran dia selalu menyapa dengan teriak
863703 seperti dia kalau lagi suka dengan cowok dia tuh cerita saja ke banyak teman secara pribadi aku tidak tahu persis dia itu seperti apa tetapi yang aku tahu dede itu orangnya memang begitu
863704 itu pertemuan kami yang terakhir aku hanya membantunya dengan doa

863709 tapi kami masih terus melakukan pemeriksaan biar persoalannya makin jelas

863713 this is steve jobs you think im an arrogant expletive who thinks hes above the law and i think youre a slime bucket who gets most of his facts wrong
863714 you think im a facist elitist who thinks hes hot shit and i think youre a feeble minded blogger who could win the nobel prize for excrement
863715 you think im an insanely great snot who thinks hes hot shit and i think youre a mouldy doormat who is driving with his lights off
863716 you think im an imperialist dictator who thinks hes king of the world and i think youre a friendless blockhead who farts out the wrong end
863717 we had to account for 30 years of sins in terms of not maintaining our data
863718 when i joined i used to tease everybody that the erp around here was microsoft excel everybody laughed but there was a lot of truth to that statement
863719 they had a couple of microsoft access database apps which in reality only allowed them to put in a larger amount of records and there was no such thing as a business analyst at ach
863720 kludge together how to price a consumer order and a commercial order which took a lot of manual labor and workarounds
863721 historically it was very difficult to get one version of the truth youd run a batch routine ten minutes later and get different numbers
863722 hitler didnt snub me it was fdr who snubbed me the president didnt even send me a telegram
863723 when i first came here i completely did not think about or worry about or care about the atomic bombing
863724 in war you just kill your enemy and the atomic bomb is a big bomb and kills a lot of the enemy so whats wrong with that
863725 really caused me to suddenly think about the impact of the bomb on the society that received it
863726 now i completely consider the atomic bombings to be a
863727 those americans who are 70 years or older the ones who really hated still have ambivalent feeings about japan and they dont like to hear people talking about how japan is a victim
863728 most of them are pretty shocked many of them even have tears in their eyes sometimes
863729 and many of them come up afterwards many of them actually apologised to her on behalf of america and many of them asked what they can do
863730 i said from the beginning we are not here to talk about the past we are not here to complain we are not accusing america of anything
863731 all we are doing is warning you about the future thats why we are here i say
863732 the nuclear weapon is not just another weapon this will kill us all absolutely and we have to learn to control it and we have to learn to control our violence in general and that is the key message from here
863733 any ancient deeply rooted autonomous culture especially if it is spread on a wide part of the earths surface constitutes an autonomous world full of riddles and surprises to western thinking
863734 for one thousand years russia has belonged to such a category
863735 a great writer is so to speak a secret government in his country
863736 a man sprouts a tumor and dies how then can a country live that has sprouted camps and exile
863737 suddenly all the professors and engineers turned out to be saboteurs and they believed it or all of lenins old guard were vile renegades and they believed it suddenly all their friends and acquaintances were enemies of the people and they believed it
863738 the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of
863739 not only was i convinced that i should never see a single line of mine in print in my lifetime but also i scarcely dared allow any of my close acquaintances to read anything i had written because i feared that this would become known
863740 wicked governments or by heavy crises or by their own barbarity or incomprehension
863741 exile from his great theme stalinism and the gulag had exposed his major weaknesses
863742 understood the subtlety sensitivity and kindheartedness of the jewish character
863743 we need to be better so we need to go more slowly
863744 tibet groups such as our own are planning a whole range of activities during the olympics
863745 to present an image of stability and harmony to the outside world
863746 this comes down to how china is going to react how modestly or greatly in front of the cameras this is what the world wants to see
863747 china wanted untarnished games a seamless debut on the global stage they didnt get it
863748 its the 64 000 question will reporters be allowed to do their jobs without restrictions
863749 if people are protesting if people are waving flags which is against the olympic rules reporters are going to want to cover it
863750 its round brown and flat now challenge every one of those assumptions
863751 we have people who are focusing on package design and advertising and marketing
863752 we have people focusing on sourcing the product so we have relationships with manufacturers theres food scientists involved so they really test the integrity of the product theres folks who develop recipes that go along with the products
863753 at least 50 clinical studies have shown that using it can reduce your cholesterol 15 to 25 percent
863754 there were about 18 different companies that came up with new and novel ways to make fats without trans fats in them and cargill was one of them
863755 people expect their snacks to be as nutritious as a meal and their meals to be as convenient as a snack
863756 consumers will try something new and are always looking for the latest thing
863757 if it turns out to be really good it might take off but of all those products that roll out less than 10 percent of them are on the market two years later so you throw it out there and see what takes
863758 sometimes scientists can forget that food is pleasurable to people
863759 it needs to be cost appropriate but it needs to taste good it needs to look good its not just a science project although theres a tremendous amount of science that goes into it
863760 the large food companies and the food science department at the u have driven a concentration of talent here
863761 the fact that theres a lot of food innovation here is not necessarily well known unless you work in the industry
863762 it drives loyalty and differentiation within all of our markets
863763 you can only get these products within all of our stores
863764 there was such an atmosphere of love and respect in the send off i couldnt have asked for more on that day
863765 i performed at the tonys i got to do all kinds of things that i never would have gotten the chance to do otherwise
863766 i did my homework i know what leading ladies make on tour and i didnt want to be taken advantage of
863767 we went to six flags and i could scream on all the rides because i didnt have to worry about saving my voice
863768 i can have a glass of wine its just nice to have some down time and hopefully another door will open in the next couple months
863769 wow this stuff is soooo yummy for my cats they just love it
863770 used a similarly configured boeing 757 during the 2000 campaign
863771 for me he was a good buddy at the park and away from the park we always had a lot of great laughs he will be very sorely missed
863772 the braves family and braves fans everywhere will sadly miss him our thoughts are with his wife paula and his children
863773 hes had some medical issues but youre never ready for something like this
863774 were all very shocked by the timing its a very sad day for family and for braves fans i think the braves fans feel theyre part of skips family
863775 he had a huge impact on a lot of peoples lives and he had a huge impact on my life
863776 during the season we spent more time together than we did with our families and our lives
863777 i do not want to give the government the opportunity to take the focus off of its failings by engaging in cheap personality based politics mr buswell told a media conference in perth
863778 i give an assurance today that whoever replaces me as leader of the parliamentary liberal party will have my 100 per cent support both on the record and off the record
863779 on behalf of his family and friends in galveston we are grateful for honoring dougs memory in such a wonderful way
863780 ghf is really pleased to see this type of interest in our employees and naming it for doug is a special incentive to recognize the role of volunteers in the mission of ghf
863781 the doug kanoy fund really sets a great model for others to follow
863782 we hope that other donors step forward to add support to the philanthropic vision of mr leopold and mr evans so that the fund will increase in years to come allowing for greater participation
863783 weve made a verbal promise to the senior citizens that they will always have a place to hold their lunches
863784 the strength of a city is measured in its quality of living
863785 we try to get in guest speakers once a month to talk about senior citizen issues
863786 all we want is somewhere for the senior citizens to go monday through friday
863787 a lot of seniors donated their time to build this center
863788 every big town i know of has a community center
863789 its important for the elderly on low incomes to be able to buy a gift like spending a nickel to buy a coffee mug
863790 the eclipse had a convertible top was pretty much a two seater and got about 18 miles per gallon
863791 the prius is getting about 45 mpg and that allows us to go to dallas to visit relatives again affordably
863792 i have a beautiful cadillac sedan deville an 89 with 19 000 miles on it
863793 i chauffeured a friends niece to her prom in this white cadillac it cost me 44 11 just for gasoline
863794 it was first come first served so i arrived friday at 7 45 a m a blue prius came in but it was for someone else
863795 i stayed the whole day and read a nice book in their coffee shop area
863796 my friend rick brought me lunch and i stayed until closing then i arrived saturday morning at 11 minutes after six
863797 dylan i love you you are a good man god be with you love elaine
863798 the only sign i saw of her was of somebody being pretty positive about life
863799 its hard dealing with something thats happened 15 months ago
863800 i find it hard to believe shes just gone off on a jaunt
863801 if she is out there the further effort will locate her
863802 it had nothing to do with self defence it had nothing to do with the past it had everything to do with the business
863803 she finds time to complain about chaim kimel running the business
863804 i cant put my feelings into words but its just good its just good
863805 im happy that my brother is going to a better place and im sad because i didnt want to see him leave like this
863806 i had 48 hours to live when i got this god blessing even though it was her tragedy it was a blessing to me in that i got this liver and its thanks to antoine because he gave me the chance to live again
863807 we actually done what we set out to do we made it work and it feels good to give this to antoine and ms foster and her family
863808 were going to remain a family for the rest of our life as gods will well always be together well always be together
863809 they pulled up and said we cant find a spot
863810 this little cash bonus makes it a little easier to tolerate
863811 why dont you put it on the roof so we dont have to mess with it
863812 its like walking down a desert highway all by yourself
863813 if you cant get a satisfactory answer to any of these questions
863814 while the number of places where we can gain access to these treatments is expanding our notion of what beauty is isnt really expanding
863815 if there are a large number of desirable members of ones own sex available one may regard ones own market value as lower
863816 you think yes my partners fine but why do i have to settle for fine when there are just so many great people out there
863817 my pool includes the people i see in my everyday life
863818 i dont consciously think that the people i see through movies tv and magazines are artificial still seeing juliette binoche all the time registers in my brain
863819 our research suggests that our brains dont discount the women on the cover of cosmo even when subjects know these women are models subjects judge an average attractive woman as less desirable as a date after just having seen models
863820 when the concept of most beautiful people in the world tends to be the same for everyone it becomes more and more difficult to make more people happy
863821 if men found themselves being less attracted to their mates after being exposed to eight or 16 pictures in a half hour experiment what would be the effect if that happened day in day out for 20 years
863822 there appears to be something about male teachers who come in daily contact with teenaged women that increases the likelihood of being currently divorced or separated
863823 most real life divorces happen because one or the other spouse is dissatisfied with their mate
863824 the contrast effect can explain why men might unconsciously become dissatisfied they dont know why they suddenly find their middle aged wives not appealing anymore their exposure to young women might be a reason
863825 we want it we need it and our ancestors didnt have enough of it
863826 they were more concerned with starving as a result we have very hypersensitive detectors for it and modern technology packages it and sends us doses that are way too large for our health
863827 about 10 percent of my male patients tell me they want cosmetic surgery to ensure they arent overlooked when it comes time for a promotion
863828 more and more men are starting to feel the pressure to look attractive and youthful to increase their desirability and marketability in different areas of their lives including the work world
863829 advertising is a young persons profession and my chin was starting to bother me after the surgery i not only felt better but clients were telling me how good i looked
863830 to preach the gospel of cleanliness and economy and sanitation in every nook and corner of this city
863831 each laundry operator is instructed that besides wearing a snow white uniform they must be physically as well as morally clean when they handle the work of the customers
863832 a survey of the plant shows that over 95 percent of the laundrys owners are satisfied and not involved in any manner in the present difficulty
863833 i do not want to give the government the opportunity to take the focus off of its failings by engaging in cheap personality based politics
863834 i give an assurance today that whoever replaces me as leader of the parliamentary liberal party will have my 100 per cent support both on the record and off the record
863835 i do not want to give the government the opportunity to take the focus off of its failings by engaging in cheap personality based politics
863836 i give an assurance today that whoever replaces me as leader of the parliamentary liberal party will have my 100 per cent support both on the record and off the record
863837 we worked so hard and put so much into it a qc and barrister doing it pro bono without charge i havent had the guts to read the judgment its quite nauseating
863838 jag h rde tv skott och s g en man sitta p taket
863839 she rushed home on an early train feeling half insane from hearing his refrain but shes let down again
863840 a reflection of finding myself in the most romantic city in the world with a broken heart
863841 paris without his kiss she never thought the dream she bought would ever end like this paris without his eyes the city of lights which shine so bright wont sparkle through the light
863842 theres a fire on the horizon red and gold upon the beach it reminds me of your eyes in flames when my love was in reach
863843 a veces uno busca los temas y otras veces lo buscan a uno este tema me busc hace muchos a os y siempre supe que alg n d a lo contar a porque est basado en una experiencia personal dura
863844 un mundo donde deb a renunciar a las mujeres para toda la vida someterme a la mortificaci n corporal usar cilicio accesorio utilizado para provocar deliberadamente incomodidad o sufrimiento practicar las disciplinas que entre otras cosas consisten en que los s bados uno debe golpearse la espalda lo peor sin embargo no es lo relacionado con lo f sico sino las ideas que te meten acerca del infierno la forma en que te alejan de la familia cuando uno se da cuenta de que est dentro de algo tan brutal busca salir pero no es f cil encontrar la puerta de salida porque est n las amenazas del infierno de las enfermedades

863877 the environmental summit is a perfect way for us to get input and ideas from the community and elected officials

863880 the plan approved by the galveston county united board of health is designed to make measurable improvements in the health of galveston county
863881 unite for strength fully supports the recent sag board motion reasserting sags commitment to the core principle that it does not authorize our employers to make non union product under our contracts regardless of the medium or budget level we believe sag needs new leadership but we also agree with sags negotiators that actors need real gains from a new contract we agree that the original goals of our tv theatrical contract negotiators such as pay and mileage increases increased pension and health contributions residuals on new media protection from product integration abuses increased dvd residuals and preservation of force majeure protections represent gains all actors deserve unite for strength believes actors should have all those protections and more we support our families with sag earnings so getting the strongest deal for actors is our top priority and we know our current negotiating team feels the same way but because sag is alone at the bargaining table we have less leverage thats what unite for strength has pledged to fix

863930 lets get it clear the asio submission is very separate to the afp submission
863931 the problem is the material that weve provided to mr clarke a good proportion of it belongs to the united kingdom authorities and we dont have consent to release that
863932 i dont have consent to release that the organisation doesnt have consent to release it nor does mr clarke
863933 its nothing to do with the afp refusing to co operate with the inquiry
863934 but the redacted submission doesnt make sense without the other information being made available
863935 the afp would be far better off if we could publicly put our submission out into both the community and the media but we cant and its not within our control to do that or make that decision
863936 but it hasnt even finished yet weve only put our first witnesses before it

863942 i enjoy your blog but i think you need to look at scripture again the bible prohibits sexual immorality you are a teacher and a youth minister and you ought to be teaching young people about the importance of purity instead of encouraging them to defile themselves with sin please look at the attached passages and see the error of your ways

863945 though why you think anyone i represent has done anything to their faces is beyond me ha ha getting any artist besides joan rivers and kathy griffin to go on record about the subject is not easy of course one of the great quotes came from my gal cher who said in an interview if i want to put my tits on my back its my business whatever madonna has had done and i really dont know she looks truly amazing
863946 she was double dutch jump roping with a bunch of 18 year old girls and she outjumped them all i cant believe how fit she is

863951 theres an obligation on the environment agency to have to review these combined sewer overflows
863952 the problem is that the sewer system was designed for a climate which is different from the one we have got now
863953 because of the effects of climate change we are having a lot more rain
863954 the combined sewer overflows are starting to discharge a lot more often than they should their environmental impact is greatly increasing
863955 it amounts effectively to a licence to pollute because there are no restrictions on how much and how often these pipes can discharge
863956 what we want to see is these 3 500 pipes reviewed quickly so that if any of them are causing serious environmental problems it can be dealt with
863957 what we would like to see from the courts are greater fines handed out to water companies for pollution offences
863958 we have identified around 3 500 remaining temporary consents for cso discharges
863959 these are mainly for storm overflows that are operating without causing problems
863960 as youd expect our priority has always been to focus on those consents that are a problem
863961 we expect companies to be proactive in identifying intermittent discharges such as cso and emergency overflows from pumping stations that are at risk of becoming unsatisfactory
863962 pbwiki knows that budgets are going to be tight and we don t want a lack of funds to deter educators from using collaborative technologies like wikis with their students

863971 zomg you made my kid upset i was just letting him or her play troll
863972 weve neglected our rivers across the state for so long theres only one or two rivers in the state that are actually receiving their environmental flows at the moment
863973 everywhere else the environmental flows have been suspended and thats not a good situation to be in given that we know climate change will bring further pressures on those rivers
863974 never has this much sediment been released at once into such an active and hungry river
863975 marmot is certainly one of the best documented and most spectacular examples of dam removal in the sense that the river was allowed to process the material itself
863976 that is a very different river system h said the dam was built in 1913 to generate power but pge decided in 1999 that updating it to help declining fish runs would cost more than its energy value a question was whether pge should scoop out the sediment behind the dam or simply blow it up and let it go they blew it up just in case teams took wild fall chinook salmon from spawning areas to a hatchery where the fry were raised to be released into the river to keep the stock going the dam never blocked salmon passage a fish ladder allowed fish to get past the dam and some fish advocates were disappointed to see the dam go because it kept hatchery raised fish from mingling with wild salmon above the dam biologists could sort the fish as they entered the fish ladder allowing the wild fish upstream past the dam but keeping the hatchery fish out making the upper reaches effectively a sanctuary for wild fish but bill bakke executive director of the native fish society said the upside is that it lays more groundwork for a lot more dam removals which have value for our rivers

863980 the past two months have been great for righttrack which i feel is a very encouraging message for the whole training industry in the past learning and development organisations have had to fight tooth and nail for business in economic downturns and although it is still tough the main battle now is to ensure a clients training budget is maximised to get the greatest return on investment and not actually persuading the benefits of learning and development this is good news as it shows uk organisations understanding and appreciation of the benefits of good people management and pushes learning and development organisations to be creative productive and efficient when designing and implementing learning initiatives
863981 we were surprised to learn that such a high proportion of parents heavily rely on verbal agreements to ensure their childrens online activities are safe and legal
863982 as well as the possible safety issues there are financial implications to your childs internet activities with 48 downloading music online it would be easy to exceed your broadband fair usage limit leaving unsuspecting parents out of pocket at the end of the month
863983 weve never seen a rush of business like this and certainly not for utilities the response to the announcement has been swift and brutal
863984 this is the largest number of people switching utility providers in just two days since we started the froggybank co uk network four years ago we expect the switching to continue for some time
863985 the internet is a great communication tool and we realised at the outset a two way dialogue between the site and its users was required competitions are a great way to draw people in but we also want to encourage them to stick around for some informed opinion and to contribute their own experiences or frustrations concerning their use of the products

863995 following our initial myspace site trial for skins we wanted to build on that success and envisioned an online community site where we could engage excite and grow our e4 audience base building loyalty and from a commercial viewpoint creating new revenue streams and advertising potential
863996 this project was hugely exciting for many reasons and we rose to the technical and time challenges we faced the new site not only enables e4 programme fans to play an active and creative part in the communities around their favourite shows but also provides channel 4 with a flexible platform for future innovations in new media we look forward to our future working relationship with channel 4 supporting a major strategic initiative for 2009
863997 when choosing a partner to work with we needed a company who could demonstrate proven credentials in this particular type of project provide a robust development team and had the ability to innovate around the challenges we felt that thoughtworks met all of these requirements

864005 the inability to see clearly is a kind of misty beauty and by no means represents poor air quality
864006 in a bathhouse you cant see clearly thats called steam not pollution

864015 i certainly encourage married couples to pray for a good and happy sex life its a way for them to become closer to god
864016 at first people are usually slightly shocked but at the same time happily surprised
864017 if you believe in god then you believe god is involved in life in love marriage and in sex and sexuality it seems natural to talk about sex to remove taboos and the label of sinfulness says the monk who resides in a monastery of the order of friars minor capuchin in stalowa wola southern poland
864018 love between a married couple expressed in sex brings the human body closer to heaven the ecstasy in the joy of sexual intercourse can be likened to the joy of eternal life
864019 this is why the conjugal act allows spouses to begin to understand the sweetness of encountering god
864020 concentration on the physiological side of a sexual intercourse causes reduction of its most important elements
864021 when a woman is excited she wants to experience absolute pleasure as much as a man does

864060 normally you would have jumped with the horse the season before
864061 shes only 22 but she does get the chance to ride a lot of horses and shes always had a challenging one
864062 the best start she could have got was have two brilliant ponies to begin with
864063 they were absolute freaks which made her believe she could do anything
864064 if she was wrong on tonka hed take over when she got skylight he had to be ridden more but with the experience she had on tonka it was all a natural progression

864076 in my mind theyre both playing pretty well im pleased with the reads theyre making

864254 of course we welcome criticism but if critics say they care about theatre then they must be caretakers of theatre which means taking care of people in theatre
864255 from the true critic the theater generally gets what can only be interpreted as gross infidelity the reason being as shaw and every other major observer of drama makes abundantly clear and as our own sense of what is civilized should tell us that the critic cannot give his loyalty to man and institutions since he owes it to something a great deal more permanent he owes it of course to truth and to dramatic art

864261 i would say out of the three that gabe and melissa are vocally head and shoulders above shawn mayer just as singers and their stories are really really compelling
864262 i would be happy to produce either one of them
864263 my style of trying to critique her and mentor her just didnt mesh with her personality at all when im not being critical or being a mentor and were having a conversation i get along with her great i think as time has gone by she understands me a lot more and i understand her a lot more if she wins this show i have no doubt that shawn mayer and i can cut a hit record
864264 to have someone up there who is a mother of five and battling her weight issue and winning and succeeding and then with this gift of vocal ability you just dont see that every day
864265 being a mother of five is so representative of a lot of our listeners in country music and we dont have somebody like melissa in country music
864266 we have artists who are stars in country music who are mothers but they became that after they became famous they didnt show up on the scene with three or four kids i think the music you could record on her that speaks to her life and that would connect with millions and millions of americans is just mind boggling
864267 when i first saw gabe garcia he came in and it looked like he had just gotten off work
864268 i think during the show youve seen him go from this shy introverted guy on stage to where in the last couple of performances hes engaging the audience his confidence level is going up
864269 they dont just listen to it when theyre teenagers and then they get older and listen to something else
864270 they listen to it from the time theyre 5 years old until the day they die just like i have it tells you the country music audience is very discerning and you cannot pull the wool over their eyes they know the real mccoy when they see it

864275 i am confident in theo but its down to performances
864276 his first touch is much better he moves the ball quicker and his penetration his final ball is better
864277 his goal scoring potential is in him and i hope we get that out of him
864278 for now he is not a link player between midfield and the strikers like robin van persie can be and he is maybe at the moment a fraction short physically to play as a real target man
864279 he can play wide on the right wide on the left as well

864281 that the trial judge ought to have exercised his discretion to exclude the evidence of the alleged incident where the applicant stewart placed his fingers in the virtual complainants vagina and the events that immediately followed
864282 this is because on one hand the trial judge told members of the jury that they could not use the incriminatory utterances to consider whether the applicant committed the offence
864283 the offence was allegedly committed in 1993 and a report first made in 1999 in those circumstances we do not think that any useful purpose would be served by ordering a retrial accordingly the appeal is allowed and the sentence and conviction quashed

864287 those that remain unclaimed are put to sleep by a lethal injection we have a vet coming in two days a week and injecting the dogs sometimes we put down a dozen dogs at one time
864288 it has become terrible and it is not being dealt with by the government
864289 the problem is that these animals are breeding and the owners are dumping them they are surviving because we have so much fast food now and the dogs are eating from the garbage
864290 we also have a spay week every year where we subsidise the cost to 100 last year 450 dogs were spayed during the spay week
864291 if these owners act more responsibly we would not have so many animals on the roads dogs have three litters a year and if you know you dont want them then spay your dogs
864292 i collected 13 dogs from the streets which i care for at my home we have a vet which assists us and gives us discounted prices to attend to the dogs and we also have packages for people who have a lot of dogs and needs assistance
864293 a cool person who was a favourite with the women
864294 we go inside real early we have a curfew up here
864295 is only the youths in the area really causing chaos here fighting against each other and they just getting younger
864296 yes we always hear gunshots when church is in service but we are protected by god and doing gods work so we do not worry
864297 i turned around and headed to caroni when i got there i spoke to the paramedics and gave them a description of my brother i knew it was him that died
864298 he was a quiet straight forward person who spoke his mind and was good at what he did
864299 some of them are supported by government but the money they get is not enough to ensure that the homes are viable and equipped to maintain the children
864300 the way these homes are accepted in other countries cannot compare to trinidad and tobago the homes are not catered for by government in trinidad they have absolutely no interest in these homes
864301 it is not a problem for the police to take the children out of the homes but there is no where to go the orphanages are full and the police dont know where to turn
864302 because of this they run into situations where children are being abused by other children there is simply no supervision
864303 any organisation that can help these children is desperately needed
864304 that was not true my uncle died but we continued to live in the house for many years afterwards we did not move out until everyone got older and started getting married the house was not haunted the years i lived there were the happiest times ever
864305 the house definitely does not have 100 windows it was built with a lot of windows but not so many
864306 we did not like when people say those negative things because we knew they were not true
864307 i would go and ensure that the house was cleaned and everything was in order but deep in my heart i knew that i wanted to give my childhood home to charity and when i heard about the blessed mother teresas missionaries of charity i decided to talk to the sisters about converting the house into a home for children
864308 i hope the home would come into the community and change things around i want to have a better place for the next generation to grow up the community needs to be cleansed from all the drugs and crime
864309 we cannot take in too many children because this is a lifetime commitment we want these children to go to school or learn a trade
864310 and for the first time we have a nun from the caribbean with us and she is settling with the other sisters this sister is on her first assignment and we are happy to have her here
864311 so far a bank has donated 1 million and we need 1 8 million to begin construction
864312 we do not have enough money to feed the number of persons sent to us
864313 the sfa covers the entire range of bilateral relations including economic cultural diplomatic etc the sofa covers military cooperation
864314 to give some context to the issue over the years the ministry has made discreet efforts to deal with the challenge of waste and waste disposal
864315 those efforts have not borne fruit in the way that we would have liked at this time in the context of vision 2020 the ministry has developed a draft policy on municipal solid waste management through a consultative process
864316 this has been developed with a view towards implementing an integrated waste resource management system in trinidad and tobago
864317 one of the key indicators of any nation seeking developed country status is how comprehensively it treats with waste
864318 it is interesting to note that some 20 years ago nova scotia was in a similar position as trinidad and tobago
864319 by that we mean that they recognised that they were running out of land area for land fills and in the absence of proper policies and systems nova scotia ran the risk of exposing itself to environmental degradation
864320 now they are world leaders in waste resource management trinidad and tobago has the opportunity to benefit from the fact that our partners in nova scotia have already gone through the process and they possess the expertise and the experience in the field of waste resource management
864321 the government of trinidad and tobago through the ministry of local government is following through on the nova scotia model given the similarities in demographics and population numbers with this country
864322 simply put the mou allows for our partners from nova scotia to act as project managers assisting the ministry of local government in implementation
864323 admittedly the current municipal solid waste management policy which we have developed does have some gaps which novia scotia will assist in rectifying through a comprehensive review analysis of the municipal solid waste management mswm policy as well as the tobago house of assembly model they nova scotia will then assist us in charting the way forward in collaboration with our local stakeholders
864324 a sound system of accountability is being developed to ensure that both parties conform to its provisions
864325 there are essentially two levels involved in the project the management and the technical
864326 i have held numerous discussions with works and transport minister colm imbert and his predecessor franklin khan over the integrity of this bridge now more than 50 years old and which has had very little work done on it recently
864327 and the traffic and the amount of weight this bridge is carrying has increased by ten fold since then
864328 the works ministry visited the bridge and agreed it was in need of attention
864329 it is important to import cattle to revive the industry
864330 death is more universal than life everyone dies but not everyone lives
864331 there are many children who cannot afford to pay travelling expenses and we try to assist them pupils who cannot afford glasses and those who need to have operations are also assisted through the fund
864332 we dont go around begging for donations our members donate money and items whenever we have anything
864333 i heard the rumours but when i asked about them i was told since a retaining wall was built it dont flood here again
864334 all here was under water my wardrobe gone through the crib was floating
864335 when he called in it sounded like it was no big thing but when they saw the damage they were like why didnt you tell us
864336 i was really shocked im not really a guy like to get other people involved in my business but for them to come through like this for me it was really good
864337 when it rains in the night i cant sleep it gets me nervous
864338 not because i want to get anyone in trouble but because this was a miracle and i want people to know that you dont often get second chances so dont waste the short life we all have
864339 we will do a full investigation to determine the circumstances surrounding this
864340 if i pray for anything else it will be for her forgiveness because i love my wife and child
864341 and he told me he wished i was dead and to leave everyone alone
864342 i was not thinking right so much stress i end up going to a shop and buying a bottle of gramaxone next door was a bar i bought a soft drink to chase it with and finish the bottle
864343 i was hooked up with needles and tubes i was in so much pain i could not move swollen from the poison and the beating
864344 the next thing i knew was i wrapped in a sheet with blood on it two bodies on the same trolley i was in the middle
864345 this fella who is not even a close friend told me later that he could not believe i was dead so when the person pushing the trolley went to close the door he pulled the zip and opened the sheet and saw me blinking
864346 i opened my eyes when i saw the light that was all i could do i could not move my body the mortuary man chase after my friend and then come back to zip me back up then he see me blinking
864347 the processes involved in engineering are crucial and should be known
864348 one must be responsible of ones actions and there are always consequences for what we do it is not just a lesson for cricket but a lesson for life
864349 this action will help trinidad and tobago cricket it will help players understand that cricket is a serious business and that indiscipline will not be tolerated at any level of the sport this is the message that will permeate into all levels of trinidad and tobago cricket
864350 it was unfortunate that we had to send them home and we took no pleasure in such actions but we had team meetings we decided that this had to be done
864351 having the under 17s here was incidental but after coming into the team they performed beyond expectations
864352 and they showed real character after all the changes they went through
864353 all the things going on in the sidelines may have affected other guys in a negative way but what these guys did was truly commendable
864354 for the guys who remained the kind of character they showed and the seamless transition of the under 17s into the squad is really a testament of their mental strength
864355 the fact that they the under 17s could keep focused on the task at hand demonstrates a lot about their mental development
864356 rickson maniram was the best wicket keeper in the tournament
864357 sachin boodram bowled very well and yannick ottley was outstanding but it was kissoondath magram who really stood out in the final
864358 magram was the person who bowled the last over they needed 11 runs and for the 15 year old to bowl the last over and win the game for us was exceptional
864359 and before the match started he said that he knew which team was going to win
864360 this a reflection of all the t amp t teams
864361 always ready to play and willing to go all the way
864362 kenwynes having an operation on monday and well know the exact damage in 24 hours so its fingers crossed
864363 well know one way or another so ill be saying a few prayers
864364 ive said for the last week or two were hopeful of two or three players coming on board
864365 we have two or three weeks to play with but dont want to get backed into a corner at the end of august
864366 such programmes are not only about the winners but they strive to raise the level of all our participants so that they too will shine in times
864367 a race had been freed but a society has not been formed
864368 our countrys fortuitous location between north and south america will assist in promoting a core business that consists of a regional captive market in other words significant amounts of foreign funds will unquestionably be encouraged to flow through our ifc as a convenient regional alternative to new york and miami there are other ifcs in the caribbean including the bahamas bermudas and the cayman islands but none are of the scale planned for the ttifc and neither is the ttifc going to be a tax haven it will not be involved in traditional off shore banking activities
864369 foreign earnings from the captive market will afford trinidad and tobago the opportunity to determine how the funds are managed
864370 the establishment of the ttifc will complete trinidad and tobagos arrival on the grand stage of the international financial world and firmly entrench on the national psyche the ideals of governments conceptual and practical commitment to economic diversification which will benefit future generations
864371 i wish i could see the king of rock and roll mr elvis presley alive once again
864372 i wish i could see dream theater if only they came to singapore
864373 i wish i could be in the crowd if megadeth came it would be awesome
864374 nats just trying to create some bullshit reflection because he has nothing interesting to write
864375 no need go church la you you metalhead go church for what
864376 the maxi stopped near cross crossing and two police officers who were nearby came into the bus
864377 one of these officers was in uniform the other was in plain clothes they did not ask any questions upon entering the maxi they grabbed me and took me to the front of the maxi when i was grabbed i was grabbed from behind so i did not see who was holding me i attempted to shake the person off
864378 for some reason i still do not understand why the police handcuffed me and took me off the maxi they put me in a police vehicle and i was in some great pain because of an injury to my hand
864379 i recall my mother and brothers trying to tell the police that i didnt do anything but they refused to listen
864380 my mother asked him name called how it was damaged and he replied that he was not seeing properly with them but that he will let us all go if she paid him 2 000
864381 no other police officers were present my mother agreed to pay the money but told the officer that she did not have it now he told my mother and myself that he was going to make a paper for my mother to sign
864382 this morning i was very nervous but i focused on my game and now i won so i am happy
864383 i was planning to play in japan but maybe now i change my plans and play in america
864384 there are so many and they are playing so good so consistent
864385 found that 81 percent of political science professors consider themselves liberal and just 2 percent as conservative
864386 two percent with professors dripping over barack obama and conservative ideas seldom taught in the classroom its no surprise that he is a favorite on campus
864387 ronald reagan captured 59 percent of the youth vote in 1984
864388 young people are thirsty for conservative ideas and were happy to quench that thirst
864389 barack obama has the same liberal ideas that fail every time they are instituted
864390 we need to hear about the gas shortages of jimmy carter the high inflation the confiscatory taxes and the weak national security an obama presidency will be carter redux
864391 the national youth turnout rate rose from nine percent in the 2000 primaries to 17 percent in the 2008 primaries
864392 in swing states with more youthful populations including virginia colorado and nevada the youth vote could easily play a monumental role
864393 young people crave choice and services that big government can never provide so they should be easy constituents for the gop
864394 drilling in alaska has no more of a tie to rv plant closures than it does to the mortgage crisis
864395 increased the cost of exploration and production of domestic oil
864396 prohibit ed the extraction of nearly 61 billion barrels of american oil
864397 we need to push into these underserved markets as much as we can
864398 we must take responsible steps to ensure our financial and housing markets are sound but the democrats bill represents a multi billion dollar bailout for scam artists and speculative lenders at the expense of american taxpayers
864399 obamas support among working hard working americans white americans is weakening again
864400 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
864401 not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
864402 las vegas isnt my scene and i aint driving that far unless i have to
864403 im very happy as a footballer a lot of clubs will look for you but this club is one of the biggest in the world there are lots of young players and i have a big chance to have a good career at this club
864404 when there is a lot of speculation they the fans believe what they read in the newspapers the most important thing is to keep on enjoying your football
864405 some of the fans will love you and some will hate you but im in a good position and most fans love me for me what happened this summer is over
864406 nosotros gannon y leal continuamos am ndonos el fue es y siempre ser mi mejor amigo
864407 lance y sebastian son muy abiertos el uno con el otro y no tiene secretos
864408 ten a mucho miedo de arruinar las carreras de mis mejores amigos por nsync fui ignorante al pensar que si lo revelaba toda nuestra vida se aruinar a y el grupo llegar a a su fin porque todo el mundo nos odiar a
864409 pero ahora veo lo est pido que fui y deseo volver atr s para ser capaz de decirle a todo el mundo quien era realmente pienso que todo hubiera estado bien y que hubiera ayudado a mucha gente mis fans siempre estuvieron conmigo y ellos no han cambiado
864410 where is the broom no not the broom where is the one to clean the floor with
864411 this is where you are for eternity there is a circle of your kind over there doing rituals at this moment the fishing is great and many berries to pick
864412 oh thats the christians for ya they wouldnt have it any other way
864413 how can people not believe in something bigger than themselves
864414 i am not ashamed of the gospel because it is the power of god for the salvation of everyone who believes
864415 compared with the continuing writedowns at citigroup and merrill lynch chinese banks are definitely winning the financial medals said shao chingxiao managing partner of smc china fund in shanghai
864416 and that kids is the story of how i met your mother
864417 it has not been done because we have not had time to do it were making this a higher priority to get it done than it has been in the past
864418 some of them appear to have violations that would not allow their drivers to drive
864419 lets say you were out late downtown and you called a cab you certainly dont want to get picked up by someone who would be a threat to yourself
864420 i think we need to review who is driving we certainly dont want anybody to get hurt or taken advantage of
864421 they paid one year and they asked us to reconsider the rates and so the city did
864422 they were originally proposed because they were in line with industry standards
864423 i was very very surprised that this time the city just did everything behind our back
864424 they call it a fee but to us its a tax without representation
864425 i dont think the legislature has really demonstrated a commitment to public education and thats the big problem
864426 the state is making all these efforts toward privatization which divert funding from traditional public schools to private schools and religious schools
864427 the present fte funding is a fair way to pay for schools but it is not adequate the way it is because of these cutbacks
864428 here in alachua county where property values are lower one mill raises 450 per student but in monroe county one mill raises 3 000 per student the state does not take property taxes into account and so different districts wind up generating different amounts and that is clearly not equitable
864429 we need to look at all kinds of revenue sources to increase our funding
864430 a lot of it is because of the age of the schools
864431 but we can still work to make things more equitable because the facilities are important
864432 everything from television and radio and print and all that to organizing volunteers to go door to door
864433 participating in every aspect of political campaigns and that includes fundraising
864434 we want to be in a place where candidates understand that they cant ignore latinos
864435 the problem of childhood obesity is reaching epidemic levels and florida is no exception
864436 we have received a number of requests from families and physicians regarding lifestyle interventions for children who are overweight or obese
864437 i want to take it from where we are now using inmates to assist county facilities and formalize the process
864438 we can develop an actual certification program the benefit is i would have five or six additional hands who could save that labor cost once they are ready to leave the jail we would be willing to stand behind them and issue them a certificate of completion we could develop a pool of contractors who would hire them
864439 the recidivism is so high and you have to use every avenue to try to get people out of the jail some of them are in a cycle and it is really tough
864440 if they do this they can come out of the jail and say that theyve done it for two years and would now like to work for a builder we could tell the builder that the guy worked for two years and we didnt have a problem
864441 i want to grow it to not for profit locations
864442 it has definitely been working well we started out slow to make sure we had the supervision down its worked beautifully
864443 hello my name is alex i am a professional cryptozoological pseudo scientific assemblage artist and illustrator i create items and objects from a past that wasnt to fashion the things you wish existed in forgotten attics or secret rooms dust covered relics of a time when the world was the same but not quite when creatures that defy our senses stalked the crevices of forgotten continents an age of wonder and intrigue of fear and trepidation
864444 the things you wish existed in forgotten attics or secret rooms
864445 november 21st 1948 a young girl died in her sleep at the st augustus orphanage in high wycombe england as her mortal essence was carefully lifted from her body her friend eloise who lay in the bed beside her witnessed something that she would carry with her quite literally for the rest of her life an entity stood over the corpse of the child not quite there a wisp of something not evil not malign but almost passive as it cradled the non corporeal vestiges of her friend eloise saw something tumbled to the floor she attempted to cry out but her words were silenced and as if what she has seen had never happened her friend and the presence were gone at the foot of the bed seemingly undamaged but very old was a small black box the box was unlocked and within was a letter addressed to whom it may concern it read if this box is found then i have unfortunately misplaced it please keep it safe until we next meet yours d the girl kept it with her until she was 86 upon her death bed she held it in her arms awaiting his return her final days were not in fear but anticipation
864446 we never know when she could have to have another valve replaced
864447 every time i get a session done i just feel like like im on clouds or something like im free or something
864448 sometimes i can feel shifts or moves and stuff but other times not really but it feels good
864449 i think youll find that no plan covers this procedure its highly likely
864450 weve classified it as investigational and experimental we look at a couple of things the literature is important anything thats been recognized in a peer reviewed journal
864451 we still are traveling every two weeks for her to meet with dr upledger
864452 shes really tight across her lower back and hes totally been focused on loosening up all of the tension thats what helped her having bowel movements on her own
864453 im a parent and if i had a kid that was stuck between a rock and a hard place and no conventional methods would work i would look to alternative methods
864454 if it feels good great but as a medical provider show me the medical results proof is not subjective
864455 this therapy is doing exactly what the american medical association described it should do
864456 it increases pain free motion increases extensibility of her tissues and to help the patient return to normal functional activities she can live with a 70 degree curve now
864457 craniosacral therapy is about as ridiculous and bogus as it could get
864458 because the idea behind it is that by putting the hand on a persons head that you can move the plates in the skull thats absurd its not supported by medicine
864459 this game was important for anelka but more important for us the fans the coach and the other players who will have more confidence in him
864460 he was playing against a big club and to get four goals against milan for his confidence it is fantastic
864461 comparing approaches to promotion between company x and company y should company x adopt different promotional strategies

864464 will talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
864465 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
864466 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
864467 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy
864468 having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
864469 thank you for not asking me to be that sad for you
864470 after the reported 14 million charity payout to parents angelina jolie and brad pitt maybe their little one knox will become known as fort knox he and his twin sister vivienne sure look cute and a half on the cover of people magazine the issue hits newsstands tom orrow but you can catch a tease of the 19 page spread here
864471 internationally hello magazine secured the rights and has a 17 page spread coming tomorrow as well
864472 chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time
864473 we got interested in caspians when we were looking for a small horse or pony for our daughter anne marie to ride and we liked what we heard about the temperament of this breed
864474 since no one appears to have paid any attention to them in the last 1 000 years they have neither been improved nor segregated
864475 i really like them because they are sweet and when they are crossbred they can be used for eventing and almost everything else they are so versatile
864476 well of course my mentality going into every single practice whoever im going against i feel as if nobody can guard me
864477 if you dont have that mentality youre already setting yourself up for failure
864478 ive just been seeing him make plays thats all ive been seeing
864479 i saw that last pass coming and i was like no no no because he was flying
864480 he was rolling down the middle of the field but hes doing a great job man hes got everyone excited
864481 i think that the play that he scored on is a really good look on how a tight end can affect the defense
864482 deep down the middle of the field he gets over the top catches it you miss one tackle and you go the distance
864483 he went one on one with a safety abram elam for us thats a pretty good matchup when youve got dustin keller running down the middle of the field i just threw that to an area and let him go get it

864486 is the living memory of a nation it sustains within itself and safeguards a nations bygone history
864487 but woe to that nation whose literature is cut short by the intrusion of force
864488 the greatest and most powerful single indictment of a political regime ever to be leveled in modern times
864489 a lot of these guys are hard working guys with good jobs this is their hobby
864490 everybody comes from all over the entire u s its fun to travel and meet everyone again each year
864491 you would have seen a sight you would never have seen before there were bikes as far as you can see
864492 i would not be surprised if we saw the court of appeals move more quickly than usual because this is about retrying a public figure in a high profile case in which the judge has attempted to set a fast pace to get to retrial
864493 we ask our judges to evaluate the questions in front of them not as a political matter but strictly on legal grounds
864494 its possible that in the future pittsburgh hospitals could get involved
864495 given the time line to get the assessment in place by 2009 it made sense to focus on one jurisdiction
864496 have demonstrated it can be done and increase medical assistance payments to hospitals
864497 this is an accepted practice and brings federal dollars to strengthen the overall health care system
864498 everything is a blur right now and we dont know anything for sure
864499 but i heard there were five casualties overall one interpreter and the other four were soldiers
864500 he knew of those guys but he didnt know them
864501 his main goal since seventh grade was that he wanted to go to west point and he knew what it took to get there
864502 he was an outstanding student always dedicated to his school work but he also knew how to have fun he was an a plus guy
864503 he was a great kid a perfect gentleman everyone got along with him he always found a way to make you laugh
864504 he was among the best and the brightest and he went on to pursue his dream attending west point
864505 its about tackling housing rehabilitation one neighborhood at a time
864506 i grew up in these neighborhoods and the housing revitalization that we see happening in braddock and much of the mon valley is the truest form of change i have seen in many years
864507 there has been little or no investment of this kind in the mon valley for years and we now see that people dont want to leave these communities if they have good and affordable housing
864508 we are beginning to see what we have been talking about for years
864509 the success of what we do depends on the strength of the community groups we work with and their commitment to identifying neighborhoods where we could make an impact
864510 what we have found is that there are many nice houses in all of these neighborhoods but people often cant see that because of all the blight around them
864511 we try to tackle such neighborhoods with expansive projects like a 25 house construction that can actually change the look of a neighborhood
864512 we dont want the blight to spread many times we see neighborhoods which have pretty nice houses but then a few abandoned properties in the same area have the capacity to create other abandoned properties and absentee landlords
864513 what we see mvi doing in the mon valley is a model of what we want to see happening in other parts of the state
864514 it is a model of housing redevelopment that i hope places like philadelphia lancaster reading harrisburg and york will adopt
864515 for the past 20 years shed see a scrap piece of fabric and shed say but its beautiful
864516 she spent her entire life doing menial jobs and raising us she was an art teacher for a while and she taught home crafts to patients at a nursing home
864517 everything was really stacked against us and we could have strayed but we didnt all four kids went through college she lived to serve us she didnt have much of a life except raising her kids and her grandkids
864518 when were done with the construction we expect the majority to be sold were getting good prices which is tough to do in a market like this
864519 weve really seen a big difference with the tax abatement its been a huge attraction for us
864520 its hard to make light of that especially given that youre going to have to spend a minimum of 300 000 to go into the building
864521 i think theyve got their hands full trying to make these things happen
864522 the pace of trying to get office or retail tenants into town can be fairly lengthy
864523 were being pretty picky about who we bring in we want the right use we dont want to fill it up we want it to be something unique
864524 youre looking for the parkway its easy just go down a few blocks to where the isalys used to be and turn left
864525 hey coach take that stinkin cornerback outta the game before he gives up another td and i puke up my nachos
864526 as far as i can see so far it looks beautiful
864527 and by day 365 well have a whole team of people who will have been trained by one of the best in the field
864528 we dont want to do things twice we want to be efficient consistent and provide high quality for the county
864529 i agree with them we dont want backlogs we want to get this resolved which is why were building a state of the art crime lab
864530 one thing everyone agrees on is we have to deal with the backlog
864531 the idea is to get it done as soon as possible
864532 its challenging and fun and now its even better because it doesnt have a bureaucracy behind it we have the solution but like anything else it requires funding the concept is going to work
864533 weve had four matches already and got warrants on prints we submitted to mr reutzel that wouldnt even have gotten close to being looked at by the county crime lab its fantastic
864534 its a shame this had to happen we already have a crime lab so why does someone have to reinvent the wheel the wheels been there for years but it needs greased and taken care of
864535 politicians talk about mergers and promises and negotiations involving municipal police departments and while theyre deciding this the police are going out day to day and servicing their communities we just pulled together to try to provide a solution
864536 this is definitely the way to go were very happy
864537 if we could address 5 percent of our worst cases we could solve 80 percent of our problem
864538 we try to identify the offenders but firing someone is incredibly difficult and if theyre union members those people are usually brought back under arbitration
864539 we do not take exception to people off for legitimate reasons but there are trends of chronic intermittent absences especially in certain job classifications
864540 its easy to plan service for someone whos on vacation or whos going to be off for a month or two but not for someone who calls off every other friday or after every steelers game
864541 its like an iceberg you cut out the 2 to 3 percent of abusers and another 2 to 3 percent pop up
864542 do you add to the extra board employees do you throw more overtime out there or do you risk service disruptions
864543 keep in mind that we are not out to condemn the 90 percent of hard working employees nor are we trying to beat up on people with cancer or babies or other situations where they really do need the fmla its the minority of abusers who complicate our life year after year
864544 unforeseen intermittent fmla leave is not only having a negative impact upon our operations but also upon our customers the general public the current provisions in the law for intermittent leave present a significant burden to schedule driven operations
864545 ive seen employees whose fmla conditions flare up on each and every holiday or even for the entire week of the holiday this further demoralizes other workers
864546 if the department of labor would define serious health condition more clearly human relations professionals would not have to debate whether the flu the common cold or an earache is covered
864547 miss monday knowing they can work four hours of overtime tuesday and make up most of their pay and oddly enough paying overtime when necessary and justified is cheaper than adding people to the payroll
864548 if we got the 40 hour rule i bet wed see those chronic absenteeism numbers drop like a rock
864549 one of the union responses is that we need to add more people to fill in for vacancies how about if we just got people in those positions to come to work
864550 the extra board has been cut in half from when i started in 1977
864551 there were always people available for whatever happened to ensure that citizens had no disruption of service the problem is they dont know how to manage they want to blame it on the easiest target the union its always the union

864575 we are heartened that all parties involved in the discussion have expressed a desire to respect each others positions all that remains is to confirm our documented intentions to sign the agreement which will regulate exactly all the nuances including those related to the transfers of players and the mutual respect of contracts
864576 this league will be for the best players between the ages of 17 and 20
864577 using the currently existing farm teams of the khl clubs which actually are junior teams we have the basis for the possible formation of a junior league

864581 understanding the evolution of fangs sheds light on how snakes colonised new environments or adapted to feed on new prey
864582 the evolution of these unique adaptations has been unravelled for the first time
864583 the true innovation in venom delivery came with the development of hollow syringe fangs to deliver the venom under high pressure
864584 the origin and evolution of the snake venom system has long been an area of great controversy and acrimonious debate it has only become recently evident that venom is a basal characteristic of the advanced snakes
864585 such innovations allowed the snakes to envenomate new prey items such as being able to efficiently get past the thick fur of mammals or puncture the hard scales of other snakes
864586 we showed that front fangs actually start their development in the rear end of the upper jaw and are strikingly similar in structure to rear fangs found in the snakes with less specialised venom delivery teeth but that front fanged lineage has developed its own trick
864587 as the venom system is an intricate combined system a better understanding of one part facilitates the study of the other components so the implications of this study go well beyond being a clever dental exam
864588 it is a disgrace that in new zealand men have no right at all to get a simple dna test to confirm whether they are the father or not
864589 presently if the mother says no to a dna test then the man and child are left in the dark as to whether they are in fact related
864590 the british situation is comparable to here and the numbers are simply staggering in one in five cases of disputed parentage the wrong father has been fingered but in new zealand they have no right to clear their name
864591 this means that thousands of new zealand kids out there have no idea who their biological father is and that thousands of men are paying tens of thousands of dollars to raise children that are not even theirs
864592 all this could be fixed if the government introduced dna testing in cases of disputed parentage it is easy it is accurate and it simply removes the cloak of uncertainty that surrounds so many father child relationships

864631 it will send a positive signal to everyone that the country is heading towards free and fair polls in the third week of december this year the voting also gives us the chance to see how the digital voter list works
864632 at least two candidates have been arrested for paying money to voters
864633 despite all the government talk of finding new leaders and clean candidates the polls have become a showdown between the two main parties and their disgruntled leaders
864634 the government has managed to clean up the electoral process by framing new rules and compiling digital voter lists but it has failed to create conditions for relatively clean efficient and visionary candidates

864638 we didnt want to live right on the corner we wanted to be set back a little in the neighborhood
864639 if it was right by a gas station wed notice there were a lot of burglaries and we wouldnt even go look at it

864644 you have to make sure your pictures are of good quality and done when the listing is put in you have a short window of time and have to really give them a feel for that house in seconds
864645 youve got to keep up with how people use technology such as cell phones and personal digital devices such as blackberrys so they can react with whatever information you have
864646 there were houses not in areas where potential buyers were searching but they saw the interiors of the rooms and one of them just got accepted because of that
864647 its not just going to show part of the picture it will be sized to the screen

864679 my job is to play the role of a mccbs anchor and to edit mccains responses to questions
864680 i trim out the more incoherent material so that what the public sees makes some sort of demented sense
864681 sometimes this requires me to match the answer to one question with another question for example mccain frequently gets names dates and geography wrong as in the case of the anbar awakening but thats o k fixing his errors is what i get paid for
864682 legally katie is employed by the mccbs network so her salary does not count as a campaign expense
864683 she can interview him for mccbs and then improve his answers so the public thinks hes coherent and it doesnt cost us a dime
864684 if mccain ceased to be a viable candidate we would lose a lot of advertising revenue by propping him up for the next few months our profits are assured

864687 upon direction from the u s attorneys office in the district of columbia asd will not be able to move funds into company accounts or out of them we will work to resolve this problem and return to normal operation as soon as we are permitted to do so
864688 i went to an asd meeting last thursday night it was my first introduction to this company in the company presentation it was said that 100 000 people are current members membership fees are 100 00 per month per member that equates to revenue to the company of 120 million per year
864689 asd adds 0 25 to every dollar invested and pays back to the account 1 per day for a maximum of 125 in other words if you buy an ad packet for 1000 they add 250 to it and your account receives 12 50 for 125 days or about 4 months for a total of 1562 50
864690 if the 100 000 members were in it for only 1 000 asd would be paying out a cool 169 million per year
864691 so asd has got to come up with multiple billions per year to pay these members
864692 how do they do it well when asked that question asd responded by saying that it sells advertising to corporations plus member dues of 120 million per year i dont think so i find it highly unlikely that they are covering their costs this way
864693 no less an investment contract merely because the investor contributes some effort as well as money to get into it
864694 just has sic meetings in dc and met with the president and vice president and received some honors in relationship to what asd is all about
864695 good piece david im proud of you the article was terrific i know someone who invested 10 thousand she says she has gotten 4 thousand back and could have gotten more had she not reinvested whatever the hell that means asd could be the greatest thing since peas in a can but without full disclosure how can anyone know i suspect that perhaps very few people have actually received more than 100 on their asd investments the whole idea of ponzi schemes is to keep everyone in a form of suspended animation selling others and reinvesting while waiting for his or her own ship to come in if this is a ponzi and i hope it is not its among the most clever ive seen
864696 youve got to have people who can do the job coming off the bench
864697 reeds certainly done that and so have a few others it gives you some favorable matchups at least we can counter some moves that the other manager makes
864698 thats probably the best moment for me on a baseball field
864699 ive never had a curtain call before ive always wondered when ive seen rammy go out there and d lee go out there when they hit big home runs what it would be like to have a curtain call
864700 actually it was my idea to come out i told catcher geo soto that i might throw 1 more after i got out of that fifth inning
864701 geo went to lou and lou came to me and said do you think you can go one more i said yeah
864702 but the day was getting longer and lou said you know what ive got samardzija warming up just go out there and throw some warm up pitches and ill make the change
864703 well it was just a bad day or bad timing
864704 yes mom my friends are coming over from 2 00 3 00 to have our first meeting
864705 hmm this looks yummy i wonder who it is and what they have here
864706 i cant remember a year when there were 10 guys in the first or second round who were legitimate left tackle prospects
864707 hes going to go against the top pass rushers week in and week out for 16 weeks and hopefully more
864708 from an assignment standpoint its maybe not the most technical position but from a technique and ability standpoint it is thats the challenge
864709 of all the rookies you mentioned we thought he needed a little more seasoning
864710 if were able to run better thats less times he has to pass set less third and longs were in less obvious pass situations and thats where typically talented or not a young player gets exposed
864711 hes a top athlete and a very good fit in that offense
864712 theres a lot of movement and cutting back for a team like denver or houston hes a home run
864713 hes a slam dunk at least to be a good solid left tackle
864714 will he be a pro bowler i doubt it at right tackle i think hed be a superstar
864715 i think he was the most athletic tackle in the draft by far
864716 in their scheme hell be a superstar you just dont find kids with his size and his feet
864717 he probably needs to improve as a run blocker but i think thats easier for a young player to do than to improve pass blocking
864718 hes not a fiery competitive kid he got beat because he stopped blocking at times
864719 they may as well throw him out there with rookie qb matt ryan
864720 im a 25 year veteran of the u s congress and ive never seen anything like this
864721 you are so difficult i i dont believe it why are you like that ughhhhh
864722 you killed my love my true love my only love you sick sadistic fuck kill me i have nothing left to live for

864830 these new figures should bring new focus to our efforts to address aids and hiv here at home
864831 combating hiv aids also demands closing the gaps in opportunity that exist in our society so that we can strengthen our public health we must also overcome the stigma that surrounds hiv aids a stigma that is too often tied to homophobia
864832 we need to encourage folks to get tested and accelerate hiv aids research toward an effective cure because we have a moral obligation to join together to meet this challenge and to do so with the urgency this epidemic demands
864833 work closely with non profit government and private sector stakeholders to continue the fight against hiv aids
864834 by focusing efforts on reducing drug costs through greater market competition promoting prevention efforts encouraging testing targeting communities with high infection rates strengthening research and reducing disparities through effective public outreach we as a nation can make great progress in fighting hiv aids
864835 these data which are based on new laboratory technology developed by cdc provide the clearest picture to date of the us hiv epidemic and unfortunately we are far from winning the battle against this preventable disease
864836 we as a nation have to come together to focus our efforts on expanding the prevention programs we know are effective

864872 mario west after being a walk on at georgia tech and playing a full four years went undrafted but was picked up by the atlanta hawks in the summer he may not have any sort of scoring ability however his hustle on defense has kept him around since he only plays a handful of minutes a game he comes in with a lot of energy and is never afraid to guard big names on the other team its either him or zaza pachulia who definitely deserves every award that can be handed out to a person
864873 for the charlotte bobcats who have struggled for wins in their short existence the floor burn nominee would have to be now second year forward jared dudley he does not have anything resembling jump out of the gym athleticism but he is a heady smart player making the most out of his limited tools and just being in the right place at the right time for rebounds putbacks and steals
864874 west was with the team only for the last two months of the season and the playoffs but it took him less time than that to earn the fans appreciation he is sort of a jack of all trades master of none hell fill any role on the court asked of him and hell give 100 effort in all of them he plays tremendously hard on defense and has a knack for coming up with a huge block when you least expect it but most need it or will knock the ball away to create a breakaway situation or will snag a key rebound the guy does it all and gives nothing but effort in the process
864875 if you want a nice guy to go about his business like a mild mannered man you can look past jason maxiell
864876 foster simply goes to work whether hes starting or coming off the bench the consistent effort remains the same he is the king of resuscitating possessions by scrapping his way to a rebound that is up for grabs and at least batting it out to a teammate to keep it alive for the pacers
864877 after coming up through the flintstones system of michigan state basketball it took charlie bell a few years to catch on in the nba following several stints in europe bell earned his way into the big show with a defensive mind set similar to former journeyman two guard bruce bowen nowadays bell can be found locking down opposing teams slasher and bringing an undeniable sense of toughness to the milwaukee bucks
864878 his name is known around the league but only those who have been paying attention understand the amount of blood sweat and well more sweat that lee leaves on the court every night the man makes every second count
864879 reggie evans gained mainstream attention when he grabbed chris kamans family jewels while playing for the denver nuggets in the 2006 07 season now thats doing the dirty work evans is a guy who makes a living on hustle he has very little actual basketball talent but is always among the leaders in rebounds per minute at times he was the best player on the floor in the sixers pistons playoff series this year shocking but true when hes on his game hes a menace
864880 the 11 year veteran had been the backup point guard for the washington wizards for two years when gilbert arenas went down with a bum knee antonio daniels stepped in and started a career high 63 games in those games he averaged eight points four assists and closely guarded the other teams point guard daniels led the wizards to the first round of the playoffs and even when arenas came back he still retained the point guard duties and often times ran the team more efficiently
864881 a brief d leaguer who wasnt thought to amount to much of anything has become a pivotal part of the mavs future hes undersized but plays in the paint not incredibly athletic but outworks other guys and plays with a huge chip on his shoulder as dallas moves forward in trying to eliminate their finesse team moniker bass is going to be a huge part of that
864882 few players would be able to parlay a season in which they scored just 6 6 points per game and pulled down 3 9 rebounds a night into a new four year 17 million contract then again few players alive play with the energy heart and determination turiaf does the free spirited reserve rebounds defends and blocks shots but it is his relentless passion for the game that sees him outclass all other hustle players
864883 fazekas is probably different than many of the candidates for the floor burn tournament its not that he doesnt hustle per se but he is so incredibly unathletic that everything he does even diving on the floor looks awkward and slow but the guy just gets stuff done hes the guy when youre playing pick up basketball whose team keeps winning and you just cant figure out why even after his team has held the court for two hours and hes led them in scoring every single game you still think he stinks and youre better than he is well youre not hes better than you are because hes just a baller hes got incredible hands goofy long arms an array of junky moves around the basket a nice touch out to 20 feet and he knows how to get the ball in the hoop
864884 why lowry in memphis we call him the bulldog for his gritty man to man defense ability to grab boards and knack for getting to the line he was 27th in the nba in steals per 48 minutes ninth amongst point guards he was 10th best rebounder of all point guards and was the seventh best point guard at getting to the line as a backup nonetheless
864885 the man is a physical freak with a wingspan longer than youd expect explosive speed and the intelligence to read opposing players and anticipate their moves ju ju has quickly become one of the hornets best defenders while simultaneously snagging steals left and right when hes not hopping around for boards he may not have dominated the stat sheet like other rookies last year but he did a little of everything and was a total hustle player
864886 im thinking that robin lopez should be this guy in the coming season thats what hes here for and hustle and energy and tough defense are why the suns drafted him beyond that i guess raja bell but he didnt really have that kind of year last year d j strawberry didnt play enough shawn marion is gone and shaquille oneal diving into the stands aside isnt what youre looking for here

864890 the main ingredient of good leadership is good character this is because leadership involves conduct and conduct is determined by values
864891 you must take personal responsibility you cannot change the circumstances the seasons or the wind but you can change yourself that is something you have charge of
864892 in the west we tend to think of leadership as a quality that exists in certain people this usual way of thinking has many traps we search for special individuals with leadership potential rather than developing the leadership potential in everyone we are easily distracted by what this or that leader is doing by the melodrama of people in power trying to maintain their power and others trying to wrest it from them when things are going poorly we blame the situation on incompetent leaders thereby avoiding any personal responsibility when things become desperate we can easily find ourselves waiting for a great leader to rescue us through all of this we totally miss the bigger question what are we collectively able to create we forget that in its essence leadership is about learning how to shape the future leadership exists when people are no longer victims of circumstances but participate in creating new circumstances
864893 of nearly 1 200 managers and directors by the uk based has found more than eight out of 10 struggle to prioritise their work with conflicting demands pulling them in all directions two thirds complain they have little time to think and more than half struggle to find time to plan strategically the majority of managers claim they struggle to finish tasks with seven out of 10 admitting they are not looking for new market opportunities or product gaps in the marketplace
864894 insists that the leader manager must free up no less than 50 of his her time from routine tasks
864895 most managers spend a great deal of time thinking about what they plan to do but relatively little time thinking about what they plan not to do as a result they become so caught up in fighting the fires of the moment that they cannot really attend to the longterm threats and risks facing the organization so the first soft skill of leadership the hard way is to cultivate the perspective of marcus aurelius avoid busyness free up your time stay focused on what really matters let me put it bluntly every leader should routinely keep a substantial portion of his or her time i would say as much as 50 percent unscheduled only when you have substantial slop in your schedule unscheduled time will you have the space to reflect on what you are doing learn from experience and recover from your inevitable mistakes leaders without such free time end up tackling issues only when there is an immediate or visible problem managers typical response to my argument about free time is thats all well and good but there are things i have to do yet we waste so much time in unproductive activity it takes an enormous effort on the part of the leader to keep free time for the truly important things
864896 the world is flat a critical analysis of thomas friedmans new york times bestseller
864897 globalization is the greatest reorganization of the world since the industrial revolution
864898 all of the growth leaders in our study had unusually varied experience early in their careers along the way they acquired skills that eventually helped them explicitly in their launching of growth initiatives along with diversity of experience we found in our subjects a deep seated belief in their own abilities and in their power to change the world around them for them life is a journey of learning they thrived on accepting challenges taking action and getting immediate results these positive traits tended to reinforce one another in a virtuous circle this type of growth mindset prepared them to see and to chase opportunity
864899 although growth leaders embraced new ventures they werent risk seekers in fact they minimized risk wherever possible while most managers are taught to approach new projects by calculating expected return on investment growth leaders are more likely to estimate an acceptable degree of loss to start this lets them pursue interesting opportunities without investing more than they can afford to lose the managers in our study tended to place small bets fast then study how their bets had influenced the market this in turn encouraged them either to double down or to place new bets elsewhere its an approach that allowed them to be fast flexible and capable of capitalizing on early success
864900 success was based more often on thoughtful exploration of customers needs than on dry market data
864901 in assembling teams growth leaders learned to combine two seemingly opposing forces holding people ruthlessly accountable for results and engaging their passion to build something great together their overall approach was to be tough but fair
864902 its a lonely road for those of us who choose to be remarkable and the path of convention can sometimes be appealing that path is paved with safe lives middle of the road monotony and little chance of failure but wheres the fun in being like everyone else out there
864903 if you want it badly enough and are willing to make some changes in your life to cause it to happen you too can take over the world or do anything else you really want to do yes you really can have it all the only things youll need to give up are assumptions expectations and the comfort zone that holds you back from greatness

864909 experience shows me again and again that agility is not about working fast but about finding elegantly simple solutions to business problems youll know youve found an elegantly simple solution when it solves their most important and immediate problems because people cant find these simple solutions they mistakenly claim that agility itself doesnt work they come to this conclusion because they attempt to be agile by cramming complex solutions into short development cycles through working harder longer and faster an elegantly simple solution a robust 80 solution doesnt do everything there isnt time for that just the most important things
864910 agility means simple things done well not complex things done fast

864990 india and afghanistan are likely to be engaged in defence co operation and small development projects and help in local self governance
864991 not only pakistan even the us will have anxiety on the issue the us would like india and afghanistans co operation up to a point to push pakistan to deliver
864992 as india cannot object to pakistans relation with say bangladesh pakistan should not have any grouses when india helps afghanistan you must remember that india built roads on its western border only because pakistan steadfastly refuses access to india from the eastern side
864993 the war in afghanistan is part of pakistans larger struggle with india afghanistan has been a prize that pakistan and india have fought over directly and indirectly for decades to pakistan afghanistan represents a strategic rare base that would along with the islamic nations of ex soviet central asia offer a united front against hindu dominated india and block its rivals access to energy rich regions conversely for india a friendly afghanistan would pressure pakistan on its western border just as india itself pressures pakistan on its eastern border thus dealing pakistan a strategic defeat
864994 the karzai government has openly and brazenly strengthened its ties with india and allowed indian consulates in jalalabad kandahar herat and mazar e sharif it has kept alive the possibility of inviting india to help train the new afghan army and to help in dam construction in the northeastern afghan province of kunar abutting pakistan all this has driven the isi wild with fear and anger
864995 one thing we never understood is that india has always been the major threat for pakistan
864996 we are unlike european donors we are picking up only those project afghan people want us to do we are not imposing our idea of development

865037 higher oil prices and the lack of adequate fiscal policy reactions amidst high pent up price pressures are putting the burden of macro economic adjustment on the monetary authorities
865038 as a result policy as well as market interest rates could rise and a sharp deceleration in growth may follow
865039 greater government borrowing needs while not leading to a material deterioration of its key credit metrics would likely prevent an improvement in the remainder of fy08 09 contrary to our earlier expectation
865040 while moodys overall assessment is that the current constellation of risks is captured in the prevailing stable outlook downside pressures could emerge
865041 firstly they could involve deteriorations in the governments general debt metrics and its access to external liquidity given intensified commodity price shocks and an inadequate fiscal response
865042 secondly such pressures could be due to the rising risk of fiscal spillovers to indias external accounts such spillovers if large enough could weaken the case for the two notch gap between its foreign currency and local currency ratings
865043 elections are due in less than a years time and it is not clear whether the new coalition partners would support further reforms that could alleviate the countrys economic stresses

865053 it would be hard to find another band in our own backyard as consistently bludgeoning and intense as cursed on their third album cursed remain true to their last two musical pummel fests with a potent mix of hardcore metal and doom some genuinely fierce and dense production helps the band sound remarkably huge while the songs themselves are quick focused and determined to push the level of aggression as far as it can go occasionally cursed draw things out a little as they do on friends in the music business and closing instrumental track gutters offering momentary relief from the otherwise relentless pacing raw emotion is their greatest asset and theyve successfully channelled it here

865165 pengajaran hari ini manfaatkan segala yang ada resit merah tuhanlah yang memberi izin tuhanlah memberi kekuatan tuhanlah yang menggerakkan hati hati ini tuhanlah yang menunjuki atau mencelakai sesiapa yang ia kehendaki dari tuhan aku datang dari tuhan juga aku kembali ke manakah berhak perginya kudrat ini jika tidak kembali berbakti ke pangkuan ummah juga amanah dari tuhan
865166 were very good friends and im really sad for her
865167 i support her but i also support drug testing im sad for this whole situation it definitely doesnt make our sport look good shes a good friend of mine and im behind her but if it does leave a vacant spot ill do everything i can to fill the 50 free im still kind of in shock about the whole thing its really unfortunate
865168 that was one of the things we tried to talk about were here to represent our country in the best possible light we can
865169 we have to move forward from this and that should be our goal and focus
865170 i think i developed in this past year better than i ever have before it really helped me improve as a player and get to where i want to be as an nhl player some day
865171 if hes ready to play in the nhl im not here to hold kids back
865172 were disappointed that max pacioretty has chosen to forego his eligibility at the university of michigan
865173 max was certainly a positive force on our team last season we would like to wish him well in his pursuit of his dream to play in the national hockey league
865174 i talked to him before and he talked to me about the pros and cons about either decision
865175 a couple of days later i ended up signing making the decision to leave i really took into consideration what he had to tell me hes a great coach hes probably the best coach i ever played for
865176 max pacioretty is a young player with a lot of skills who has the potential to play in the nhl
865177 we feel he is ready to make the jump to professional hockey and we will make sure to provide him with all the resources which will benefit his long term development as a player
865178 were going to go with what we got and hopefully somebody else will step up and fill that role
865179 we felt robin had a very good chance of qualification but in the end the ncaa eligibility center found him to be just short of eligibility to receive a scholarship from any division i university while we were aware of the risk involved with this signing and we are disappointed for robin it does not deter our confidence in finding the right student athletes for the future of this basketball program
865180 robin is a fine young man and we will continue to provide him with the ncaa information he will need if he continues to pursue options in the united states if he does not pursue these options i assume he will begin playing at a professional level in europe starting this fall
865181 things were a lot different in those days there wasnt any fear
865182 we would go to new york city on a saturday a couple of friends of mine and wed spend the day we used to write for tickets to different radio broadcasts and go to those they were free i grew up in a great time
865183 the one big thing i can remember was bob feller pitching coming in in relief
865184 he struck out the first batter i cant remember who and then closed out the game the american league won i think the score was 3 1
865185 they had a great bunch of players in those days frankie frisch and the deans dizzie and daffy and they had a great competition with the brooklyn dodgers
865186 we took my sister to a game a doubleheader between the dodgers and the cardinals she sat between us and when we got home she told my mother it was a good thing each team won
865187 as brothers will do even though were up there in years we still talk a lot on the phone
865188 just having the experience having done it once before helped me a lot
865189 its obviously a physical feat but its a real mental challenge as well because it lasts for so long and theres so much sleep deprivation involved your reach a point maybe a couple of times when the situation seems untenable somebodys sick somebodys feeling terrible you really hit some lows to push through that it really helps to have some experience
865190 i think the greatest single thing i can do to stay healthy is to exercise regularly
865191 this is a fact about diabetes that needs to be spread around more the major message of this team is to try and encourage people who have diabetes who might feel their condition gets in the way of doing something adventurous or of simply exercising to realize those things might help their condition
865192 the race is a good example of the extreme conditions where that kind of flexibility is really important we were all adjusting our insulin moment to moment throughout the race because its such a bizarre and stressful situation
865193 the first time i went out i remember looking out the window of the plane and thinking of everything id see the mountains the plains
865194 it turned out half our riding was done in the middle of the night and in the daytime it was just too much work to take it all in
865195 someday id love to take two months to do it
865196 listen if you cant get along with a kid like kosta then youre clueless
865197 if youre making 2 million season and cant figure out how to use a 7 foot 1 kid youre clueless if you cant get along with a kid who comes early stays late and gets good grades youre clueless and youve got the problem
865198 maybe you should do an aa news investigation into osu
865199 although he continues to disagree with the validity of the terms rich and the rest of us at michigan felt that it would be best to get this distracting issue behind us
865200 no it worked with beilein so lets try it here
865201 has an obligation to tell the public what happened here
865202 and maybe just maybe hed even have a winning record against ohio state
865203 with the quickness a little tale of young black love hardcore style
865204 we have 52 elephants some twats started kicking them in i was asked to viral together to promote the elephants
865205 nixon wouldnt look right unless he was carrying a pocketbook
865206 excuse the expression but shes the stereotypical bitch you know what i mean
865207 exclusive commitment to a cultural and national identity played a major role in obamas decision to identify himself with christianity
865208 well theres no question the power is crackling through his jeans
865209 it is time for an honest look at the problem of order in the united states
865210 traitors to the high principles in which many of the nations democrats believe
865211 when they have a man for lunch they really have him for lunch
865212 in the worst case scenario your staff and customers could be killed or injured and your premises destroyed or damaged in a no warning multiple and co ordinated terrorist attack
865213 fotitos de mis amigos a d 5to y mi graduacion
865214 it kind of sneaks up on you when you get to the top of the nation not without trying but without even knowing it and youre ninth and then eighth and sixth
865215 and then wow now shes fourth and you only have to be sixth to make the olympic team and wow shes only 18 it is amazing
865216 im training with a lot more olympians people at a very high level and its great training with them and having someone to try and stay up with
865217 shes such a fun goofy kid but shes not a kid shes taller than me
865218 shes improving so much and i would love to see allison on the team
865219 ive been waiting for it i know how talented she is and ive seen how she works in practice shes not the kind of person whos going to get caught up in the moment shes just like ok im going to go swim fast now bye and then she does
865220 ive never been in a venue or pool that big and it was exciting just to see it
865221 there will be a lot more energy a lot more people im just really excited ive never gotten nervous for a meet before so i dont want to change anything it would be a dream come true if i make the team that would be just great im really looking forward to seeing how i swim
865222 i feel like until last summer ive been content in my spot on top
865223 i didnt really have anybody pushing me off my little podium
865224 now theres dara and natalie and jessica hardy theyve all passed me or are nipping on my heels
865225 i think the competition is great for the sport and my event i dont expect to get anything easy i want to work for what i get
865226 you never want anything bad to happen but it gave her time to take a breath
865227 every year at ncaas she carried our team and then she went right into the international scene every time she turned around she was under the gun i think she got a little tired a little worn out
865228 its not how you want to draw it up but i think taking a step back recharged her and gave her more zip for the sport she came back with a vengeance
865229 i missed making the team in the 200 by one spot last time
865230 it was a couple of 100ths of a second in 2004 and that was devastating so that was definitely an emphasis to focus on my 200 theres no question in my mind im going to be on that relay in one of those spots i think ive learned to swim the 200 a little smarter
865231 i think im going to swim so much faster than what ive done lately i havent swam the race tapered in over a year i dont think ive reached my peak at all
865232 i really havent had a strong entire year since 2004 but i think im going to more than make up for that this year

865245 the storemen and packers union is extremely militant as nsw people recently have had good cause to know but it is far from being leftist bob carr examines its ambivalent approach to industrial issues and looks at the men who are running it
865246 she was a little green in her first couple of starts but she has really been improving and she felt like an old aged racehorse out there tonight
865247 i think she is a special filly there was lots left in the tank tonight i just chirped to her once and she took right off
865248 ondanks dat ik geloof in het feit dat mevrouw spears haar leven heeft gebeterd wil ik bewijs zien dat het niet alleen een act was ik wil zien dat het daadwerkelijk een verandering is daarom verleng ik het toezicht tot 2008 dit toezicht zal in handen blijven van jamie spears

865272 gustafsson 18 was the fifth rated european skater in the draft according to nhl central scouting and has spent two seasons with the frolunda junior team in sweden
865273 anton is a highly skilled player with strong puckhandling skills and playmaking ability
865274 he is an effective passer through traffic who also has a good selection of shots hes a tall strong and talented two way center with good vision and a fine understanding of the game he plays a mature game even when playing against opponents who were two or three years older
865275 john carlson is a big burly defensemen he is a real good skater and a strong skater
865276 he runs the power play from the top of the umbrella and he has a very heavy shot hes a very self assured kid and rightfully so hes a boy yet in a mans body and very physically strong i knew when i first saw him that he was a first round pick he was a guy i had seen before as an under ager he had all the tools size skill physical presence and charisma
865277 the man who reads nothing at all is better educated than the man who reads nothing but newspapers
865278 oh its another fucking mexican writing about his or her experience of crossing the border or the river or being smuggled across by a coyote
865279 they break in line at the store bang your car door
865280 we houden hoyng puur voor de zekerheid op de tribune we nemen geen enkel risico met hem
865281 het was voor mij het ek en het wk voetbal meer niet ik weet pas sinds een jaar of twee drie dat er tijdens de olympische spelen ook gevoetbald wordt
865282 wanneer je hier presteert kent de hele wereld je in n klap das mooi als kleine jongen was het mijn streven bekend te worden nu ik de gelegenheid krijg mijn land in peking te vertegenwoordigen wil ik dat dan ook zo goed mogelijk doen
865283 door de zware trainingen van de laatste dagen waren ze duidelijk vermoeid
865284 toen kregen we vier strafcorners en vier echte kansen daar hadden we meer van moeten maken
865285 door de vermoeidheid kun je echter nog geen flitsend spel verwachten
865286 christs faithful have the right indeed at times the duty in keeping with their knowledge competence and position to manifest to the sacred pastors their views on matters which concern the good of the church they have the right also to make their views known to others of christs faithful but in doing so they must always respect the integrity of faith and morals show due reverence to the pastors and take into account both the common good and the dignity of individuals
865287 the catholic church is the only thing which saves a man from the degrading slavery of being a child of his age
865288 maybe the most striking feature which an outside observer notices in the west in our days
865289 should one point out that from ancient times decline in courage has been considered the beginning of the end
865290 without any censorship in the west fashionable trends of thought and ideas are carefully separated from those which are not fashionable nothing is forbidden but what is not fashionable will hardly ever find its way into periodicals or books or be heard in colleges legally your researchers are free but they are conditioned by the fashion of the day there is no open violence such as in the east however a selection dictated by fashion and the need to match mass standards frequently prevent independent minded people from giving their contribution to public life there is a dangerous tendency to form a herd shutting off successful development i have received letters in america from highly intelligent persons maybe a teacher in a faraway small college who could do much for the renewal and salvation of his country but his country cannot hear him because the media are not interested in him this gives birth to strong mass prejudices blindness which is most dangerous in our dynamic era there is for instance a self deluding interpretation of the contemporary world situation it works as a sort of petrified armor around peoples minds human voices from 17 countries of eastern europe and eastern asia cannot pierce it it will only be broken by the pitiless crowbar of events
865291 there are meaningful warnings that history gives a threatened or perishing society such are for instance the decadence of art or a lack of great statesmen there are open and evident warnings too the center of your democracy and of your culture is left without electric power for a few hours only and all of a sudden crowds of american citizens start looting and creating havoc the smooth surface film must be very thin then the social system quite unstable and unhealthy
865292 but the fight for our planet physical and spiritual a fight of cosmic proportions is not a vague matter of the future it has already started the forces of evil have begun their decisive offensive you can feel their pressure and yet your screens and publications are full of prescribed smiles and raised glasses what is the joy about
865293 do you know where is exactly i have done it
865294 you dont need to be bachelor degree or even a master degree to have income from internet all you need is the effort to
865295 ye are all gods children of the most high god
865296 how can i find understanding in what im going through
865297 what does god want me to experience in the unknown
865298 ye are all gods children of the most high god
865299 ye are all gods children of the most high god
865300 ye are all gods children of the most high god
865301 there are no property developments in the portfolio and all the buildings over which mortgages are held are established and well tenanted there are no related party loans
865302 the reality is that this is a solid investment which has delivered attractive consistent returns
865303 the fund is performing well however we cannot ignore the market sentiment and the impact this is having on investor confidence
865304 we are hopeful investors and their advisers will clearly consider the nature and benefit of good quality mortgage assets when making investment decisions in the current environment
865305 i keep my own personality in a cupboard under the stairs at home so that no one else can see it or nick it
865306 we dont see a major negative effect on second half although there will be some moderation
865307 ye are all gods children of the most high god
865308 invariably there will be a slowdown from the growth that we had last year because the us is still a very major trading partner for malaysia
865309 signs are emerging that this commodity boom may soon come to an end as a slower world economy and sky high prices damp global demand for commodities
865310 what sterilization techniques were used and did they use an autoclave
865311 the stench of alcohol was everywhere and what is sterilization and autoclave
865312 did you know that alcohol does not kill hiv or hepatitis
865313 i know i dont have hiv because i dont have herpes
865314 ms couillard may have put herself in jeopardy of having contravened a provision of the security of information act
865315 also regrettable but i dont think china is regressing the way that russia is we have a greater opportunity to work in a cooperative way with china
865316 we understand as the dalai lama does that tibet is part of china but we hope tibetans are not repressed or oppressed
865317 you dont want to go over there and insult the chinese
865318 it would not be good for our relations i certainly dont think the president would or should go over there and be confrontational at the same time i think the president can in a very diplomatic style make it clear what we stand for and believe in
865319 i see a steady progression in russia of more and more repression of rights and the disappearance of semblances of democracy
865320 we have to deal with them negotiate with them especially in light of their hoard of petrodollars but we cant sit by and watch a country murder people in england
865321 our goal from the very start is to get people using these resources so they appreciate them and are interested in conserving them
865322 in some conditions it would be for experienced paddlers only
865323 this sting operation proves that there are gaps in the system and that scam artists can exploit and are exploiting those gaps
865324 if real fraudsters had been in charge of the fictitious companies they would have been clear to bill medicare from the virginia office for potentially millions of dollars worth of nonexistent supplies
865325 will only be successful if those tasked with ensuring compliance exercise due diligence when conducting screenings and inspections
865326 the vision is to figure out how to re establish the connection between individuals and their natural environments and reconnect families in the process
865327 think of the traffic and the noise and light until we know how many houses are being proposed its hard to know what the impact will be
865328 they own the land and they can do what they want with it
865329 we need a business to keep people here not drive people away
865330 its a little difficult when you dont have direct contact with the landowners
865331 this is a significant change whether you like it or not
865332 we want to be a good neighbor and partner and were trying to find ways to do that
865333 i believe party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories
865334 today is a proud day for all of us who fought so hard to ensure floridians votes are fully counted
865335 his commitment to uniting the party and ending the uncertainty surrounding the process
865336 as always our goal is to ensure a fair process and a unified democratic party so that we can win in november
865337 as we prepare to come together in denver however we must be and will be united in our determination to change the course of our nation
865338 the public has demanded action to protect our environment and our health and clearly the legislature has listened
865339 not only bolster our efforts to change the way we consume produce and deliver energy in the commonwealth but also grow jobs and provide new opportunities for our work force
865340 it took me four years to paint like raphael but a lifetime to paint like a child
865341 i rushed to the spot in search of my three children who had gone to pay obeisance at the hilltop shrine
865342 i fail to understand why god was so cruel to us
865343 there is no need to panic everything is normalized now
865344 from time to time other subcommittee members would drop in but the show like the bill clearly belonged to chairman seiberling
865345 hes got it made and he doesnt know about the people who dont
865346 theres no use talking to reagan his mind is made up and he doesnt want to be bothered with the facts
865347 i urge anyone who thinks they are running out of fuel or heating oil dont come in friday morning see me on thursday because friday may be too late to do anything before the weekend
865348 is going to come off of somebodys back by the end of the year i dont want to touch the van drivers at this point because i think it is important that the seniors have transportation
865349 a community has to buy into this program in order for it to fly
865350 but im also concerned about the status of the school
865351 very devoted mom always willing to lend a helping hand
865352 she is going to be remembered she loved her kids
865353 although the peace garden is not a quick fix to neighborhood violence it is a small step toward connection with each other and with nature
865354 its hard to get the lay of the land from paper
865355 thats why we wanted to come out here and take a look we are just doing our due diligence
865356 we have a traffic study going on right now at a busy time of the year and the peer review is being done also what we would like to do is clear out some land and build some models up front here the main part of the subdivision will be in the back so we want to get a road in rough cut so people can drive in when we sell off the models then we can build some more its not going to be like a big thing all at once thats the plan right now
865357 they will own the lot but it will all be maintained the exteriors will be maintained they wont even have to cut their grass they do a lot of this in florida and there is one on gulf road in dartmouth it will be maintained as a private community by the homeowners association that will be funded and bonded
865358 its a little easier to understand the plans now that we have walked the lot
865359 we are hiring our own engineering company to go over all the figures that the developers have presented with respect to the elevations the wetlands and whether they can get the yield plan that they said they could they will make their recommendations and present them back to the board and we will review them
865360 we should also have the traffic study back by then
865361 we would like to be building some models as soon as the ground is prepared and maybe even marketing by the spring
865362 we had a wonderful turnout and gave out a lot of information
865363 but there were also lots of insights from passengers on the buses as well telling us things we didnt know we would like to come up with a new theme for next year and a different route
865364 the creek was overflowing and the sky turned a funny shade of yellow we knew something was wrong but we didnt know what
865365 the whole thing has been very well attended we had around 60 children in the parade on saturday and there were 16 teams registered for the treasure hunt
865366 who is this psycho lady and why in the world is she showing me her tattoo
865367 we need to be aware of every building and piece of land for economic development and this inventory gives us a tremendous amount of objective data to help us make developers understand what the opportunities are
865368 allows us to plan for the future it allows us to work with current mill owners to know their needs
865369 it is better to be prepared it really is a blueprint for the city
865370 these kind of planning activities are important because then we can set our own direction rather than just reacting
865371 we do not have an over abundance of land but we do have an over abundance of mills
865372 that one third of the mills surveyed have high economic development potential and it is recommended that these mills be specifically targeted for redevelopment
865373 he was the best thing that ever happened to me
865374 im fully confident that she will do an excellent job and thank you in advance for supporting her in this position
865375 i saw the extra steps that the other servers took to improve the experience for the guests it was natural to do that in competition because we do that every day at hemenways
865376 by the time the woman went into 7 eleven to ask them for water because she wanted to extinguish the fire herself the cashier said something to the effect of its much too big now
865377 it reignited we theorize through a short circuit in the vehicle it sort of rekindled itself it was very stubborn to put out
865378 i was scared that the pumps were going to go up in flames too they were right next to the car it was just too much to see
865379 everyone around me was scared but the fire department did a great job
865380 the car was just out of range of danger but close enough to cause concern
865381 i want to call out to our american friends to tell them that they can count on our friendship
865382 my constituents are asking me when something is going to happen whether an indictment is going to be returned or whether the justice department is going to make an announcement that theres insufficient evidence to prosecute representative jefferson
865383 when can the public expect some news one way or the other on this issue
865384 there are some groups that are going to be here just because this is a big stage
865385 but i think the majority of groups are here because they really want to demonstrate to the delegates that they want to see some sort of changes in the party platform
865386 these groups have said we cant survive four more years of this
865387 it is something that really gets people out in the streets
865388 its not directed specifically against the republicans thats for certain
865389 its against the warmakers but even people marching dont necessarily have to see things as broadly as i do
865390 this is a big deal and a time we want to interject the voice of the people
865391 we love augusta and were going to stay as long as we can
865392 its a pretty special time of the year coming around again
865393 when i saw it going down there i said oh no dont hurt the hammer
865394 the putts all day werent breaking the way you thought they would because the greens were real bumpy
865395 im sure there was some luck involved in that one
865396 when i missed the birdie putt i figured i wouldnt even get a gift certificate for a high finish
865397 for his sake it would be nice if hed win another one
865398 i sweat a lot anyway but this was so bad i had to slow down and pace myself a little more
865399 the thing that impresses me most about him is he continues to get better each time out
865400 his fastball command early in the game was a lot better it was good to see him aggressive early
865401 things like that are the reason why people talk about him the way they do
865402 the hitting is good but i like throwing guys out at the plate
865403 after it left my hand i knew i had him
865404 when you get into a little slump like this a day like today reminds you not to take anything for granted
865405 right wing spin machine uses misleading figures to argue that the tax code is more progressive under bush

865412 whos going to employ all of us now that they have sound embedded in the films
865413 if the north american churches dont accept the need for moratoria then to say the least we are no further forward
865414 that means as a communion we continue to be in grave peril
865415 a fellow christian may believe they have a profound fresh insight
865416 but the christian with the new insight cant claim straight away that this is now what the church of god believes or intends
865417 for people who think that this is going to lead us to disenfranchise any gay or lesbian person they are sadly mistaken
865418 were just getting quotes now from professional movers so that we can get it over here intact
865419 so they no longer have people tramping through when they are playing
865420 we are renting the building on a year to year basis but the school committee does not believe they will need the space in the coming years so were very pleased to be here its efficient use of the empty building and economical for the town
865421 thanks to the efforts of our coa drivers and some of the lions it was a seamless transition and we were able to get everything up here without any disruption to services we are still organizing but are looking ahead to the fall when we can get some activities going in the new space we also hope to stay open one evening a week

865424 we are fortunate to have dr hickey with us to share his views on medical care to people in nigeria especially vulnerable groups because living conditions and safety issues are getting worse in developing countries
865425 its a pretty violent place you just cant go out and walk about
865426 the overall lack of functioning and accessible emergency medical services in the region
865427 the nation 300 miles north of the equator has severe pollution problems drinking water is contaminated from oil spills and suspended sand particles in the dry air cause dust clouds that irritate the lungs
865428 including gunshots stabbings beatings burns domestic and sexual violence as well as traffic related accidents
865429 children may begin participating in conflict from as young as the age of 7
865430 theyre one paycheck away and if you cant help them theyre going to lose it all
865431 they really do their best to help others as well as helping me
865432 just walking in there i feel a lot of love
865433 any ancient deeply rooted autonomous culture especially if it is spread on a wide part of the earths surface constitutes an autonomous world full of riddles and surprises to western thinking
865434 for one thousand years russia has belonged to such a category
865435 a great writer is so to speak a secret government in his country
865436 a man sprouts a tumor and dies how then can a country live that has sprouted camps and exile
865437 suddenly all the professors and engineers turned out to be saboteurs and they believed it or all of lenins old guard were vile renegades and they believed it suddenly all their friends and acquaintances were enemies of the people and they believed it
865438 the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of russian literature
865439 not only was i convinced that i should never see a single line of mine in print in my lifetime but also i scarcely dared allow any of my close acquaintances to read anything i had written because i feared that this would become known
865440 wicked governments or by heavy crises or by their own barbarity or incomprehension
865441 exile from his great theme stalinism and the gulag had exposed his major weaknesses
865442 the whole truth about russia until they shut my mouth like before
865443 understood the subtlety sensitivity and kindheartedness of the jewish character
865444 we need to be better so we need to go more slowly
865445 ye are all gods children of the most high god
865446 ye are all gods children of the most high god
865447 weve been fortunate that over the years weve been able to keep up with the capital debt that the town has had to incur
865448 its pay as you go we call it progress payments
865449 we are overcrowded no doubt and we are looking at the possibility of renovation
865450 twenty years later we have to start thinking about the future
865451 how many crimes are committed by people who have their permit
865452 we know what to expect from the coaches now we know what to expect out of this defense
865453 its more of a reaction now than us trying to make sure were going through each step making everything right its becoming second nature for us
865454 its your talent its understanding your scheme and then playing with great effort those are the things we want to establish thats what we have to get to
865455 these guys are seeing change in their own performance as they get a better understanding of the defense
865456 you can throw history away i just know that through the progression of this defense be it at ole miss with chuck be it bailiff at texas state tcu and new mexico year 2 was always a much improved quantum leap a lot of that was the knowledge that allowed the young men to play faster
865457 we should be better at the end of the day when you add up all the numbers rice should have a much better defense than it has had in the past
865458 on saturday morning dan gillmor and i had the same thought when we read glenn greenwalds post abc news has to respond but to what exactly we tried to put it into three questions tough but fair as people there would probably say on other occasions
865459 we have to keep out word or sources wont trust us
865460 the networks hyperventilating broadcasts of leaked false allegations purportedly tying the anthrax to saddam husseins iraqi regime see glenn greenwalds meticulous examination of the coverage was bad enough
865461 its imperative for abc to tell us what happened here
865462 pressure on abc to out their sources should be swift and sustained
865463 here is one advantage bloggers have in the struggle for reputation for the users trust they are closer to the transaction where trust gets built up on the web theres a big difference between tapping a built up asset like the st pete times brand and creating it from scratch
865464 you dont own the eyeballs you dont own the press which is now divided into pro and amateur zones you dont control production on the new platform which isnt one way theres a new balance of power between you and us
865465 howard weaver vice president for news at the mcclatchy company said it comes as close as anything ive seen to a roadmap for the near future
865466 just so you know the media has no mind it cannot make decisions which means it does not get behind candidates it does not decide to oppose your guy or gal it is a beast without a brain most of the time it doesnt know what its doing
865467 im just advising newsroom joe and jill make room for fdl in your own ideas about whats coming on news wise dont let your own formula blog opinion fake you out a conspiracy of the like minded to find out what happened when the national news media isnt inclined to tell us might be way more practical than you think
865468 were at the twilight of the curmudgeon class in newsrooms and j schools though they can still do a lot of damage you know theyre giving up when they no longer bother to inform themselves about what they themselves say is happening
865469 the important thing is to show integrity not to be a neuter politically and having good facts that hold up is a bigger advantage than claiming to reflect all sides equally well
865470 enterprise reporting goes pro am assignments are open sourced they begin online reporters working with smart users and blogging editors get the story the pack wouldnt couldnt or didnt
865471 newassignment net just launched its first reporting project a partnership with wired com and newsvine its called assignment zero heres the deal and the links
865472 a highly satisfying failure jeff howe called it in wired no a spectacularly successful failure says beth lawton at the digital edge meanwhile offthebus net launched this week carrying the lessons of zero into political space
865473 here are my coordinates for the territory we need to be searching i got them from doing a distributed trend story with wired com and thinking through the results
865474 this white house doesnt settle for managing the news what used to be called feeding the beast because there is a larger aim to roll back the press as a player within the executive branch to make it less important in running the white house and governing the country
865475 youre assuming that you represent the public i dont accept that
865476 bush and his advisors have their own press think which they are trying out as policy reporters do not represent the interests of a broader public they arent a pipeline to the people because people see through the game of gotcha the press has forfeited if it ever had its quasi official role in the checks and balances of government
865477 savviness that quality of being shrewd practical well informed perceptive ironic with it and unsentimental in all things political is in a sense their professional religion they make a cult of it and it was this cult that karl rove understood and exploited for political gain
865478 were headed i think for schism tumult and divide as the religion of the american press meets the upheavals in global politics and public media that are well underway changing around us are the terms on which authority can be established by journalists the net is opening things up shifting the power to publish around consumers are becoming producers readers can be writers
865479 some of the pressure the blogs are putting on journalists shows up then in the demand for
865480 theyre not equals but washington and arlington have their own spheres over the newspaper and reporting beats len downie is king over the website jim brady is sovereign over the user s experience no one has total control theres tension because theres supposed to be tension
865481 an industry that wont move until it is certain of days as good as its golden past is effectively dead from a strategic point of view besides there is an alternative if you dont have the faith or will or courage needed to accept reality and deal the alternative is to drive the property to a profitable demise
865482 so while people in the old press pack up and tell stories about giants they knew in the era when they are also asking each other where headed
865483 mcclellan bush cheney and rove proved there were other ways
865484 woodward and bernstein of 1972 74 didnt have such access and this probably influenced for the better their view of what nixon and his men were capable of watergate wasnt broken by reporters who had entree to the inner corridors of power it was two guys on the metro desk
865485 just one mans opinion but now is a good time to say it the new york times is not any longer in my mind the greatest newspaper in the land nor is it the base line for the public narrative that it once was some time in the last year or so i moved the washington post into that position
865486 this here is a post for practically everyone in the game of seizing on media bias and denouncing it which is part of our popular culture and of course a loud part of our politics and this is especially for the were fair and balanced youre not crowd wherever i may have located you
865487 the posts links dont expire you see links to the new york times do
865488 oreilly feeds off his own resentments the establishment sneering at inside edition and like howard beale the mad prophet of the airwaves his resentments are enlarged by the medium into public grievances among a mass of americans unfairly denied voice
865489 dan rather and cbs took the risky course impunging the motives of critics rather than a more confident and honorable one lets look at our sources and methods what can explain such a blind reaction here is my attempt
865490 occupy the reasonable middle between two markers for vocal critic and critics look ridiculous charging you with bias their symmetrical existence feels like proof of an underlying hysteria their mutually incompatible charges seem to cancel each other out the minute evidence they marshall even shows a touch of fanaticism
865491 among foreign correspondents there is a phrase parachuting in thats when a reporter drops into foreign territory during an emergency without much preparation staying only as long as the story remains big the high profile people who might parachute in are called bigfoots in the jargon of network news the problem with being a bigfoot of course is that its hard to walk in other peoples shoes
865492 the bias charges are getting more serious lately as the stakes rise in iraq and the election but there is something lacking in press coverage and it may be time for wise journalists to assess it the re building story has gone missing and without it how can we judge the job bush is doing
865493 there are hidden moral hazards in the ethic of neutral observation and the belief in a professional role that transcends other loyalties i think there is an abyss to observation alone and i feel it has something to do with why more people dont trust journalists they dont trust that abyss
865494 find some new information and put it into your post
865495 opinion based on information everyone has is less valuable than opinion journalism based on information that you dug up originated or pieced together so its not important to us that contributors keep opinion
865496 what capacity for product development do news organizations show zip how are they on nurturing innovation terrible is there an entreprenurial spirit in newsrooms no do smart young people ever come in and overturn everything never
865497 number one is the houston chronicle number two the washington post theres more and theres a big chart so check it out more
865498 i think the happiest conference goers at blogher were probably the newbies people who want to start blogging or just did they got a lot of good information and advice some of the best information was actually dispensed in response to the fears provoked by blogging which shouldn t be avoided the sages said but examined turned around defused and creatively shrunk
865499 the weblog comes out of the gift economy whereas most of today s journalism comes out of the market economy
865500 the quality of any weblog in journalism depends greatly on its fidelity to age old newsroom commandments like check facts check links spell things correctly be accurate be timely quote fairly
865501 sure weblogs are good for making statements big and small but they also force re statement yes theyre opinion forming but they are equally good at unforming opinion breaking it down stretching it out
865502 when youre sitting at your desk and there are things strange wonderful and new on your screen you may have to re decide what journalism is and is finally about in order to cover the new class of cases that arise when youre doing it live online
865503 its pirate radio legalized its public access coming closer to life inside the borders of blogistan a real place with all the problems of a real place were closer to a vision of producer democracy than we are to any of the consumerist views that long ago took hold in the mass media including much of the journalism presented on that platform
865504 and big media doesnt entirely own the press because if it did then the first amendment which mentions the press would belong to big media and it doesnt these things were always true the weblog doesnt change them it just opens up an outlet to the sea which in turn extends the press to the desk in the bedroom of the suburban mom where she blogs at night
865505 journalists think good information leads to opinion and argument its a logical sequence bloggers think that good argument and strong opinion cause people to seek information an equally logical sequence what do the bloggers bring to this my short answer to the press is everything you have removed
865506 journalists you can stop worrying about bloggers replacing the traditional news media were grist for their mill says satullo a mill that doesnt run without us bloggers consume and extend the shelf life of our reporting and they scrutinize it at a new level of intensity
865507 the web is good for many opposite things for quick hitting information for clicking across a field for talk and interaction its also a depth finder a memory device a library an editor not to use a weblog for extended analysis because most users wont pick that option is web dumb but media smart whats strange is that i try to write short snappy things but they turn into long ones
865508 i remember the moment when presidential campaigns turned from just maddening and absurd to completely empty for me it might have happened years before but i am a believer in politics so it took until the fall of 2000 bush and gore were then fighting it out not by opposing one another in any kind of argument but by running virtually the same campaign on the same issues pandering to the same groups advancing a rhetoric that sounded the same but for a few catch phrases
865509 somehow it had all gotten away from them presidential campaigns had drifted out of alignment with most americans the ritual no longer seemed like something the country did for itself every four years but what a professional cadre did and sold back to the country as politics but it wasn t really at least it wasn t democratic politics at anything like capacity
865510 were winning to somehow be removed or retired as the operating system for news campaign reporting would immediately become harder to do not because there would be no news but rather no common repeatable instructions for deciding what is a key development in the story a turning point a surprise a trend master narratives are thus harder to alter than they are to apprehend for how do you keep the story running while a switch is made
865511 spin alley an invention of the american press and politicos shows that the system we have is in certain ways a partnership between the press and insiders in politics they come together to mount the ritual an intelligent nation is entitled to ask if the partners are engaged in public service when they bring to life their invention alternative thesis they are in a pact of mutual convenience that serves no intelligible public good
865512 how is it you know youre the press because you have a pass that says press and people open the gate the locker room doors admit you
865513 the answer i think involves an open secret in political journalism that has been recognized for at least 20 years but it is never dealt with probably because the costs of facing it head on seem larger than the light tax on honesty any open secret demands the secret is this pssst the press is a player in the campaign and even though it knows this as everyone knows it the professional code of the journalist contains no instructions in what the press could or should be playing for
865514 i think its a bankrupt form it serves no clear purpose has no sensible rationale the journalists who offer us strategy news do not know what public service they are providing why they are providing it for whom it is intended or how we are supposed to use this strange variety of news
865515 when journalists avoid drawing open conclusions they are more vulnerable to charges of covert bias of having a concealed agenda of not being up front about their perspective of unfairly building a case for against while pretending only to report what happened
865516 no one knows what a political convention actually is anymore or why it takes 15 000 people to report on it two successive regimes for making sense of the event have collapsed a third has not emerged thats a good starting point for the webloggers credentialed in boston no investment in the old regime and its ironizing
865517 nobody had ever asked to anchor convention coverage from the floor feist said as we shared a booth like real diners cnn got the new gear tested it out and made the request to the democrats the democrats said yes and right there the sky box era at conventions came to an end
865518 journalists find before them with 50 days left a campaign overtaken by vietnam by character issues attacks and fights about the basic legitimacy of various actors including the press itself including dan rather its been a dark week and the big arrow is pointing backwards
865519 the every four years headset is like outdated software still running because its an expensive decision and major disruption to replace a piece of press think so big with so many parts there is no agreement on a new think system and there is every incentive to keep the old program going for another election cycle even though the world has moved on
865520 new and interesting species are still being discovered on caribbean islands despite the very small amount of natural forests remaining
865521 im tired of chasing my dreams im just gonna find out where theyre headed and hook up with them later
865522 according to karma the girls are singing the flying of the cranes composed by the fifth dalai lama who is said to have been a sometime poet a prisoner sentenced to death is enclosed in a box and thrown into the river through the slats he spies two flying cranes and implores them to lend him the help of their wings asked if they did so karma shakes his head that prisoner was probably a romantic sort he says
865523 there is no history only fictions of various degrees of plausibility
865524 if i lie and say you took me for a friend patched together in my thin bones will you help me be cunning and noisy as the wind
865525 the great enemy of the truth is very often not the lie deliberate contrived and dishonest but the myth persistent persuasive and unrealistic
865526 i got no alibis cant even tell my usual lies
865527 excellency its a natural lie to tell i beg you stop this now
865528 i might come to the end of my life and find out everyone was lying
865529 so we cheated and we lied and we tested and we never failed to fail it was the easiest thing to do
865530 some folks get spiritual cause they see the light some cause they feel the heat
865531 berapa lama gw akan nganggur setelah resign dari job yang sekarang
865532 never trust a computer you cant throw out a window

865537 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
865538 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
865539 played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
865540 paint the white house black and im sure thats got em terrified
865541 you go into some of these small towns in pennsylvania and like a lot of small towns in the midwest the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothings replaced them and they fell through the clinton administration and the bush administration and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are gonna regenerate and they have not and its not surprising then they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations
865542 i work with a guy who acts and directs and works backstage at a community theater he really enjoys it
865543 they just punch each other and go on their way
865544 was a four bedroom house with decorative rock walls and a three car garage that towered over ranch and split level homes in their clayton county neighborhood the homes door opened into a lobby that featured four fireplaces a solarium a music room and a plush new office
865545 its aggravating it just makes you mad you do that much work and they just squander it
865546 in fact there is no evidence that he obama planned to take anyone to the american hospital other than a military adviser whose status as a campaign staff member sparked last minute concern among pentagon officials that the visit would be an improper political event
865547 made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops seems the pentagon wouldnt allow him to bring cameras
865548 no writer that i can think of in history really was able to do so much through courage and literary skill to change the society they came from
865549 and to some extent you have to credit the literary works of alexander solzhenitsyn with helping to bring down the last empire on earth
865550 during all the years until 1961 not only was i convinced that i should never see a single line of mine in print in my lifetime but also i scarcely dared allow any of my close acquaintances to read anything i had written because i feared that this would become known
865551 the human soul longs for things higher warmer and purer than those offered by todays mass living habits by tv stupor and by intolerable music
865552 i had my last set of radiation treatments last fall its not something that i let rule my life
865553 i like to think of it like this say you have a yardstick you have cancer so cancer gets three inches of your yardstick then you have to refuse to let it have another inch of your life
865554 im a banker shes a caterer she knows more about the industry than i do
865555 its a combined effort shes really done a great job building the business i think the reason shes been so successful is that she loves what shes doing
865556 shes been the strength for me for a lot of things since weve been married
865557 ill never complain that i dont feel good because she doesnt feel good every day but it doesnt cause her to not get through her day
865558 shes not too impressed with her business gifts that she forgets that hard work brings it all together she works hard
865559 shes got more drive than most people she contributes more than just her good taste in food to everyday life and the people she deals with
865560 my parents were both very industrious people which is probably where i get it from
865561 try to figure out why you were sleeping the day away at 6 a m
865562 i was very athletic growing up probably a huge tomboy i was always mad if the boys could climb a tree quicker than i could
865563 wed have to find a way to climb out of them and would come back dry and covered with chalk
865564 whatever i did i had to do it perfectly clean and im still that way im a bit of a germaphobe
865565 my sisters would always bathe and dress me three or four times a day they thought i was a doll
865566 everybody calls me dr cindy if they need to know something cures ailments diagnoses they call me
865567 i like to study things which is why i enjoyed being a paralegal so much
865568 i remember when i was diagnosed praying that i would live five years long enough for my children to remember me
865569 when that prayer was answered i started praying to live long enough to see them graduate from high school then college and then long enough to see my grandchildren graduate i know you dont bargain with god but i figured asking cant hurt
865570 when i would eat certain things it would cause me to have an accelerated heart rate headache or hypertension
865571 i started cutting preservatives and aged foods out of my diet
865572 doctors attribute a large part of my survival to attitude and faith
865573 i attribute it to all of the above plus being an informed patient i always tell my doctors they have hundreds of patients i only have one
865574 one day this particularly upbeat young lady signed on and in an instant one had to love her
865575 there were times i had wondered how one could fight as long and hard as our cindy crawford did
865576 knowing the extent of her illness and how it would curb even the strongest person im in awe at what she has accomplished with her life since we met im extremely proud to call her a good friend
865577 weve basically doubled sales every year that weve been in business
865578 the cost of that one party was more than i made the first year that i catered its amazing how its grown
865579 shes been smart enough to grow this business slowly and gradually she hasnt had to go out and borrow a lot of money to run the business
865580 it has to have equal importance to us because its equally important to our client
865581 because of that my business was very fortunate to get the start that it needed
865582 its been a wonderful foundation for how i do my business
865583 we work with a client to design a menu that suits them specifically for that event
865584 if a recipe calls for chicken stock then we make chicken stock we dont buy canned stock it has too much sodium and a lot of them have msg im a big label reader
865585 well sit down and figure out things they can eat
865586 im not a dietitian or nutritionist i just help them with what they can tolerate
865587 we wanted it to be more whimsical and fun we took the opportunity to redo the things that we didnt like

865592 the symptoms can take your life and rip it to shreds mocking your dignity and stealing your freedom they ravage your soul they deaden your spirit but they wont kill you
865593 having someone like johnny cash one of the greatest singer songwriters of all time want to cover your song thats something that matters to me its not so much what other people think but the fact that it was worthy of interpreting
865594 if you were to turn on rock radio in the united states theres probably 20 different pop punk type bands that sound exactly the same that sing songy bullshit
865595 the beatles or led zeppelin are the ultimate archetypes for what a rock band can and should be ive just suffered through wolfmother at some festival we just played come on guys im not saying they do a bad job but theyre a fucking cover band
865596 over the years you cant help but get more jaded and think a thing like a grammy in the states doesnt mean anything its not from people that matter its from old men old school business a holes that help their buddies out theres no legitimacy to it

865622 the reds lost for the eighth time in nine games and fell to a season worst 10 games under 500 having failed to gain any noticeable edge from a 20 minute players only meeting prior to batting practice
865623 nos damos cuenta de que vivimos en ciudades porque nos apropiamos de sus espacios casas y parques calles y viaductos pero no recorremos la ciudad s lo a trav s de medios de transporte sino tambi n con los relatos e im genes que confieren apariencia de realidad aun a lo invisible los mapas que inventan y ordenan la trama urbana los discursos que representan lo que ocurre o podr a acontecer en la ciudad seg n lo narran las novelas pel culas y canciones la prensa la radio y la televisi n

865626 we then noticed another gene right next to the first one which looked like it might code for a catalyst that adds a single carbon to chemical compounds
865627 when push came to shove the climate research fell off the table
865628 you can identify patterns of active deformation in a landscape
865629 mountains are formed by tectonic plates pushing against each other and crumpling the crust but mountain ranges can be vast and identifying the zones that are most likely to rupture is a challenge especially in remote and rugged ranges
865630 if you were sitting in chengdu and could lift all the clouds and smog you would see an incredibly steep mountain front rising almost 6000 metres above you just 50 kilometres to the west
865631 if you kayaked down one of these rivers you would hit a point where it falls down steeply along a series of rapids
865632 it is not as simple as saying aha the mountains are steeper here so they must be rising faster and this is where were going to see an earthquake
865633 rocks for instance are not always of the same strength they give in more or less to erosion which is the other factor that affects the slope of a riverbed
865634 you could say it is a quick and dirty reconnaissance tool topography can highlight regions that have the potential for active deformation but then you have to get on the ground and dig around and look at history of earthquakes in region
865635 but that in itself is a huge step compared to nothing
865636 seismologists have limited time and funding to do field studies so if you can direct the selection of sites and go to areas that are most likely of being at risk then you have done something worthwhile
865637 we suspect that because of the hardening fat in the tails the animals could no longer swim and so sank and drowned
865638 but the fish are ok and all the other animals in the olifants river are ok
865639 but if the theoretical limit is higher you can presume that the real figure that you will be able to reach will also be higher
865640 theoretical predictions are only the beginning of the long process to realisation of practical solar cells
865641 have you seen what they use to hike its efficiency titanium i guess thats a very plentiful and cheap mineral so go ahead
865642 when they first come out i guess theyre hungry so theyre eating with lots of gusto and making lots of munching noises
865643 in some measure it makes sense if people buy goods and become liable for the emissions generated when the goods are produced
865644 they will certainly be more choosy about what they buy
865645 even after the backswimmers were rather roughly caught with a bucket
865646 we found a large number of mud pots and mud volcanoes many of which were lined up beyond the accepted end of the san andreas fault
865647 some geologists knew about a few of these pots and one even suggested many years ago that they might indicate a fault
865648 it opens up a chance for geochemical studies of fault zone fluids to contribute to seismic hazard estimates
865649 however in terms of biomass parasitologists and non parasitologists alike have generally assumed parasite biomass to be negligible in comparison with free living organisms
865650 to some extent this already happens but not in response to climate change it is certainly physically possible
865651 i interpret the term designer nature as more about envisaging a new nature that we like through personal preference where the objective is very human centred
865652 our objective is instead to save as many functioning species as possible where functioning means reasonable population sizes and the potential for future evolution in a natural context
865653 virtually the entire planet is already manipulated by humans and by altering the worlds atmosphere and climate we are perturbing every ecosystem on earth
865654 living in a complex natural environment carrying out an ecological function for instance harbouring parasites interacting with other species and evolving
865655 it is suffering from warmer temperatures even where the habitat is still in good shape and has trouble moving north past the urban sprawl of san diego and los angeles
865656 it would be easy to move and should not have a negative impact on the wildlife in its new home region
865657 history shows that nature needs help and that we have successfully helped it in the past
865658 there are all sorts of issues that will arise when you move species which the authors have not addressed
865659 for instance in all these places you are going to move species to there are already species there is not an infinite amount of space
865660 is that there is so far no standardised way of assessing the threat that climate change poses to different species
865661 pimentel estimated 6 kilograms of plant protein are needed to produce 1 kg of high quality animal protein
865662 not that guys back off in regular practice but you know what youre going to get
865663 a game isnt that way when you go into a game you feel guys out theres the unexpected
865664 practicing against other guys forces you to focus a lot more
865665 but im with a new team right now i dont really care what theyre doing
865666 hes going to be very successful in this league his style will take him a long way
865667 that depends on his relationship with the people on top
865668 last year although we werent as successful as we wanted to be it was the most fun ive had playing in my career
865669 you get used to seeing the same looks every day from our defense
865670 this will be more realistic a good gauge of where were at it will be fun
865671 but we knew if we played our ball we could shut him down but hes a great running back you cant take that away from him
865672 all their running plays were to my side the defensive left side
865673 guys that big are usually just power runners he has power and speed
865674 hes a guy whos versatile and always making big plays
865675 hes one of the best backs i faced in the sec im looking forward to practicing against him and playing against him in the preseason game

865677 were going to push through health care reform regardless of the views of the american people
865678 of all tyrannies a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive
865679 today ive taken every step within my power to allow offshore exploration
865680 this means the only thing standing between the american people and these vast oil resources is action from the us congress
865681 in the short term its important for us to have our own reserves as we transition to different kinds of energy
865682 we need to have sufficient oil reserves off our coast to either reduce or at least cushion the increased costs of oil
865683 if offshore drilling would provide short term relief at the pump or a long term strategy for energy independence it would be worthy of our consideration
865684 but most experts even within the bush administration concede it would do neither
865685 the president cruelly is misleading americans for attempted political gain
865686 he knows ruining our coastlines wont bring down gasoline prices nor solve our energy challenges
865687 more drilling riggs will give back some control over supply i think it is good thing
865688 at current rates of oil consumption the arctic national wildlife preserve contains enough oil to power the us for only six months
865689 example a bacteria in a petri dish will grow exponentially until they run out of resources at which point their population will crash
865690 what starts as a slow build up eventually culminates in a very serious outcome
865691 the mortality caused by this population is going to be quite substantial given the distribution of greenhouses through north america and the number of commercial bumble bees being used
865692 in general moving parasites around among different host populations can lead to epidemics and we should be cautious about any economic practices that increase the probability of such movement of parasites
865693 this introduced species isnt going to wipe out just one native its taking out a whole assemblage of native species
865694 i doubt oxygen came from mountains obviously this so called scientist has not studied water
865695 we have to have catalysts which are cheap and we have to have systems which are very robust
865696 i see this as one big step in that direction
865697 you need to shingle your roof with the stuff for it to make a dent
865698 i think the value of this work is not so much in figuring out how we can use it to humankinds advantage but in figuring out that the major rivers of the world may be helping to balance the co 2 inventory of the planet in ways we havent realised before
865699 for the first time we have produced alkanes the main component of gasoline and diesel from lignin and biomethanol becomes available
865700 a large percentage of the starting material is converted into useful products
865701 but this work is still in its infancy so other aspects related to economic issue will be evaluated in the near future
865702 that said the yields of monomers in the new reaction are striking
865703 i believe that approaches such as this will go a considerable way to help us extract valuable molecules including fuels from all components of lignocellulose
865704 radioactive waste is not an acceptable part of any energy
865705 common good ethics and right do not enter any equation they create
865706 this cannot be explained by current generation ipcc class climate models suggesting that these models lack certain mechanisms that could be important in future greenhouse climates
865707 if thats the case then we cant rely on some magical benevolent thermostat that is just going to kick in and keep the tropics from heating up
865708 there are hardly any sediments preserved from this time interval in the continental tropics
865709 the plants should be there in the late paleocene which was colder and gone during the petm
865710 accurate models arent necessary to know that we have a massive problem on our hands
865711 seems to explain some of the observations used to argue that plumes do not exist
865712 but thats two fold higher than the practical storage capacity of gasoline
865713 do you mean that the ecosystems and people that exist on rocks and dirt have no value compared to the opportunity for a priveliged few to live isolated artificial lives consuming with no regard to the efects
865714 the chinese leadership has been thinking about a new pathway
865715 they know they cant repeat the path of the past they know it has to be clean it has to be more efficient low carbon has now been integrated into this new pathway
865716 china has got the green message companies are making profits in pushing forward the low carbon economy
865717 the thinking in china is that there is no doubt that in 20 or 30 years time china will be a world leader
865718 we suggest that a blowout in the banjar panji 1 well was the most likely mechanism for triggering the lusi eruption
865719 dams are the most dangerous man made structure likely to cause quake
865720 in truth it was probably a bad idea for the scientists to be cloud seeding while a storm was building
865721 but mans ability to modify the weather in some small measure can in no way match power of nature
865722 cloud seeders often have the opposite problem they dont know whether theyve had an effect at all
865723 the evolution of the atmosphere is very sensitive to small perturbations
865724 if there is an 80 chance a storm is going to hit miami and if diverting it creates a 10 chance it will hit bermuda what do you do
865725 in my view it is inevitable that it will be tried but that may not be in our lifetime
865726 climate change is a non problem the right answer to a non problem is to have the courage to do nothing
865727 they should all be sent to live on a small pacific island about 3 feet above sea level

865729 factual programmes or items or portrayals of factual matters must not materially mislead the public

865732 there is no evidence at all from earths long climate history that carbon dioxide has ever determined global temperatures
865733 theres money on the table for you to prove this stuff
865734 the common belief that carbon dioxide is driving climate change is at odds with much of the available scientific data data from weather balloons and satellites from ice core surveys and from the historical temperature records
865735 content which materially misleads the audience so as to cause harm and offence

865743 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death

865782 for the first time in its history theyre going to have a magazine that is going to make money when a newspaper is bleeding and you have something that will lift the newspaper immediately why not
865783 actually the magazine turned profits in the early 1990s and in 2004 but the underlying problem was always the advertising department in the early 1990s ad sales staff had financial incentives to sell the magazine they worked then ad department rivalries reasserted themselves and the incentives were killed readership surveys consistently found the magazine was the third best read section on sundays behind a section and calendar the problem wasnt readership the l a times magazine failed for lack of a separate sales staff

865795 on my first week i was saying to people less belt holster more iphone
865796 that to me is for better or worse how i see the brand evolution
865797 we keep preaching about the consumer so if the magazines consumers profile is consistent with certain brand categories then those advertisers will find like minded prospects remember when it was unheard of to advertise automobiles in womens magazines
865798 reader feedback soon after we launched suggested that the rapid weight loss ads were unrealistic and did not fit with the edit in all you
865799 the editor and i together made a policy decision at that point not to carry these ads ever again walking away from significant ad revenue when we were still in launch mode
865800 fashion would be outside of wireds scope since it reports on how technology affects culture the economy and politics
865801 some readers may like it others may not if somehow the ads were tied to technology i could see it having relevance
865802 were not a proxy for broadcast media so there can be a shift as weve seen in the quarter between very measurable marketing services which are the largest part of our company vs what is spent in broadcast or some of the other media areas so we have seen shifts we havent seen reductions to our revenue base

865804 adopted a principle that companies should devote a significant amount of time educating physicians about a new medicine before they commence advertising
865805 the posters need to raise awareness of the impact of climate change especially among peer groups and most importantly to motivate people to take action by bringing conservation friendly initiatives into their lives and workplaces

865851 the only plausible explanation we can find is that the iranians are figuring out how to launch a missile from a ship and get it up to altitude and then detonate it
865852 and thats exactly what you would do if you had a nuclear weapon on a scud or a shahab 3 or other missile and you wanted to explode it over the united states
865853 if even a crude nuclear weapon were detonated anywhere between 40 kilometers to 400 kilometers above the earth in a split second it would generate an electro magnetic pulse emp that would cripple military and civilian communications power transportation water food and other infrastructure
865854 you have to go back into the 1800s to look at the size of population
865855 id have to say that 70 to 90 percent of the population would not be sustainable after this kind of attack
865856 explicitly discuss a nuclear emp attack that would gravely harm the united states
865857 an emp attack on america would send us back to the horse and buggy era without the horse and buggy
865858 if youre a terrorist this is your ultimate goal your ultimate asymmetric weapon
865859 they could do it either directly or anonymously by putting some freighter out there on the ocean
865860 its well known that people dont go on a diet until theyve had a heart attack
865861 and we as a nation are having a heart attack
865862 as of today we have no defense against such an attack we need space based missile defenses to protect against an emp attack
865863 theyve got test ranges in iran which are more than long enough to handle scud launches and even shahab 3 launches
865864 why would they be launching from the surface of the caspian sea they obviously have not explained that to us
865865 detonated the warhead near apogee not over the target area where the thing would eventually land but at altitude
865866 the only plausible explanation we can find is that the iranians are figuring out how to launch a missile from a ship and get it up to altitude and then detonate it
865867 and thats exactly what you would do if you had a nuclear weapon on a scud or a shahab 3 or other missile and you wanted to explode it over the united states
865868 a nation can survive its fools and even the ambitious but it cannot survive treason from within an enemy at the gates is less formidable for he is known and he carries his banners openly but the traitor moves among those within the gate freely his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys heard in the very halls of government itself for the traitor appears not traitor he speaks in the accents familiar to his victims and he wears their face and their garments and he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men he rots the soul of a nation he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of a city he seeks to infect the foundation so that it can no longer resist a murderer is less to be feared
865869 this is our last warning to china and the rest of the world the viewers and athletes especially those who are muslim who plan to go to the olympics should change their plans and not go to china the turkistan islamic party plans military attacks on people offices arenas and other activities that are connected to the chinese olympic games
865870 but in iraqi culture it is very difficult to search women we had to find a way to fill this gap
865871 the scholarships started out as an idea to engage students at a local careers expo and with the support from a number of local organisations the scholarships have grown from there
865872 this year for the first time we have been able to gain some corporate sponsorship from bp australia
865873 my plans are to continue to expand the scholarships by encouraging other corporate and local businesses to get behind supporting local youth to do the best they can and to start planning their future career pathways
865874 terrorists should be perceived and described as criminals not holy warriors and our analysis suggests there is no battlefield solution to terrorism
865875 the united states has the necessary instruments to defeat al qaida it just needs to shift its strategy
865876 today they have consented that the existing 5 000 or 6 000 centrifuges not be increased and that operation of this number of centrifuges is not a problem
865877 announcements like this whatever the true number is are not productive and will only serve to further isolate iran from the international community
865878 ultimately it is not president ahmadinejad who decides irans nuclear policy but the countrys spiritual leader ali khamenei
865879 ahmadinejad will not compromise because he seeks confrontation but khamenei or another presidential candidate may be tempted to accept a compromise package drawn up by the west in return for halting uranium enrichment
865880 we will approach whoever is elected before the inauguration and will be having discussions with campaign staffs between now and the election
865881 we will draft presidential directives that can be imposed by the new president immediately
865882 agencies need to cooperate rather than compete with each other as they work to protect the united states from a broad range of new dangers never imagined
865883 allowing problems to escape presidential attention until they worsen and reach the crisis level
865884 we will approach whoever is elected before the inauguration and will be having discussions with campaign staffs between now and the election
865885 we will draft presidential directives that can be imposed by the new president immediately
865886 when you become roadkill when you happen to have lost some weight and youre not really healthy but you know one thing you know that you have worked your ass off and youre not smart enough to know the answer thats tough
865887 this approach crystallises value for the group on an ongoing basis
865888 im convinced that the korean government is doing everything it can to progress this transaction
865889 we will submit a revised application to fsc financial services commission as soon as practicable
865890 my knowledge is that hsbc board could not decide whether to extend the deal because the price renegotiation has not finished
865891 medical science has proven that the keys to changing the outcom
865892 its my winter break and i dont do school stuff on my break
865893 my daughter is supposed to get her license wednesday you must do her drives monday and tuesday cant you take her to dallas and back ill pay for the gas
865894 according to our contract at precisely midnight at the moment of her greatest triumph the party of the first part thats you agrees to render up her soul now and forever more to the party of the second part thats me shall we go
865895 one of the things that troubles me most is that the rapid fire publication of unsettled results in highly visible venues creates the impression that the scientific community has no idea whats going on
865896 lablit is all about encouraging the use of realistic depictions of science and scientists in realistic fiction
865897 its a wonderful venture and a topic of the most resonant importance
865898 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
865899 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
865900 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
865901 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
865902 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
865903 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
865904 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
865905 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
865906 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
865907 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
865908 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
865909 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
865910 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
865911 rioters drove two vehicles to break into the border patrol armed police division
865912 i had an opportunity to talk to brett favre today
865913 hell be reinstated he will go through a physical just like every other player thats come through hell go through a conditioning test at that time there will be a conversation with brett from that conversation there will be information in that conversation that i will use to make a decision on how we move forward with the quarterback position i will share that with the team first theres been no decision made its important for brett and i to sit down face to face and have a discussion
865914 theres been no promises once again theres been indecision throughout bretts path back to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate there are some things we need to go through
865915 if there was a game tomorrow aaron rodgers would be our starter
865916 ill tell you this its not the first time ive been booed and it probably wont be the last
865917 as much as it affects this team and affects me personally him coming back its out of my control
865918 the president called the meeting in order to brief jean facilitation process
865919 why bother with the meeting i can tell you now what mbeki will say that a breakthrough is imminent
865920 the standing council is meeting for its regular briefing and obviously the mou memorandum of understanding will be high on the agenda
865921 the war vets say that our children cannot be allowed to attend zanu pf schools because their parents are sellouts they tell us that we should build our own mdc schools that we should send our children to
865922 last week a parent came here to complain to us after his children had been sent back home despite him having no fees arrears while we were still explaining to him a group of about five war veterans stormed the headmasters office and sent the man packing with sticks they accused him of trying to run the school yet his party had nothing to do with it
865923 the article also talks of the support mugabe enjoys from the zimbabwean armed forces but he must be acceptable to the armed forces because he needs their support but even they must respect the will of the people
865924 matonga himself is a man of low standards easily borne out by his ludicrous statements in the past few months challenging the british to invade zimbabwe and also labelling the efforts by the us and the uk to have sanctions enforced on mugabe and his government as racist i have actually heard matonga in an interview trade insults with a fellow panelist which culminated in matonga calling the other panelist racist whilst defending himself saying that he is not a racist as he has married a white it would appear that matongas first wifes family are not impressed this is how he pays her after all that she has done for him abandoning a woman who made him what he is today because of this other woman
865925 he is an ungrateful bastard so he is trying to curry favour with the president by marrying his niece
865926 the taxi fare goes up while she is in class
865927 weve neglected our rivers across the state for so long theres only one or two rivers in the state that are actually receiving their environmental flows at the moment
865928 everywhere else the environmental flows have been suspended and thats not a good situation to be in given that we know climate change will bring further pressures on those rivers

865932 not that guys back off in regular practice but you know what youre going to get
865933 a game isnt that way when you go into a game you feel guys out theres the unexpected
865934 practicing against other guys forces you to focus a lot more
865935 but im with a new team right now i dont really care what theyre doing
865936 hes going to be very successful in this league his style will take him a long way
865937 that depends on his relationship with the people on top
865938 last year although we werent as successful as we wanted to be it was the most fun ive had playing in my career
865939 you get used to seeing the same looks every day from our defense
865940 this will be more realistic a good gauge of where were at it will be fun
865941 but we knew if we played our ball we could shut him down but hes a great running back you cant take that away from him
865942 all their running plays were to my side the defensive left side
865943 guys that big are usually just power runners he has power and speed
865944 hes a guy whos versatile and always making big plays
865945 hes one of the best backs i faced in the sec im looking forward to practicing against him and playing against him in the preseason game

865978 anyone who voted for me has very little in common with the republican party if you care about the issues i care about and the future that i outlined during my campaign then you really have to stay with us in the democratic party and vote for sen obama to be our next president
865979 the way to continue our fight now to accomplish the goals for which we stand is to take our energy our passion our strength and do all we can to help elect barack obama the next president of the united states
865980 i want her campaigning as much as she can she was a terrific campaigner she i think inspired millions of people and so she can be an extraordinarily effective surrogate for me and the values and ideals that we share as democrats
865981 i think we will have a terrific time together in new hampshire and i think that she will be very effective all the way through the election
865982 theres no one i would rather be on a ticket with than john mccain
865983 let me point out that all during the campaign when i was his rival not a running mate there was no one who was more complimentary of him publicly and privately

865994 its close all we can do is just go out and do what weve been doing try to get top fives and top 10s and if we continue to do what weve been doing were gonna win some races and make the chase and everything is gonna be great
865995 we knew when we stayed out there when it rained that we were about three laps short of making it on one stop
865996 unless we had more rain or more caution laps we knew we were gonna be a little short thats just what we chose to do i thought it was gonna rain one more time we didnt think it was gonna rain out but i though there was gonna be another little delay and then we would have been able to make it

866047 start with a business strategy defining carefully what you want to accomplish through the community
866048 invest most in the area that services your key business objective
866049 make sure you deliver real special unique obvious value to the core group youre hoping to attract
866050 the core of the community needs to be of high value or interest to people a focus worth contributing to
866051 get insight into what motivates members to join the community we found a different motivation than we hypothesised
866052 too often people get drunk with web 2 0 tool excitement and then try to push their business and customer goals into the wrong tool
866053 focus on the lowest common denominator first keep it easy to navigate with simple tools to use
866054 people are busy they need information in brief easy to scan bits they can quickly choose what is interesting to them and go right to it
866055 think of how to create events what can you do to excite people and get them to share in the community
866056 make sure you devote enough time to managing the community letting it fester is worse than not having it in the first place
866057 participate but do not try to control the community belongs to the people not you
866058 get legal and pr to buy in and help on design but keep them out of active management
866059 make sure you have a committed core of passionate users before you launch
866060 you must have a critical number of high quality participants to get the momentum going

866064 the development of the printing press was similarly criticised for making books readily available with the prospect of intellectual laziness and a weakening of minds obviously whilst maybe containing a grain of truth the eventual upsides far out weighted these fears
866065 one of nietzsches friends a composer noticed a change in the style of his writing his already terse prose had become even tighter more telegraphic perhaps you will through this instrument even take to a new idiom the friend wrote in a letter noting that in his own work his thoughts in music and language often depend on the quality of pen and paper you are right nietzsche replied our writing equipment takes part in the forming of our thoughts under the sway of the machine writes the german media scholar friedrich a kittler nietzsches prose changed from arguments to aphorisms from thoughts to puns from rhetoric to telegram style

866159 barack obama coming up here and competing here is going to force john mccain to make a choice
866160 for everything that mccain does up here thats a little bit less that he can do in these big battleground states we always hear about

866180 we have to stay in character from the morning until the time we leave
866181 i think patrons would be very surprised by how much thought goes into that
866182 its just a passion for the show and for the people

866204 as a candidate for the nomination i supported the dncs efforts to establish and enforce a schedule for primaries and caucuses that would broaden the opportunity for democrats from all regions of the country and all backgrounds and walks of life to have a meaningful voice
866205 as we prepare to come together in denver however we must be and will be united in our determination to change the course of our nation to that end democrats in florida and michigan must know that they are full partners and colleagues in our historic mission to reshape washington and lead our country in a new direction
866206 this matter will be the top priority for the credentials committee when we meet on august 24 as always our goal is to ensure a fair process and a unified democratic party so that we can win in november

866251 existe informaci n de que usted mantuvo conversaciones con montesinos estando en par s dice que no
866252 que yo sepa nadie ha tomado el nombre del doctor montesinos para llamarme hubiera sido de lo m s curioso recibir una llamada de montesinos

866254 durante estos diez a os que usted viv a en el per yo tuve que vivir fuera por culpa del gobierno de montesinos de manera que no entiendo esa relaci n salvo que yo sea un masoquista absoluto cosa que no soy en segundo lugar que alguien presuma que montesinos me llame es muy gracioso me ha llamado mucha gente haciendo bromas diciendo que era montesinos o que era fujimori

866263 i cannot imagine it and so if he said that and i dont know the context i strenuously disagree
866264 the fact that john mccains top adviser says that a terrorist attack on american soil would be a big advantage for their political campaign is a complete disgrace and is exactly the kind of politics that needs to change

866302 for the last 8 years bush with mccains support have lost the respect of our allies wont it be great and powerful to regain that respect so the us does not have to go it alone
866303 for the last 8 years americans have been ashamed of its leaders wont it be great to have a leader again that has won the respect of both world leaders and the people they represent
866304 this is the support we had after 9 11 and then bush with mccains support squandered it to john mccain it is a big joke something to mock and hes spending millions of dollars to belittle me this time when you vote vote as if your whole world depended on it because it does
866305 theres a good reason john mccain does not draw large enthusiastic crowds he has nothing to say that george bush has not been saying and he does not know what he is talking about when he does
866306 john mccain claims to have experience but has it been useful he didnt know you were hurting economically he didnt even understand who the enemy is in iraq he still has not apologized to the american people for promoting and voting for the war in iraq
866307 john mccain brought to you by the same people who brought you george bush
866308 how did this ever happen to a little old town like ours

866320 immature testing organizations tend to have about five clean tests for every dirty test mature testing organizations tend to have five dirty tests for every clean test this ratio is not reversed by reducing the clean tests its done by creating 25 times as many dirty tests
866321 but perfectly executed code coverage doesn t mean users will use your program
866322 numerous studies have found that test cases are as likely to have errors as the code they re testing
866323 immature testing organizations tend to have about five clean tests for every dirty test
866324 if youre the head of qa and you hear that your developers are working test first
866325 you should think good for them now we can focus on the truly diabolical tests instead of worrying about these dead on arrival problems
866326 to cap it all off developer testing isn t all that effective at finding defects

866344 my staff refused to go with them to the station insisting that they had not committed a crime that warranted a visit to the police station

866348 the average of most agricultural commodity prices over the next 10 years will still exceed the average of the previous decade by about 10 to 50 percent in real terms depending on the commodity you look at
866349 today around 862 million people are suffering from hunger and malnourishment this highlights the need to reinvest in agriculture
866350 the poor and in particular the urban poor in net food importing countries will suffer more
866351 in many low income countries food expenditures average over 50 percent of income and the higher prices will push more people into undernourishment
866352 rising food prices mean an erosion of the capacity to meet basic needs and this is likely to become a potential source of political tension and even violence
866353 there is no such thing as a risk free environment in this country

866376 when jesus rodriguez was picked as the muralist who was going to do this he came before the board and he talked about how he researched his project i think we all knew that it was going to be a great representation but it just surpassed i think all of our imagination in terms of it authenticity how well it captures the individuals
866377 the reason we picked leona is because ross told me years ago that they were in fact the very first park forest residents
866378 phil klutznick liked to say that he moved in first because apparently they had their furniture in there court b 1 but mrs klutznick was expecting a baby and so as a result they were not able to move in and the delues actually moved in first

866388 what may be known about god is plain to them because god has made it plain to them for since the creation of the world gods invisible qualities his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly seen being understood from what has been made so that men are without excuse for although they knew god they neither glorified him as god nor gave thanks to him but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened
866389 do not be deceived god cannot be mocked a man reaps what he sows the one who sows to please his sinful nature from that nature will reap destruction the one who sows to please the spirit from the spirit will reap eternal life

866415 go up to hilkiah the high priest and have him count the money the gatekeepers have collected from the people at the lord s temple entrust this money to the men assigned to supervise the temples restoration then they can use it to pay workers to repair the temple of the lord they will need to hire carpenters builders and masons also have them buy the timber and the cut stone needed to repair the temple but there will be no need for the construction supervisors to keep account of the money they receive for they are honest people
866416 i have found the book of the law in the lord s temple
866417 your officials have given the money collected at the temple of the lord to the workers and supervisors at the temple
866418 go to the temple and speak to the lord for me and for the people and for all judah ask him about the words written in this scroll that has been found the lords anger is burning against us because our ancestors have not obeyed the words in this scroll we have not been doing what this scroll says we must do
866419 dont you know that you yourselves are gods temple and that his spirit dwells in you
866420 the lords anger is burning against us because our ancestors have not obeyed the words in this scroll we have not been doing what this scroll says we must do
866421 you shall have no other gods or anything else between your face and mine
866422 why me thats too huge there are so many people more qualified and better equipped for it ive messed up too many times in my life to be used on that kind of a scale
866423 do you think i care about any of that no i created you with a purpose and a destiny that i intend to carry out
866424 1 timothy 6 3 to the galatians paul writes but even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you let him be eternally condemned
866425 do not let anyone who delights in false humility and the worship of angels disqualify you for the prize
866426 there will be false teachers among you they will secretly introduce destructive heresies many will follow their shameful ways and will bring the way of truth into disrepute in their greed these teachers will exploit you with stories they have made up
866427 this includes trying to induce the experience yourself as i mentioned in the last paragraph
866428 everyone has a right to these things and youre missing out if youre not seeing heaven

866434 if your son asks for a fish will you give him a snake if he asks for bread will you give him a stone or if he asks for an egg will you give him a scorpion no way in the same way your heavenly father will certainly give the holy spirit to those who ask him
866435 for false christs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and miracles to deceive even the elect
866436 therefore it is my judgment that we do not trouble those who are turning to god from among the gentiles but that we write to them that they abstain from things contaminated by idols and from fornication and from what is strangled and from blood
866437 some specific presentations of the gospel that market themselves as complete but are sadly lacking in the most important areas
866438 i want you to return i want you to repent because i want to bring blessing i want to leave a blessing behind my manifold goodness and kindness i want you to return to me so that i can bind you up and heal you if you will return then i can begin to come with the rain of my presence again as i begin to turn your captivity around i want to bring you blessing and fruitfulness i want you to repent because if you repent i can give you mercy and when i can give you mercy i can give you healing that is my heart
866439 does not that lamb who was slain deserve the reward of his suffering
866440 how could false gospels be running rampant in the church wouldnt a false gospel be obvious it would deny jesus christ say he didnt come in the flesh or somehow blaspheme god right

866446 god heal me god bless me god make me feel good god do this and god do that
866447 art you have a knack for writing about something and making it appear as though you have that thing all figured out
866448 when we put bizarre behavior on the platform we imply that it is normative thus more strange fire is allowed to spread
866449 therefore hear the word of the lord i saw the lord sitting on his throne with all the host of heaven standing around him on his right and on his left and the lord said who will entice ahab into attacking ramoth gilead and going to his death there
866450 one suggested this and another that finally a spirit came forward stood before the lord and said i will entice him
866451 i will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets he said
866452 you will succeed in enticing him said the lord go and do it
866453 so now the lord has put a lying spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours the lord has decreed disaster for you
866454 thats a little hard to count how many of you would be willing to say that all you saw was the back of your eyelids

866462 you should know one thing i put a little bit of dog poop in them but its only a little bit
866463 amen so be it may this be the beginning of the revival weve been crying out for may the healing power of god be poured forth from heaven on a global scale
866464 todd bentleys gift of healing is true but his method of ministry is unnecessarily theatrical and many of his teachings are littered with falsehoods
866465 branham never raised his voice when he was speaking nor did he use any showy tactics
866466 yes i do know why i fell over you pushed me
866467 often if the anointing was not present branham would simply cut his meetings short and walk out leaving thousands frustrated branham sometimes did this if he felt the congregation was looking too exclusively at him to effect the healings
866468 when a severely inflicted person comes up on the stage for healing and doesnt fall over when he screams bam in their face todd immediately changes the subject either by calling out another word of knowledge or telling everyone that the atmosphere is changing either an angel has shown up or a new glory is filling the place
866469 we are all shocked that each night a minimum of 60 percent are first time visitors
866470 have we completely forgotten the warnings of lying signs and wonders in the last days
866471 this is what the lord almighty the god of israel says i will break the yoke of the king of babylon
866472 amen may the lord do so may the lord fulfill the words you have prophesied by bringing the articles of the lords house and all the exiles back to this place from babylon nevertheless listen to what i have to say in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people from early times the prophets who preceded you and me have prophesied war disaster and plague against many countries and great kingdoms but the prophet who prophesies peace will be recognized as one truly sent by the lord only if his prediction comes true
866473 this is what the lord says in the same way will i break the yoke of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon off the neck of all the nations within two years
866474 go and tell hananiah this is what the lord says you have broken a wooden yoke but in its place you will get a yoke of iron
866475 love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth it always protects always trusts always hopes always perseveres
866476 i tell you the truth whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven again i tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for it will be done for you by my father in heaven for where two or three come together in my name there am i with them
866477 and see now i go bound in the spirit to jerusalem not knowing the things that will happen to me there

866484 ive been thinking a lot about all the things you said yesterday and all the wisdom i heard in what you said was there some person whose beliefs have really influenced you and made an impact on the way you believe
866485 there was actually one guy in particular that has had a profound influence on my beliefs
866486 therefore you are inexcusable o man whoever you are who judge for in whatever you judge another you condemn yourself for you who judge practice the same things
866487 do not judge or you too will be judged for in the same way you judge others you will be judged and with the measure you use it will be measured to you
866488 im not going to say anything now because i need to make sure my heart is right before talking about this but im not particularly thrilled with the changes either
866489 what is there in me that would make me a point person for all this murmering
866490 i am the resurrection and the life he who believes in me will live even though he dies and whoever lives and believes in me will never die do you believe this
866491 i believe that you are the christ the son of god who was to come into the world

866495 do not think that because you are in the kings house you alone of all the jews will escape for if you remain silent at this time relief and deliverance for the jews will arise from another place but you and your fathers family will perish and who knows but that you have come to royal position for such a time as this
866496 go gather together all the jews who are in susa and fast for me do not eat or drink for three days night or day i and my maids will fast as you do when this is done i will go to the king even though it is against the law and if i perish i perish

866517 the chaos precipitated by the killing poses dangers beyond pakistans immediate neighborhood said jack rosen a past president of the american jewish congress noting that pakistan is one of a handful of declared nuclear powers and the only muslim country with the bomb if the government fell into extremist hands the bomb also falls into the hands of extremists rosen told jta you dont need to worry about a nuclear iran you have a nuclear pakistan in the hands of extremists

866721 with lucky 8 when america wins essentially everyone wins possibly eight times its a fun way for people to bring the excitement just a little closer to home
866722 the combination of limos transparent governance model balanced development model and extensive mobile industry heritage sets it apart and has garnered strong industry support and engagement
866723 this next wave of limo handsets points to the innovation that will flow as the industry coalesces on the limo platform
866724 limo was founded on the notion that fragmentation of the mobile industry among dozens of proprietary closed operating systems was inhibiting innovation
866725 with such a variety of industry players cost effectively adopting the limo platform for non differentiating handset middleware more development resources are being devoted to enhancing the consumer experience this new wave of limo handsets serves as proof
866726 over the past five years the apparel industry has experienced remarkable changes generating challenges from intense competition to pricing pressures to season and line complexity to time to market
866727 as a result apparel brands retailers and suppliers need a system to streamline their communication and make sure everyone is on the same page which ultimately benefits the overall business were proud to partner with global apparel industry leader zymmetry group to deliver the very first solution to address these demands by approaching product development and sourcing as a unified business process
866728 for global virtual teams designing products 24 hours a day faxes and e mails dont work anymore our industry needs a system that helps create a seamless responsive relationship between the trend setting creative side of the business and the practical business and production side where costs can be managed the enovia apparel sourcing solution is the glue that ties everything together
866729 industry consolidation the emergence of private equity the high cost of failure the reduction in operating margins and the substantial working capital required have all created demands that require the industry to force its way to a streamlined level of efficiency
866730 if the garment industry or a brand organize themselves and concentrate religiously on creating and maintaining an efficient supply chain on specialization and on collaboration there is no doubt that profit and success will soon follow
866731 limos consensual governance model and balanced collaborative development methodology have set it apart from other platform initiatives and continue to garner wide industry support
866732 these 11 new members will join the development of a consistent and competitive global handset os operating system within which the collaborative benefits of shared cost and innovation are realized and upon which diverse commercially driven differentiation freely thrives
866733 limo greatly appreciates the commitment to openness and collaboration taken by all of our new members todays announcement includes several former lips forum participants that have chosen to redirect their resources into limo in order to drive unification of the mobile ecosystem
866734 limos broad industry engagement demonstrates the fact that limo offers an open transparent and equitable opportunity for established industry players and newcomers alike to shape and drive innovation within the limo platform
866735 we are pleased to partner with cctv com to bring immersive interactive web experiences to millions of sports fans

866755 epas irresponsible inappropriate decision has failed navajo communities and needlessly sacrificed our air land and water
866756 it is a devastating blow to tribal members who continually suffer from the large coal complex encroaching upon our land
866757 this air permit seriously undermines regional efforts to clean up the air and promote renewable energy projects
866758 if the coal plant is built it will add to health problems already facing tribal members and residents of both new mexico and colorado
866759 this is a political decision not one based on science or epas own mandate
866760 epa ramrodded this permit out the door in response to a lawsuit filed by the coal plant owner whose lawyer jeff holmstead was a high level epa official in the bush administration it looks like hes still giving orders to epas staff
866761 is epas rush to judgment on this permit decision sithe complains that the epa should have issued the permit several years ago but the whole reason this is taking so long is because the concept for desert rock is faulty epa still hasnt finished a thorough evaluation of the project but its allowing a former agency official to bully it into rushing this permit out the door
866762 we plan to vigorously contest the permit to prevent a tremendous setback to the efforts of state and local governments and dedicated citizens to rein in global warming pollution and to protect the health of area residents

866766 if we sign up for that deal and send you a big pile of us for it then if we back out within 60 days we would get back the whole pile of us right
866767 if a customer pays for a long term contract say 3 years and then downgrades at say 1 year into the contract does the customer get a refund so that they are paying for the remaining 2 years at the rate of the downgraded service
866768 can they do this by simply paying the difference between their existing plan and the upgraded one

866773 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
866774 it absolutely bewilders me why canada is so determined to bring in these huge numbers of temporary workers to put the resources into making it easy for employers to bring temporary workers when first of all weve got hundreds of thousands of people that have paid their money and are waiting in line to come here as immigrants who already want to make a commitment to build the rest of their lives here
866775 and secondly weve got a group of well educated competent people who have already come as immigrants who the statistics tell us are living a longer time than ever more deeply in poverty in canada and so those things are going on and we keep bringing more and more temporary workers to let employers fill jobs at low wages everybody loses in the equation
866776 the reality is that canada has a hugely positive reputation because we do take a lot of people and theres only a few countries that do but what has been really a much more shining reputation i think theres the beginning of some tarnish on that as the temporary worker stuff gets out
866777 the temporary worker stuff is so blunt it just says to people well let you come here and work but you have zero chance of becoming a canadian or having you and your family live and work here
866778 the volume of horror stories of employers mistreating temporary workers is just shameful
866779 there is no abuse of a worker that an employer can commit that youve ever heard of that we havent heard a story from a foreign worker of
866780 the whole temporary worker program should be completely reconsidered the whole program is a mistake
866781 we need more staff in citizenship and immigration both in canada and at consulates abroad processing applications faster giving people definite answers and letting them come here because we can use the people obviously we need more immigrants or we wouldnt be bringing 40 000 or 50 000 temporary workers more to the country than we used to so the two go hand in hand stop the temporary foreign worker program but improve and speed up an immigrants chance to get here
866782 typically i think the liberals pursued what some people have called an ethnic brokerage model of outreach where they would identify leaders of certain groups who somehow magically would become the recipients of substantial grants and subsidies for their community organizations
866783 they would establish a kind of tammany hall operation of patronage with certain individuals and certain organizations that i think is the kind of cynical and passe approach that is not relevant to the diversity of canada today
866784 obviously its no secret that the vast majority of new canadians do settle in our largest cities typically our three largest cities so i think its vitally important to the future prospects of the conservative party in our metropolitan areas
866785 we do listen and if there are particular issues in communities of interest we try to be responsive to those
866786 but i can tell you one thing we dont go around trying to set up community godfathers in different communities which is the liberal model we dont go around picking winners and losers for government grants
866787 they agreed to review the case and they give us a positive decision
866788 we get to stay thats wonderful the kids were extremely happy it was big big news the family were just doing great were really happy most important for the kids cause their future is what we were talking about now we know that their future will be secure
866789 its hard to find words how to say thank you to everybody but thats our most important message right now we really want to say thank you to everybody to each person that help us or support us in anyway
866790 canada will benefit from keeping these excellent and hard working community members
866791 theyre constantly trying to please and thats what got them in trouble
866792 i told canadian border services officials you grill people with questions but you dont give them a chance to respond
866793 if youre not conversant in the english language you can imagine what that would be like
866794 i do know that both cic and cbsa are happy and pleased with the result and that these dancers are able to come back and share some cultural experiences
866795 dealing with government is like trying to do business with your head cut off
866796 people look at what happened at the airport in the past
866797 things like that leave a lasting memory for a lot of people when the next incident happens
866798 we visit their country quite often and never have problems getting in and out
866799 immigration has come forward with a guarantee that when they come friday there wont be any issues at the border and thats all we could ask for
866800 i feel very good about it it has been so many years just the waiting
866801 we are happy and everybody is happy because it is good news its been a long time were waiting
866802 i just have a soft spot for people who need help
866803 they seemed very nice and its just a great feeling being able to help somebody
866804 he melgar says hes comfortable with his life now because he knows hes not going to be put on a plane in two minutes and sent back he can now start rooting his life because prior to this point they didnt know if they were here or there and now they have some stability im very happy for them because they can now start fresh without this cloud over their head
866805 because without this public support the government wouldnt have listened
866806 you have to understand that to the government they melgar and molina are just a number and there are a million and one cases that are all the same and they cant look at all of them individually
866807 i think it was one of the key ingredients to having the removal order stayed and also one of the key ingredients to having immigration canada pressed to review the situation and come to the proper conclusion
866808 to tell you the truth i wasnt surprised at the eventual outcome but i was surprised that it got to the stage that there was a removal order
866809 we will go to the church to say thank you to pray for thanks for all those people who have helped us
866810 i was pretty much hanging out most of the time
866811 when half the class drops out its not our kids
866812 look you can get deported tomorrow do you want to get deported as a garbage collector or deported as a doctor
866813 there will be people all over the world who will have you
866814 it was the next best thing compared to other things that didnt get my attention
866815 i had nothing to do i felt like a loser
866816 i would have probably just dropped out of high school
866817 i didnt really tell them anything until toward the end where we had to ask them for permission to go to california
866818 well get our butts kicked well take notes and well come back next year
866819 the kids did it the next two years to prove that it wasnt a fluke
866820 but i didnt want our kids to be subjected to that discrimination
866821 i want to teach the teachers something that they havent done yet
866822 when i go back to carl hayden im a god to them
866823 im just another student who was trying to do something
866824 most kids came over when they were young and they didnt have a choice
866825 like me i didnt have a choice they dragged me over here pretty much
866826 if students are here and do a good job in school why cant you give a chance for those students
866827 thats what this country needs the country is already bringing in educated people from other countries to do that work
866828 i dont know how much of a difference that makes but we made a dent
866829 you dont really get to hear it in the mass media about us these success stories you usually just hear the negative side
866830 it was pretty good i saw people having barbecue on the side of the street it was a good race
866831 people put up tents in the front yards they have a party they have a get together its been a huge success this thing is going to be here for a long time to come
866832 we made it on the podium for the first time im excited i told them i wont raise anybodys taxes i got on the podium
866833 the shoulder is really sore at the moment you just got to keep it as still as you can but its ok in general
866834 this is right up there with downers grove and downer avenue up in milwaukee all of the superweek events
866835 we sat out in their front yard and watched them go all the way up the road its pretty neat
866836 ive got enough money and im in a leadership role
866837 what i have to do is appeal to voters common sense and ask them if with the state in the condition its in is something wrong here
866838 he cant be doing a great job if the states in a mess
866839 i knew rep washington was going to have quite a bit of money and i knew angelo running against an incumbent was going to have trouble raising money
866840 this practice is really about organization building and safeguarding your fortress as the boss of the area

866903 both spr and lspr systems were recently introduced in portable forms and these solutions are very elegant and space efficient
866904 however the spectrum analyzers on which they rely require complex data processing performed by a pc further simplification of the lspr system would require replacement of the spectrum analyzer with another device giving a straightforward electrical output such as voltage
866905 palm sized biodetection system based on localized surface plasmon resonance
866906 measuring only the intensity of the reflected light at a few selected wavelengths could lead to a calculation of the peak shift
866907 in fact a lspr system with high reproducibility could even be based on the amplitude of the reflected light intensity at a selected wavelength the consequence of this is significant as this would allow replacement of the spectrum analyzer and subsequent signal processing scheme by a single source of monochromatic light and a photodiode as detector the resulting photocurrent output could then be converted into a voltage by an operational amplifier with a resistor in a feedback loop i v converter and detected by a voltmeter
866908 this was interesting indeed and we started to investigate where the color change was originating from
866909 at that point we also started to think about how to measure this effect without using fancy instrumentation
866910 we have upgraded a previously reported single channel optical system based on a lock in amplification technique
866911 an integrated fluorescence detection system for lab on a chip applications
866912 each light source was modulated at a different frequency and the composite signal detected by the photodiode was demodulated to provide four outputs corresponding to four individual signals each related to one light source the optical system was also redesigned to accommodate four 5 mm diameter leds mounted around a photodiode detector as the reflected light intensity from the lspr chips is much greater than the previously detected fluorescence the new optical system requires lower efficiency that was achieved by the longer optical path between leds and the photodiode as well as using less sensitive photodiode than earlier

867285 that conforming your life to christ doesnt necessarily mean giving up a homosexual lifestyle
867286 such actions and views as those above fly in the face of the clear teaching of the holy scriptures and the resolutions of the lambeth conference 1998 rowan williams would not have the confidence of the vast majority of anglicans in the world who are now in the third world and who as loyal anglicans take the holy scriptures as their supreme authority his appointment would lead to a major split in the anglican communion including the church of england
867287 if his consecration proceeds many provinces are likely to consider themselves to be out of communion with the episcopal church usa this will tear the fabric of our communion at its deepest level and may lead to further division on this and further issues as provinces have to decide in consequence whether they can remain in communion with provinces that choose not to break communion with the episcopal church usa
867288 strangely before the deadline and before the primates could get the opportunity of meeting to assess the adequacy of the response of tec the episcopal church and in a clear demonstration of unwillingness to follow through our collective decisions which for many of us was an apparent lack of regard for the primates lambeth palace in july 2007 issued invitations to tec bishops including those who consecrated gene robinson to attend the lambeth 2008 conference at this point it dawned upon us regrettably that the archbishop of canterbury was not interested in what matters to us in what we think or in what we say

867294 it professes the faith which is uniquely revealed in the holy scriptures of the old and new testament as containing all things necessary for salvation and as being the rule and ultimate standard of faith and which is set forth in the catholic creeds and to which the historic formularies of the church of england bear significant witness which faith the church is called upon to proclaim afresh in each generation
867295 would respect the dogmas of the church epitomized in the creeds as showing in the language and thought forms of the age that produced them balanced and authoritative affirmations excluding false theological solutions and including the necessary theological ingredients for such christians however both doctrines and dogmas are so inadequate to the living reality of whom they are the attempted theological formulations that they cannot command full commitment or loyalty in the best sense of the word they are provisional

867418 70 percent of americans with a religious affiliation say that many religions not just their own can lead to eternal life
867419 bolstered by the fact that among nondenominational church members responding to the pew survey the percentage of those claiming many religions can lead to eternal life is much lower
867420 for example 34 percent of nondenominational evangelicals agreed with the many religions option
867421 how much do you agree disagree if a person is sincerely seeking god he she can obtain eternal life through religions other than christianity

867476 fine there you go reds go die of tar poisoning
867477 i dont know exactly we just sort of find out as we go its all part of the fun i guess
867478 i just wanted to talk to you sometime yknow you seem pretty cool
867479 theres nowhere else to get a job in this shit hole
867480 they just keep knocking them out of the park ive seen every one of them
867481 i think this is going to address some major issues with marriages and its got enough evangelism in it that people can get saved
867482 obviously we think that marriage is a crucial issue to address in our culture inside and outside the church
867483 marriage has become simply a contract a piece of paper we hope that the movie is going to impact homes not only inside the church but outside the church because every one of us knows a couple that struggles either we are or we know somebody who is
867484 if couples learn some things out of this film that will help them in their marriage then it will be successful to us if we can help save some marriages that are on the brink of going off a cliff it would be great
867485 i think the things that this movie could do for peoples lives are immeasurable
867486 i think the message is timeless love is not based on an emotion its not birds chipping and flowers blooming all the time sometimes its hard and its a decision very often love starts with an action and then follows with an emotion rather than vice versa as we tend to think that it does
867487 what we keep hearing from those fight scenes from couples is do you guys have a camera in my house because my wife and i have had those fights
867488 i think thats why theyre so hard to watch because theyre so real this couple is fighting about real issues theyre fighting about finances theyre fighting because of miscommunication theyre fighting because he struggles with an internet pornography issue
867489 she catherine refers to caleb viewing trash on the internet so that when children are watching the movie it will go right over their head
867490 but every adult knows what were talking about we believe we can deal with a very sensitive subject without being graphic that we can address the issue without slapping people around with it or showing things that are inappropriate a family can still go and see this movie
867491 the opening weekend is the key and is so critical
867492 unfortunately we live in a society with movies where its market driven and box office driven
867493 we had a great opening weekend with facing the giants and so it spread to other cities
867494 only the pure of heart would sacrifice themselves for the one they love
867495 if you want to come into a movie theater and have an experience not be told a story but actually have a physical emotional experience then this is the ride for you
867496 weve got more than one camera plus i dont have to both direct and play a major role
867497 the foundation of marriage has been attacked devalued and redefined by many in our culture
867498 it is our desire to tell a story that would allow the audience to relate to common marital issues and then to take them down a path toward understanding principles for unconditioned love through the roles of husband and wife
867499 our hope would be that after viewing the film couples and singles hoping to marry would be challenged and exhorted to pursue god honoring relationships that reinforce the foundations of marriage in light of a relationship with jesus christ we want people to realize that fireproof does not mean the absence of fire but the ability to withstand it
867500 we could not be more pleased with our relationship with albany the police and fire departments offered their services and equipment and some officers volunteered their time and others received credit for training exercises
867501 the fire department even burned down an old house for us that is a pivotal role in the movie and gives kirks character the opportunity to rethink lifes priorities phoebe putney hospital let us film on site as well as provided some doctors offices as a set for some scenes more than 20 sets and a production office were provided by local businesses
867502 i just wanted to be part of something exciting that a church was doing on the quality level that sherwood has brought to the screen i wanted to be sure that my casting if it occurred would be of the lord and not just because i had more experience than others
867503 in my lifetime the divorce rate has climbed to one out of two marriages and the marriage rate has dropped 30 percent what if we can make a dent in those statistics
867504 if we go back to the idea of redeeming the time because the days are evil this is the best use of our ministry time
867505 we each have full time responsibilities at the church but this is just something else that we feel needs to be done and is worked into our schedule
867506 thats why you see all of these volunteers out here in the hot sun taking vacation and personal time away from their jobs to help make this movie we are preaching a two hour sermon in the format of a hollywood movie and will be able to reach people who would never set foot inside a church
867507 they are doing this for more than here more than now they have a sense that long after they have left this world this movie will still be telling a story of redemption and will represent what they feel is important in life
867508 the difference in a run at the bcs very likely the rose bowl if ohio state takes care of its business and another new years morning tilt in florida currently at four in a row is whether the defense veers more towards last years mediocrity or the killer 2006 unit
867509 it was important for our guys to line up and play and it was a fundamentally based scrimmage i saw some bad fundamentals and i saw some bad technique and thats really what i am anticipating coming out of the film study tomorrow
867510 how is it that good christians can do bad things
867511 how is it that any of us can do even one good thing
867512 what would so and so think of me if they saw me doing this
867513 i refuse to lose my audience by teaching the truth
867514 why doesnt so and so stay to help out with such and such
867515 i go to church sunday morning will get me into heaven
867516 we are called to learn and develop faith because this is the most essential and of the utmost importance for every aspect of the christian life without faith we can do nothing as christians especially those who are responsible for the education and care of others we are called to build our spiritual formation from the solid foundation of the bible rom 10 17 heb 11 6
867517 in nearly every trial we found staff morale runs considerably higher when bosses dont read workers e mail over their shoulders complain about their superior salaries or act in any way like giant self centered assholes

867520 s ince when is it okay to openly express your bisexuality on national television this is very bizarre there has always been homos and bisexuals but showing it on tv is a no no cause other people might venture into that type of lifestyle
867521 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one
867522 what is going to make this perfectly fine b paper into an a paper

867524 or you can just f ing sign up when its time to
867525 there has been a very intentional effort to paint him as somebody outside the mainstream other hes not one of us
867526 hey i dont like what you are saying do you mind talking in a softer voice so i cant hear you
867527 and god is able to make all grace abound to you so that in all things at all times having all that you need you will abound in every good work
867528 he has scattered abroad his gifts to the poor his righteousness endures forever
867529 is it sin to not believe for extra money for your church and to help the poor
867530 oh we just got an unexpected 200 now what 300 expense will hit us
867531 its a concern for us a concern for cricket and we cant afford that split
867532 i think it will be the end of cricket if that ever happens and i really hope that isnt the case
867533 you only have to look at when we played india recently its so tough that cricket
867534 i dont think india pakistan sri lanka any of the sub continent teams would want that and i know australian cricket wouldnt want it
867535 were certainly not thinking about any splits and our relationship with the subcontinent is important
867536 at the moment there are a number of issues facing world cricket there are the twenty20 concepts in england and india and the issues dealing with pakistan and the champions trophy are frighteningly difficult
867537 its important for world cricket that pakistan cricket is strong and the only way they can stay strong is if the likes of australia visit there regularly
867538 pakistan have said they want us there weve made it clear we want to come but it has to be safe
867539 there is the suggestion that there will be an offer left open for the ecb to send middlesex who obviously have no icl indian cricket league players
867540 there has been talk in the media of a team from pakistan being sent and obviously if the ecb feel that they cant send middlesex then there has been talk of a new zealand team who won their competition
867541 the commercial partner still has a variety of decisions to make there in terms of a host nation but obviously there is the potential to play that tournament in the three venues already mooted in india
867542 there are still a few unanswered questions but there are lots of answered questions
867543 probably with a lot of attention on the olympics and afl football and the two rugby codes at the moment people might not realise quite what a big story this is for australian sport this is significant news
867544 there is so much money involved now that the benefits of the world twenty20 will go a long way to helping irish cricket now and in the future
867545 hopefully we can make the semi final at least because the financial gains and the bonuses for cricket ireland will be huge
867546 it would be a real shame if we didnt get through because the winners play england in the opening game at lords and for a couple of the lads that will be the defining moment of their career
867547 twenty20 is still a game of cricket just like any other format and it shouldnt be played any differently weve got to ensure we do the basics right
867548 there is no clear favourite but we feel we can be part of the world cup next year
867549 we were disappointed to miss out in south africa and i felt the associate nations should have had three spots rather than two
867550 associate cricket is coming on leaps and bounds and its great that we have three this time
867551 im looking to transfer that form into the weekend and beyond
867552 weve not played a great deal of twenty20 cricket but it was fantastic to be part of the first world cup and to play in england would be fantastic
867553 we are confident we can make the final at least but bermuda cant be taken for granted and playing ireland will prove as difficult as always
867554 we would obviously consult with the ecb before making any final decision
867555 i havent seen the offer yet but we are part of the ecb and wed have to go through the consultation with them
867556 from our point of view weve got extremely good relations with both bcci indian board and the ecb and were excited about the fact the tournament is going ahead and well have to wait and see what happens
867557 the call from david graveney came through on mike watkinsons mobile when he told me it was graveney on the phone i thought it was a wind up
867558 i couldnt believe it when it really was him it was a short call he just said you are in congratulations the first thing i did was ring home and tell my mum
867559 starfire airshow and fireworks sat aug 2 genesee park seattle 6 45 pm 10
867560 i think we get back to the same thing that weve said over and over and over again since bretts retirement and then subsequent things that happened during the spring we were asked to move forward at the quarterback position weve tried to do that things are a little different than they were back in february and march early march but well see we quite havent got there in terms of what role that will be i think after we meet with brett tomorrow and with the quarterbacks in general and were meeting with the team and then at that point well determine which way well go
867561 no packer is going to play for favre favre is going go down and go down hard i wonder how much the bonus is for the player to break favres arm leg during practice
867562 needanotherleroy congrats brew you got boob in waukesha to leave you cant be thanked enough
867563 i dont feel i need to sell myself to the fans
867564 they need to get on board now or keep their mouths shut
867565 2 minute drive ends in int in the end zone those of you claiming we can look forward this this ending with favre what do you say about the chances rodgers will end the season the same way
867566 rodgers looked fine but all the favre fans are saying he looked like crap
867567 i like how the packers wanted to make rodgers look good so they had the packers 1 offense go against the 2 defense
867568 2 minute drive ends in int in the end zone those of you claiming we can look forward this this ending with favre what do you say about the chances rodgers will end the season the same way
867569 brett is the greatest packer to play the game and tt forced him into retirement and he wanted to play the the entire org said no and hell no and please no and there is no other player that would be coming to practice tomorrow thats pretty big
867570 favre is deservedly bigger than the packer organization you call him a crybaby
867571 the best they the packers could do was dispatch murphy to mississippi to offer favre a 10 year marketing and promotions deal worth between 20 million and 25 million sort of a gold and green lots of green parachute
867572 the referees have done an awesome job of making calls
867573 there are balls and strikes sometimes it goes over the plate and sometimes it doesnt
867574 we were all warned about being off plane i sped up and so did theoret but then he went off plane again
867575 i hit a roller and got a little air under the right sponson
867576 if he doesnt start clocking up some runs in the next three innings then the selectors will have no other option they will have to make the decision for him then im afraid
867577 hes a sensible man so he himself will know that by the end of the series that if he has not scored many runs then something has to give its unfortunate but thats the way it goes
867578 the answer for michael is to make runs in the middle
867579 its all right playing well in the nets but its a completely different thing to playing in the middle and that is where hes missed out when hes not played for yorkshire
867580 its hard to juggle both jobs michael has captained the side well but you cant keep on forever not making runs i had the advantage of being a bowler but michael is a pure batsman
867581 if the other five were carrying him then we wouldnt be talking about this three or four of them at the moment arent mentally tuned to play test cricket
867582 ive never seen a player so out of touch as he is at the moment
867583 i am almost tempted to say that england are gonna loose this one but pietersen is still there and why do i have this funny almost ludicrous feeling that collingwood is about to break out of his recent funk
867584 skill wise and in terms of natural ability i would probably put henriques up there with mark waugh
867585 hes confident now and the big difference for any sportsman is you dont want to be playing when youre not confident in your form
867586 id love to see harmy back in the england side thats our job we want to win the championship but its also number one for him to get back
867587 he made the pitch look a bit quicker than anyone else
867588 hes been brilliant outstanding he poses a threat every time he comes up to bowl
867589 im sure he would pose a threat to south africa hes done it at international level for many years
867590 hes had enough cricket now and has been bowling lots of overs and has good control
867591 theres no reason why if there was a bit in the wicket and a bit of bounce he wont get it out
867592 it looks like hes next in line for the oval and he deserves it
867593 at the beginning of the season harmison was playing nowhere near international standard and if they had picked him then it would have been like throwing him to the wolves
867594 colly still has another chance in this test to prove himself and he is that type on character who will keep going and guts it out he is mentally very strong a fighter
867595 but i also think that if he doesnt perhaps he needs to get to durham and get some runs in county cricket
867596 he just needs to get his form back and his confidence back
867597 thats when you want to be playing test cricket not when you dont know which end of the bat to hold
867598 we are currently in discussions with a view at arriving at a mutually beneficial agreement
867599 until then i cannot say much in fact whether or not i am captain my focus now is on the upcoming canada and pakistan tours where i hope to perform well and help the team to victory
867600 theres no rift with the senior players i dont know where you came across that
867601 ill keep this short i want my house key and the ring i gave you back please drop them off or call me so that we can set up a time for me to come and pick them up
867602 you waited in line all this time for just that
867603 its not as though i had much choice is it
867604 i dont think theres anything wrong with it at all
867605 that mystic capability of leaders of genius at certain critical moments to suddenly transmute into someone something awesomely larger than their ordinary selves
867606 si eso no describe tus relaciones un mejor consejo para ti es deja de andar con perdedores
867607 la medida final de un hombre no est en d nde l se ubica en momentos de comodidad y conveniencia sino d nde se ubica en tiempos de desaf o y controversia
867608 this joy i have the world didnt give to me and the world cant take it away
867609 you sunk rather than rose to the occasion and thereby heaped the searing coals of self reproach on your head
867610 activists movements that address state violence such as anti prison anti police brutality groups often work in isolation from activists movements that address domestic and sexual violence the result is that women of color who suffer disproportionately from both state and interpersonal violence have become marginalized within these movements it is critical that we develop responses to gender violence that do not depend on a sexist racist classist and homophobic criminal justice system it is also important that we develop strategies that challenge the criminal justice system and that also provide safety for survivors of sexual and domestic violence to live violence free lives we must develop holistic strategies for addressing violence that speak to the intersection of all forms of oppression
867611 we dont often get the opportunity to hear from men who have done the work and gotten on the path to transformation we need to know what we can learn from them however since we cant always predict who will be successful in the change process we want to be clear that hope that someone will change is not a reason for women to stay in a dangerous relationship
867612 we are not focusing on transformation to encourage women to stay in unhealthy relationships this article is meant to share information with people who work with men who batter and batterers to offer hope that they can change their behavior and insight into whats most effective particularly what men say has been essential in their journey to change
867613 if that does describe your relationships much better advice to you is stop hanging out with losers
867614 the ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy
867615 when i was 22 talking about himself i did the same thing living on my own just a bed and a language though
867616 so tell me why is a good man like you still single
867617 of course this prada dress was on the sales rack at marshalls
867618 the heavens forever are built of kindness you establish your faithfulness in them
867619 prepared the imaginative powers for a sacred purpose so that the soul may be receptive to the temples splendor and holiness
867620 they walk in darkness all the foundations of the earth collapse
867621 the temple service awakens the soul from its sleep and rejuvenates all its powers
867622 the torah speaks in the language of man with expressions of prophetic vision and imagery and the truth of this concept cannot be grasped or comprehended by human thought this is what the verse job 11 7 states
867623 prophecy which involves the powers of imagination and the senses as a portal for acquiring daat
867624 it deals with a sphere that is beyond human comprehension gods command was that abraham walk before god and walk himself
867625 and the great principle of faith upon which all depends
867626 the foundation of all foundations and the pillar of wisdom
867627 he alone is true and the truth of his being does not resemble the truth of any other beings
867628 provides a foothold for a person of understanding to develop love for god
867629 as david stated my soul thirsts for god for the living god
867630 kindness and truth have met righteousness and peace have kissed truth will sprout from the earth and righteousness will peer from heaven
867631 it was only created to exist in the absence of repentance even if one does not repent he still can be purified through these punishments and his soul not be annihilated completely
867632 that there is a limit placed on the amount of evil that a person can do once that limit is reached god no longer gives that individual a chance their measure is filled
867633 but in the world to come the state in which a person finds himself depends completely on his own deeds
867634 but in the world to come the state in which a person finds himself depends completely on his own deeds
867635 but in the world to come the state in which a person finds himself depends completely on his own deeds
867636 rampant levels of violence hamas and impurity have become entrenched the world already deserves to have been destroyed yet god in his kindness established another method of purification that repairs moral defects over time the ashes of the red heifer
867637 only in extreme cases is it necessary to purify through destruction
867638 those who traverse the valley of thorns transform it into a wellspring
867639 singers as well as flute players all wellsprings are in you o zion
867640 appear before god in zion for one day in your courtyards is better than a thousand elsewhere for a sun and a shield is hashem
867641 upon three things the world depends torah the temple service and deeds of loving kindness
867642 and when i reflected to consider the apparent peace of the roisterers it was iniquity in my eyes until i came to the sanctuaries of god and contemplated their end
867643 the dark places of the earth filled with the habitations of hamas
867644 to whom can you liken god and what likeness can you attribute to him
867645 he does not weary he does not tire he gives strength to the weary and abundant might to the powerless
867646 all the nations are like nothing before him as nothingness and emptiness are they reckoned by him the nations are like a drop from a bucket and like dust rubbing off a scale he will cast away the islands continents like dust
867647 the lebanon is insufficient kindling and its beasts are insufficient oleh offerings
867648 truth will sprout from the earth and righteousness will peer from heaven
867649 write this as a reminder and repeat it in joshuas ears god shall be at war with amalek for all generations
867650 the eternal hates lechery zimah which takes the heart of a man and distances it from good
867651 the only ones who are cast aside completely are those who are not worthy of perfection at all neither through their own merit nor through association with a righteous person the number of those saved from annihilation and assured of ultimate bliss thus is maximized
867652 that good or evil may befall a person because of the place where he lives or because of the group with which he is associated
867653 come buy and eat even without money and without price
867654 as it is stated this is like the waters of noah to me regarding which i swore
867655 a human being does not have the capacity to properly comprehend the goodness of the world to come
867656 so much time and so little to do wait a minute strike that reverse it
867657 the absence of common criteria certification is a showstopper for federal customers and other high security vertical markets such as finance
867658 one of the most significant benefits of common criteria evaluations is that the documentation requirements force vendors to implement strict change management and release controls which can minimize but not eliminate the serious and valid concern of vulnerabilities being introduced post evaluation given this rigor evaluated products should have fewer vulnerabilities over time than their non evaluated peers however do not assume that good cryptography is included in a common criteria evaluation fips 140 2 is a widely accepted and successful standard for evaluating cryptographic modules and ensures the correctness of cryptography
867659 our indoor and outdoor adaptive wireless lans have drawn considerable interest from prospective domestic and international users with high security requirements for whom fips 140 2 validation by itself is insufficient
867660 these users require a combination of common criteria certification fips 140 2 validation and directive 8100 2 compliance with these in hand we can bring the same mobility and efficiency benefits to high security users as we do to general enterprise customers it was not a simple task to meet these requirements and we are very pleased to be the first wireless lan vendor to have done so
867661 we are disappointed after a decent start we didnt push on but that is what weve got and we have got to work with that getting smith out was a start for us to claw our way back into the game
867662 you work with what youve got and work hard with that because you know you are still very much in a scrap if we bowl them out tomorrow and bat well they have to bat last on the wicket which will be real pressure
867663 we will say we wanted to get more runs of course we will
867664 the run outs were disappointing but we expected our top order to get us off to a good start to establish a base
867665 it was a shame because fred was starting to look dangerous
867666 he played with real authority and calm to start with and was looking to get himself in
867667 when we started to lose wickets he was going to start to open up and unfortunately we didnt see that at the end because he ran out of partners
867668 i dont think he should have taken one and put himself at the other end fred wanted to be on strike so he could do what he could do but he made a mistake and that is done
867669 it was frustration yes because fred wanted to carry on and he was enjoying himself
867670 in sport you get stuck in with each other sometimes you shout at each other but you all get stuck in together
867671 we have to pull ourselves tight get out there tomorrow and scrap hard to get ourselves back into the game
867672 international cricketers are always under pressure that is part of the territory and the fun of the game
867673 he was left out as much because of shape as we played an extra bowler at headingley and we wanted to play a different shape in this game because we thought it was our best team
867674 he is playing pretty well in his practice and he has another dig in the game so hes got a chance hes a tough bloke colly and he has played well for england over the last 12 18 months
867675 he has had a bad run of scores but we support him because we think he is playing well enough and can come through that paul has served england very well in the past and i think will do long into the future
867676 strauss was a bit of a bizarre dismissal i dont think he has ever hit wicket before
867677 there were a couple of tough decisions and suddenly we were behind the eight ball
867678 we got a lucky break with strauss stepping on his wickets
867679 i was about to shout at myself for bowling down the leg side and then all of a sudden bouch mark boucher came running towards me shouting hes out so i was pretty happy
867680 jakes bowled really well into the wind it was an unbelievable spell of bowling as it was a real test of your skill from that end
867681 it is a bit slower from that end against the wind and allowed us to attack from the other
867682 when the world has turned its back on you take another look you probably have just turned your back on the world
867683 nearly half of all foster children available for adoption are minorities almost two thirds are age 6 or older and many have been victims of parental neglect or abuse
867684 in big agencies the client agency relationship is the most sacred thing
867685 and when we say the client agency relationship is second to the work that doesnt mean it isnt important because the work is a direct reflection of the quality of that relationship if it is strained the work shows it if people are having fun it shows if people are bleeding it shows if people are just trying to turn other people on it shows
867686 every negotiator has two kinds of interests in the substance and in the relationship
867687 devil may cry 4 may not be the complete overall title of the dmc franchise but for many pc owners this will be their introduction to the series what you get is a great title with plenty of action to keep you busy and enough eye candy to melt your corneas for a while you get to play as both nero and dante so you get the best of both worlds the old and new dmc experience
867688 nothing whatever can shake the firm belief of the people of dakota in the integrity and purity of bishop hare
867689 this fantastic new competition gives our best state cricketers and their equivalents in other competitions a chance to pit their skills against champions from other countries
867690 i am also delighted that the benefits of this global event will flow down to state level and enhance cricket at grass roots level
867691 i am certain it will add a whole new dimension to our own kfc big bash twenty20 interstate competition and globally will help us all in winning new fans for cricket around the world
867692 hes always upbeat hes a lovely bloke and he got dealt with harshly by the press because he bowled well for a test debut on a very flat wicket
867693 hes come out fighting hes bowled well so far in this match and we hope he can continue bowling well for notts because hes been one of our main strike bowlers in our run so far this season
867694 im sure hell be aiming for some winter tours or champions trophy
867695 obviously its a bit odd having a drive between games when theyve just started
867696 but i did it a bit last year when i was 12th man for india shooting up motorways and then bowling in the afternoons
867697 it is something im kind of used to and obviously it is very enjoyable to have bowled them durham out by the end of play and be in a very strong position
867698 charlie shreck has been fantastic again coming up with four wickets on what is a very low slow wicket
867699 we hope we can surpass them and put them under pressure for when the wicket deteriorates later in the game
867700 i think we were unlucky in the first session we should have had a few more wickets
867701 i thought the indian openers batted very well and ajantha mendis did very well in the last session
867702 we need to get early wickets on friday and keep india to a manageable score as the players did tell me this pitch may not turn as much as it had done in the past
867703 when youre bowling against one of the best players in the world like kallis it brings the best out of me and it probably did that tonight
867704 it was up there with one of my better spells
867705 it was an important hour for us when we came back out this evening
867706 we scrapped all day and we needed to get wickets to get back into this game so from that point of view it was great
867707 the decision got turned down and you can chunter as much as you want but youve got to get on with it havent you
867708 it did get me going a bit and to get rid of him in my next over was ideal
867709 i cant remember what i was saying i was just chuntering it was just an aimless rant
867710 but ive been in to see aleem afterwards and i apologised its not something which i particularly like it was just emotions taking over but were friends again
867711 i think the yorker is perhaps under used at times
867712 i obviously bowl it a lot in twenty20 and 50 over cricket and wed tried everything else so i tried to slip a few in and it seemed to come out through the committee room window and they struggled to see it
867713 the dark windows above the sight screen that was the issue
867714 lets hope common sense prevails and we get a sheet over there otherwise we are going to get tall guys running up bowling yorkers all day
867715 hopefully the two captains can come together to sort that problem out
867716 any time you get good battles in test cricket it is great for the game
867717 people are saying that with twenty20 around test cricket is going to die but i dont think it is anywhere near dying
867718 with exciting afternoons like that what more do you want
867719 if im honest its taken a while but its nice to get past 200 but i should have done it 15 or 20 tests ago
867720 i enjoy playing here its somewhere ive scored runs and bowled alright too so i think you turn up somewhere where youve done well it often helps
867721 but i want to take a lot more wickets and score a lot more runs
867722 at this moment in time i am not driven by any stats or records i just want to do well for myself and well for england
867723 people need stories more than bread itself they tell us how to live and why
867724 we crawled to the border that was our solution and i think we stayed at the border for two or three hours until the israeli army let the injured enter
867725 fatah officials in gaza should stay in their posts and should not leave gaza to hamas
867726 continue to hope even if we fight between each other or have differences
867727 will quickly discover it committed a very big act of stupidity
867728 if i would have learned english and math in high school
867729 it would have been a terrible waste of time i hear from people who did matriculation exams in high school that half the time is wasted anyway in the end whoever wants to get into university has to learn it all over again
867730 the hareidi manipulators succeeded in achieving publicly subsidized ignorance for their students
867731 fear that general knowledge would cause them to abandon the political camp that is dependent on their ignorance
867732 education minister yuli tamirs willingness to give in to the hareidim regarding general education does not indicate tolerance but rather sycophancy and surrender
867733 we will have to balance the technological environmental and economic issues at the heart of this complex study
867734 its like asking a cat to guard a bowl of milk
867735 its an environmental question mark and thats why we are doing these studies
867736 its very important that we examine and understand all the potential environmental implications
867737 there is an interest internationally in saving the dead sea and this could also help bring water to the region that badly needs it
867738 we need to check all the options if the project is deemed unsuitable then we wont do it but if there are no problems found then why shouldnt we pursue it
867739 this is a major vision of the president of israel to use water and energy as a catalyst for peace and stability
867740 i have a feeling not enough money or time is being given to research to answer major questions good studies have to be done
867741 who will take responsibility for the impact on our lives livelihoods and what we call home
867742 youre not going to let an 8 year old girl ruin our relationship are you things were going so well
867743 theres no way im living with no loco crazy daughter she tried to kill me
867744 no man is ever going to love you with a daughter like that
867745 oh like i havent heard that one before tell me then who switched julios shaving cream for nair
867746 because thomas has work to do hes a contributing member of this family unlike you
867747 if you hadnt made me leave my bike at daddys
867748 ive already explained this to you over and over and over
867749 i dont care its not fair why cant i go with you thomas
867750 im really tired right now crystal i need to get this done but i promise to let you take a ride after school today okay if you get all your homework done
867751 and you had better behave yourself today god help me if i get another letter from ms
867752 i want the kitchen to be clean when i get home
867753 he is our brother and you should treat him like it
867754 the success of the ipl has undoubtedly captured the imagination of cricket supporters from around the world
867755 the champions twenty20 league which will be played by the eight best teams from the world which have earned their place through their domestic competitions provides a new and exciting pinnacle for club championships across the world
867756 it will provide teams with the opportunity to earn the title of world club champions in a format which will be eagerly anticipated by spectators and players alike i keenly look forward to the inaugural season of the champions twenty20 league in september october 2008
867757 this fantastic new competition gives our best state cricketers and their equivalents in other competitions a chance to pit their skills against champions from other countries
867758 im also delighted that the benefits of this global event will flow down to state level and enhance cricket at grass roots level
867759 im certain it will add a whole new dimension to our own twenty20 interstate competition and globally will help us all in winning new fans for cricket around the world
867760 the champions twenty20 league is an idea whose time has come
867761 im certain this competition will significantly enhance the international stature of domestic cricket and pave the way for greater involvement of cricketers right from the club province state and county through to the national and international arenas
867762 csa is proud to be associated with this initiative and we are sure that this event will ignite the passion of cricket lovers the world over quite along the lines of what we had experienced with both our current standard bank pro20 and the recently held inaugural icc twenty20 world cup held in south africa last september
867763 only by using their imagination will people understand why compromises should be made
867764 these children have never experienced peace they dont have the chance to travel to other countries to see how it is this is all from their imagination
867765 my little heart was tormented with pain for those images could cause rocks to cry
867766 there isnt a prison that can deprive me of him because prisons have been demolished and converted into parks for children
867767 filled with havoc weeds and piles of rubble barbed wire and soldiers with helmets
867768 palestinian villages fall asleep in the dreamy green embrace of nature
867769 many countries need our assistance in resolving conflicts and deep rooted disputes and restoring peace
867770 the essays which the palestinian and israeli children have written are in fact one of the best indicators or opinion polls of what the situation really is like
867771 was not a question of principle it was a question of tactics
867772 i cant pretend that im brave and that i can beat the whole world
867773 wait a minute chaps some good may come of this
867774 i went to see him to tell him what are you doing it was an unbelievable initiative he took a massive risk
867775 once you arrive at the beachhead then you allow the people to move on hes not a bubble gum leader chew it now and throw it away
867776 he was thinking way ahead of us he has posterity in mind how will they view what weve done
867777 to persuade people to do things and make them think it was their own idea
867778 the most ruthless and brutal of the apartheid regimes characters
867779 realized that even the worst and crudest could be negotiated with
867780 it was also the big industrialists the mining families the opposition he would pick up the phone and call them on their birthdays he would go to family funerals he saw it as an opportunity
867781 but he was the only supporter and he had to face the reality that it would not win the day he accepted it with great humility he doesnt sulk that was also a lesson in leadership
867782 dont give me any crap i need a 7 passenger vehicle that is what they ordered that is what they should get
867783 the boys gave me the nickname and the press have hyped it up a bit
867784 i dont have to say as much now its been said already i can just concentrate on my bowling
867785 ive learnt to control my emotions in the last few years it makes me a better bowler when i got fired up and get in other people faces
867786 it gets my energy going and that is what i need sometimes to get going i use it as motivation
867787 i was going to shout at myself for a bad ball and then i saw the stumps were down
867788 it was a bit of luck but you take it and that changed the game for us at that stage
867789 i think it stayed slow but the ball kept on swinging all the time
867790 it always seemed like there was something in the wicket
867791 we made a decision to be consistent with our length and try and hit the deck as hard as possible jacques bowled an unbelievable spell into the wind for us
867792 he swung the ball and was patient it worked out nicely with me and him bowling together
867793 would he be mad if he knew you was in here
867794 why dont you come out now honey and well slip you out the back no trouble your daddy never has to know you was here
867795 now i dont want to see you hiding under anymore tables you hear me
867796 hey kiddo i gotta go run some errands before i head home tonight so you just run on home without me
867797 nah you just go on home and tell your maw not to keep dinner waiting mind the alley and stay out of the shadows
867798 whats a small fry like you doing out wandering the streets
867799 now come on squirt show us how tough you are
867800 you stay outta our territory after dark okay squirt and dont go trying anymore tough stuff
867801 there is an issue over whether it is an officially sanctioned event but we hope it can be resolved
867802 we will be delighted if this is sorted out because it is clearly a tournament we would like to take part in and it would be a great disappointment if that did not happen
867803 it will send a positive signal to everyone that the country is heading towards free and fair polls in the third week of december this year the voting also gives us the chance to see how the digital voter list works
867804 at least two candidates have been arrested for paying money to voters
867805 despite all the government talk of finding new leaders and clean candidates the polls have become a showdown between the two main parties and their disgruntled leaders
867806 the government has managed to clean up the electoral process by framing new rules and compiling digital voter lists but it has failed to create conditions for relatively clean efficient and visionary candidates
867807 we would obviously consult with the ecb before making any final decision i havent seen the offer yet but we are part of the ecb and wed have to go through the consultation with them
867808 from our point of view weve got extremely good relations with both bcci and the ecb and were excited about the fact the tournament is going ahead and well have to wait and see what happens
867809 the champions twenty20 league which will be played by the eight best teams from the world which have earned their place through their domestic competitions provides a new and exciting pinnacle for club championships across the world
867810 it will provide teams with the opportunity to earn the title of world club champions in a format which will be eagerly anticipated by spectators and players alike
867811 this fantastic new competition gives our best state cricketers and their equivalents in other competitions a chance to pit their skills against champions from other countries
867812 the champions twenty20 league is an idea whose time has come
867813 im certain this competition will significantly enhance the international stature of domestic cricket and pave the way for greater involvement of cricketers right from the club province state and county through to the national and international arenas

867881 anyone who cares about irish soccer should hope robbie succeeds at liverpool as we need him to be at his very best if we are to have a chance of qualifying for the next world cup
867882 no disrespect to tottenham but the team he will be playing for this season is a class above what he has been used to of late but i believe the three man goal threat of robbie fernando torres and steven gerrard will frighten the best of defenses this season
867883 he does not always show his best form when he is trying to lead the national team maybe he tries a little too hard to answer his many critics in ireland but what robbie needs to remember is that he is a top class player and a very clever one as well

868004 this may seem like a pipe dream but it is a potential reality it doesn t matter where the 2020 olympic games are held but many of us who ve experienced international twenty20 cricket and the ipl are convinced that cricket should bid to become an olympic sport in time for the 2020 olympic games wherever they re held
868005 now is the time for the 10 full member nations of the icc to plan for the development of the sport over the next 100 years over the next century the challenge for all of us who love the game is to spread the word of cricket to parts of the globe that have never heard of it and currently don t play our sport
868006 i believe the olympic games is the vehicle the sport should use to aggressively sell the message of our sport to all 202 competing olympic nations so our sport is strong and robust in countries where it is currently played and exciting and ground breaking in countries who haven t yet caught the cricket bug

868017 the captain and coach really backed me and told me to go and enjoy out in the field and give a good start which would win us the game
868018 i think the last game was brilliant where we scored 600 runs so you cant point fingers after having just one bad game its just that we need to figure out a way of controlling situations a bit better especially under pressure and see how we can come out of this

868050 als hout verbrandt lijkt het alsof je niets meer over hebt omdat je niets meer ziet maar toch is dat niet zo
868051 de moleculen in hout bevatten hoofdzakelijk de elementen koolstof waterstof en zuurstof wanneer hout brandt ontstaat een chemische reactie tussen de houtmoleculen en zuurstof dit levert koolstofdioxidegas en waterdamp op in lijn met de wetten van behoud van elementen atomen en massa
868052 als hout volledig verbrandt blijft alleen potas over als zichtbare restant
868053 de andere moleculen zijn niet verdwenen de ordening van die moleculen is alleen veranderd in de chemische reactie door de verhitting

868060 true golden hair was held in the highest estimation but naturally all shades of auburn and red were favoured in a court whose queen set the fashion by her own tudor tresses supplementing them as they faded with various wigs of these tints women of fashion incurred much censure from the pulpit and scorn from the satirist for the general practice of dyeing their hair and wearing wigs face painting was common among women and at court and evidently was carried much farther than ever before harrison stubbes stow gosson and other writers of the time see in it a token of a depraved mind and imply that the use of face paint is incompatible with moral behaviour

868065 and he has anointed himself ready to carry the burden of the one he can do no wrong can you see the light
868066 barack obama may be the one but is he ready to lead
868067 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
868068 the oil companies are shoving this thing down the throats of congress because they know everybody wants to try to pretend theyre doing something about the energy crisis this is not real i know its tempting the polls say its one of the ways that a majority of americans think were going to solve this problem but its not real i understand how desperate folks are if i thought that i could provide you some immediate relief on gas by drilling off the shores of california and new jersey id do it
868069 in world news i guess youve heard barack obama was elected chancellor of germany ladies and gentlemen as you know yesterday barack obama was in the fatherland john mccain was in grandfather land
868070 barack obama is in france today and again mccain doing everything to compete with him like today he ordered the french toast combo at ihop
868071 you can tell the french are still a little gun shy after speaking in front of 200 000 germans yesterday when obama arrived in france today they said you came alone right
868072 and barack obama landed in london just about an hour ago hes in london now and to prepare for his visit to england he didnt brush his teeth for four days
868073 did you hear about the dalai lama did you hear about this the dalai lama had a near death experience today he met with john mccain

868075 well the other big political story if you believe there are two americas then john edwards is in trouble in both of them do you know about this the mainstream media is now starting to report a story that was first broken by the national enquirer that john edwards was caught leaving his girlfriends hotel room at the beverly hilton hotel at 2 00 in the morning the woman had a room at the beverly hilton so at least he is not another politician screwing the poor
868076 if this story turns out to be true there go his chances at becoming vice president he could still be governor of new york yes

868084 era da pi di un anno che teddy non toccava droghe
868085 e intanto prende in mano la tazzina col caff che luomo le ha porto
868086 quando sono tornata a casa dal lavoro quella sera lho trovato steso a terra in bagno la siringa piantata nel braccio teddy era ancora vivo ma non riusciva a muoversi ha detto qualche parola mentre lautoambulanza ci portava allospedale non ho capito bene la voce era troppo flebile parole rubate al fiato smozzicate poi poco dopo se ne andato

868116 the magnitude and frequency of floodings may increase because springtime flooding is usually caused by rain on snow
868117 but thats a long way down the road we have a lot to learn in the interim to plan for that
868118 the olympics can no more lose money than a man can have a baby
868119 there is no intention from the promoters and the bidders and organizers to reduce the impact and dimensions of the games they want public funds handed to them to build and build
868120 it has nothing to do with sports and friendship or peace
868121 our review of vanocs venue capital cost estimates however indicates there are risks that may result in additional costs to the province
868122 there are still many pressures facing the capital budget for the games and risks inherent in the operating budget as well
868123 the highway was included in the bid book in the first instance
868124 the purpose of the secretariat as we understand it is to help the province manage its olympic commitment and we think thats a fair cost to include
868125 way back when we were bidding for the games one of the things we looked at was the access to whistler
868126 we had a conversation with the province about the road and the plans were to build it by 2012 the games have triggered a timing change thats all
868127 its the enron style accounting we have been warning about since 2002
868128 the question is what are they going to do to make sure things dont get worse
868129 whether the revised enhanced 580 million budget will be sufficient to deliver a venue package that meets international olympic committee satisfaction is questionable
868130 i believe that we have the confidence of the people of the province
868131 it is abundantly clear that vanoc is not far enough along on design completion of project definition reports or tender and award of contracts for all their venues to be able to state unequivocally that they can deliver olympic 2010 venues within the revised 580 million total budget
868132 it should be noted that in the worst cast scenario similar to torino 2006 the venues could be delayed to just prior to the olympic events
868133 this would result in canadian athletes not being able to do practice runs on the actual olympic venues as presently planned in addition another downside effect is that additional escalation that is presently not provided for in the 580 million construction budget would be incurred
868134 yes that scandal has been a huge concern for us all
868135 one of the cases that made the news actually involved a former priest at the parish that i had served in the early nineties the allegations concerned an earlier parish in his ministry but we were always concerned that someone from the history of our parish might come out of the woodwork it is an unspeakable harm that these men have perpetrated it has hurt the church more than that however it has hurt the cause of christ my constant prayer is for more opportunities to convince people that while men will fail them jesus never will
868136 ah jack higginbotham pastor at abundant life this is father dom uh im sorry i dont know your last name

868138 take this hayar road about a quarter mile and youensll see it on the riiight
868139 the causes of truancy are predominantly a lack of parental supervision or a breakdown in the functioning of the family to the point that the parent has no control over the actions of the child
868140 in this case reported from christchurch and under a new scheme called rock on the police are simply fulfilling the role of the parent and are providing a short term solution to a potentially longer term problem
868141 the problem which is becoming more common is that a student is being left to fend for themselves in this case from 6 15 in the morning schools are already expressing concerns that children are being dropped off at schools earlier and earlier
868142 research is quite clear that parental supervision needs to be in place at key times of the day including before and straight after school to ensure that the child doesnt become at risk
868143 unfortunately the expectation on both parents to work economic pressures on families and the hours that parents work means that children and teenagers are more likely to be unsupervised at key times
868144 shift work can also mean that mum and dad are at home at completely separate times for their kids
868145 it is time we expected and enabled parents to fulfil their important and essential role of supervising their children rather than trying to put rescue nets and programmes in place which simply mask the problem

868153 theres probably half a dozen companies big enough in the lines industry to look at it here
868154 any of the lines industry could be interested but its a bit obscure what 50 percent for sale means whether thats the actual company or shares in the company or specific assets i just dont know
868155 typically lines companies have gone well above their regulatory asset value which i suppose tells you something about that people are prepared to pay a premium for the extra stability

868168 the title mere christianity indicates the intention of lewis an anglican to describe the christian common ground he aims at avoiding controversies to explain those things that have defined christianity in nearly all places and times lewis restates the fundamental teachings of the christian religion for the sake of those basically educated as well as the intellectuals of his generation for whom the jargon of formal christian theology did not retain its intended meaning
868169 god said in the bible that we were gods and he is going to make good his words
868170 there are people in other religions who are being led by gods secret influence to concentrate on those parts of their religion which are in agreement with christianity and who thus belong to christ without knowing it for example a buddhist of good will may be led to concentrate more and more on the buddhist teaching about mercy and to leave in the background though he might still say he believed the buddhist teaching on certain other points
868171 but there is a difficulty about disagreeing with god he is the source from which all your reasoning power comes you could not be right and he wrong any more than a stream can rise higher that its own source when you are arguing against him you are arguing against the very power that makes you argue at all it is like cutting off the branch you are sitting on
868172 inspired by the photosynthesis performed by plants nocera and matthew kanan a postdoctoral fellow in noceras lab have developed an unprecedented process that will allow the suns energy to be used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen gases later the oxygen and hydrogen may be recombined inside a fuel cell creating carbon free electricity to power your house or your electric car day or night
868173 friday preachers and imams in baghdad and the governorates called on the politicians to reach an agreement on the provincial council election law in the same context the friday preachers welcomed the security operation in the diyala governorate against the terrorist groups
868174 the kirkuk issue is once again discussed by friday preachers taking into consideration that it is the topical issue of the political street commenting on this issue shaykh jalal al din al saghir imam and preacher of the buratha mosque termed this issue as difficult he called on the political parties to deal with it accurately in order to come up with a provincial council election law that satisfies all parties
868175 in addition to the importance of the kirkuk issue there is also the issue of operation heralds of prosperity the military operation that is under way toenforce law in the diyala governorate the friday preachers have discussed thisissue as being the last stage of eliminating terrorism in the country
868176 we will achieve victory it will be announced soon god willing through operation heralds of prosperity in diyala and security and safety will be achieved and their likes of the gangs which seek evil to iraq and the iraqis will not find safe havens in it
868177 check with the election centers to see whether their names are registered or not
868178 i stress that the provincial council elections is one of the very important elections takinginto consideration that these elections support right and deter falsehood and injustice
868179 friday preachers called for solving the countrys current crises based on accord among all components they stressed the need to confront and uproot administrative corruption the preachers said that the recent visit to the holy city of al kazimiyah by millions of people has proved that the iraqi people adhere to their strong loyalty to islam
868180 he is deluded the one who says that the iraqi people have departed from islam and do not want islam and that this will be replaced by secularism and the like this is a living evidence and example taking into consideration that millions of people have visited al kazimiyah under these difficult circumstances
868181 role of the security forces and the continuous achievements and successes they make beginning with basra mosul and maysan and ending with diyala
868182 however the arrows of accusations were aimed at the government which according to sayyid al hasani stands idly watching the financial and administrative corruption that has ruined most of the ministries
868183 for his part sayyid yasin al musawi imam and preacher of the friday sermon in holy al najaf stressed the importance of the security operation in the diyala governorate saying that it is aimed at achieving security and enforcing the sovereignty of law
868184 this wronged area diyala complains to god in these difficult years of what its citizens had suffered from in terms of injustice terrorism killing expulsion and displacement the takfiris holding other muslims to be infidels and the saddamists are trying to pursue their course of killing innocent people and spreading chaos this operation operation heralds of prosperity just like the previous operations aims to extinguish the fires of seditions and to eliminate terrorists saboteurs saddamists anarchists andall those who do not seek prosperity to iraq experience has proved that thepeople are one united people and that it has become clear to all the peoples groups and sects that salvation can only be achieved by the creation of a legalstate to protect them
868185 in the al diwaniyah governorate sayyid hasan al zamili imam and preacher of friday sermon said that the government should find curative solutions to the problem of unemployment in the country

868190 i do not want to give the government the opportunity to take the focus off of its failings by engaging in cheap personality based politics
868191 i give an assurance today that whoever replaces me as leader of the parliamentary liberal party will have my 100 per cent support both on the record and off the record
868192 ive made the decision today to resign as leader of the parliamentary liberal party because i believe its in the best interests of the the western australian liberal party
868193 there is a massive political opportunity at the next state election and i think i owe it to our candidates to my fellow members of cabinet and to the liberal party to make sure we have every opportunity to win government at that election
868194 most observers of politics would know that my six months as parliamentary leader has not been without its challenges
868195 however during that time i feel that weve done a good job in holding the government to account when theyve made mistakes
868196 im confident that ive made the right decision im confident ive made an honourable decision
868197 a classic case of being in the wrong place when somebody else does the wrong thing

868206 ten years ago pregnant women were told to take it easy now we know that being sedentary can increase the risk of complications during pregnancy even walking is beneficial
868207 people used to think rest was the norm and exercise was dangerous but now we realize that in a pregnancy free of complications the opposite is true
868208 the exercise a women does during pregnancy allows her to lose weight more quickly after having the baby if she continue to exercise
868209 the hardest time to learn about breastfeeding is after the baby is born when you are exhausted vulnerable and at the mercy of booby traps myths misinformation and well meaning but ill informed professionals or family members
868210 if youre a new mom finding someone you connect with whos willing to talk about their experiences without sugarcoating is like finding a pot of gold suddenly youre not alone
868211 the internet can be a wonderful tool to augment our information and give us quick answers
868212 if you dont want to hear about every disease of the week you have to tell friends and family
868213 trust yourself you know more than you think you do
868214 wow youre so good at getting him to take that bottle
868215 i cant believe how easy you make installing a car seat look
868216 your own diet during pregnancy might define your babys predisposition to diabetes obesity and heart disease later in life
868217 some people do well with solid ginger like ginger candy ginger tea reeds jamaican ginger beer non alcoholic or heated ginger jam over vanilla ice cream
868218 theres no magic cut off point but the less the better
868219 somehow a salty sugary high fat low nutrient dense diet seems to program a babys taste preference
868220 a bunch of legislators would love to pass family friendly laws but there has to be a constituency they can point to and say these people have told me they absolutely have to have this
868221 the womens movement in the 60s and 70s did a lot to create room at the top
868222 now younger women can be anything they want to be but when they have children they realize there is a bias against mothers maternal profiling and a major lack of basic support systems for families in this country
868223 online networking provides the key that enables every mother to become an activist
868224 even if you have just a few minutes you can send an e mail to a legislator or read up on issues
868225 babies in utero have a constant symphony of sensation they enjoy jiggly motion the touch of the velvet walls of the uterus and womb sounds louder than a vacuum cleaner 24 7 once your child is born its critical to mimic this environment rock hold and shush him as much as possible your job for the first three to four months is to act like one big walking uterus
868226 still any bit helps so if you are able to nurse your baby once or twice a day do
868227 babies are not yet rolling in the mud so bathing twice a week is usually what i recommend
868228 the first time your baby rolls over could be off the bed changing table or couch
868229 so get in the habit from day one of never leaving him unattended on a raised surface
868230 all parents should realize that they must consciously decide to make their relationship a priority after the baby is born
868231 talk to each other about both the excitement and the anxiety associated with becoming a new parent expectant parents especially fathers to be often keep their feelings of anxiety inside
868232 childbirth is about empowerment and transformation its an opportunity to take control of your body and to be forever affected not just by becoming a mom but also by speaking out about what you believe and what is best for you and your baby
868233 two significant changes are that the amount of medication administered in the epidural has been dramatically lowered and the option of patient controlled epidural analgesia have been introduced
868234 with lower dose epidurals most women have some feeling with contractions and they are able to move their legs which assists with pushing and allows more emotional involvement with the delivery
868235 this woman can get through 20 odd tasks in just one day just eight months after her baby is born and look at her not bad sure shes still got 20 pounds to lose but you can barely tell under that loose fitting hoodie
868236 i dont care if im labelled old fashioned for these views
868237 we live in a crime filled violence filled one you take the kids to visit grandma we see grandma raped murdered and dumped in a ditch
868238 important symbolic figure at a critical point in our citys history
868239 we cant eviscerate the thug culture that greases greater clevelands slide into chaos and then decry an officer like jim simone who has continuously drawn a courageous line against crime
868240 the fans are into me and i like that i like it here lets see what happens
868241 it wasnt this divisive when i grew up protesters shout french people get off our territory at our meetings flemish authorities refuse to give contracts to our french speaking schoolteachers they give flemish children here 179 euros a year for school trips and other expenses french children 68 euros if we want subsidies we are obliged to stock our library with 75 percent of the books in flemish but its ridiculous to have a flemish library in a mostly french speaking town
868242 in belgium the two cultures know very little about each other because they speak different languages there are singers known in one part not in the other television is different newspapers books
868243 there are six million dutch speakers and theyre angry about francophone influence but meanwhile they care nothing about the influence of english and anglo culture
868244 so its not rational weve forgotten our true cultural history in the 15th century bruges was the most vibrant city outside italy because it was full of foreigners then it was antwerp when the foreigners left bruges today the national movement in flanders is in complete denial of the past
868245 should there be a significant release of water there will be a rapid increase in the volume depth and velocity of water in the maich water channel
868246 there is therefore a risk of flooding and erosion of the channel
868247 ich m chte konflikte l sen und nicht versch rfen
868248 manchmal gelingt es durch ein telefonat aber es kommt auch vor dass ich bescheide als rechtswidrig ansehe
868249 ich bin froh dass mich die gesch ftsleitung unterst tzt und meine anregungen m glichst schnell von den mitarbeitern umgesetzt werden
868250 wir hatten viele beschwerden aus der bev lkerung die sich nicht verstanden und bei dem bergang ins neue system allein gelassen f hlten
868251 das system hat einfach m ngel die auch die wohlfahrtsverb nde kritisierten die begr ndungen der bescheide sind oft nicht nachvollziehbar die sachbearbeiter telefonisch nicht erreichbar das verschwinden eingereichter unterlagen oder die lange dauer bei der bearbeitung von erstantr gen wird bem ngelt
868252 viele menschen die zu mir kommen sind verzweifelt und mit ihren problemen hoffnungslos berfordert sie brauchen einfach profis die ihnen helfen mit dem leben klar zu kommen
868253 warum hat ihr niemand gesagt dass sie sich kopien besorgen soll damit der antrag bearbeitet werden kann
868254 you do not realize now what i am doing but later you will understand
868255 unless i wash you you have no part with me
868256 not just my feet but my hands and my head as well
868257 a person who has had a bath needs only to wash his feet his whole body is clean and you are clean though not every one of you
868258 you call me teacher and lord and rightly so for that is what i am now that i your lord and teacher have washed your feet you also should wash one anothers feet i have set you an example that you should do as i have done for you i tell you the truth no servant is greater than his master nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him now that you know these things you will be blessed if you do them
868259 pride goes before destruction a haughty spirit before a fall
868260 this is the moment the world has been waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
868261 am i living a life of my own design following my passions and interests or am i following my family friends or society living someone elses dreams
868262 when he gets older what games would you like to play with him
868263 i feel like a fake and that im deceiving people and im afraid people will find out thats where im at right now
868264 is this really me doing this will these people really listen to or follow me
868265 if they accepted that theyre feeling afraid for instance they might make themselves stay scared forever
868266 scott this is a great post i think a lot of people are in the position you mention 9 years out of the weight training loop can make your re entry as scary as the first day of high school
868267 i write to keep from going mad from the contradictions i find among mankind and to work some of those contradictions out for myself
868268 pulling weeds picking stones we are made of dreams and bones
868269 my son the svelte and muscular swimmer water polo player and surfer with an ebullient smile is bruised sallow skin and bone and his eyes are vacant black holes when i reach him he goes limp in my arms
868270 do not worry that your child is not listening to you worry that your child is watching you
868271 here then is my personal challenge to view my own life the same way i view the lives of my two sons that is to recognize the endless opportunities that lay before me and are within my grasp if i am willing to work hard take a few risks and believe in myself
868272 to say we feel grateful is not to say that everything in our lives is necessarily great it just means we are aware of our blessings
868273 i complain about not having shoes until i see a man without legs
868274 the sun was shining in my eyes and i could barely see to do the necessary task that was allotted me resentment of the vivid glow i started to complain when all at once upon the air i heard the blindmans cane
868275 over a year ago i stopped watching television in fact i dont even own a television its saved me money freed up my time and given me back my opinions when i tell people i dont have a television they always respond with shock and awe followed by either admiration or scowl
868276 wir haben es hier nicht mit einem magischen orakel zu tun wir wollen auch nicht behaupten dass der computer schlauer w re als der nutzer oder dass wir genau wissen w rden was der nutzer will
868277 das diggen hat stark zugenommen und auch die anzahl einzelner nutzer die diggen
868278 what if the bible had been mistranslated or censored to remove the tawdry bits about pimps cross dressers or ahem a brazilian wax as punishment
868279 the complaint letter does actually state that ken is guilty of libel
868280 from where i stand it has now become clear to me that mr abanes feels anyone who disagrees with him is simply wrong
868281 if ken silva wishes to place another article up titled
868282 i challenge anyone to find any criticisms observations corrections in that ken silva article that discusses my theology or doctrinal beliefs such material is not there that article was personal in all its attacks it was nothing more than an article deliberately designed to impugn my personal professional integrity
868283 earnestly contend for the faith that was once and for all delivered to the saints
868284 i took your challenge of finding anything resembling an argument of your doctrinal and theological positions in that article and could not find anything substantive
868285 in essentials unity in non essentials liberty in all things charity
868286 before turning this situation over to my attorneys i respectfully request that ipowerweb net ipowerweb com remove this particular article from its servers and notify ken silva to cease and desist the posting similar articles i have no wish to name ipowerweb net ipowerweb com in a legal suit and hope to resolve this issue as quickly and easily as possible
868287 yeah richard if cs had his own discernment site it wouldnt get much traffic it would be relatively balanced polite and boring because he doesnt call names and even sees both sides of issues shocking
868288 but please stop playing innocent and say that you never threatened a lawsuit to i power
868289 i have no wish to name ipowerweb net ipowerweb com in a legal suit and hope to resolve this issue as quickly and easily as possible
868290 is it morally wrong to break the law to smuggle illegal snakes to use in your church service
868291 just simply to say that it goes against tradition and the teaching of the church and scripture does not necessarily make it wrong we worship a living god and that living god leads us into truth
868292 to say that it goes against tradition and the teaching of the church and scripture does not necessarily make it wrong
868293 ive also seen that married monogamous people are most fulfilled perhaps this is a selling point
868294 hey come to jesus so your time in the sack will be better
868295 i felt like i spoke my truth bottom line they still felt the calendar is inappropriate and not the image that the church wants to have i have no ill feelings toward any of those people they did what they believed was right and i really do feel it was the best decision for both of us
868296 we had to make sure we got something on file
868297 i think that everybody has been pretty fortunate up to this point just in general
868298 why do you have to be so theological cant you just go with the spirit
868299 or the church in houston that wants to spend a gizillion dollars to build a couple of really big crosses and a prayer room forty feet off the ground so people can pray for the city
868300 will there be a split in charismatic circles over the lakeland revival
868301 miraculous manifestations are never the test of a true revival fidelity to gods word is the test
868302 we still dont stream our service s on the web
868303 leaders of church 2 0s are quick to give back what they are learning this learn and return idea of generosity is a driving force behind what we do at the journey
868304 show an openeness to all political views in order to save some
868305 but my question is is this the job of a pastor church
868306 how should i as a believer play a part pray support
868307 i think you have to distinguish between faith and worldview
868308 some people believe barack obama despite his professed christianity is secretly a muslim others say that is just a rumor and obama really is a christian as he says and point out hes attended a christian church for years what do you believe is obama a muslim or a christian
868309 and rebekah lifted up her eyes and when she saw isaac she lighted off the camel
868310 what makes you think that the teaching pastor a title i might add was never in the bible has to be on site modern multi sites will agree with you that leadership for different campuses is essential many times people think that since the teaching pastor is not on site that there is no leadership locally
868311 i am the good shepherd the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep
868312 i guess using the logic that some had what authority or right did paul have in writing letters to these churches if the leadership was established and the shepherds were doing their job what gave paul the right to stick his head in the mix
868313 i would argue that the campus pastor is the pastor for all practical purposes he is the one who is shepherding the flock he is the one who is knows them intimately the is the one with the tight knit relationship and the unique bond
868314 we need to learn net but not on our own time
868315 the phone number field has a bug that does not allow it to accept alphanumeric characters
868316 it should accept alphanumeric values in case someone wants to add a phone number like 1 800 call att
868317 he will cover you with his feathers and under his wings you can hide
868318 this is how we know what real love is jesus gave his life for us
868319 whoever loves money never has money enough whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with his income
868320 officials say many of them have been sold off by their families to begging mafias who exploit a tradition that the rat children are sacred offerings to shah daula the shrines 17th century sufi saint
868321 for at least 100 years but perhaps for centuries it has been though is no longer a depository for children with microcephaly
868322 infertile women who pray at shah daulas shrine will be granted children but at a terrible price the first child will be born microcephalic and must be given to the shrine or else any further children will have the same deformity
868323 it is widely believed that the handicapped are closer to god and must not be ignored their value as beggars is therefore enormous
868324 priests chua masters or perhaps even parents they say purposefully deform healthy infants by placing pots or metal clamps on the heads of healthy infants and so retard the growth of the brain
868325 pakistans microcephalic chuas of shah daulah cursed clamped or cherished
868326 undoubtedly deteriorated into exploitation for begging as was predictable in an institution where the balance of power was so heavily weighted towards the custodians
868327 the brain of an infant grows for the first nine years of life and the skull has gaps sutures to accommodate that growth should these sutures seal prematurely as they do in certain rare genetic conditions the result is not microcephaly but rather death
868328 but the strongest reason for dismissing the bonsai account of microcephaly is that the disorder occurs among british pakistanis as well and they it is quite clear are not clamping their children
868329 some 60 percent of marriages are between first cousins in pakistan the frequency in bradford and leeds is thought to be comparable
868330 the result is that clinical genetics units serving the british pakistani community see a range and frequency of genetic disorders unknown elsewhere in the country
868331 his department had busted more than 30 gangs across the province involved in exploiting street children some of which had broken the limbs of children so that they would earn more as beggars
868332 the ministry of special education and the ministry of religion can work together with the pakistan television network the state owned television broadcasting channel to develop more programs and public service announcements programs on ptv lahore for example can focus on refuting the myths of shah dolas rat children and on exposing the beggarmasters and the inhumane way in which they treat these microcephalic children
868333 because you voted a goddamned homocidal fucking madman into the white house twice

868358 tribal sovereighnty means that its sovereign i mean youre a youve been given sovereighnty and youre viewd as a soverign entity and therefore the relationship between the federal government and tribes is one between sovereign entities
868359 dabei waren die voraussetzungen wirklich schwierig das niveau steigt im olympischen jahr auch bei uns und noch nie hat ein land in dieser bootsklasse den titel verteidigt
868360 aber wenn man dann mit den anderen im boot sitzt und durch das gemeinsame arbeiten das boot schnell macht belohnt mit solchen erfolgen das gef hl kann man nicht beschreiben
868361 wenn die n chste saison gut verl uft dann mache ich sicherlich weiter
868362 aber ich will sp ter auch nicht sagen m ssen dass ich zwei oder drei gute jahre hatte und alles andere vernachl ssigt habe n chstes jahr soll immerhin das studium losgehen

868367 the invitation was really surprising for me that day became the historic landmark for me i will never ever forget that day that i spent there with google google people are so careful about users and that day they cared a lot of me and my mates i feel lucky that im a superuser this was the first time for me that when anyone was asking question i was listening with my full concentration
868368 the best thing about being an orkuteers is to receive the recognition from google for doing something that i just love helping people on orkut the recognition im talking about is not just gifts but to know that google wants to hear from me about problems and suggestions for orkut and the orkut help group
868369 todav a merece la pena luchar por la ronda de doha pero los pa ses tienen que dar un paso atr s para dar dos pasos hacia delante

868374 for me he was a good buddy at the park and away from the park we always had a lot of great laughs he will be very sorely missed
868375 i didnt think i could finish it there at the end
868376 although i was hadnt won i was confident i was going to win
868377 i told everybody that knows me that its just a matter of time its going to come this was a six week run and i was geared up to win im glad that it happened the first week out
868378 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
868379 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
868380 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
868381 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
868382 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
868383 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
868384 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
868385 sometimes people have to have a little bit of common sense guillen said
868386 olivo overreacted to the situation and i wonder why timmons thought we were going to hit a guy with the bases loaded with a pitch in the hands
868387 im not going to bring in a guy that throws 85 mph to hit some guy i guarantee you im going to bring in octavio dotel matt thornton and i will tell them to hit them thats the way i do business
868388 im not a headhunter but ive hit people before on purpose yes i have thats my job to protect my players greinke he did the wrong thing
868389 i signed a five year deal with this organization and we play kansas city a lot i dont say be careful but theyre playing with fire i respect everybody at the pro level but enough is enough
868390 i should have to teach him a lesson how to play baseball everybody in the dugout knows he did the wrong thing i didnt do anything because i didnt think it was worth it they kicked our butts wear it
868391 with the position were in as a team this is definitely not what you want to happen
868392 it happened quick and i didnt get it stopped or slowed down
868393 if we want to get to the point we want to get theres no doubt our starting pitching has to do a better job thats the only way i see this ballclub going in the right direction

868400 we are trying our best to live up to the charter but these criminal activities are making it extremely hard for us to reach our target
868401 these are areas that we were previously not present in and where most of our new atms were going to be unfortunately these are the same areas where bombings are prevalent
868402 if we could do something as a community we would but we are not dealing with petty criminals here
868403 we are not rand bears but we believe r7 80 to r8 to the dollar is likely to be the level later in the year
868404 we are an emerging market and by having exposure to developed markets one can access a variety of different businesses and asset classes
868405 many of these are strategies that are not related to equities and can deliver when markets are falling
868406 these are historically cheap with strong cash flows and high dividend yields
868407 i dont think that prices will return to the record level nor will they fall below 100 per barrel
868408 what some media reported that kuwaits oil reserves are less than that is wrong and not based on scientific record on the contrary there are new discoveries

868412 you see we are not as nasty as some of you in the western media say we are

868423 the thing we need is an architecture that combines the full programmability of the cpu with the kinds of parallelism and other special capabilities of graphics processors and that architecture is larrabee
868424 it is not a gpu as many have mistakenly described it but it can do most graphics functions
868425 it looks like a gpu and acts like a gpu but actually what its doing is introducing a large number of x86 cores into your pc
868426 larrabee does not require a special api larrabee will excel on standard graphics apis
868427 so existing games will be able to run on larrabee products
868428 and of that population two suppliers ati and nvidia own 98 percent of the discrete gpu business

868515 all the research weve done shows gen y lacks resilience and a work ethic generation z is different
868516 they will be incredible achievers leading the nation through issues like the ageing population and climate change
868517 youre probably going to have the most savvy generation of all time
868518 they are going into primary school already using the internet and pcs making them the most information intensive generation of all time
868519 my kids have been on the internet ever since they were born
868520 they have been exposed to so much more information music movies cultures and photos their capacity to absorb information is breathtaking but they like the short grabs they become incredibly knowledgeable about their passions because they have access to a mountain of information that we never had

868524 but i dont think so theres a fork in the road the parents of gen y the baby boomers were guilty about mum working and therefore very indulgent the parents of gen z gen x have let go of the angst its tougher love mean mummy instead of yummy mummy they have a more realistic view of the world
868525 gen z will be realists and more balanced than y they might come along in the 2020s and clean up the mess left by gen y who couldnt handle the downturn they could be the doers the fixers

868538 unfortunately users are very trusting of messages left by friends on social networking sites
868539 he seemed nice enough so we went out bar hopping for the second date
868540 as were finishing our first drink he mentions very casually that when he was 13 he killed someone with an ax for looking at his sister wrong i was creeped out but i let it go
868541 there were some words shared and we went out to the dance floor
868542 not two minutes later the guy flirting with me comes up behind me grabs my arm and starts pulling me with him the next thing i know my date pushed the guy against the wall and punched him in the face and i was out the door i never talked to him again
868543 that can be good because you can get a deeper sense of a person on a social networking profile than you can on a dating profile
868544 social networking sites are usually used fairly frequently by their users so you get a truer picture of who the people on the site are but there is a negative side too
868545 people tend to play the profile they learn everything they can about a person and then bring it up on their date in order to be more likable that can lead to a distorted reality of who the person behind the profile really is
868546 he was well read well educated everything in his profile was spelled correctly
868547 he had an eclectic taste in music and movies and didnt take himself too seriously
868548 once i arrived he had to sneak me through the back stairs of his flat and up to his bedroom because he lived with his parents and they were asleep
868549 i was completely mortified but figured we had good chatting chemistry so i could at least give him the benefit of the doubt
868550 once he set up the movie he didnt say a word to me and i was so bored i had to leave because i was falling asleep
868551 for some people inept at communicating in person online meet and greets are much easier
868552 they can be themselves they have time to think about how to respond to someone approaching them
868553 but in person theres an implied pressure to get it right the first time and often you only get one chance to get it right an online profile is something you can tinker with whereas theres only so much you can do to tinker with your in person profile
868554 a girl messaged me out of the blue one day claiming that i looked familiar though we had never actually met

868561 were aware sarah and marcs mum and dad did get caught up in it but we managed to get them alternative tickets some time ago
868562 were cerainly not aware of any other families that have been involved if they were i think we would have heard by now
868563 its been quite clear there have been some dodgy websites out there and certainly everybody was urged to go through the official ticketing agencies
868564 my understanding is it happened some time ago and the people affected have had alternative tickets for some time
868565 they did get caught and i guess they lost some money so thats a concern
868566 but the important thing for them was they got tickets and are looking forward to being over here and watching them compete
868567 i dont know that theres any less tickets for beijing certainly there has have been some pressure on tickets but the real challenge is that families want to wait until athletes have qualified before they apply for tickets

868589 scams are not new thats why the committee works hard to ensure people choose to buy their tickets through reputable agencies
868590 regrettably some people believe they can save some money by going elsewhere and they put themselves at risk while doing so
868591 we regret that but there is no shortcut in the process
868592 but they can usually only be reactive rather than proactive with these things and that means people get burned in the process
868593 weve managed to get them all general tickets although theyve still lost money in the process
868594 tickets have long sold out but there are always ways with our friends who are official ticket people for other national olympic committees

868597 they are based out of arizona somewhere and are being sued by the united states olympic committee if they can even find them

868621 it looks as though obamas prepping us for one socialistic money grab after another one in keeping this race issue alive
868622 theyre going to try to say well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the other presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
868623 this isnt the first time that obama has done this
868624 obama didnt say it once that day he said it three times that day he also echoed comments that he had said back in jacksonville oh and did i mention hes black is that playing the race card
868625 can you name one prominent republican that has brought up the issue of barack obama being a black american
868626 to be honest with you as far as playing the race card goes and obamas tendency towards saying that you know theyre trying to uh the republicans are trying to scare people with regard to him i quite honestly think that thats a good idea i find obama to be a scary guy the things that he says and has been able to get away with saying i find to be insulting appalling and it looks as though hes prepping us for one socialistic money grab after another one in keeping this race issue alive
868627 erik you were the first to write the column about the black value system and bring up the issue of his church and jeremah wright so you have been talking specifically about race
868628 obama also made the comment about you know bitter americans clinging to their guns and religion was he talking about white people there
868629 i definitely believe that he was i think that you know and a lot of other people do as well think that that was demeaning condescending and insulting
868630 i submit that you have not senator obama but a lot of the people around him they have fashioned this sort of a shield whereby you know you cant say anything about him and its largely because hes black otherwise youll be a racist

868739 taking life seriously does not mean spending our whole lives meditating in a cave but we should get out of 9 to 5 tangled existence where we live without any view of the deeper meaning of life perhaps the deepest reason why we are afraid of death is because we do not know who we are
868740 the existence of both self and world are seen in terms of mutually conditioning psycho physical events which arise and pass away interdependently

868742 when you think of a tree you tend to think of it as a distinct clearly defined object and on a certain level it is but on a more important level the tree has no independent existence rather it dissolves into a web of relationships the rain that falls on its leaves the wind that causes it to sway the soil that supports it all form part of the tree ultimately if you think about it everything in the universe helps make the tree what it is it cannot be isolated its nature changes from moment to moment it is never the same this is what we mean when we say that things are empty that they have no independent existence
868743 it is not enough to be compassionate you must act there are two aspects to action one is to overcome the distortions and afflictions of your own mind that is in terms of calming and eventually dispelling anger this is action out of compassion the other is more social more public when something needs to be done in the world to rectify the wrongs if one is really concerned with benefiting others one needs to be engaged involved

868757 we never set out to perform for kid audiences but early on someone saw us and said theres a place for you in schools
868758 whether we know it or not we transmit the presence of everyone we have ever known as though by being in each others presence we exchange our cells pass on some life force and then we go on carrying that other person in our body not unlike the springtime when certain plants in fields we walk through attach their seeds in the form of small burrs to our socks our pants our caps as if to say

868766 its a nice way to open communication with residents among themselves and with various city departments
868767 national night out is celebrated once a year but it truly is a culmination of activities aimed at crime prevention throughout the year
868768 in aurora i think we have caught the spirit of the event which is to strengthen partnerships between the community and the police
868769 as neighborhoods change and residents move in and out national night out provides a means to get to know neighbors and police officers in a fun event
868770 the goal of the evening is to create a sense of commitment to reducing crime and a desire to improve the quality of life
868771 were looking for people to get outside and reconnect with their neighbors
868772 theres so much production involved in the costuming and the visual effects
868773 ive got enough money and im in a leadership role

868782 arrest is an instantaneous shattering thrust expulsion somersault from one state into another
868783 we have been happily borne or perhaps have unhappily dragged our weary way down the long and crooked streets of our lives past all kinds of walls and fences made of rotting wood rammed earth brick concrete iron railings we have never given a thought to what lies behind them we have never tried to penetrate them with our vision or our understanding but there is where the gulag country begins right next to us two yards away from us in addition we have failed to notice an enormous number of closely fitted well disguised doors and gates in these fences all those gates were prepared for us every last one and all of a sudden the fateful gate swings quickly open and four white male hands unaccustomed to physical labor but nonetheless strong and tenacious grab us by the leg arm collar cap ear and drag us in like a sack and the gate behind us the gate to our past life is slammed shut once and for all
868784 power is a poison well known for thousands of years if only no one were ever to acquire material power over others but to the human being who has faith in some faith that holds dominion over all of us and who is therefore conscious of his own limitations power is not necessarily fatal for those however who are unaware of any higher sphere it is a deadly poison for them there is no antidote
868785 we have to condemn publicly the very idea that some people have the right to repress others
868786 it is going to be uncomfortable horrible to live in such a country
868787 sometimes though you got thinking and your spirits soared your sentence was running out there wasnt much thread left on the spool lord just to think of it walking free on your own two legs
868788 standing there to be counted through the gate of an evening back in camp after a whole day of buffeting wind freezing cold and an empty belly the zek longs for his ladleful of scalding hot watery evening soup as for rain in time of drought he could knock it back in a single gulp for the moment that ladleful means more to him than freedom more than his whole past life more than whatever life is left to him
868789 shukhov felt pleased with life as he went to sleep
868790 the end of an unclouded day almost a happy one
868791 just one of the three thousand six hundred and fifty three days of his sentence from bell to bell
868792 that device had a real potential to put that family in jeopardy
868793 its regrettable that certain scientists are willing to put their families at risk by choosing to do wasteful animal experiments

868798 its ok to change your mind in politics if it benefits your country
868799 to mislead the american people as to thinking its going to reduce the price at the pump
868800 what sen obama said is what we want a president to say
868801 lets look at all of the options lets compare them and lets see what really does increase our supply protect our environment save our economy protect the consumer instead of a single shot thing that does none of the above
868802 well maybe it will as its part of a larger energy package
868803 there is no need to panic everything is normalized now
868804 it was pretty good i saw people having barbecue on the side of the street it was a good race

868811 he walked out and thats the last time i saw my boy

868816 everybody loves the location and the neighborhood embraced the event
868817 i have to turn away its a little bit too scary
868818 you cannot persuade me there are not more disturbed or disgruntled persons with a political agenda in such a large group
868819 people given these kinds of responsibilities with this kind of power at their fingertips we have to make sure that they are not likely to do harm to others or misuse that authority be it intentionally or be it because of some mental problem
868820 these kinds of situations cry out for reexamination of our standards
868821 been adjudicated as a mental defective or been committed to any mental institution
868822 hiding it from your co workers that would have been very very difficult
868823 universities are pretty sloppy its an academic setting not a security setting
868824 youre basically going to scare off any scientist from wanting to work in this field if it becomes even more stringent
868825 it is a balance its a policy decision about how stringent we want to be
868826 have access to some of the most lethal substances imaginable
868827 one of the complaints by people who work in safety and security is they cant get the time of day from people running the labs
868828 are viewed as deeply offensive by a lot of scientists as if their patriotism is being questioned
868829 though several agencies have a need to know no one agency knows the number and location of these labs in the united states
868830 we want justice we want peace u s out of the middle east
868831 genevas historic center is a source of pride to residents and an attractive walkable commercial district to visitors historic preservation has always played an important role in maintaining the citys authentic sense of place this discussion is critical in determining the future of historic preservation in geneva
868832 we wanted to get the national night out celebration back into the neighborhoods because we thought it was important for people to get out and get to know each other and the people on their blocks
868833 its important for us to know that individual neighbors can rely on each other
868834 the investigation is still ongoing and it should reach a conclusion in the next couple of days
868835 there are seven different categories in which someone can be nominated
868836 if an individual fits the criteria they can certainly be considered
868837 there are many many individuals who have had a tremendous impact in elgin or in the world in these categories and we believe they should be recognized
868838 we will recognize them for now on a special web site page that will be created but eventually we would like to recognize them on a larger scale
868839 i just said to my team now we take control and i just cruised to the finish
868840 we bike around because we dont want to pay for gas
868841 road racing is a little more exciting since theres a broader field

868843 its pretty cool that its a major event here in elk grove our little hamlet
868844 the point was that it is hard to get into our neighborhood
868845 if you are going north on state a visitor would guess that they could turn on west chicago but you cant so you continue on to west highland and then get stuck there waiting creating a backup of cars behind you

868861 the buddha never taught that the self is not but only that it cannot be apprehended p 109
868862 it is something that is not easy to talk about and impossible to understand through words alone
868863 it is something you can only fully grasp through a combination of reflection and personal experience but ill try to explain it in a simple way when you think of a tree you tend to think of it as a distinct clearly defined object and on a certain level it is but on a more important level the tree has no independent existence rather it dissolves into a web of relationships the rain that falls on its leaves the wind that causes it to sway the soil that supports it all form part of the tree ultimately if you think about it everything in the universe helps make the tree what it is it cannot be isolated its nature changes from moment to moment it is never the same this is what we mean when we say that things are empty that they have no independent existence
868864 everything has been determined by god and is controlled by him it must make people very apathetic there seems to be no room in christianity for personal growth in the way there is in buddhism through spiritual practice we have an opportunity to develop ourselves
868865 those who believe in existence are stupid like cattle but those who believe in nonexistence are still more stupic things are not existent not nonexistent not both and not something that is not both
868866 everything is subject to the law of dependent origination as nagarjuna said origin through relations is the buddhas rich profound treasure on this level our categories distinctions and labels you and i mind and matter become one and disappear what we take to be solid and substantial is in fact changing from moment to moment just in the same way that the tree is empty the self is empty if you reflect on it you too dissolve as part of everything else around you the self or ego is ultimately no more separate than anything else in the universe
868867 i cant understand it my sister in the capital she now has all these things that do the work faster she just buys her clothes in a shop she has a jeep a telephone a gas cooker all of these things save so much time and yet when i visit her she doesnt have time to talk to me

868871 contemplate all energies without fear or disgust find their essence for that is the stone that turns everything to gold p 219
868872 your soul ought to be without ghosts to be void of all forms and images that are ghosts you should strive to keep it so for if you love god as a god a ghost a person you are not loving him as he is one in whom there is no duality
868873 those who believe they have plenty of time get ready only at the time of death then they are ravaged by great regret but isnt it far too late
868874 my religion is to live and die without regret p 12
868875 a turning about in the seat of consciousness a personal utterly non conceptual revelation of what we are why we are here and how we should act which amounts in the end to nothing less than a new life a new birth almost you could say a resurrection what a beautiful and what a healing mystery it is that from contemplating continually and fearlessly the truth of change and impermanence we come slowly to find ourselves face to face in gratitude and joy with the truth of the changeless wit the truth of the deathless unending nature of mind
868876 our buddha nature is as good as any buddhas buddha nature
868877 good in the beginning good in the middle and good in the end
868878 may whatever merit that comes from this practice go toward the enlightenment of all beings may it become a drop in the ocean of the activity of all buddhas in their tireless work for the liberation of all beings these three sacred principles the skillful motivation the attitude of nongrasping that secures the practice and the dedication that seals it are what make your meditation truly enlightening and powerful
868879 according to the buddhist explanation the ultimate creative principle is consciousness
868880 complete devotion brings complete blessing absence of doubts brings complete success
868881 this is good this is bad i dont want it
868882 the great way is not difficult for those who have no preferences
868883 because we now have conflicting evidence the court should reconsider its earlier decision
868884 its no secret that we get a lot of complaints in there and we are using national night out to send a clear message
868885 the message is the neighborhood and police department have organized and we will fight back
868886 we have been a part of this event and are maintaining the tradition that was started in the past
868887 its also a great way to create relationships between the community and the police force
868888 they like this truck because theres a bed in it
868889 you see a lot of trucks on the road but not everyone has the chance for the hands on theres a lot of joy here you dont even hear any kids crying there are no frowns all smiles
868890 theres a pipe that runs along the ladder that can pump 2 000 gallons of water every minute
868891 it gives people a chance to see the rigs and it gives us a chance to be out in the community

868897 i am very aware and grateful for what rcl has done for my daughter and know what they do for the other clients i want to give back by helping out so that other disabled people can have the same type of help that my daughter has received
868898 most of their clients are people that would fall through the cracks if it werent for rcl because they dont fit the criteria for permanent residential living
868899 to offer adults with developmental and or physical disabilities opportunities to achieve greater self esteem dignity and participation in all aspects of community life through affordable housing options individualized skill instruction and necessary support services
868900 a person who eats sleeps and drinks rcl she is totally dedicated to the needs of our clients many of whom do not have families and to our volunteers many of whom are also clients we are a young organization we need more volunteers and we also need people who are willing to act as mentors for our clients
868901 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
868902 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
868903 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
868904 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
868905 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
868906 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up
868907 we require that different media have the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games and im adamant in saying there has been no deal whatsoever to accept restrictions our requirements are the same from host city to host city and remain unchanged since the ioc entered into a host city contract with beijing in 2001
868908 i expected there to be more people this tells me a lot about the market conditions right now
868909 gay lesbian bisexual and transgender individuals enjoy an atmosphere of inclusion and respect
868910 theyre for defensive purposes were not going to attack anybody
868911 i wasnt expecting anybody alive at the bottom of the shaft so i was shocked
868912 i think she probably went down head first and landed on her back
868913 i love making buttons and shirts and playing drums i mean i learned how to play drums completely
868914 i worry that someone coming in for four or eight years couldnt learn that job in that time
868915 its a job i love and i really wouldnt want to do anything else
868916 it will be years before we find another one like her
868917 i dont know why the clerk is included in the limits the city clerks more of a department head
868918 on the honesty and the loyalty of the current security force in kirkuk
868919 marginalize any other ethnic group control kirkuk and annex it to kurdistan
868920 the kurds want to lay bricks for an independent state but escalating tensions will not bring any good to anyone
868921 tried hard to impress the world and to prove the country deserves respect and appreciation
868922 but the west used the olympic torch relay and the coming games to shame the country and frequently remind the chinese they were not good enough
868923 a safe olympics is the biggest indicator of the success of the games
868924 kein angriff auf den iran schluss mit krieg und zerst rung
868925 im a huge cubs fan and think it would be cool to sing in front of all those people
868926 im nervous for her but im not worried shell be nervous if she wins she loves to sing in front of huge crowds
868927 and i really want to sing this year because the cubs are going to the world series
868928 my brother is the biggest cubs fan in the world
868929 oh you must be one of the people on the pe list
868930 we did find some areas where although he initially resisted he came around
868931 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist
868932 and i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
868933 theyre very good at negative campaigning theyre not so good at governing
868934 were glad the obama campaign retracted barack obamas accusation because it was absolutely false and were moving on
868935 the only cynical candidate in this election is barack obama for his continued opposition to john mccains comprehensive energy plan that includes additional oil drilling gas tax relief and affordable nuclear energy
868936 none of you thought i was making a racially incendiary remark or playing the race card
868937 it wasnt until john mccains team started pushing it that it ended up being on the front page of the new york times two days in a row
868938 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people either through poisoning he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted or has had especially toward women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
868939 has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer i have that in evidence and through my working with him i also believe that to be very true
868940 very important that the fbi present their case against bruce and not just state that the investigation was over because it was him and hes gone
868941 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure
868942 its loud its dirty not something you get to see every day
868943 the guys who look like they can go the farthest never do
868944 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
868945 in no way do i think john mccains campaign was racist i think they are cynical
868946 their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks
868947 were glad the obama campaign retracted barack obamas accusation because it was absolutely false and were moving on
868948 none of you thought i was making a racially incendiary remark or playing the race card
868949 it wasnt until john mccains team started pushing it that it ended up being on the front page of the new york times two days in a row
868950 we face serious issues in this election and have real differences
868951 im not going to assault sen mccains character im not going to compare him to pop stars
868952 we understand it might be beneath a worldwide celebrity of barack obamas magnitude to appear at town hall meetings alongside john mccain and directly answer questions from the american people but we hope hell reconsider
868953 senator obama says he wants energy independence but he doesnt support anything that serves that goal he is opposed to new domestic drilling opposed to nuclear power and wants to add taxes to coal producers
868954 but i was 15 years old i was incredibly scared of the bombs i was no hero
868955 he enjoyed what he was doing and was proud to be in the army
868956 at the same time he knew the risks he wanted to remind me how very much he cared for his brothers and sisters he asked me to tell them that if the worst happened
868957 he said it happened very quick and that my son didnt suffer
868958 he told me my son never knew what hit him
868959 he was really my best friend he seemed more focused when he came home he had goals he wanted to go to college when he got out of the army
868960 i believe party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories
868961 today is a proud day for all of us who fought so hard to ensure floridians votes are fully counted
868962 his commitment to uniting the party and ending the uncertainty surrounding the process
868963 senator obamas action today will help unify the democratic party it also underscores the need for a fairer and more sensible process for selecting presidential nominees as well as the critical role of michigan and florida two representative swing states over the efforts of iowa and new hampshire to perpetuate their privileged position in that process
868964 as always our goal is to ensure a fair process and a unified democratic party so that we can win in november
868965 as we prepare to come together in denver however we must be and will be united in our determination to change the course of our nation
868966 most experts are in agreement that its inevitable that we will become totally infested over time
868967 when that will happen i cant say its pretty grim
868968 it got here by accident and its taking advantage of the food source here
868969 this isnt the first time this kind of thing happened
868970 these things happen and its not coincidental that theyre all invasive pests that cause these things
868971 ash is a very popular tree because it has a lot of qualities that make it a good tree for landscaping
868972 there is no saving the tree once you start seeing symptoms its kind of too late
868973 its so much fun this is my second year competing
868974 its a lot of fun and we have a good time with this
868975 next year ben and luke are thinking of making a boat
868976 we wanted to get the national night out celebration back into the neighborhoods because we thought it was important for people to get out and get to know each other and the people on their blocks
868977 its important for us to know that individual neighbors can rely on each other
868978 i dont want the state to take a role in telling us what to do
868979 my job in district 214 is try to do the best i can for this community
868980 the people here like what the schools provide and we cant endanger that
868981 if this is the land of opportunity then we as a state and as a society have an obligation to create those opportunities for everyone as best we can
868982 would a different kind of tax be as reliable i think its still pretty unclear
868983 but at the same time we never have enough i would like to see schools all over the state funded better but im not sure at this point how wed go about it
868984 i think there would be a way to make it work without hurting the kids out here in the suburbs but wed have to put aside politics to get there
868985 as a statewide system were only as strong as our weakest link
868986 if were failing to educate children somewhere whether its st charles or chicago or anywhere in the state and we have to remediate them down the line in the prison system or elsewhere thats not a good way of doing things
868987 i just didnt leave the house when i was in a fib
868988 its a concern because it can be difficult to pass a needle through
868989 in ganschows case we turned the radio frequency on and the baylis device went right into the left atrium one try very easy
868990 speaking to us at medical conferences many doctors have expressed to us their intention to switch over completely to the nrg needle
868991 i just thought 80 had a better ring to it
868992 in a few years hopefully well look back and think how silly it was the way we were poking needles through like that
868993 im just looking forward to having a normal life where i dont have to pretend to tie my shoes in a store because im getting dizzy and need to put my head down
868994 the u s government never discusses the specific security clearance of an individual employee or military member
868995 time honored procedures to examine security clearances on a regular basis
868996 very important that the fbi present their case against bruce and not just state that the investigation was over because it was him and hes gone
868997 im concerned about what closing this case without conclusive evidence might do to harm our life sciences enterprise i think we as americans need to see the proof
868998 its a shame the man is not here with us we might have known more
868999 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure
869000 client has a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats plans and actions towards therapists
869001 we take our legacy of providing trustworthy and balanced resources to citizens and lawmakers seriously
869002 the league of women voters truly has left its footprint on american history and i believe our democracy is stronger because of it
869003 its one way for a lot of people to see the candidates face to face at the same time and on a level playing field
869004 and we think we ask better questions than the press more issue orientated questions and less gotcha questions
869005 how candidates answer voters questions is very revealing so a forum provides an important opportunity for local voters to hear candidates in an unfiltered format

869007 will you regret it when youre 30 if you dont go
869008 how do i find time to do what i want
869009 oh is it worth anything it says its worth 20 kind of a measly birthday present wouldnt you say dad
869010 well its worth a lot more than that its gold an ounce of gold
869011 but it says its worth 20 i guess at one time it was worth 20
869012 can you still use these for money i mean can you go into a shop in canada and pay for things
869013 well maybe but i dont think it would be a good idea
869014 or maybe you can say to your boss that you want to be paid in these coins and then when the irs asks you how much you made you can say 20
869015 i dont know henry but i think thats the sort of thing that people go to jail for
869016 well its their fault the coin is worth more than 20 isnt it you should be able to use it as 20 i mean whats going on anyway something funny about this
869017 oh henry this is a very long story but youre right its very funny

869063 the concern is that its a very expensive undertaking for businesses both small and large to install and operate cameras that would operate 24 hours a day
869064 its definitely a public safety thing it is to protect the patrons
869065 we would just like them to defer it to give them time to consider the issue
869066 what i hope to accomplish is this they will certainly give us an idea of whos committing these crimes and they will certainly give law enforcement a better opportunity to solve these crimes
869067 the technology is there and the cost is extremely low
869068 we all like it when some burglar gets caught by a camera but theres a cost incurred

869114 i do not want to give the government the opportunity to take the focus off of its failings by engaging in cheap personality based politics
869115 i give an assurance today that whoever replaces me as leader of the parliamentary liberal party will have my 100 per cent support both on the record and off the record
869116 ive made the decision today to resign as leader of the parliamentary liberal party because i believe its in the best interests of the the western australian liberal party
869117 there is a massive political opportunity at the next state election and i think i owe it to our candidates to my fellow members of cabinet and to the liberal party to make sure we have every opportunity to win government at that election
869118 most observers of politics would know that my six months as parliamentary leader has not been without its challenges
869119 however during that time i feel that weve done a good job in holding the government to account when theyve made mistakes
869120 im confident that ive made the right decision im confident ive made an honourable decision
869121 i do not want to give the government the opportunity to take the focus off of its failings by engaging in cheap personality based politics
869122 i give an assurance today that whoever replaces me as leader of the parliamentary liberal party will have my 100 per cent support both on the record and off the record
869123 lets get it clear the asio submission is very separate to the afp submission
869124 the problem is the material that weve provided to mr clarke a good proportion of it belongs to the united kingdom authorities and we dont have consent to release that
869125 i dont have consent to release that the organisation doesnt have consent to release it nor does mr clarke
869126 its nothing to do with the afp refusing to co operate with the inquiry
869127 but the redacted submission doesnt make sense without the other information being made available
869128 the afp would be far better off if we could publicly put our submission out into both the community and the media but we cant and its not within our control to do that or make that decision
869129 but it hasnt even finished yet weve only put our first witnesses before it

869279 naturally the common people dont want war that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same way in any country cobra said if there is an age restriction on going to war because everyone knows how easy it is to pull the trigger on a gun why cant there be an age restriction in the nba the age restriction on war is a luxury of a secure american society many of our wars have involved boys that lied about their age or were accepted into the regulars with full knowledge by their superiors that they were only 14 or 16 they were allowed to defend their ideals how come an 18 year old kid who is an adult in the legal sense has to go to college for year what if he is a poor student and his only real skill lies in playing ball if his only real skill rested in the ability to pee gasoline he would have been on the job two days after he was shot out of the womb the more mature polished player makes for a better nba product and since they are an exclusive league meaning anyone cant join in on the fun they can set stipulations for playing in it most if not all kids are not ready to play in the nba after 0 or 1 year in college in the end though it comes down to money the younger you let players come into the league the younger they go out of the league so older players dont really want a 19 year old coming in and filling that last roster spot when they are 25 instead of when a 35 year old used to fill it then you have the owners who are tired of signing these kids to a guaranteed three year deal with an option for the fourth and not getting anything out of him until the second contract if hes even with the team anymore you still didnt answer my question though why 18 as the age to allow people to join the military i mean anyone can throw a grenade so why not 14 or 12 you cant handle the truth actually th 26th amendment to the constitution makes 18 the voting age and it has a lot to do with vietnam as many of you know the war in southeast asia opened the eyes of many americans to some for the injustices rampant in society as far as suffrage was concerned the power to set the age limit rested in the states some states had adopted 18 as the legal age some were 19 20 or 21 regardless of the state age for enfranchisement the age for conscription in the united states military and institution governed by the federal bodies was 18 as a consequence men were being sent to war against their will by a government they were unable to participate in this is disenfranchisement now dammit i am not going to say this again everybody go read starship troopers it is a classic that covers this very topic forget watching the movie it is crap and not at all about the same thing now the issue is conscription the 26th amendment signed in the spring of 71 made all of the soldiers subject to conscription part of the body politic one will note an important lesson the government has learned since vietnam there has never been any real suggestion of reinstating conscription in 70 the prince of cambodia was deposed by his prime minister who was a close buddy of the us now our movements into laos and cambodia were wide open to increase the war was spreading but one thing was clear to the laotian neutrality was being violated the war was spreading unhindered in 71 the pentagon papers came out the public was being better informed of the rising deception that was vietnam the failure of vietnam points out a lot of things one in particular is the age old reality that a conscription army is far weaker than a volunteer auxiliary in ww2 many of the better outfits were those made of volunteers and military leaders were not ignorant of that that is not to say soldiers that served in vietnam were bad in fact there are a lot of combat statistics that show that the soldiers and marines in vietnam consistently outfought their opponents they were better equipped and better trained they routinely drove off enemy forces that vastly outnumbered them but the enemy had number and moral the conscripted army had moral issues drug issues leadership issues race issues and the sense of no solution to an orientalized problem they could not fully understand these were all if not whole at least in part a product of the growing disillusionment of the troops in country and the people stateside that disillusionment still exists clearly and that is why we dont conscript anyone and probably wont it is also one of the reasons that the argument that relates the injustice done to the soldiers of vietnam to that of those in iraq which was a common protest theme early in this recent installment of lunacy it is somewhat toothless yeah yeah yeah i know all that stuff again though why 18 and not like 14 higher maturity strength intelligence level s the point im making is that the nba has learned that kids coming straight from high school are not prepared to play in the nba and since playing in the nba is not a right its a privilege the nba can make a decision thats best for the league as a whole sure there might be one or two players who can make it in the nba that young but as a whole it makes the league worse so this link is only good until sunday the 20th at midnight but a link worthy of following the red son said thanks for the link glad that you like the blog cobra 18 in the us because that is the voting age in our society the idea of bringing in younger soldiers has become unconscionable there for we dont if you are asking if it is because older men are bigger stronger faster then you are asking the wrong question if the army could get its recruits younger and begin indoctrinating them at a younger age and building them physically at a younger age they would and they have a lot of developed societies have adapted this sort of thinking to paramilitary type clubs for the purpose of developing useful skills njrotc boy scouts hitler youth you name it they want to get them as young as possible not only that but it is not the most substantial argument to say that the nba wants to get guys more ready because then they wouldnt pass up drafting all those freshmen asking them to spend one year in college is far from establishing higher maturity strength intelligence level s particularly when it is based on letting kids run around without any court discipline or structured offense that one year is no consolation at all it is a just a ploy to make the nba look like it is attempting to push young black males towards college it is not a privilege to play in the nba one may feel honored to do it many who cannot may desperately desire the distinction but at the end of the day it is not a privilege privileges are things bestowed a sort of entitlement playing in the nba is a job they are well rewarded for let me a share a little labor theory from the writer of the great john wayne movie mclintock when a guy receives an honest wage for an honest day of work nobody owes anybody anything owners didnt mind when other high schoolers came into the game they capitalized on their youth and popularity the same way they do older guys they form game plans around them the same way they do older guys it is a job and an exclusive one and those with the ability to perform it should be allowed to ply their trade in the best way they see fit if i was 611

869315 most observers of politics would know that my six months as parliamentary leader has not been without its challenges

869332 lets get it clear the asio submission is very separate to the afp submission
869333 the problem is the material that weve provided to mr clarke a good proportion of it belongs to the united kingdom authorities and we dont have consent to release that

869388 answering a question about his approach to combatting crime john mccain suggested that military strategies currently employed by us troops in iraq could be applied to high crime neighborhoods here in the us mccain called them tactics somewhat like we use in the military you go into neighborhoods you clamp down you provide a secure environment for the people that live there and you make sure that the known criminals are kept under control and you provide them with a stable environment and then they cooperate with law enforcement the way he described it his approach sounded an awful lot like the surge as part of his argument mccain praised the crime fighting efforts of former new york mayor rudolph giuliani urban league president marc morial countered that while new york did experience a drop in crime under giuliani there were several major instances of police misconduct to which mccain promised aggressive prosecution of civil rights violations and a justice department free from political cronyism

869449 because ive been around long enough to know that ill be looked at as a quitter
869450 we see cases of soldiers deploying when they did not meet the hearing standards

869456 for them to tell me to think happy thoughts is what will resolve my issues immediately i have no faith in their judgment
869457 staff sgt dunne attested that he could fulfill his duties

869512 but the medics on the scene often dont know how serious the injuries are and its not until the patient gets to a trauma center that those injuries can be assessed
869513 we are putting patients and flight crews at risk when there is absolutely no chance for the patient to benefit from the risk
869514 we dont do that it would be unethical behold the almighty hippocratic oath
869515 promotes critical thinking skills logical analysis and open and objective discussion of scientific theories being studied including but not limited to evolution the origins of life global warming and human cloning
869516 this bill is not a license to propagandize against something they dont like in science
869517 someone who uses materials to inject religion into the classroom is not only violating the constitution they are violating the bill
869518 they believe that scientific data related to creationism should be discussed when dealing with darwins theory
869519 a scientific hypothesis that survives experimental testing becomes a scientific theory
869520 i will tell you what the truth is you will make the facts fit
869521 were going to drive you to the aircraft carrier they will fly for about a minute before they launch you over the hospital and the crew on the ground should be able to retrieve you and bring you inside within the bogus hour
869522 one recommended way to deal with this complete airway obstruction is to place several more large bore catheters into the trachea to act as exhaust ports for the pressure
869523 if you stick needles into the neck long enough the abyss stares back at you
869524 if you are going to do that you should probably perform a surgical or sem i surg ical cricothyrotomy
869525 none of them had had any specific training in performing a cricothyroidotomy

869528 the silliness of sending a fire engine to a medical emergency deserves a post on cluelessness all to itself
869529 fire department policy requires a truck operator to stop before proceeding through a red light
869530 the fire truck was third in a line of four emergency vehicles and reached the intersection eight seconds after an ambulance had safely gone through it officials said
869531 took on yales professional and administrative staffs citing their hypocritical diversion from the tenets on which the institution was built
869532 the only thing worse than an ineffective laughing stock of a government agency is allowing someone to make a decision without going through a bunch of committees

869535 what do we have currently we have a health care system that costs over 2 trillion dollars a year to operate it is 15 of our economy half of that is government gravy train money some would argue we need expensive health care to keep our economy from collapsing that 2 trillion dollars funds millions and millions of americanas retirement college savings mortgages suvs and t bone steaks removing a significant chunk would collapse the economy the only problem is that money is being spent in all the wrong ways and we are printing money to support a system that is collapsing on its own weight

869538 you lost me on this one a trauma pt needs some kind of blood pressure to make it to surgery the iv is may not be first on the list of things important but is is on the list
869539 if the limbs are busted up burned or missing and there isnt a peripheral iv site handy central lines work just dandy
869540 ios with a pressure infuser just dont give decent volume in my experience
869541 dont stay and play but enroute to 1 of our 5 trauma centers get done what needs to be done even with 5 centers ive had transport times over 40 min urban sprawl at its best
869542 if i want to be a helicopter pilot and want to be a flight nurse should cross train everyone so that i can have my dream job
869543 get your nursing license and your pilots license why would you train everyone
869544 once you have the license you want get the job you want
869545 if you take a utility truck to ems calls and
869546 we do have automatic dispatch of medics theyre on every engine i shudder at the thought of meeting the fire truck on the scene of a working fire if the truck gets there first and the homeowner sees nothing being done because there is no crew now what if the crew gets there first nothing is getting done because they dont have any fire fighting equipment i wouldnt want to have to explain that one to the news crews or defend the video that will show up on youtube
869547 witness noted the medics arent terrible as a whole but there are several merchant medics of death who continue to practice their deadly art
869548 there are some turds floating in every punch bowl why i drink beer if you see a turd make whoever is in charge of ems or training do their job and cleanse their mortal souls we have had guys given the choice of dropping their patch or going through another medic training course from day one to graduation
869549 question what are you guys seeing in the new hires quality wise
869550 hey id rather be you know like at the lake on my boat
869551 my dear you are right i should have given it im i would have too if i didnt think i would get yelled at by the doc on duty
869552 of course i started an iv but it became dislodged when the patient came around just look at his veins hes been stuck
869553 its a fee for providing a service of booking your hotel room
869554 but its not for the hotel room its for the booking
869555 this hotel will give us a 24 hour presence downtown
869556 right now housing in the downtown seems to be a moot point the economy is just not there for condos at this time
869557 it will bring a critical mass of people to the downtown overnight visitors who will shop and eat in our restaurants and make trips out into wine country
869558 they havent told us who hotel chain is leaning toward the project but they said they do have someone interested

869567 the thing we need is an architecture that combines the full programmability of the cpu with the kinds of parallelism and other special capabilities of graphics processors and that architecture is larrabee
869568 it is not a gpu as many have mistakenly described it but it can do most graphics functions
869569 it looks like a gpu and acts like a gpu but actually what its doing is introducing a large number of x86 cores into your pc
869570 larrabee does not require a special api larrabee will excel on standard graphics apis
869571 so existing games will be able to run on larrabee products
869572 and of that population two suppliers ati and nvidia own 98 percent of the discrete gpu business

869575 it is known that keli lane frequented this house prior to the birth of tegan and we believe that she visited there shortly after departing auburn hospital
869576 this has been an ongoing inquiry thats been going on for two years and today we will be conducting a forensic archaelogical excavation at premises at gladesville searching for the remains of tegan lane
869577 we will be interviewing the mother and other people associated with this inquiry in the near future
869578 of course those remains would have to be tested to verify they are the remains of tegan lane
869579 as far as can be determined the risk ranking of ground control was not reassessed or revised in the light of these events

869598 all our life long especially in the time of temptation and when we are present at the administration of it to others by serious and thankful consideration of the nature of it and of the ends for which christ instituted it the privileges and benefits conferred and sealed thereby and our solemn vow made therein by being humbled for our sinful defilement our falling short of and walking contrary to the grace of baptism and our engagements by growing up to assurance of pardon of sin and of all other blessings sealed to us in that sacrament by drawing strength from the death and resurrection of christ into whom we are baptized for the mortifying of sin and quickening of grace and by endeavoring to live by faith to have our conversation in holiness and righteousness as those that have therein given up their names to christ and to walk in brotherly love as being baptized by the same spirit into one body

869619 this will have to be a partnership between the city the state and ourselves
869620 no private entity could afford to put that amount of money into a theater
869621 the uptown can only reopen with the necessary funding from the city
869622 we would first want to see a solid redevelopment plan
869623 just because the theater is located away from downtown doesnt mean it doesnt deserve the same kind of funding as the loop theaters
869624 this is a theater that will serve the entire metropolitan area
869625 a lot of people will be looking over the new owners shoulders

869630 the bottom line here is that the ownership issue will be completely cleared up
869631 regardless of what has happened in the past whoever is the highest bidder will own the building

869703 who says it didnt what i say is that a sun wont last forever thats all im saying were safe for ten billion years but then what
869704 youre thinking well switch to another sun when ours is done arent you
869705 sure you are youre weak on logic thats the trouble with you youre like the guy in the story who was caught in a sudden shower and who ran to a grove of trees and got under one he wasnt worried you see because he figured when one tree got wet through he would just get under another one
869706 dont shout when the sun is done the other stars will be gone too
869707 it all had a beginning in the original cosmic explosion whatever that was and itll all have an end when all the stars run down some run down faster than others hell the giants wont last a hundred million years the sun will last ten billion years and maybe the dwarfs will last two hundred billion for all the good they are but just give us a trillion years and everything will be dark entropy has to increase to maximum thats all
869708 you ask multivac i dare you five dollars says it cant be done
869709 i cant help it i feel funny about leaving earth
869710 we had nothing there well have everything on x 23 you wont be alone you wont be a pioneer there are over a million people on the planet already good lord our great grandchildren will be looking for new worlds because x 23 will be overcrowded
869711 i tell you its a lucky thing the computers worked out interstellar travel the way the race is growing
869712 i suppose families will be going out to new planets forever the way we are now
869713 it will all stop someday but not for billions of years
869714 entropy little sweet is just a word which means the amount of running down of the universe everything runs down you know like your little walkie talkie robot remember
869715 cant you just put in a new power unit like with my robot
869716 the stars are the power units dear once theyre gone there are no more power units
869717 dont let them daddy dont let the stars run down
869718 now now honeys ill ask microvac dont worry hell tell us
869719 see now the microvac says it will take care of everything when the time comes so dont worry
869720 and now children its time for bed well be in our new home soon
869721 are we ridiculous i wonder in being so concerned about the matter
869722 i think not you know the galaxy will be filled in five years at the present rate of expansion
869723 i hesitate to submit a pessimistic report to the galactic council
869724 i wouldnt consider any other kind of report stir them up a bit weve got to stir them up
869725 space is infinite a hundred billion galaxies are there for the taking more
869726 a hundred billion is not infinite and its getting less infinite all the time
869727 very well immortality exists and we have to take it into account i admit it has its seamy side this immortality the galactic ac has solved many problems for us but in solving the problem of preventing old age and death it has undone all its other solutions
869728 not yet im by no means old enough how old are you
869729 im still under two hundred but to get back to my point population doubles every ten years once this gaiaxy is filled well have filled another in ten years another ten years and well have filled two more another decade four more in a hundred years well have filled a thousand galaxies in a thousand years a million galaxies in ten thousand years the entire known universe then what
869730 as a side issue theres a problem of transportation i wonder how many sunpower units it will take to move galaxies of individuals from one galaxy to the next
869731 a very good point already mankind consumes two sunpower units per year
869732 most of its wasted after all our own galaxy alone pours out a thousand sunpower units a year and we only use two of those
869733 granted but even with a hundred per cent efficiency we only stave off the end our energy requirements are going up in a geometric progression even faster than our population well run out of energy even sooner than we run out of galaxies a good point a very good point
869734 well just have to build new stars out of interstellar gas
869735 there may be some way to reverse entropy we ought to ask the galactic ac
869736 its something the human race will have to face someday
869737 oh say i didnt really mean to have you ask that
869738 we both know entropy cant be reversed you cant turn smoke and ash back into a tree
869739 we call ours the same all men call their galaxy their galaxy and nothing more why not
869740 not all galaxies on one particular galaxy the race of man must have originated that makes it different
869741 is in hyperspace in what form it is there i cannot imagine
869742 and is one of these stars the original star of man
869743 mans original star has gone nova it is a white dwarf
869744 a new world as in such cases was constructed for their physical bodies in tlme
869745 but when all energy is gone our bodies will finally die and you and i with them
869746 i do not wish it to happen even after billions of years universal ac how may stars be kept from dying
869747 there is as yet insufficient data for a meaningful answer
869748 carefully husbanded as directed by the cosmic ac the energy that is even yet left in all the universe will last for billions of years
869749 eventually it will all come to an end however it may be husbanded however stretched out the energy once expended is gone and cannot be restored entropy must increase forever to the maximum
869750 can entropy not be reversed let us ask the cosmic ac
869751 there is as yet insufficient data for a meaningful answer
869752 when will you have enough data to answer the question
869753 there is as yet insufficient data for a meaningful answer
869754 ac is this the end can this chaos not be reversed into the universe once more can that not be done
869755 there is as yet insufficient data for a meaningful answer
869756 if someone thinks that love and peace is a cliche that must have been left behind in the sixties thats his problem love and peace are eternal
869757 weve got this gift of love but love is like a precious plant you cant just accept it and leave it in the cupboard or just think its going to get on by itself youve got to keep watering it youve got to really look after it and nurture it
869758 keeping bees alive is a seven day a week job now
869759 used to be i had time for a bit of fishing and riding my motorcycle but not anymore the bees need attention
869760 we still dont know whats going on or why but bees are dying and we better figure it out quick
869761 we know what to expect from the coaches now we know what to expect out of this defense
869762 its more of a reaction now than us trying to make sure were going through each step making everything right its becoming second nature for us
869763 its your talent its understanding your scheme and then playing with great effort those are the things we want to establish thats what we have to get to
869764 these guys are seeing change in their own performance as they get a better understanding of the defense
869765 you can throw history away i just know that through the progression of this defense be it at ole miss with chuck be it bailiff at texas state tcu and new mexico year 2 was always a much improved quantum leap a lot of that was the knowledge that allowed the young men to play faster
869766 we should be better at the end of the day when you add up all the numbers rice should have a much better defense than it has had in the past
869767 it makes you wonder why humans think theyre such big screaming deals
869768 see im frodo and youre sam they are fighting to get rid of the evil ring see the big burning volcano thats candice trying to ruin my life oh look the battlefield theres jay jarrod jake lou my family kenny and everyone just staring and happy that its finally over
869769 but nick you tried moving to nashville an you missed home
869770 should there be a significant release of water there will be a rapid increase in the volume depth and velocity of water in the maich water channel
869771 there is therefore a risk of flooding and erosion of the channel

869773 the whole contest part of this is just for fun and if for any reason anyone is uncomfortable with the tou they shouldnt enter the competition part and just enjoy the walk
869774 i hear that girls suffer not just physically but psychologically
869775 but i am afraid i dont want my daughters to have uncontrollable demands for sex
869776 insomma il film di matteo garrone riesce nel miracolo di incrociare alla perfezione la dimensione del reale e quella dellincubo facendoci precipitare in quellincubo della realt che viviamo ogni giorno senza quasi accorgercene
869777 if youre talking about someone to take on both jobs then kevin pietersen becomes the number one candidate because hes one of the few people who can be guaranteed their place in both teams
869778 michael vaughans decision is his own decision but i cant believe that paul collingwood made that decision off his own back
869779 clearly they want to unite the job and get one bloke in there and theyve given paul a gentle nudge to say that this is in the best interests of the team
869780 hes been a wonderfully successful captain englands most successful in terms of test match wins and is surely one of englands greatest ever captains
869781 in terms of playing captaining leading decision making michael vaughan is the best man for the job
869782 its a wonderful job but its also a job that becomes all consuming he said hes not been himself at home and wanted to get back to being me
869783 the job gets on top of you its a great job but youre thinking about it all the time
869784 when youre supposed to be at dinner with friends or the wife youre thinking about who should be opening the bowling the next day and how to tell your mate hes not in the next team
869785 that pressure eventually bears down on you and if youre not getting runs as well then it becomes very difficult
869786 people should just be intentional and not try to use the ef as a wonder hammer to hit all potential projects as with any other technology it should be evaluated in the context of the project constraints and attributes
869787 i must do every possible thing that nhib lbllgen subsonic etc does
869788 the above code has no requirement for instances on the ef
869789 what we do believe however is that it is desirable to have a single meta model edm if you will with which you can describe many domain models and that by having a single grammar we can provide a set of common services on any given domain model
869790 coding in a box then seeking feedback on preview or final releases
869791 but we had to deal with the tension between trying to add more features vs trying to stay true to our initial goal which was to lay the core foundation for a multiple release strategy for building out a broader data platform offering
869792 but be ready for the warning because i signed a five year deal with this club and were going to play kansas city a lot i dont say be careful they played with fire and i respect everyone on the pro level but enough is enough
869793 well simply have to coax him out into the open
869794 hey bob check this baby out one of a kind
869795 oh my goodness where did i go wrong with her
869796 you can see how for people who were exhausted it would have been nearly impossible for them to descend without the ropes
869797 once their hands and feet are frozen they really are unable to move on their own power and it takes other people to carry them down
869798 its more technical its steeper the weather is more intense
869799 thy place is here sad sister come away once like thyself i trembled wept and prayd loves victim then though now a sainted maid but all is calm in this eternal sleep here grief forgets to groan and love to weep evn superstition loses evry fear for god not man absolves our frailties here
869800 this happened to a friend of a friend of mine
869801 its not even headline news on the times of india website a day later is life just so temporal that a country moves on from such a senseless tragedy so fast
869802 to benjamins family benjamin was found near here in physical distress he was vomiting and his breathing was not normal he had no tag or collar and so was thought to be a stray he was taken and cared for but his condition was severe and he did not live please know that he was held and comforted in the most tender way and did not die alone we are very sorry for your loss
869803 whats the matter with you why are you staring at my application
869804 i dont know its this part experience i dont really have any
869805 bullshit of course you have experience everybody does look what can you do
869806 nothing i mean ive never had an actual job ive done things but weird things you know things people havent even heard of let alone talk about let alone on a job application
869807 okay so like i am double jointed in strange ways i can bed my wrist well like this
869808 okay and i can do the splits but like totally flat and i can cross my legs over my head all this weird shit thats useless but look see what i did
869809 it means shit darling i made it up but see what are they gonna do if they ask if i was really a senior contortionist all i have to do is bend over backwards and touch the top of my head to the floor which i can do plus theyll see handicapped and thay will just really freak them out you cannot fuck with the handicapped in this country or with anybody who even knows somebody who is handicapped
869810 im bipolar and i often rent hotel rooms so i can destroy the furniture there instead of at home
869811 id change reasoning to your mother being the psychotic mess no one could argue with that
869812 does this look like the dick of a fifteen year old to you waitress
869813 but my god you should have seen how that shut them all up heres this big fat pig of a linebacker with a tampon stuck to his shirt then splat on his shoe
869814 what you saw in the congress this week was the war dance of the hand maidens of the oil companies
869815 to make their most grateful acknowledgments to their friends and customers for the many favours and civilities they have received and hope by this union they will be enabled to carry on their business to the entire satisfaction of their friends as on their part the strictest assiduity and attention shall be observed
869816 from our point of view the move into an mvno is one of the key strategic directions for us but the question is always what is the right market to launch into
869817 when we select the market to launch into we want to get it right
869818 it has been a wonderful experience being associated with balaji motion pictures in the past with shootout i really liked the concept of the film c kkompany and the way they incorporated me to introduce the 3 protagonists in the title song i enjoyed the song when i heard it and also since it was proposed by mr ramesh sippy who is like family i immediately agreed to do it this is just the beginning of our long association
869819 i really dont know painting was just a subject in my school and i started improving it slowly and steadily i got some stuff at home to paint and now i really enjoy painting
869820 i basically do sketching drawing shading or dry pastels it really depends on my mood on a particular day
869821 i really havent taken any formal training in painting as such its just whatever i learnt in school my teachers encouraged me by saying that i do have a flair for painting and i just took it forward from there
869822 not really my paintings or sketches reflect what mood i am in sometimes i may sketch a human figure or maybe paint some of our gods and goddesses at times it may just be something abstract or maybe a cartoon figure
869823 ive had the figures checked and the trend is stable or down
869824 ahmadiyah is the enemy of islam they are the infidels that have been trying to destroy islam not using violence but through their deviant principles
869825 ahmadiyah must be dissolved as it is more dangerous than communism
869826 dylan i love you you are a good man god be with you love elaine
869827 the only sign i saw of her was of somebody being pretty positive about life
869828 its hard dealing with something thats happened 15 months ago
869829 i find it hard to believe shes just gone off on a jaunt
869830 if she is out there the further effort will locate her
869831 immediately after yesterdays game the club wasnt able to confirm the extent of lukes injury due to the unusual nature of its occurrence
869832 scans this morning revealed that luke has strained his left hamstring the strain is to the belly of the muscle not the tendon
869833 it was quickly rectified and there were no safety implications at any time
869834 we experience these sorts of delays right across our business
869835 the pre flight inspections are done as part of the safety systems within qantas and every other airline for that matter for this exact reason to find anything the crew or the engineers are not happy with
869836 there are so many potential problems that can be picked up before the aircraft is in the air it was a hydraulic leak a very routine event
869837 it shows that the safety system is working as it should in fact we should all be encouraged that the systems are working well
869838 we dont have any evidence before us that qantas safety systems are not working or that there are links between these events or that there are any safety problems within qantas
869839 there is no doubt that behavioural change can be very difficult and this advice line means people wont have to do it on their own
869840 its based on the very successful quitline which has helped thousands of smokers quit the habit and start leading healthier lives
869841 i certainly encourage married couples to pray for a good and happy sex life its a way for them to become closer to god
869842 at first people are usually slightly shocked but at the same time happily surprised
869843 if you believe in god then you believe god is involved in life in love marriage and in sex and sexuality it seems natural to talk about sex to remove taboos and the label of sinfulness
869844 love between a married couple expressed in sex brings the human body closer to heaven the ecstasy in the joy of sexual intercourse can be likened to the joy of eternal life
869845 this is why the conjugal act allows spouses to begin to understand the sweetness of encountering god
869846 concentration on the physiological side of a sexual intercourse causes reduction of its most important elements
869847 when a woman is excited she wants to experience absolute pleasure as much as a man does
869848 the feeling of sexual dissatisfaction for a woman who is already excited is a great physical and psychological suffering
869849 i look at it this way you dont have to have a heart condition to be a cardiologist and you dont have to be an alcoholic to work as a therapist
869850 the holy fathers theology of the body and other philosophical and theological works delve deeply into the divinity of sexual relations in marriage im just making these complex ideas more accessible to average catholics
869851 the workshops with father knotz really helped us to overcome our inhibitions and guilt regarding sex
869852 he really listens to couples and this is why i think he understands us so well
869853 its a novel approach which in my experience helps couples achieve greater intimacy so why not
869854 this report shows that more than 50 per cent of existing teachers would meet those accomplished standards
869855 what we require now is a commitment on the part of government with additional targeted funding to progress this proposition
869856 this proposal from the profession is timely as coag council of australian governments is developing its national partnership on teacher quality
869857 i am concerned that the aeus proposal would mean that more than half of the nations teachers would qualify for this professional pay
869858 performance pay should be for those who actually perform at the highest level and should be something teachers strive towards it shouldnt be easy for anyone and everyone to qualify
869859 the ieua looks forward to working with our colleagues in the government school sector to achieve these agreed outcomes
869860 the death toll as of now is 148 and 48 people are injured
869861 jeffs a leader to all the aboriginal boys at the club and also to a lot of younger guys
869862 i would like to see him stick around for a couple more years because i reckon wiz is a great leader on the field and a lot of boys look up to him
869863 if ive got anything to talk about hes always there to back me up hes sort of like another brother to me
869864 i havent spoken to wiz about his future i think hes spoken to his manager but the way ive seen it i think hell be playing on next year
869865 mr mac is responding well to treatment and will be released soon
869866 he asked that his privacy and that of his family is respected while he gets well

869868 its happened so now what can i do to help the situation
869869 coal makes us sick oil makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining our world
869870 after an exhaustive review of a substantial body of climate research and in conjunction with the obvious and compelling new evidence that exists it is time that the world community acknowledges that the earth has begun the next climate change
869871 predominantly colder global temperatures for many years into the future
869872 alarmists have adopted the position that all extremes of weather cold warm wet or dry are all due to global warming
869873 the record snows severe weather and heavy rainfall have been the result of rapid cooling in the northern tier of the united states and canada not global warming
869874 nasa now begrudgingly confirms that the hottest year on record in the continental 48 was not 1998 as previously believed but 1934 and that six of the 10 hottest years since 1880 antedate 1954
869875 but global warming alarmism with its dire warnings about the consequences of industry and consumerism is equally a rebuke to capitalism
869876 india and g33 did the right thing really if we cannot have the flexibility to impose extra tariffs above the current levels developing countries like the philippines will face real dangers of being flooded with subsidized imports as a consequence people will severely lose their jobs and livelihoods and they will be added to the many workers and industries displaced by this unhampered trade liberalization this may even exacerbate the global food crisis that we are experiencing right now
869877 developed countries led by the us are blaming india and the g33 for the collapse but we say if not because of the intransigence of the us eu and other developed countries to keep their trade distorting subsidies at the expense of the poorer countries and for us to swallow deeper cuts in industrial goods than them we could have saved the doha round
869878 we therefore salute the developing countries for standing their ground on what they believe as their right to development and to defend the jobs and livelihoods of their working people
869879 the multilateral agreement such as the wto is still our preferred option but if we are going to pursue bilateral and regional trade agreements we should always put our national interest above all and always within the framework of our development needs we should not rush into entering free trade agreements that in the end will be to our disadvantage jpepa is a clear case of this great economic disadvantage to us
869880 in this case what we are always saying to the government is that we should now create a law like the philippine trade representative office ptro precisely because the country needs a unified trade negotiating team pursuing a clear philippine trade development agenda in all of the trade negotiations we are entering into

869885 i dont want to be a distraction to the packers and i hope in the next few days we can come to an agreement that would allow me to continue playing football
869886 aaron rodgers is the starting quarterback for the green bay packers
869887 i hope we can finally understand that thats where we are as an organization and as a head coach of the green bay packers i dont know how else to answer that question
869888 people of the world this is our moment this is our time
869889 a world wide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbor anywhere in the world
869890 dylan i love you you are a good man god be with you love elaine

869895 the socialist connections of obama and the democratic party have certainly not been featured in the washington post columns of harold meyerson who happens not only to be a member but a vice chair of the democratic socialists of america
869896 american voters must make up their minds about what barack obama really believes in if anything his recent rhetorical concessions to the center further muddy the waters so we must look to his past teachers and associates for help in understanding the inner obama
869897 in his first series of national campaign commercials since securing the delegates needed to win the democratic presidential campaign barack obama struggles to re introduce himself

869907 corporations have neither body to jail nor soul to damn
869908 reliable information not money is the currency of true democracy
869909 rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will within limits drawn around us by the equal rights of others i do not add within the limits of the law because law is often but the tyrants will and always so when it violates the rights of the individual
869910 unthinking respect for authority is the greatest enemy of truth
869911 a nation that is afraid to let its people judge truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people
869912 if they can get you asking the wrong questions they dont have to worry about the answers
869913 the illusion of freedom will continue as long as its profitable to continue the illusion at the point where the illusion becomes too expensive to maintain they will just take down the scenery they will pull back the curtains they will move the tables and chairs out of the way and you will see the brick wall at the back of the theatre
869914 the 20th century has been characterized by three developments of great political importance the growth of democracy the growth of corporate power and the growth of corporate propaganda as a means of protecting corporate power against democracy
869915 the corporation is an externalizing machine moving its operating costs to external organizations and people in the same way that a shark is a killing machine
869916 we have long since made clear that a state of war is not a blank check for the president when it comes to the rights of the nations citizens
869917 if youve done nothing wrong then you have nothing to worry about
