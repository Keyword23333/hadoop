7900013 ceos tell people all the time that they value integrity a good way to walk the walk is have integrity on salaries
7900014 a major concern from a management perspective is that an employee goes from being unhappy to becoming a true villain
7900015 in a worst case scenario an employee may actually try and sabotage others by spreading rumors not sharing important work related information and engage in other problem behaviors

7900043 he is a people person and a relationship oriented superintendent which in a community like fallbrook will pay high dividends

7900045 i certainly wouldnt say i know all there is to know about either the community or the school district there is a lot to learn and a lot of people to meet
7900046 hes a very caring person and everywhere hes been hes made a difference
7900047 youd better downplay that around here dale because this is chargers country
7900048 that will allow him to network well with the elementary school districts around fallbrook
7900049 he is so versed in their ed code their economics and their budgeting he could sit in on a meeting of those superintendents and really hold his own
7900050 hes already met with the teachers at fallbrook high to rave reviews
7900051 lets just hope it goes that way and i have no reason to believe it wont

7900070 appliancesmart has established itself in the atlanta market with four other strongly performing retail outlets we believe our brand of offering customers a wide selection of high quality discount priced appliances has proven to work extremely well in this market the addition of a fifth outlet to serve this market will enable us to increase our market penetration while generating greater economies of scale as we leverage advertising and other overhead expenses

7900088 it is probably not advisable to drive before six weeks after bunion surgery on the right foot our research shows that the reflexes and the power required to brake suddenly in an emergency is fully returned only at six weeks in the post operative period
7900089 however it is extremely important for all patients to discuss when they can return to driving with their surgeon after having any type of surgery to their foot
7900090 before we started this project we contacted multiple government agencies and insurance companies to find out what advice patients are given about driving after foot surgery and were very surprised to learn that no guidance existed
7900091 we found this not only surprising but also unsatisfactory anecdotal experience told us that patients are generally allowed to drive after a period of six weeks after other lower limb surgery but no research existed before our study to support this advice

7900279 it soon became clear to me that the ossetians viewed georgians in much the same way that georgians view russians as aggressive bullies bent on taking away their independence
7900280 i was there in march 1991 shortly after the city was occupied by georgian militia units loyal to zviad gamsakhurdia the first freely elected leader of georgia in seven decades one of gamsakhurdias first acts as georgian president was to cancel the political autonomy that the stalinist constitution had granted the republics 90 000 strong ossetian minority i discovered that the town tskhinvali the capital of south ossetia had been ransacked by gamsakhurdias militia the georgians had trashed the ossetian national theater decapitated the statue of an ossetian poet and pulled down monuments to ossetians who had fought with soviet troops in world war ii the ossetians were responding in kind firing on georgian villages and forcing georgian residents of tskhinvali to flee their homes

7900297 due to similarities in the wording of the statements and the manner of suicides as well as statements made by other detainees interviewed
7900298 there was growing concern that someone within the camp delta population was directing detainees to commit suicide and that additional suicides might be imminent
7900299 the cells of other detainees were searched during the week following the suicides in an attempt to find evidence regarding whether the suicides had been part of a larger conspiracy which might result in additional detainees also taking their lives
7900300 additional handwritten notes found in cells other than those where the suicides took place
7900301 and other documents reveal that the men took advantage of lapses in guard protocol and of lenient policies toward compliant detainees to commit what suicide notes described as an attack on the united states
7900302 investigators found that guards had become lax on certain rules because commanders wanted to reward the more compliant detainees giving them extra t shirts blankets and towels detainees were allowed to hang such items to dry or to provide privacy while using the toilet but were not supposed to be able to obscure their cells while sleeping guards told officials that it was not unusual to see blankets hanging in the cells and that they did not think twice when they passed several cells on the night of june 9 2006 with blankets strung through the wire mesh authorities believe the men probably hanged themselves around 10 p m but they were not discovered until shortly after midnight on june 10
7900303 who was arrested near his college in pakistan in march 2002 and was turned over to u s authorities on may 2 2002 in afghanistan was not someone they could prosecute
7900304 a mid to high level al qaeda operative who had key ties to principal facilitators and senior members of the group
7900305 although many of the individuals apprehended during the raid have strong connections to al qaeda there is no credible information to suggest ahmed received terrorist related training or is a member of the al qaeda network
7900306 senior pentagon official who read the report and provided details in exchange for anonymity
7900307 that the navy investigation found the simultaneous suicides to be acts of defiance and martyrdom
7900308 left unexplained one key question why guards had not checked on the men for two and a half hours before they were discovered hanging in their cells
7900309 tours of the prison camps have described a strict doctrine that had guards check on each detainee every few minutes
7900310 its simply astounding that it took the government over two years to conclude a so called investigation of three men who died in a small cage under the governments exclusive control the investigation itself is what needs to be investigated along with the people whove perpetrated the disgraceful extra constitutional detentions
7900311 several of the detainees had had a vision in which three of them had to die for the rest to be freed
7900312 they have lost hope in life they have no hope in their eyes they are ghosts and they want to die no food will keep them alive now even with four feeds a day these men get diarrhea from any protein which goes right through them
7900313 said that dinner had come early that evening and that everyone in the block suddenly got tired and had fallen asleep even though it was never quiet in the block at that hour even when the guards left us in peace there was always someone who couldnt fall asleep who wanted to pray or who kept waking up throughout the night
7900314 the metal shutters in front of the windows had also been closed from the outside as if a storm were approaching
7900315 he had been woken up in the middle of the night by a loud bang
7900316 we didnt think that could be true he would have had to attach the noose to the sharp metal lattices with his hands and feet tied and with no chair to stand on that was nearly impossible
7900317 it seemed highly unlikely that the guards would have failed to catch him in time
7900318 they barely let us out of their sight for a minute
7900319 the guards claimed he had covered the walls of his cage so that they hadnt seen him do it but what was he supposed to have used to cover the cage the same sheets with which he allegedly hung himself
7900320 it was not unusual to see blankets hanging in the cells
7900321 and what about the rule prohibiting us from hanging anything on the walls of our cells
7900322 it seemed too much of a coincidence that the other two dead men had hung themselves at exactly the same time in exactly the same way in the same block while all the other inmates had been sleeping like babies when the guards were patrolling the corridors it never took long before other guards came to ensure we were following the rules the guards never took a break since they too were kept under surveillance to ensure that they too were carrying out their duties
7900323 and what about the sharpshooters in the watchtowers hadnt they noticed anything
7900324 didnt seem to have much of a reason for killing himself
7900325 no we prisoners unanimously agreed the men had been killed maybe they had been beaten to death and then strung up or perhaps they had been strangled
7900326 if prisoners died in guant namo it would create trouble for the bush government and they wouldnt have to take part in the war

7900351 i am encouraged by the news that more high school students in the class of 2008 took the sat r and that their scores rose slightly over last years class
7900352 this means they are committed to taking more rigorous coursework that will help them succeed in college
7900353 there still exists a significant achievement gap between students who are white or asian and african american or latino students just like with the act r results released earlier this month the sat r scores show too many students of color are falling behind academically i know many dedicated teachers administrators and parents are working hard to prepare their children for college because thats where they will develop the skills needed to compete in a more global economically challenging world

7900370 the results keep demonstrating that changing to circular hooks is the right choice since it favours turtle conservation without having an impact on the economy of artisanal fisheries
7900371 together with fishermen we are building a culture for sustainable fishing practices that will guarantee fish stocks in the long term
7900372 our goal is to reduce the incidental catch of marine turtles from the long line fishing operations without affecting the fisheries activity which is a main source of food and income for local communities
7900373 this programme is going beyond an initial focus of saving sea turtles from bycatch and is creating the groundwork toward sustainable artisanal long line fishing in the eastern pacific
7900374 by working co operatively collecting data and learning how to improve practices this programme is living proof that conservation and industry can work together for sustainability

7900389 our belief is that the apsa should choose its sites carefully with particular regard for questions of freedom of speech and conscience
7900390 have written in areas that seem particularly disfavoured by the canadian legal establishment
7900391 we are uncertain of the extent of the legal jeopardy that apsa members might place themselves in should they make public arguments in canada or post those arguments online concerning hot button issues like homosexuality same sex marriage or the nature of the islamist threat to western civilization
7900392 the nature of radical islamism and the relationship of public morality and homosexual conduct are issues of vital public importance
7900393 all political scientists have a professional interest in a full and open scholarly debate
7900394 turn a blind eye to canadian attacks on freedom of speech
7900395 protection of academic freedom equitable access to opportunity and a commitment to non discrimination
7900396 our belief is that most americans even apsa members have no idea how precarious the rights of freedom of speech and conscience are in canada
7900397 whereas members of the association ought to be able at the 2009 annual meeting to present research and argument on controversial topics such as public policy concerning homosexuality or the character of and proper response to terrorist elements acting in the name of islam without fear of legal repercussions of any kind we petition the council and staff of the apsa to take all steps necessary to ensure that academic freedom and free speech even on controversial topics such as these are not threatened at the 2009 annual meeting including soliciting legal advice and seeking the assurance of the government of canada and local authorities that the civil rights and liberties of members to free speech and academic freedom will be secure

7900418 weve just taken it to the classic rock platform and tried to play the very best of the music in the era of the late 60s and early 70s
7900419 we want to build a fan base have a fair priced ticket and have the show proliferate with other versions that come out in the future

7900421 ich freue mich dass der bildungsmonitor 2008 unsere anstrengungen f r eine familiengerechte politik w rdigt wir werden diesen weg in berlin fortsetzen und die angebote gleichzeitig weiter verbessern
7900422 die kritik m ssen wir ernst nehmen allerdings muss man diesen punkt differenziert betrachten so steht die betriebliche ausbildung im fokus der untersuchung und nicht der schulische teil zugleich schl gt hier die strukturelle schw che des wirtschaftsstandortes berlin durch richtig ist dass wir einen schwerpunkt auf die berufliche bildung legen zum beispiel sollen leistungsschwache auszubildende k nftig besser gef rdert werden daf r habe ich veranlasst dass mit beginn des neuen schuljahres die teilnehmer an der einstiegsqualifizierung berufsschulpflichtig werden

7900425 we feel a deep responsibility to make measureable changes not only at the us open and national tennis center but also in the minds of our worldwide audience
7900426 we have the opportunity to showcase this highly attended sport in a way that encourages our fans to alter their approach in their own lives in the end it is this collective action that will truly make a difference
7900427 big time sporting events provide a unique platform to educate fans on green initiatives and we feel that the best way we can educate is to lead by example
7900428 we have a plan that will lessen the environmental impact of the event and heighten the environmental awareness of those who attend it
7900429 we are taking a big step with the home of the us open becoming one of the first in the tennis community to take significant action to positively impact the environment
7900430 the us open will serve as a springboard for other tennis events to declare their commitment and actions to a greener approach to our sport
7900431 the usta is using its market influence and cultural visibility to send environmentally meaningful signals to the market place
7900432 all tennis fans should take pride in what the usta is doing by using clean non fossil fuel energy to power this event switching to recycled paper products promoting the use of public transportation and assuring the recycling of its plastic debris the usta is making an important statement that we all need to lighten our impact on the planet this smart event planning should be used as the model for all tennis events worldwide
7900433 already requires awareness because a lot of this is driven through peoples perception of the product
7900434 this series is one big serial and the most ambitious story weve ever made

7900436 we hope to make torchwood a gripping and surprising tv event with storylines that push our team into greater danger and sacrifice
7900437 if it were a real painkiller we should expect no difference compared to the routine overt administration
7900438 what we found is that the covert cck antagonist was completely ineffective in relieving pain
7900439 we can never be sure about the real action of a drug
7900440 the very act of administering a drug activates a complex cascade of biochemical events in the patients brain

7900452 indicates clearly that the russian federation after its attempts of military intervention in georgia invasion of a part of georgian territory and overthrow of the democratically elected government has decisively chosen ethnic cleansing and destruction of civilian infrastructure with the use of military force as an instrument of its foreign policy
7900453 calls on the international community to take all measures necessary to prevent the russian federation from invading the territory of georgia conducting ethnic cleansing and destroying its economy
7900454 its not a connection that seems to make much sense at first glance but you cant ignore the pattern

7900460 they said if you dont voluntarily give up the dogs we will arrest you and put you in jail and charge a fine for each dog here
7900461 i equate this to living in one room of my house for all of my life and somebody just dropping groceries by once a week not a lot of stimulation
7900462 this is not what dogs were put on this planet for
7900463 how can you raise dogs without worming them and vaccinating them trimming their toenails and grooming them
7900464 we petted them and played with them and held them
7900465 they rode around on a golf cart with us they were very well socialized
7900466 some of them you put them on the ground and they dont know what it is because theyve lived their entire life on wire mesh
7900467 all the dogs had food and water in front of them at all times
7900468 you have to understand in an environment with four or five in a kennel theyre competing for food
7900469 you simply cant describe the overwhelming smell of the ammonia the feces
7900470 and these were kept decently clean but still the smell was just horrible
7900471 she was trying to care for the animals the best way she could but it was just impossible to care for that many dogs properly with the staff that the kennel had
7900472 these dogs have never been outside of that environment everything is new to them
7900473 they come to you with these bright eyes saying thank you

7900556 the barangays that will be directly affected can tell that they were not consulted there was a barangay that was consulted but residents do not want it why would we still approve its endorsement
7900557 if you will notice there are small newspapers in news stands that carry obscene stories even little boys and teenagers can pick them up and read them if we allow this we might be encouraging the development of a potential rapist
7900558 if you see a woman naked do you still think of art
7900559 this is really sad because it degrades the image of women into being sex objects these reading materials are disrespectful of women

7900694 there will be criticism from some inside and outside the company that these changes particularly in editorial will compromise quality and critical mass in the metro mastheads and their mission
7900695 we reject that this initiative has been carefully constructed by the publishers with full regard for the integrity of their mastheads our mastheads will remain true to their heritage and their values of quality andexcellence
7900696 you would expect them to say they can maintain quality
7900697 time will tell but you will not find many editors who have figured out how you can lose several hundred staff and keep up the quality without a magic potion
7900698 i was responsible for starting a lot of these sections at a time when the smh had no sections at all
7900699 but the newspapers have gone far too far down the lifestyle track they have done it because they believe these sections command benefits in additional advertising
7900700 after fuelling growth in these sections for two decades it would now be not a bad thing at all if the reduction in costs came from cuts to lifestyle
7900701 what those of us who care about journalism say is that there should be less of this death by a thousand cuts and a deeper analysis and reinvention
7900702 we dont manufacture widgets here or car tyres we responsibly provide information to people
7900703 the point we make is that quality depends on individual journalists and the teams of journalists they put together they seem to want to actively break up the teams and the esprit de corps
7900704 management simply doesnt value quality and this new round of redundancies is another example of it
7900705 you cant expect quality wont be affected when you take out so many
7900706 the people likely to go are the most experienced and valued journalists whom fairfax sees as the most expensive newspapers all over the world are struggling and the ones that are doing better are the ones who are investing in their staff
7900707 we must tell people what they want to know and even more important what they might not want to know about war politics economics schools corruption and the thoughts and deeds of those who lead us we need to tell readers more about barack obama and less about britney spears
7900708 if you look at readership and circulation trends over the last few years newspapers with markets that are very clearly defined very targeted are still growing
7900709 this includes regional dailies like the geelong advertiser and townsville daily bulletin or the gold coast bulletin the national daily the australian its a serious political newspaper were still growing i think the fin is holding on better than the smh and the age it knows its market it is a business newspaper but its those papers that are trying to be all things to all people in the capital cities that are struggling
7900710 its instructive that management at fairfax sees that their core business is in fact lifestyle journalism because lifestyle journalism is just as vulnerable to the internet as classifieds were
7900711 theres not much in lifestyle journalism that you cant get provided easily online and its very cheap for internet providers
7900712 well how can that be there has to be a reason were here
7900713 this is about productivity and efficiency mainly at the metropolitan end
7900714 we make no bones about the fact we do continue to see a leaking out of the bottom of the bucket when it comes to lineage classified advertising

7900725 cynthia mckinney deserves a place in the new orleans debate any presidential candidate who has qualified for enough ballot lines to achieve the necessary electoral votes to win to be elected regardless of poll numbers has earned a place in the debates the 15 threshold is being used to exclude all candidates outside of the corporate party nominees john mccain and barack obama
7900726 ms mckinney is more than just the candidate of a viable and growing party she has played a special role in the movement to help survivors of the 2005 hurricane disaster in new orleans and the gulf coast region no other presidential candidate can talk about the needs of those whove been displaced or otherwise affected by katrina the way ms mckinney can their concerns will be missing from the debate if cynthia mckinney isnt invited
7900727 voters deserve to know about all the names theyll see on the ballot on election day and to know which candidate best represents ones interests and ideals its time to end debates limited to candidates approved by sponsoring corporations and pollsters

7900741 the muslim community has been disenfranchised since 9 11 said khurrum wahid a florida trial lawyer and an organizer of the first ever caucus
7900742 we have young people who are engineers and doctors and lawyers but they have not gotten involved in politics it is important to make that step if we are to totally integrate into the american system we need to integrate but we dont need to lose our identity in the process
7900743 i never thought id see this wahid said to ellison as they looked around a room filled with more than 150 people
7900744 he asked me if i thought he should run wahid said
7900745 i told him if you do run youre going to be under a microscope like never before he told me bring it on i knew then he was the right man now we need more to follow him

7900844 the eastern portion of the fault has moved at a predictable rate and the earthquake activity associated with it has been what we would expect
7900845 but the western part of the fault has been lagging in terms of the number and size of earthquakes it seems to be straining absorbing the motion
7900846 it could mean that the fault is getting ready for a large earthquake or it could mean that the movement has been so gradual that we couldnt detect it
7900847 land stations also detected a four fold increase in the number of earthquakes along the blanco fault in 2008 compared to background rates
7900848 our monitoring may be missing a lot of earthquakes that are less than 3 0
7900849 the western side of the fault may be experiencing a series of mini quakes that we cant detect or it could be slowing creeping along in a way we cannot measure
7900850 but we cant discount the possibility that its energy hasnt been released and it will some day in the form of a good sized earthquake
7900851 you need quite a bit of vertical displacement on the ocean floor to generate a tsunami

7900866 remember 18 million people voted for me 18 million people give or take voted for barack
7900867 well if this party has a message it has done a hell of a job of hiding it tonight i promise you that
7900868 everyone else to have felt it was a very very successful first night of the convention so carville seems to be out there in the minority
7900869 clearly tonight as we move toward the economy you will see some very sharp contrast because there is a real difference between him and john mccain
7900870 i look at this and i am about to jump out of my chair
7900871 latest polls show that 30 of hillary supporters are voting for mccain as cnn stated last night if even 5 vote for mccain in november mccain will win the presidency
7900872 i dont think anyone really believes that obama was a better candidate than clinton in retrospect
7900873 what is wrong with the clinton supporters why cant they let go i do not get it all
7900874 wij verklaren hierbij de gezamenlijke opdrachtgevers te zijn van en verantwoordelijk te zijn voor de uitgave van de nummers van bluf waarin de gewraakte dokumenten werden gepubliceerd

7900876 hes got to kick butt a little more about it
7900877 hes going to go run across this state and kick john mccain from one side to the other
7900878 you dont want to play the race card but its out there
7900879 i just think the trade and labor movement was not ready for some of the major changes were looking at
7900880 bidens close to the trades and it plays better with him
7900881 it shouldnt be as close as it is now it just seems to me it shouldnt be that close it should be a no brainer
7900882 i really think it still has to do with gods guns and gays you bring in his race and the muslim rumor all these things are factors that are easy to play out in the rural areas
7900883 at the end of the day even though im anxious im still confident were going to win
7900884 we need to be talking to each other but we also need to be talking to america
7900885 were not talking about any of that and its crazy
7900886 were busy with the kids and doing playing sports living a normal life
7900887 were trying to find solutions to help her and to eventually you know be less stressful for her and also our family as a whole
7900888 the obama plan doesnt take away any choices but the main way it helps is by directly reducing the cost of care to get their premiums down
7900889 no challenge too great for a world that stands as one
7900890 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
7900891 n o n o pode ser nunca esse pre o
7900892 irritated i was angry and i was disappointed and frustrated
7900893 my company and local media in general have been talking about not going for the last 12 years the last three conventions
7900894 ive been waiting for a long time for this shoe to drop and now it has
7900895 this is where a lot of the political stories for the next two months come from
7900896 when youre at a convention youre in a bubble working on your own story
7900897 i know more about whats going on there not being there that feels odd to me
7900898 theyre sending what like 20 people is there such a thing as too much local coverage
7900899 you can compare what we do in a couple of weeks to what kstp does for twins games
7900900 now we turn to the community with an even bigger question which image do you want to see on your resistance 2 collectors edition cover while you may think developing the game is our biggest challenge at insomniac we agonize almost equally over important details like creating and choosing the box art and this time weve got three solid images that are making the decision especially difficult were torn and want to know what you think so vote well be eagerly awaiting your feedback as always
7900901 there may be parts of the speech that arent going to get a lot of applause but ive got to say what i believe will get out country back on the right path
7900902 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it tonight i promise you that
7900903 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
7900904 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7900905 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7900906 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7900907 to discuss ways in which his foundation is addressing some of the worlds most pressing problems
7900908 president clinton understands this is sen obamas convention and he is here to do all he can to make sen obama our next president
7900909 were talking about the nominee for the president of the united states

7900940 the arrest is part of an ongoing investigation by lancashire constabulary and greater manchester counter terrorism unit
7900941 this is a very sensitive time for all our communities and we are working hard to ensure everyone is kept up to date with as much information as we can give
7900942 we will endeavour to carry out any searches as quickly as possible to minimise impact on the area concerned however inquiries of this nature are complex and may take time to resolve
7900943 i would like to thank local residents affected by the arrests for their co operation and ask that they remain patient
7900944 we are experiencing very challenging economic times and edc is laying the groundwork for results
7900945 an aggressive marketing effort has netted over 192 prospective companies and we are poised to recruit more companies as the economy shows signs of improvement the board and staff are intensely focused on turning this corner
7900946 i think its fair to say there was muffled consternation in the first few seconds
7900947 people were clearly suffering with the shock of it but on the whole
7900948 they thought they were going to meet their maker and thats not an exaggeration
7900949 that he hoped the clinton supporters in the room would help as much as possible
7900950 if women take a moment to realize that on every issue important to women john mccain is not in their corner that would help them sadly folks like lithwick and taylor marsh whom she quotes in her article just
7900951 however its finders keepers losers weepers she made the grave mistake of sending to the rbo inbox
7900952 it was until 1968 i think every reporter secretly craves for the world to blow up during one of these things
7900953 in any rational trial the defendant would walk because you wouldnt be able to prove that love actually exists
7900954 yeah ive heard that hes working on an a rod biography he wrote a joe dimaggio biography after
7900955 i agree with you stella and im not saying that the clintons are obliged to do anything im just saying what im sure they will do theyve always been 100 percent loyal democrats
7900956 love the post i had my own wooden horse buster ah the memories of galloping off into the sunset on my timber steed must now post my own pony acquisition story
7900957 i think ill get the above mentioned stuffed pony just for funsies i feel it might discourage chronic cubical loiterers as well thanks for the kind words pf hes a really special horse and were doing all we can
7900958 again how can we get a pundit to be a food taster and then serve food and look menacing
7900959 oh no no meanness meant i just realized that when wayne was teasing you and he mentioned the roman empire that was all i could think of the naked man oiling scene i am extremely superficial obviously
7900960 well she wants to see the results of the move itll be this one time
7900961 have you needed to go in the house without my permission to get something or fix something
7900962 why i would never go in your house without your permission that would be illegal i would never go through your jewelry or your closets that would be wrong
7900963 i was going to get something from your house but you werent home so of course of course i didnt go in would it be alright if i dropped by to pick up this unimportant thing i cant even remember what it was she wanted now
7900964 well is the code the same i mean if you changed it i wouldnt want the police to come
7900965 why dont you just tell me when you need to come and ill be available

7900978 investigations by unama found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men
7900979 we believe those to be family members of the targeted militant mullah sadiq he was important for us to target
7900980 military operations lasted several hours during which air strikes were called in
7900981 the destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with some 78 houses having been totally destroyed and serious damage to many others
7900982 i have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations
7900983 the impact of such operations undermines the trust and confidence of the afghan people in efforts to build a just peaceful and law abiding state
7900984 air strikes on civilian targets uncoordinated house searches and illegal detention of afghan civilians must be stopped
7900985 today we have structure government parliament legal authorities and our national institutions have reached strength our police and army are growing
7900986 this is a clear indication that people of all races have rejected the communal politics of barisan nasional it is a clear endorsement of our reform agenda we are on track to take over the government
7900987 i will vote for anwar he represents the voice of the people god willing he will win
7900988 i have signed decrees on the recognition of the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia
7900989 taking into account the freely expressed will of the ossetian and abkhaz people
7900990 this is not an easy choice but it is the only way to save the lives of people
7900991 unfortunately they were ignored also by nato and the un
7900992 were bewildered at the extreme level of activity of nato naval forces in the black sea which continue to increase their numbers
7900993 only yesterday i said there were nine nato ships in the sea and by evening another frigate of the us navy passed through the bosphorus straits
7900994 we have also learnt that another eight warships from nato states are expected shortly
7900995 they talk about planned exercises and you can probably find some legitimacy in that but its very hard to believe that all the visits so far have been bringing only humanitarian aid
7900996 we consider that this is a regrettable decision and we reiterate our commitment to the territorial integrality of georgia
7900997 we reject this categorically and reaffirm georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
7900998 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7900999 this is a great day in the history of our country and our people
7901000 this decision has no legal force russia will face harsh political consequences from this
7901001 very heartened by the fact that the negotiations are serious and they are intensive
7901002 in fact i believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed their positions somewhat closer together over this period of time
7901003 construction in the settlements has increased by a factor of 1 8 by comparison to the same period last year
7901004 the housing ministry initiated 433 new housing units during the period of january to may 2008 compared to just 240 units during the period january to may 2007
7901005 i would like to suggest to my partners not to use it as an excuse and i know they are not using it as an excuse but i understand their frustration sometimes
7901006 but at the end of the day the israeli governments policy is not to expand settlements not to build new settlements and not to confiscate palestinian land
7901007 there were some small activities but they will not influence the ability to negotiate nor the future of the future borders of the palestinian state
7901008 in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and that anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7901009 and we will continue to press ahead to get agreement so that we know what is in israel and what is palestinian
7901010 susan f has denied having killed the children and told police they died a natural death
7901011 today is an extremely sad day for the trail blazers family
7901012 kevin will be remembered by fans as one of the most popular and recognizable players to ever wear the blazers uniform but to people who knew him hell be remembered as one of the warmest and biggest hearted
7901013 when i took her home she was frozen stiff my wife and i wrapped her in a burlap bag we started a fire we fed her soup and put some old clothes on her a while later she started to wiggle
7901014 nobody else wants them because they are afraid of trouble
7901015 they think these children are dirty but i pity them they are human beings
7901016 theyll have to kill me first before ill let them take the kids away
7901017 the settlement activity is not conducive to creating an environment for negotiations
7901018 anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7901019 the peace process is not and should not be affected by any kind of settlement activities
7901020 the issue of settlement building is not just that they exist on occupied land in the west bank and occupied east jerusalem its about control over water and the territorial contiguity of any possible future palestinian state
7901021 its difficult for palestinians to have any confidence in the committment to reach a solution when settlement activity has almost doubled and by the palestinain count more than doubled
7901022 more effort should be put in order to further reduce
7901023 how much money would we save if we both lived in the same apartment
7901024 do not underestimate your own importance in missouri or in the nation

7901032 senator mccain we did not hear you mention representative harold ford as a possible vp candidate when did he first appear on your radar
7901033 well george as you know i give thoughtful consideration to all aspects of this campaign and have always been open to several possibilities
7901034 well george this decision is a big one and after reviewing all of the candidates representative harold fold clearly stood out amidst all the rest
7901035 with all due respect you are not answering the question when did you first contact representative ford
7901036 look george thats a fair question we actually made our final decision just this morning and decided to proceed with the announcement this evening
7901037 so your first call to the representative from tennessee was this morning how did you i mean what led to this quick decision
7901038 you know i am a direct person so let me give you a direct answer
7901039 no its not because hes black at all its because hes a celebrity i need celebrity now george more than ever did you know that harold has been to the playboy mansion
7901040 but senator mccain you are aware that your campaign manager
7901041 representative ford you will likely have debates with the democratic vp nominee joseph biden like you he is fine but combative orator do you think that you will be able to hold your own in these debates
7901042 hmmmm representative why do you think you and john mccain make a good pair especially given that he is a republican and you are a democrat
7901043 cokie john and i have always been independent thinkers unafraid to cross the aisle for our principles party designations are petty theyre labels well rise above the labels and bring our country to new amazing destinations
7901044 senator if you and representative ford are able to win the white house do you know how many houses you would then own
7901045 george george and cokie cokie thank you for your time this evening you are looking at the winning team on november 4 th 2008 goodnight

7901054 se cort la mala racha con la que empezamos el campeonato
7901055 me parece que hicimos un gran partido quiz s no de los mejores o de la manera en que quisi ramos jugar pero hicimos m ritos suficientes como para ganarlo o por lo menos irnos al descanso del primer tiempo con la ventaja en el marcador
7901056 el punto sirve porque cortamos una racha de dos derrotas sin merecerlas porque estoy seguro que merec amos haber sumado alg n punto
7901057 es obvio que la gente quiera que ganemos y que juguemos bien y lindo pero nosotros no podemos fijarnos en lo que cada hincha piensa
7901058 pienso que los dos equipos crearon situaciones como para marcar en el primer tiempo ellos tuvieron algunas situaciones muy claras como nosotros y terminamos errando mucho en el segundo tiempo ellos se encuentran en ventaja con un error m o y despu s nosotros lo llevamos a jugar en su campo por eso creo que merec amos el empate antes que cuando lleg pero en general el partido fue bien jugado por parte de los dos con muchas situaciones lamentablemente nos quedamos con un punto nos pod amos haber quedado con las manos vac as pero imperiosamente necesit bamos sumar de a tres

7901297 even in a very difficult economic climate we continue to see our results reflect the initiatives that were enacted over a year ago to expand our core and ancillary businesses and focus on increased revenue and profitability our increase in revenue during the quarter was due to an increase in construction activity for the period resulting from our increased sales and marketing efforts furthermore we ended the quarter with cash of 912 760 compared to 123 648 at the end of 2007 we also have working capital of approximately 1 2 million as of june 30 2008 compared to 912 000 at the end of 2007

7901320 began a weeklong effort to present her husband and his entire family as embodiments of the american dream
7901321 despite republican attempts to paint her as a liberal elitist she said in her speech that she knows from her familys struggles and successes that the american dream endures
7901322 he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did and like my family they scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had for themselves
7901323 and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values like you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7901324 some people dream of success while others wake up and work hard at it

7901331 our clinic covers 33 camps with an average population of 750 families 4 500 per camp i am the only doctor and i am running out of drugs while many more people are coming for medical assistance
7901332 there are more than twice as many people than when the latrines were set up
7901333 we are now referring more people to hawa abdi a clinic that helps the malnourished
7901334 we have people coming everyday the numbers seem to have increased in july and august
7901335 the killings resulted from indiscriminate shelling by ethiopian tfg forces following the explosion of three roadside bombs
7901336 at arbiska along the afgooye road more than 40 civilians mostly internally displaced persons idps were killed on 15 august
7901337 i am now sharing a tree with another family and after we build some shelter i will start looking for my boys
7901338 we are now living in the open and we eat only when our neighbours give us something
7901339 i took my children and fled after i saw what happened to my neighbours who were hit by an artillery shell we have nothing here but at least it is a bit safer
7901340 wfp the un world food programme has been great but the rations they distributed last time was enough for 18 out of 65 camps
7901341 however due to shipment delay wfp was not able to provide food to all idps
7901342 now wfp has finalised distribution plans and is planning to give food assistance to about 365 000 in the coming two to three days

7901345 under the decree i have signed our country will naturally help ensure the security of these two states and if they are attacked we will offer them appropriate help
7901346 the only thing we want is peace i dont care who we are with russia or georgia people are dying
7901347 they the georgians are trying to force out the ossetian population it is our territory
7901348 the extraordinary level of activity by nato navies is perplexing for us
7901349 the increase in nato forces in the black sea is worrying us
7901350 these eight ships are not there with a humanitarian cargo but with a different objective
7901351 it is very hard to believe that all these previous trips were used for humanitarian help as was stated
7901352 unlike the truth and reconciliation commission model we are using homegrown models for reconciliation because of the nature of the conflict which was hate built
7901353 there is a tendency after conflict to expect solutions to come from outside creating dependency and a lack of sustainability
7901354 they are put in a setting where they survivors and perpetrators live together as the conflict was based on stereotypes
7901355 when people are in ingando they can go for umuganda for trust building
7901356 it is a civic duty to participate in umuganda to ensure that all participate in reconciliation and development
7901357 you have a million perpetrators to be tried who then have to live with the victims this is not easy
7901358 most perpetrators are poor the elite planned but manipulated the ordinary masses
7901359 if you want to have sustainable peace you have to make sure you have an equitable society
7901360 there is also a need to rewrite history so that its teaching is not manipulative but rather serves as a lesson
7901361 those continuing to perpetrate these crimes need to be punished
7901362 initiatives to bring justice are currently in place but more needs to be done
7901363 sometimes we need evidence and those providing it are threatened some judges have also been killed
7901364 there are some extremists in society who still have genocide ideology
7901365 it is a difficult task measuring the progress of reconciliation
7901366 however the fact that people are able to co exist in mixed settlements is encouraging
7901367 we meet and see them the perpetrators around at least they accepted their mistakes and we forgave them
7901368 we are now used to this kind of life because we cannot reverse what happened
7901369 i saw when the judges blatantly stole fights from two cuban boxers in the semifinals
7901370 our fighters had hopes of winning despite the judges but it was useless they were condemned beforehand
7901371 there will be european chauvinism judge corruption buying of brawn and brains and a strong dose of racism
7901372 i think john mccain would be a great candidate for vice president i mean it i know john doesnt like me saying it but the truth of the matter is it is
7901373 i think that this is time for unity in this country and maybe it is time to have a guy like john mccain a republican on the ticket with a guy he does like they do get along
7901374 you can take the hardest rock band on the earth and they sound like a bunch of girls next to the dubliners
7901375 how can you make sure you fill it with the most fun and that you visit all the coolest places on earth before you pack those bags for the very last time

7901377 somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago when i was 8 years old
7901378 why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it
7901379 i am concerned that there are people who are still attempting to find strategems to avoid compliance with federal law
7901380 city officials have been directed by the mayor to refer all undocumented felons to immigration regardless of age
7901381 better himself and his situation through the foster care system
7901382 to circumvent the intentions of the mayor as it relates to undocumented minors involved in illegal drug sales
7901383 if this minor returns to the community i am very concerned that he will run from a nonsecure environment
7901384 further our office is not in a position to effectively provide supervision services to an undocumented person without the risk of violating federal law
7901385 remorseful for his actions and has a desire to better himself and his situation through the foster care system his ambitions are strong indications that the public will not suffer further transgressions of the law
7901386 like any child within our jurisdiction without a parent or guardian he deserves the opportunity to go into foster care
7901387 when someone convinces ice that the youth is truly dependent they would be a low priority for deportation
7901388 but that is going to be the exception considering the police are catching these guys trafficking in drugs

7901397 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
7901398 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
7901399 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
7901400 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
7901401 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
7901402 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
7901403 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7901404 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7901405 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
7901406 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations

7901417 we understand that disablement activities have been halted temporarily and that north korea has linked the resumption of these activities to the rescission of its designation as a state sponsor of terrorism
7901418 weve informed north korea that we will take action to rescind its designation when it fulfills its commitment regarding verification
7901419 it is clearly a step backward and we will be having discussions with our other partners in the six party talks to see how things play out
7901420 it is a violation of their commitments to the six party framework it certainly is in violation of the principle of action for action
7901421 we actually are in discussions with the north koreans and i think well just see where we come out in a few weeks
7901422 tymoshenko is the arch pragmatist whereas both yanukovich and yushchenkos positions are much more positions of principle i think you have to interpret her silence as an effort to gauge where the swing voters are on this issue
7901423 what this is about is the long term view that to launch a successful presidential bid in ukraine requires you not to make an enemy of russia shes obviously looking back to 2004 and thinking i really dont want to be fighting next years campaign against a headwind from moscow
7901424 only the president has forcefully put his position forward and he has taken this and that measure to complicate relations with russia
7901425 tymoshenko has more or less taken the position not to get directly involved and her priority is to find a peaceful resolution
7901426 the last couple of months in the west she is winning more points as a politician in relation to domestic events and deteriorating relations with the president
7901427 she has attracted more attention from western partners who are increasingly disappointed with yushchenko and she is concentrating more on bringing about reform than he is
7901428 the cis countries have given a rather muted reaction to the conflict which is a discomfort that can only be accentuated now
7901429 we find that by providing suggestions up front we can help people search more efficiently and conveniently
7901430 instead of just typing hotels in washington did you want hotels in washington dc or hotels in washington state dont remember that song title or persons name let google help you search
7901431 ive always found that odd id rather google show some metric related to how popular that suggested query is since thats the basis of why youre being shown these words
7901432 over at microsofts live search you dont get query suggestions when typing in the search box but they will show related searches links in the top right hand corner of search results in some cases

7901434 if we want the american people to read this weve got to produce it in a length that theyre comfortable with

7901436 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7901437 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7901438 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7901439 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7901440 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7901441 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7901442 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7901443 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7901444 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7901445 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7901446 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7901447 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7901448 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7901449 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7901450 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7901451 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7901452 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7901453 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7901454 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7901455 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7901456 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate
7901457 when ted kennedy comes here to ask us all to pull together as a party not many people in this hall are not going to take that next step
7901458 it never stopped him he didnt go in a corner and weep he just started something else and now here he is tonight so tenacious
7901459 anyone whos advanced for him knows he likes a stool
7901460 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering
7901461 i have a headache from the altitude today i cant imagine what its like for someone whos got radiation chemotherapy and has to take a battery of drugs
7901462 their stories are very different but they share a commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family
7901463 leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
7901464 id heard it from a pretty good source last night but everyone was thrilled to hear about it at our breakfast this is the kind of moment that sen kennedy lives for
7901465 id heard something over the weekend but his health is such an issue it wasnt clear if hed be able to come
7901466 im a cancer survivor and i know how draining this kind of thing can be
7901467 it pushes the focus back on the challenge ahead and on obama and the race it gives people something positive to talk about
7901468 this may be ted kennedys final gift to the party
7901469 this says that he feels this is the democrats year and the party is not as unified as hed like it to be his appearance takes the headlines away from the clinton faction
7901470 happens to be somebody who i love to death hes just a good man and obviously hes going through a difficult time but im glad that we can use this convention to remind people of the contributions hes made to this country
7901471 just charges the atmosphere here the emotion is enormous its just what you want to start off the convention
7901472 many people who have known joe for many years and have considered him a friend are disappointed
7901473 many others are actually angry he has basically turned his back on the democratic party
7901474 a vote for lamont would jeopardize our chances for getting a democrat in the white house in 2008
7901475 are a bad reflection on him as a human being
7901476 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
7901477 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
7901478 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
7901479 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
7901480 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
7901481 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
7901482 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming
7901483 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm
7901484 the water problem is so severe for adelaide that it may run out of water by early 2009
7901485 environmentalists can have a sense of humour too environmentalists can have a sense of humour too
7901486 the stakes of this election will be made very clear
7901487 knowing they will have a first lady who understands their challenges
7901488 back in june and july i truly thought he was going to blow mccain out of the water and carry 30 or 40 states
7901489 what has happened is that republicans mccain specifically have really twisted his great charisma this electric personality to discredit his ability his experience his capacity his judgment i fear they are about to do to him what they did to gore
7901490 obama has got to do some things that will shore up his ability to lead not just to charm but to lead theyve got to give credibility to his understanding of foreign policy his ability to deal with tough people and tough questions and his ability to be more explicit and convincing on his health care policies and energy policies
7901491 normally i might say these conventions are not so important but i dont think thats the case this year
7901492 i think in the case of mccain they need to frame him
7901493 viscerally my feeling is theyve got to come back at him hard
7901494 it is all too easy to find the 100 women who will protest at the convention and they become the story
7901495 rather than to talk about the underlying numbers of women voters who in droves will vote for obama
7901496 people dont know yet that john mccain is just bad for women
7901497 talking about these differences is clearly a pathway to generating intensity among women voters
7901498 these swing women voters have tremendous economic anxiety right now
7901499 women are going to the watercooler and talking about what just happened in georgia
7901500 they are not unmindful of the way the world impacts on them
7901501 weve looked at several ways to play anticipated growth in wind energy weve also considered titanium makers for that industrys ties to the production of lightweight modern aircraft
7901502 while the two trends might not appear to have much in common at first glance hxl offers a way to play both the aircraft and wind markets
7901503 the connection is the lightweight composite materials hexcel makes that are used by producers in both sectors hexcel develops and manufactures advanced structural materials
7901504 it is the largest u s producer of carbon fiber the worlds largest weaver of reinforcement fabrics and the number one producer of composite materials
7901505 its product was initially developed for the aerospace industry but is now used in a wide range of applications from golf clubs to satellite arrays and from the rotor blades of wind turbines to life saving monocoques for formula 1 race cars
7901506 its been a rollercoaster ride for hexcels stock in the past 12 months the shares hit their one year peak of 27 19 in december 2007 by january 22nd they had plummeted to 17 the shares rebounded through may only to fade again year to date hxl is off about 15
7901507 second quarter profits came in shy of wall streets expectations as a result of costs associated with the start up of four overseas manufacturing plants and a weak u s dollar the reason hexcel has been investing in plants in europe is to be closer to customers such as airbus
7901508 hexcel just won a big order from airbus that was the biggest in the companys history
7901509 hexcel is in a great position to profit from the growing investment in wind energy platforms and the demand for lighter weight more fuel efficient airplanes the skyrocketing price of crude during q2 did much to disrupt the plans of cash strapped airlines to acquire the new planes
7901510 boeings delays getting the dreamliner in the air have also been well documented those are short term problems however long term it is inevitable that air carriers will want these newer planes in their fleets
7901511 wind energy is obviously a hot topic too oilman boone pickens is pushing wind farms as an alternative to oil fired power plants al gores alliance for climate protection meanwhile has promoted them as an anecdote to greenhouse gas emissions
7901512 when two guys like gore and pickens coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum can come to the same view theres some karma happening
7901513 a strong dollar should help hexcels cost structure in its overseas plants and could well lead to an earnings surprise in the second half of the year if the trend continues this is a stock to keep on our radar
7901514 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
7901515 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
7901516 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
7901517 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
7901518 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
7901519 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
7901520 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
7901521 were not a public utility were a newspaper and we cover things based on what is newsworthy people who have half a percent or less following among the public are much less newsworthy than people with 40 and 50 percent
7901522 the nader campaign is based on a simple premise there is no difference between the two major parties
7901523 this is true if you stand far enough away from the two parties in the same way new york and tokyo would look similar if you were standing on the moon
7901524 a self indulgent exercise that that will distract voters from the clear cut choice represented by the major party candidates
7901525 the public deserves to see the major party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field
7901526 protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the worlds poor even more miserable it is a strange platform for the ralph nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected
7901527 many of those who are thinking about voting for mr nader probably imagine that he is still the moderate humane activist of the 1960s
7901528 any presidential candidate whose running mate is winona laduke an ojibway indian activist from a minnesota reservation must be considered both marginal and self indulgent
7901529 like an enormous zit on prom night when least expected or desired nader and his green party followers have reappeared on the political scene
7901530 one of the saddest sights in politics is a fading public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has passed
7901531 the latest egotist to ignore reality is ralph nader the aging consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long ago nader is in the great tradition of political diehards who stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter
7901532 the two party system works fine if not perfectly why cant we leave it at that
7901533 the same speech hes been giving for months why didnt he give the germans something more
7901534 it was a tent in the desert 100 degree heat off and on for what seemed like forever
7901535 why was i held by the united states like that when i was their ally
7901536 if theyre exaggerating and distorting this much in august what will october be like
7901537 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
7901538 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
7901539 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down

7901562 madonna shows that obama has no chance against mccains gang
7901563 he does not feel that obama has given him the respect due to him as a former president
7901564 he should have called clinton and asked him for advice about foreign policy or suggested a joint appearance
7901565 oftentimes one brings in celebrity for a sense of making a campaign look like its young and vibrant and visionary and all the rest of it you give it a bit of that showbiz juice the problem is that the last thing that barack obama needs is showbiz juice
7901566 hes got all the charisma hes got the speaking the whole idea of this rock star candidate is now to some extent being reframed to become a liability the democratic party has to be really careful that they dont paint themselves as a hollywood presidency kind of thing
7901567 a lot of people are beginning to realize that celebrity endorsements are doing a lot more to get you to change your mind about the celebrity than they do to get you to change your mind about a candidate
7901568 most people come to candidates with pretty set ideas of what their party is and who they like and who they dont
7901569 just because one of their favourite actors endorses someone or speaks for one of them i think its more likely that the average voter is going to say oh i used to like that celebrity but they like candidate x so i dont like that celebrity anymore
7901570 if the youth vote turns out as it did with the primaries for obama i think youre going to see a president obama
7901571 if the youth vote does as it has done in the past and that is that it always promises and looks like its going to be behind john kerry or al gore then what youre going to see is president mccain
7901572 i think it cuts both ways the candidates want celebrities there because it brings media attention but they dont want them around too much because they dont want to bring negative attention as though it is just a celebrity kind of endorsement
7901573 depending on the celebrity you might be able to register three votes but you might lose three votes there are people in hollywood who are very divisive in terms of their politics
7901574 the celebrities use it as a means of getting themselves back into the limelight
7901575 its what i would call a synergistic relationship where both sides probably benefit in a celebrity spectacle culture
7901576 it could be good for the nation if other corporate companies could emulate what standard bank has done to work with undp on an issue that is of national and global concern
7901577 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
7901578 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
7901579 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
7901580 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
7901581 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
7901582 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
7901583 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
7901584 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
7901585 shook his fist in wrath as he walked the platform a white foam gathered upon his lips giving him a look of ferocity
7901586 does mr lincoln wish to push these things to the point of personal difficulties here douglas demanded backing around and shaking his clenched fist within a few inches of lincolns face
7901587 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
7901588 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis
7901589 by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever
7901590 when lincoln rose to take the oath and discovered that he had no place to rest his top hat douglas obligingly stepped forward and held it for him
7901591 a sad heart with a grief that i have never before experienced
7901592 is that sport has nothing to do with money and the other one is that it has nothing to do with politics both lead to unnecessary and sometimes disastrous debates

7901619 the latest annual rate of inflation measured from last july to this july was 5 6 the largest annual gain since way back in january 1991
7901620 this is a great way to buy a diversified portfolio of inflation adjusted treasuries and track them quite easily
7901621 the latest consumer price index figures were a bit of a shock the annual rate of inflation measured from last july to this july was 5 6 the largest annual gain since way back in january 1991
7901622 this report was especially noteworthy because it was double what economists were predicting 0
7901623 remember that the market is always looking forward not back investors are always more concerned with what lies ahead than what happened in the recent past
7901624 july s poor inflation report is already being trumped by lower oil prices a stronger dollar and a weakening u s economy all of these factors indicate that the jump in inflation may be short lived but that s right now next month or next year may be a different story entirely
7901625 that s why every investor should have a hedge in his portfolio like inflation adjusted treasuries
7901626 inflation protected securities are essentially treasury bonds that hedge against inflation you get an interest payment every six months just like with the old fashioned t note
7901627 but your principal increases each year by the amount of the consumer price index that means the amount you re paid in interest also increases by the amount of inflation
7901628 the interest you receive is exempt from state and local but not federal income taxes and like other treasuries your investment is backed by the full faith and credit of the u s government
7901629 you can get these bonds directly from the u s government or from virtually any broker but investors often tell me they have trouble buying them or even getting a price quote
7901630 the solution is the ishares lehman tips bond fund the fund attempts to replicate the return of the lehman brothers u s treasury inflation notes index it is easy to buy liquid and the expense ratio is small only two tenths of one percent
7901631 this is a great way to buy a diversified portfolio of inflation adjusted treasuries and track them quite easily
7901632 this fund is best owned in your ira or other qualified retirement plan however since the annual principal increase is treated as reportable income even though you don t receive it in cash
7901633 investing in china is about picking the right segments of the economy and the companies that will make it for the long haul
7901634 our strategy for investing involves sticking to a handful of core strategic areas where weve picked a collection of stocks in key industries
7901635 the chinese economy is large amounting to approximately 3 6 trillion annually and its expanding at a rate of 10
7901636 industrial production the heart of the economy is gaining at a rate of 16 3 a year and is keeping a transforming labor force fully engaged unemployment is a scant 4 and retail sales are climbing at a hefty rate of more than 23
7901637 all of this comes at a price inflation is a biting 7 plus pollution is another economic stressor the major underpinnings of the chinese economy are still works in progress although theres a lot to be gained those gains never come in a straight line or without some challenges
7901638 our strategy for investing involves sticking to a handful of core strategic areas focused on energy environment infrastructure commodities and agriculture sectors
7901639 on the energy front oil is crucial to china this means china is helping to propel profits from producers worldwide offshore drilling in the south china sea is a no brainer which means
7901640 an increased need for cleaner water isnt just an issue in china but across the globe billions more dollars need to be invested with some 300 million chinese citizens clamoring for more clean water
7901641 while succumbing to the current market woes we continue to favor one of the worlds top leaders in water and water treatment businesses

7901644 at that time there were no victim rights and somebody had to witness an act of violence in order to prosecute it
7901645 the criminal justice system lacked information and training on the dynamics of domestic violence and its effects on the family
7901646 you can sponsor a bill but if you just sponsor a bill and let it sit there thats nothing
7901647 he shepherded it he made sure it happened he assigned staff to it gave them carte blanche to do with they needed they spent days and nights on it
7901648 dont put so much emphasis on the orgasm its not the goal of sex two people can have a sweet passionate connection regardless of whether or not she orgasms
7901649 you can tell whether or not she enjoys sex by whether or not she orgasm um yeah duh
7901650 this is great and all but im not going to get there tonight dear so do you think we might be done sometime before dawn
7901651 the full participation of women and the protection of their rights as citizens are essential for freedom and democracy to flourish
7901652 in no state does the typical full time woman worker earn as much as the typical man
7901653 the poverty rate among women has increased in 15 states
7901654 strong disparities exist among new yorks women while 87 9 percent of white women in the
7901655 new york state ranks in the bottom third of all states in the nation for the proportion of women who live above the poverty line women in new york state were more likely to be poor than women nationally and since the late 1980s new york state has experienced an overall increase in poverty among women and a severe drop in its ranking from 30 th to 40 th in the nation these trends call attention to poverty as an increasingly pressing problem for the state
7901656 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group

7901661 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
7901662 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7901663 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
7901664 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7901665 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
7901666 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
7901667 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
7901668 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
7901669 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
7901670 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
7901671 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
7901672 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
7901673 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
7901674 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
7901675 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
7901676 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
7901677 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
7901678 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
7901679 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
7901680 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
7901681 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
7901682 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
7901683 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7901684 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7901685 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7901686 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7901687 this is a very solid showing for senator obama in historical terms its a showing that augurs well for him
7901688 the more you like senator clinton the more likely you are to be for senator obama
7901689 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7901690 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7901691 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7901692 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean he enthused
7901693 i mean thats a storybook man not a fairy tale
7901694 look the clintons are dirty how many times do the republicans need to throw that in our faces turn the page they did most of the stuff that the republicans said they did whitewater catte futures filegate travelgate gennifer flowers katherina wilkie monica lewinsky turn the page
7901695 never walk over others in climbing the ladder to success you just might meet them on your way down
7901696 they will dictate political fortunes and reshape the government of this country at all levels anyone who wants to understand the political landscape must examine the mind and motivations of the womens electorate
7901697 year after year one thing has become clear when women vote women and democrats win
7901698 thats why this study is so important to understanding the messages and issues that will motivate this critical segment of the electorate
7901699 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7901700 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7901701 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7901702 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7901703 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7901704 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7901705 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7901706 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7901707 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7901708 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7901709 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7901710 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7901711 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7901712 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7901713 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7901714 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7901715 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7901716 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7901717 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7901718 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7901719 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7901720 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7901721 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7901722 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7901723 in the process of expanding in europe germany is one of several possible future markets

7901726 tv and the web amount to the same thing to us

7901732 estoy acostumbrada a papeles con hondura y dramaticidad es duro interiorizar el dolor pero cuando me dicen corta no me quedo con el dolor dentro

7901737 la gente echar de menos algunas cosas como en toda adaptaci n pero son veh culos distintos pasamos del coche literario al coche cinematogr fico las historias hay que meterlas en los veh culos que las lleven m s lejos

7901750 catch a wave and youre sitting on top of the world
7901751 would you like to go out for dinner and a show
7901752 would you like to come up and see my etchings
7901753 ive finally come to learn that i dont need a gold medal in my life
7901754 ive finally realised that it isnt going to change me isnt going to make me more popular more loved
7901755 to win i had to realise the real reason we olympians do all this because we love it
7901756 the number of goals teams are scoring when they get a run on is what we are focusing on
7901757 in previous years we have been able to weather the storm and regain momentum and limit teams scoring against us
7901758 so well need to shore up our defence put more pressure on as a midfield group and also improve our delivery to our forwards there are a lot of areas to work on
7901759 we have just got to make sure that we really attack the game come out with confidence and back ourselves
7901760 would you like to go out for dinner and a show
7901761 would you like to come up and see my etchings
7901762 im sure players adopt an attitude that managers test the waters and rugby in europe seems to be the latest one
7901763 ive spoken to benji what benji decides to do in 12 months time is hard to say
7901764 if weve got to make changes then players will be tapped on the shoulder and changes will be made
7901765 i dont like to use that as a stick but the reality is changes need to be made
7901766 there are a couple of changes in the side this week
7901767 players are sort of looking around thinking is it me hes talking about
7901768 whether the tackle was right or wrong its over now
7901769 i started feeling dirty about a week after it happened
7901770 for a month or so i was just so sick of rehab the thing i hated the most was that i would be guaranteed at least an hour of pain every day but getting back on the field and then winning a few games has helped me get over it
7901771 i did watch it a few times it used to be fresh but ive learned that you cant keep looking in the rear vision mirror
7901772 i thought about it a lot when it happened and when i was out at the time it was all i had to look back on in my season those seven minutes
7901773 now ive played a few games and my match fitness is getting better i dont really give it a second thought
7901774 i did my bit and spoke honestly about being up for the game and i suppose that made me a target
7901775 it was the start of the year and there were big expectations for us
7901776 the roosters love that sort of stuff ive been there done that they would have found every article and stuck it up on the wall they would have thought souths are going to america souths are this international team it would have fired them up
7901777 last year when i was with the roosters we were really bitter about souths making the finals
7901778 although they havent been playing the best lately we see them as a top side
7901779 we want to know we can beat the top sides
7901780 theres nothing worse than watching the finals and thinking youd get smashed we want to prove something to ourselves
7901781 in my view if don bradman was playing today he would still have an average as twice as good as any other batsman in the world
7901782 with the advances in bat technology and training imagine how good the don would be today it would be scary he is by far and away the best batsman ever and would still be today
7901783 his name and what he achieved its so far out of any players reach
7901784 in my view if don bradman was playing today he would still have an average as twice as good as any other batsman in the world
7901785 quero ser o amigo que est sempre em teu caminho e quem tem amigos nunca est
7901786 the ajc didnt even bother to discuss the track fees issue with the trainers they just decided to increase the fees and expect us all to cop it on the chin
7901787 this is a commercial negotiation between the ajc and the tenants trainers
7901788 i think it is highly unprofessional to be arguing about a commercial issue in the public domain
7901789 i am extremely confident a resolution will be found to the satisfaction of both parties
7901790 what has to happen first is that the emotion should be taken out of the argument
7901791 we should all stick to the facts work through the various issues and find a satisfactory resolution
7901792 im locked in for next year but there is still some stuff to sort out
7901793 ill deal with that in the off season the panthers have been good to me and theyll have first and last offer
7901794 it annoyed me when i realised i had been accused of faking an injury to stay off the field
7901795 faking an injury is the worst slur you can have i wanted to get back out there but the coaching staff and doctor told me i couldnt i would have given anything to get back out on the field
7901796 the fact he has asked for a release this year to me ive got my doubts about franks commitment to the team
7901797 it is always difficult to deal with a player when you dont know whether or not he wants to be at the club
7901798 you dont know what to believe but as for monday night i have got to believe frank if he said he wasnt right to go back on then ive got to go with him on that
7901799 if anything comes up in general business well discuss it but at the moment neither is on the agenda
7901800 we wouldnt consider letting him go we havent received any concrete offer anyway
7901801 he hasnt said he is unhappy and hasnt come to me saying he is unhappy
7901802 incomplete version of the computer generation a 1972 documentary featuring the artist stan vanderbeek
7901803 stan vanderbeek was an american experimental filmmaker whose ironic compositions were created very much in the spirit of the surreal and dadaist collages on max ernst but with a wild rough informality more akin to the expressionism of the beat generation
7901804 pastors dont talk about their churchs finances on their blogs do they
7901805 theyve made him a very good offer theyve advised us of that and theyve requested us to consider a release for him
7901806 its a wonderful opportunity for him to earn some money in the competition over there with a coach he likes in brian mcclennan
7901807 we dont want to stand in his way hes been good for us this year hes played more games than anyone else and we saw him as having a bright future but he is only young who knows he might be back
7901808 i only played with campo at the back end of his career but based on that experience i wonder if he would have survived for long in the professional game because he did have weaknesses in his game the opposition would hone in on
7901809 he was fragile in defence and though he wasnt slow he wasnt lightning quick either his awareness on the field was ahead of his time his kicking game was excellent and his sense of anticipation was uncanny but there are quite a few guys like that in 21st century rugby only faster
7901810 similarly he was fantastic at creating space but defensive strategies in modern rugby have evolved dramatically in the past 15 years
7901811 ricky stuart had once advised me if i was ever dealing with campo not to get caught in the master servant game
7901812 george is trying to sell a book and everyone is entitled to an opinion
7901813 for example my opinion is that gregan will go down as being remembered for making one tackle and then living off it for the next 15 years
7901814 would you like to go out for dinner and a show
7901815 would you like to come up and see my etchings
7901816 it is a very difficult decision based on cronulla being such a close knit community
7901817 terminating his contract is certainly something that will be strongly considered
7901818 he is suspended indefinitely and on legal advice we cant do another thing
7901819 i think it is the only thing we could do
7901820 we will look at it at the time and as a board and take advice sorry i cant say much more about it but that is where we are at
7901821 they are pretty keen to see some action is taken
7901822 the club has a responsibilty to sponsors supporters management staff and the players
7901823 it is important that the values of society are upheld at every opportunity
7901824 would you like to go out for dinner and a show
7901825 would you like to come up and see my etchings
7901826 would you like to go out for dinner and a show
7901827 would you like to come up and see my etchings
7901828 the forwarded never asked me for it and i didnt know i needed it

7901838 no gain or loss shall be recognized on the exchange of property held for productive use in a trade or business or for investment if such property is exchanged solely for property of like kind which is to be held either for productive use in a trade or business or for investment
7901839 vets for freedom will not stand by and let the incredible progress of our troops go unnoticed by the american public and lawmakers from either side of the aisle
7901840 it is essential that our top legislators regardless of party understand the importance of victory in iraq the consequences of defeat and the success of the surge
7901841 sen obama has said that he would still oppose the surge if given another opportunity and has pointed to every outside factor but the surge to explain improvements in iraq we hope he will listen to the veterans who have served there and support this important resolution for the sake of the troops
7901842 it doesnt seem like the crowd is on the edge of their seats
7901843 but i cant help but feel after the first night of the convention that it was largely a wasted night
7901844 they did a poor job explaining what the choices are
7901845 they are trying to race across the viability threshold before the republicans can say that this man is not ready to be president
7901846 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of
7901847 looking back at it i dont want to say yes but i dont want to say no
7901848 i offered to trade her a fattening hog for those girls
7901849 i meant it as a joke ive said it a million times most people get a kick out of it
7901850 can you believe the gall of that man trying to purchase our beloved nieces to sell into sexual slavery for the price of a pig
7901851 that man has offended me by making a joke that i deem inappropriate and therefore im going to have him arrested
7901852 you know i dont like that man lets try to wreck his career
7901853 are you people retarded do you not understand that this was a humorous compliment of a type that is common in appalachia are you really that stupid do you really believe that a joke no matter how bad deserves jail time and the possibility of registration as a sex offender
7901854 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7901855 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7901856 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7901857 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7901858 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7901859 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7901860 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7901861 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7901862 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7901863 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7901864 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7901865 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7901866 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7901867 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7901868 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7901869 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7901870 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7901871 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7901872 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7901873 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7901874 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7901875 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7901876 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7901877 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7901878 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7901879 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7901880 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7901881 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7901882 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7901883 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7901884 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7901885 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7901886 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7901887 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7901888 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7901889 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7901890 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7901891 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7901892 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7901893 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
7901894 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
7901895 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
7901896 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
7901897 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7901898 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7901899 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7901900 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7901901 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7901902 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7901903 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7901904 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7901905 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7901906 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7901907 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7901908 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7901909 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7901910 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7901911 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7901912 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7901913 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7901914 compartir escenario con no brain que siempre me ha gustado y he respetado me hizo sentir un poco nervioso pero yo creo que fue emocionante y a la vez gracioso
7901915 our fios internet and tv services have been an extraordinary hit with consumers in florida and more residents are joining the fios family each day
7901916 verizon is winning customers by providing the best most reliable network available at a competitive price for voice data and video services all backed by the best employees in the business and a name customers can trust
7901917 f4 bueno si lo tienen por favor emtren a mi correo que en estos momentos les dare
7901918 it raises the question of the fact that this may be a racial profiling situation and i say this without knowing the deputys background
7901919 jameel is a young african american driving a very nice mercedes benz around the sugar land area a very nice neighborhood that he lives in the deputy is anglo
7901920 after talking to him thats when i made the suggestion of calling the fort bend county d a s office and i told them test the marijuana the container the baggies anything for jameels fingerprints

7901931 mccain sides with bush on torture again supports veto of anti waterboarding bill
7901932 black claims mccains campaign is above lobbyist influence i dont know what the criticism is
7901933 mccain very honored by support of pastor preaching end time confrontation with iran
7901934 john mccain gets a zero rating for his environmental record
7901935 its not like the clintons have been bending over backwards to help obama get elected
7901936 youll get to see hillary speak on tuesday and barack obama the next president of the united states on thursday and i hear hillary and you will have a chat ill make sure i stop by
7901937 if i had done that i would be so bitched at for the next 3 days
7901938 really sweetie why dont you tell me all about it
7901939 well ok the mommy and daddy take off all of their clothes and the daddys thing sort of stands up and the mommy puts it in her mouth and then it sort of explodes and thats where babies come from

7901945 irish pub arent those establishments more known as havens for whiskey drinkers and sinn fein officials
7901946 as two former line cooks who used to use hot knives for more illicit purposes they decided to turn their lives around so that others may start eating properly and drinking better beer
7901947 this is a response to a slower traffic period and were giving ourselves some operational flexibility in the winter months

7901949 we have not made a decision we have not named kurt the starting quarterback its unfortunate it was out there its unfortunate matt has to see those things but i understand the quarterback is the focus and people are quick to make judgments its a process you dont make a decision based on one play or one half but itd be incorrect of me to ignore the fact matt didnt play well
7901950 can you imagine what biden would do to pawlenty in the debate
7901951 mitt romney has had very definite swings of positions not just one or two little things but on many of the issues
7901952 i think that there are better choices for senator mccain that would have the approval of values voters
7901953 weve been talking with staff in different parts of the midwest
7901954 and were all struggling to some extent with the problem of white workers who will not vote for obama because of his color there is no question about it its a very powerful thing to get over for some folks
7901955 looking back historically conventions have tended to be hotbeds of controversy and this year simply wont compare
7901956 the civil rights organization national action network and others will begin in florida then travel to six other states to register voters and make sure people who think theyre registered actually are
7901957 too often vehicles branded due to some form of severe damage are reconstructed and re titled without their damage related brand and then sold to unsuspecting consumers
7901958 with such a large number of title washed vehicles on the road today consumers shopping for a reliable used car or truck need to get an autocheck vehicle history report for all vehicles they consider buying
7901959 consumers need to arm themselves with as much information as possible when shopping for a used vehicle
7901960 an autocheck vehicle history report will show past title brands and designations of prior damage providing used vehicle shoppers with the peace of mind they need to know that the vehicle they are buying is reliable and most importantly safe

7902432 hispanic voters are one of the great untapped resources in electoral politics
7902433 are going to be very cognizant of attracting and keeping these voters
7902434 this is probably your best chance in a long time to see latino voters be a critical factor in the outcome
7902435 they are just going to say no we are not going to have a black president
7902436 open to bringing in people who dont necessarily agree with him

7902438 i do not believe that a woman young middle aged or old just on a whim says i think ill give up my baby
7902439 no person shall be prosecuted for any crime based solely upon the act of leaving a child in the custody of an employee on duty at a hospital licensed by the state of nebraska
7902440 the law says an adult can abandon the child it doesnt even have to be a parent
7902441 hopefully the system would kick in and parents be notified that their child has been abandoned and the family could be reunited but one of our specific concerns involves the possible deprivation of the parents or one parents rights
7902442 what this society needs to do is consider the causes that might compel a woman to give up what might mean more to her than anything in her life
7902443 we need sex education we need to stop talking this abstinence nonsense based on religion and look at the reality of what these women face
7902444 the american physical society is deeply concerned about the possible use of nuclear weapons against non nuclear weapon states and for preemptive counter proliferation purposes
7902445 an outcry over what would be the first use of a nuclear weapon in a conflict since nagasaki
7902446 we are proud to partner with nleomf and its drive safely campaign through 3ms protect our protectors program
7902447 education is key regarding the upcoming federal highway regulations on first responder visibility and partnering with nleomf is a great fit for promoting roadway safety for law enforcement
7902448 our nations law enforcement personnel spend much of their time on the roadways working to protect the rest of us and far too many of them are seriously injured or killed each year in the process
7902449 we are very pleased to be partnering with 3m in this important effort to protect our peace officers by educating the public and making sure our law enforcement officers meet legal requirements for effective visibility gear
7902450 mit sloan and the lfe have a tradition of working closely with industry leaders to produce the very best theory and the very best practical application of that theory
7902451 we want to be at the forefront of driving the convergence of theory and practice and this collaboration with bank of america is a step in that direction
7902452 bank of america is investing in the future of banking
7902453 we believe that the results of our collaboration with mit sloan will have long range significance for changing the face of banking as our customers know it
7902454 we seek to engage in research that is both rigorous and relevant
7902455 the best way to do that is by working directly with industry to take on research challenges that have significant implications for both theory and practice
7902456 i have deep respect for andrews work he brings to the table a perspective that is not just focused on theoretical frameworks but also their practical application this collaboration has the potential to re shape how the financial services industry looks at building out their next generation quantitative capabilities

7902463 this particular project took us six weeks to complete as far as profit margins every project is different but we like to work in the arena of 15 25 margins
7902464 we are estimating the market for us to be about 500 million to 1 billion globally this product was developed specifically to capture the actual real time readings of the small systems which up until now have been too expensive to monitor by conventional means with our product we are talking about pennies per day
7902465 many countries are adopting solar programs like greece india and italy which we are all involved with we dont focus only on the united states although it is a huge market for us we view it as an addition to global markets
7902466 the situation in jammu is being dealt with kid gloves while in kashmir it is being done with an iron fist
7902467 the handling of the situation in both parts of the state spoke high of a dual policy of the state government
7902468 while sharing my concern the prime minister assured that utmost care will be taken to restore normalcy in the state
7902469 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
7902470 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
7902471 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
7902472 we dont want to give the message that there are no connections
7902473 it is clear that more research is necessary to pinpoint the reasons for this cluster including whether environmental contaminants are a factor

7902480 housing markets have cooled from record levels of activity last year and should continue to moderate as past increases in prices have reduced affordability
7902481 can easily pay the 20 million or so in claims made against it each year
7902482 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7902483 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7902484 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7902485 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7902486 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7902487 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7902488 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7902489 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7902490 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7902491 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7902492 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7902493 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7902494 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7902495 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7902496 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7902497 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7902498 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7902499 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7902500 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7902501 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7902502 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7902503 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7902504 this order continues the filling of the sales pipeline for powershield in our first month of production in tianjin with the date for opening established our china sales force has been given the green light to begin accepting purchase orders with this order we now have over 400 000 in orders scheduled for production when the plant opens during the next few weeks we also expect to begin converting distributor purchase commitments into purchase orders
7902505 it is probably not advisable to drive before six weeks after bunion surgery on the right foot our research shows that the reflexes and the power required to brake suddenly in an emergency is fully returned only at six weeks in the post operative period
7902506 however it is extremely important for all patients to discuss when they can return to driving with their surgeon after having any type of surgery to their foot
7902507 before we started this project we contacted multiple government agencies and insurance companies to find out what advice patients are given about driving after foot surgery and were very surprised to learn that no guidance existed
7902508 we found this not only surprising but also unsatisfactory anecdotal experience told us that patients are generally allowed to drive after a period of six weeks after other lower limb surgery but no research existed before our study to support this advice
7902509 over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
7902510 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable
7902511 speaker of the house nancy pelosi is a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
7902512 is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it
7902513 we are telling the farc that they no longer have a claim on us
7902514 we dont want to ever again pick up a rifle and point it at a fellow colombian
7902515 probably the most under recognized blog in the jblogsphere as far as i am concerned

7902517 and the library said no this looks like a religious service and we dont allow religious services in our meeting room
7902518 and they prohibited the event which necessitated the lawsuit and the federal judge said that such an exclusion is viewpoint discrimination
7902519 the only wall that separates religious groups from public meeting rooms is the wall built by government officials who fail to understand the constitution
7902520 and this is a classic example of the library officials not understanding what equal access means
7902521 he was an accident and i wish he would have one preferably fatal
7902522 there are major politicians that are leading an unprecedented war on americas poor families and we are going to name names
7902523 these politicians are purposely pushing up energy prices in doing so they are disproportionately hurting the poor they need to be exposed as the prime leaders in this war
7902524 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7902525 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7902526 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7902527 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7902528 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7902529 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7902530 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7902531 who are open to doing something on the production side
7902532 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7902533 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7902534 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7902535 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7902536 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7902537 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7902538 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7902539 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7902540 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7902541 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7902542 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7902543 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7902544 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7902545 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7902546 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7902547 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7902548 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

7902550 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7902551 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7902552 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7902553 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7902554 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7902555 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7902556 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7902557 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7902558 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7902559 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7902560 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7902561 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7902562 the most significant component of nfs v4 1 is the inclusion of pnfs which represents the first major performance upgrade to nfs in over a decade
7902563 pnfs represents the standardization of parallel io and allows clients to access storage devices directly and in parallel thus eliminating the scalability and performance issues associated with nfs servers deployed today
7902564 panasas has been a leader in the development of the pnfs standard from the very beginning
7902565 the panasas directflow protocol used in our activestor parallel storage clusters currently provides essentially all of the functionality expected to be available in the nfsv4 1 later this year
7902566 users and application developers can take immediate advantage of the high performance and superior ease of use of the only production proven parallel storage system today the activestor parallel storage clusters from panasas
7902567 we are very excited that the panasas architecture is being adopted as standard by the storage industry as it validates the importance of parallel storage and our vision for the future of file storage
7902568 nfs v4 1 will finally give users a reason to aggressively migrate to the latest version of nfs primarily because of the dramatic performance benefits of pnfs
7902569 as a partner of the drive for diversity program since its inception sprint is proud to support an initiative that will help broaden the sport now and in the future

7902581 this is an important step in uracs ongoing effort to support consumer empowerment and protection
7902582 we are pleased that urac is seeking additional comments as it works to makes its standards consistent with the principles of the patient charter for physician performance measurement reporting and tiering programs
7902583 having independent review of programs that publicly report on physician performance is critical and being sure that those reviews are based on widely agreed upon principles that promote accuracy consistency fairness and consumer friendly information means that both patients and doctors can rely on those results

7902595 ceos log in the year of 2008 and 2 3 a couple of corporate supervisors and i made a surprise inspection of crunchie burga worlds food distribution warehouse a place where processed crunchie burga world food items and products such as crunchie burgers and blackened crispy fries are packaged and sent to crunchie burga world ghetto franchises nationwide
7902596 upon entering the warehouse we observed a small group of employees who wanted to keep their jobs diligently loading the refrigerated trucks what really disturbed us was a large group of disgruntled and unproductive contract employees from the we will work for food utilities and rent money temporary agency holding a meeting in the 15 minute break room leroy the warehouse supervisor explained the groups insubordinate act
7902597 mr bossman the workers dont like your five day mandatory overtime to boost production initiative especially when they dont have any health care and compensation benefits

7902604 i think its no secret and ive said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think the settlement activity is helpful to the process
7902605 what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7902606 i believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed their positions somewhat closer together over this period of time
7902607 so we will continue to press ahead to get agreement so that we know what is in israel and what is in palestine that is ultimately the goal

7903052 our province is going through an amazing period of rapid expansion and growth the time is now to invest in infrastructure that is so crucial to saskatchewans future
7903053 our long range goal is to work towards twinning the entire hwy 11 corridor having four lanes between prince albert and saskatoon will do much to expand capacity for saskatchewan shippers while connecting northern and central saskatchewan to national and international trade routes
7903054 i asked hillary supporter carlson why if she was offended by being called
7903055 id love anybody to tell me something that you cant just tell the american people and have them believe it because you didnt add lol to it at the end of your e mail message
7903056 definitely off from what the production hoped its hard to know what exactly is to blame
7903057 you cant say its the economy because there are shows like mamma mia that are selling out its not that katies bad in the part shes good enough the producers are just getting the feeling people still want to view katie as sweet little joey potter

7903065 this blog is about understanding the value of modeling to a project team and is focused on helping solution architects gain a practical understanding of the value of modeling to in turn help explain its value to the project team for adoption
7903066 where he discusses many things including the value of a metamodel
7903067 my recommendation to developers and architect is metamodel as a verb metamodel completely and thoroughly and even if you dont create a platform independent model of your solution and a compiler based on this metamodel write code with the metamodel in mind this will end up looking like a framework of course for instance define precisely what a business entity is an association a business process a task remember you are not creating an oo model you are creating a metamodel every solution domain has a metamodel there is nothing absolute about it the metamodel of an information system is different from the metamodel of an industrial process control system and what works for a travel company may not work for an insurance company
7903068 levante el pie del acelerador en esa persecuci n en contra de la comunitat valenciana
7903069 no contin e abandonando a la comunitat y dej ndola de segundo plato
7903070 una de las bases de la econom a y del progreso de la comunitat valenciana
7903071 no puede entenderse el progreso sin pensar en el agua y no se entiende una pol tica econ mica seria sin recursos h dricos por lo que la pol tica del presidente del gobierno jos luis rodr guez zapatero ha consistido en boicotear el crecimiento econ mico al negar el agua y el trasvase del ebro
7903072 contribuir a a la creaci n de 30 000 puestos de trabajo y ayudar a a paliar la destrucci n de hect reas cultivadas como ha pasado a lo largo de los ltimos a os en los que se ha llevado a cabo la destrucci n de 15 000 hect reas cultivadas
7903073 el crecimiento de esta tierra depende del agua algo que pedimos al gobierno socialista y a los socialistas valencianos remarc
7903074 ha sido gracias a las pol ticas h dricas que ha llevado a cabo el ppcv
7903075 hace falta una pol tica h drica seria para hacer frente al crecimiento tur stico la realizaci n de grandes eventos y el crecimiento poblacional
7903076 ha dado la espalda en la pol tica econ mica y en la pol tica del agua
7903077 son ya cinco millones de personas los que viven en la comunitat un mill n m s de lo que dice el ejecutivo central un mill n m s que necesita agua para vivir
7903078 zapatero amenaza los intereses de la comunitat al no reconocer el crecimiento poblacional
7903079 las necesidades del agua est n vinculadas al n mero de personas que viven ahora en esta autonom a cifra que el gobierno central da la espalda desde hace tiempo
7903080 los c lculos econ micos sobre precio de agua que zapatero realiz en 2004 han sido err neos ya que se realizaron cuando el barril del petr leo estaba a 20 euros mientras que estaba a 114 d lares cada barril
7903081 con el dec logo de medidas econ micas reclamamos al gobierno socialista que vuelta al sentido com n y que el trasvase vuelva a ser una realidad ya que los valencianos tenemos los mismos derechos que el resto de espa oles
7903082 si ha sido posible programar el trasvase a catalunya de aguas excedentarias del ebro por qu no a la comunitat valenciana
7903083 siguen a n sin cobrar las indemnizaciones que les fueron prometidas por las administraciones p blicas para
7903084 la comarca del alcalat n sufri un devastador incendio ante la presencia de centenares de vecinos que ve an impotentes como el fuego arrasaba todo lo que encontraba a su paso
7903085 las excusas que consell y gobierno central dan para negar el pago de las indemnizaciones son insostenibles e injustas pues los vecinos no deben pagar las desavenencias o conflictos pol ticos entre ambas administraciones
7903086 si el consell no ha puesto lo que se comprometi a aportar el gobierno central a trav s del delegado del gobierno debe aportar los m s de 3 millones euros y despu s cobrar a la generalitat lo que prometi aunque sea a cuenta de la financiaci n futura pero los vecinos deben cobrar las indemnizaciones
7903087 debe decir d nde y cu ndo se publicaron las indemnizaciones directas que los afectados deben recibir porque lo que no pueden hacer son las cuentas de la vieja es decir sumar todo lo que han aportado para arreglar carreteras y monumentos o las subvenciones a los ayuntamientos como parte de las aportaciones del consell
7903088 si el vicepresidente vuelve a afirmar que ya ha aportado los 3 millones de euros para indemnizar a los vecinos estar mintiendo pues no constan en ning n diario oficial las cantidades y los vecinos que han de recibir estas indemnizaciones
7903089 para que expliquen cu ndo y c mo va a pagar las cantidades comprometidas ya que no son suficiente las explicaciones que han dado hasta el momento
7903090 ya eludi una comparecencia para informar sobre el proceso de pago de estas indemnizaciones pero no se va a volver a escapar ya que ahora tenemos desde el inicio de la actividad parlamentaria hasta diciembre para que responda y pague
7903091 en la comunitat no falta agua desde que gobierna zapatero
7903092 ha consistido en boicotear el crecimiento econ mico de la comunitat al negar el agua y el trasvase del ebro
7903093 la nica verdad aunque el pp no quiera reconocerla es que no ha faltado ni una gota de agua en estos a os de gobierno socialista
7903094 mientras el pp se ha dedicado a la guerra del agua enfrentando a unos valencianos con otros y a distintos territorios entre s el gobierno de espa a presidido por rodr guez zapatero se ha puesto a trabajar para que los valencianos dispongamos del agua que necesitamos
7903095 en la ponencia que aprob en el congreso de valencia no defiende la continuidad del trasvase tajo segura con lo que camps rindi el tajo segura a la secretaria general del pp mar a dolores de cospedal
7903096 la pol tica del agua pp deja a la comunitat sin agua
7903097 los territorios de las cuencas hidrogr ficas tengan preferencia para su uso
7903098 se garantice que en ning n caso otros usos externos puedan suponer un l mite a su propio desarrollo
7903099 aplicando esta pol tica no hubiera sido posible trasvasar agua del tajo segura para consumo humano en alicante como ha hecho el gobierno de zapatero en los a os de sequ a
7903100 camps rajoy y cospedal le han dado la espalda a los intereses valencianos
7903101 la ponencia no recoge el trasvase del ebro ni el tajo segura ni el j car vinalop pero s las obras del pacto del agua de arag n para las que reclama completar con car cter previo a otras actuaciones
7903102 la ponencia reitera lo que recog a el programa electoral del pp y que camps ha negado reiteradamente intentando enga ar y confundir a todos
7903103 las mentiras tienen las piernas cortas y las de camps ya no tienen recorrido
7903104 afronte los problemas del agua con decencia sin mentiras ni demagogia
7903105 enfocar su beligerancia hacia su propio partido ya que en sus resoluciones congresuales no permite la continuidad del tajo segura y antepone el pacto de agua de arag n a cualquier trasvase del ebro una obra que ya ha enterrado rajoy
7903106 en la comunitat no falta agua desde que gobierna zapatero
7903107 repartidos entre las cinco l neas prioritarias de manos unidas promoci n educativa sanitaria agr cola social y promoci n de la mujer
7903108 de que sea aprobado por todos y se acabe de una vez por todas con el uso partidista y la guerra del agua
7903109 el gobierno central que lidera jos luis rodr guez zapatero est trabajando en esta l nea
7903110 la suma del resto de fuerzas sociales y pol ticas para avanzar m s r pido en la soluci n al problema de la escasez de agua para siempre
7903111 si el consell deja de pensar en votos y comienza a pensar en ciudadanos en colaborar con el resto de las administraciones y desarrollamos un frente valenciano com n en materia de agua que tenga como nexo aquello que compartimos todos es decir los tres puntos b sicos del acuerdo nuestros agricultores y empresarios todos los ciudadanos ser n los principales beneficiados
7903112 para ello es necesario que el presidente de la generalitat francisco camps apoye el texto que ya hemos aprobado en la diputaci n provincial de alicante y serra puede ser el hombre que sirva a este prop sito a la vista de que ripoll se encuentra marginado y aislado de la c pula directiva de su partido en valencia
7903113 nos da igual qui n sea pero que alguien en el pp de valencia d un gesto hacia la paz en materia de agua como ya ha hecho alguien de pp en alicante
7903114 lo contrario supondr a seguir viviendo con tensi n y enfrentamiento social en la comunitat sin que los ciudadanos de la provincia de alicante tengan resuelto por completo sus problemas de suministro de agua
7903115 pedir agua de un trasvase imposible como el ebro cuando desde castilla la mancha atacan al tajo segura desde la misma directiva del pp nacional de rajoy o de cospedal
7903116 manipular con informaciones catastrofistas y exageradas de los efectos de las desalinizadoras de guardamar torrevieja o denia cuando ser n ellos mismo los m ximos beneficiados
7903117 pero lo peor es el doble discurso de un pp que quiere enga ar a todos todo el rato
7903118 camps quiere condenar a la sequ a a los alicantinos porque le resulta rentable en votos ya que como muestra del verdadero discurso el pp ha congelado las inversiones en materia de agua para 2008
7903119 en la comunitat no falta agua desde que gobierna zapatero
7903120 public policy responses to the negative impacts of silicon valleys new economy on working families
7903121 our goal is medals not just to show up and be good canadians its a change in the paradigm its a culture shift why not be the first ones to get out and do it and make everyone react to us
7903122 i believe its the evolution of our sport and youre going to see more and more countries do it and it worked spectacularly today mr jenkins was spectacular today
7903123 it took courage to say that we wanted to do this and we took criticism
7903124 i didnt really care about the rest of my race i actually stopped and yelled at simon as he ran by it was so exciting
7903125 its evolving into a team sport a medal for the country come on what more can you ask for seriously
7903126 i think theres going to be a lot of dissension with all this
7903127 if the goal is to get a gold medal and thats where olympics have gone yeah this is a great move i got into the sport for the individual thing but as soon as you allow drafting that changes the playing field completely
7903128 i think paul has always made it abundantly clear hes not crazy about this whole thing and i can see where hes coming from
7903129 we wanted him to be a part of the team and his heart really wasnt in it it didnt appear that he was really buying into the process because while i dont believe its controversial its not a guarantee
7903130 what were now going to start seeing more and more in the sport is people who are swim bike specialists whose sole job is to get a fast runner to the finish line or to the start of the run in the best possible shape its absolutely no different than the tour de france the domestiques hauling their team leaders and making sure everythings taken care of until the big sprint
7903131 i dont know half of you half as well as i should like and i like less than half of you half as well as you deserve
7903132 sure you can hire a cleaning consultant or watch a few episodes of that awful
7903133 oooh and i am on the rampage again nothing like having everything you own piled
7903134 i havent heard anything good about the us olympic coverage but thats
7903135 when you write about your battle with clutter it makes it sound like we live in a house filled with junk we dont our house is pretty clean youve just got a lot of stuff youre holding onto that you dont know how to get rid of
7903136 and you know why you cant get rid of stuff dont you
7903137 you like the idea of having certain things but you dont actually use them youve got dozens of books stacked in the guest room theyve been there for a year have you needed any of those books in that time
7903138 thats my point you cant bring yourself to get rid of them yet you dont use them either so they sit there you wouldnt even notice if you got rid of them you should just do it
7903139 aptn is excited with the fall changes to the line up as well as the great new programs being offered this year as well the returning programs will please our audiences who are eagerly awaiting new episodes of their favourite shows

7903145 i am not the only one my next door neighbor is 81 and he learned to read last winter and it has just made life over for us
7903146 i would not be so worried and i would not mind facing the fact that we are working fewer hours if i only knew what people would do with their free time i would not know what to do myself if i had only to work six hours a day
7903147 do you know about that book i am so glad to be able to talk about it you know it takes such a long time to get a book around

7903149 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7903150 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7903151 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7903152 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

7903155 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7903156 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7903157 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7903158 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

7903174 will your financial planner be willing to pay your long term care bills will they have access to good quality home health care providers

7903176 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7903177 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7903178 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7903179 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7903180 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

7903182 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7903183 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7903184 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7903185 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7903186 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7903187 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7903188 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7903189 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7903190 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7903191 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7903192 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7903193 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7903194 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7903195 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7903196 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7903197 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7903198 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7903199 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7903200 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7903201 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7903202 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7903203 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7903204 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7903205 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7903206 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7903207 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7903208 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7903209 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7903210 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7903211 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7903212 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7903213 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7903214 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7903215 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7903216 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7903217 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7903218 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7903219 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7903220 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7903221 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7903222 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7903223 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

7903225 it is great that players are posing problems now for the manager when everyone is fit
7903226 they are putting in performances that demand they are on the bench if not starting i am sure the manager will be happy about that

7903243 if everything is okay maybe they could play this weekend they will be around and we will decide but they cannot play in the champions league
7903244 theyre not playing this game so they have time in training and theyll be okay
7903245 they could be the best team weve faced if you look at some of the other games we were much better than the opposition
7903246 but if we do the right things we can be on top of them at anfield we will try to play at a high tempo and im sure theyll try to play on the counter attack
7903247 we have to improve at everything set pieces and open play we had a bad game the best thing was the result but this time we have to play better and we have to score goals
7903248 we have a lot of confidence that we will go through we are at anfield and we have to improve and we will improve
7903249 body cleansing is basically a way that you can get rid of the toxins that are in your body
7903250 this is a question i hear a lot but i have to ask you how much your health is worth to you remember body cleansing is going to help your entire body so it is going to depend on what you consider to be expensive
7903251 a loan is nonperforming when payments of interest and principal are past due by 90 days or more or at least 90 days of interest payments have been capitalized refinanced or delayed by agreement or payments are less than 90 days overdue but there are other good reasons to doubt that payments will be made in full
7903252 this will become necessary due to the clamour of refugees trying to get to the highly developed regions of central asia and africa from their economically backward homes in north america and europe many of these will be brought over by formally american and european corporations which will relocate to the centre of their major markets in india the congo and china
7903253 am i the same person in cairo as i am in denver
7903254 am i the same person tomorrow as i am today
7903255 why do i take this more seriously then they do
7903256 imagine being able to create any 3d object you want a lego piece you are missing
7903257 do you want to give the democratic party the keys to the white house when they already control the congress
7903258 i think its healthier to air those disagreements and let him know where we stand rather than do what the republicans did with george bush where they kept their mouths shut for eight years while he destroyed this country and the world and nobody did anything about it because oh hes george bush weve got to stick with him or the terrorists have won
7903259 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it tonight
7903260 i think if that is eventually where we have to go i dont think they can say theyre the least bit surprised
7903261 i think its clear they want to bring down the government and not say when
7903262 well have to ask whether its appropriate to have people vote twice within a few weeks
7903263 have tabled an economic agenda that stands diametrically opposed to everything this government stands for
7903264 i think you really have increasingly in parliament two different visions of where we should be leading the country particularly during challenging economic times and thats something im going to have to reflect upon
7903265 its not a question of wanting to go to an election its the reality
7903266 when we passed the law the purpose of the fixed election date is to create certainty obviously in a minority parliament you cant be certain
7903267 in the lack of certainty about an election date it falls back to the government to create that certainty
7903268 this is not an easy choice but this is the only chance to save peoples lives
7903269 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us
7903270 we can confirm that u s ship borne humanitarian aid will be delivered to poti tomorrow
7903271 the black sea is just a small pool for their arms with the range of 2 500 kilometres
7903272 georgia chose the least human way to achieve its goal to absorb south ossetia by eliminating a whole nation
7903273 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7903274 russia is trying to legalize the results of an ethnic cleansing it has conducted to oppose it to the west
7903275 but it will result in russias isolation from the world
7903276 nothing to improve the prospects of peace in the caucasus
7903277 it is so wonderful to be here and nothing was going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7903278 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate
7903279 we are told that barack obama believes too much in an america of high principle and high endeavor
7903280 but when john kennedy thought of going to the moon he didnt say its too far to get there we shouldnt even try
7903281 today an american flag still marks the surface of the moon
7903282 what struck me when i first met barack was that even though he had this funny name and even though he had grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine
7903283 he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like mine did and like my family they scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities that they never had themselves
7903284 and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values like you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do and that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7903285 i am here because of the opportunities that my father had that my mother had you know we are who americans were supposed to be
7903286 i know that while america may not be perfect our union can be always be perfected i know what we can achieve when good people with strong conviction come together around a common purpose and i know what a great leader can go to help us build common ground
7903287 america we need such a leader a leader who can heal the wounds of the last eight years a leader who knows that unites us is greater than what divides us america we need barack obama
7903288 america realizes we cant four more years of the same ineffective governing
7903289 when you look at those polls that say 30 per cent of clinton supporters are now going to vote for john mccain he desperately needs to keep them on his side of the ledger
7903290 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7903291 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7903292 we are united and we are together and we are determined
7903293 obama mccain is the devil in disguise and will ruin canada

7903319 lumet had a cradle on the side of the hill with the arm on it and the camera was following us up and down the other side recalled sean
7903320 to be fair to sidney lumet because he goes for the difficult stuff perhaps the sound suffers a bit but you cant take away from the central core of what the movie is and how good all the actors are including myself

7903323 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7903324 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7903325 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7903326 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

7903344 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7903345 on these sensitive issues i cannot take an immediate decision we will take inputs from intellectuals and come to a collective decision
7903346 fighting corruption particularly the political corruption will be one of our main agenda
7903347 today we are sounding the bugle for a major battle against the social ills there are no leaders in the battle but only servants i am your servant we will win this battle no one can stop us

7903352 scratch the die part because we handed our freedom over to a vendor
7903353 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american people
7903354 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
7903355 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors
7903356 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
7903357 all men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree
7903358 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
7903359 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid

7903366 the numbers of true emergencies is far smaller than that
7903367 its a small number of true emergencies though there are some there are times when we have true emergencies and we need things quickly
7903368 its clear the fbi wants to minimize this as a mistake and not abuse
7903369 the facts are there was a ridiculous amount of misuse and abuse

7903372 scheduling is very difficult two of them happened to be in venice at the same time because of the burn after reading premiere so there was a brainstorming session

7903377 early screening of pregnant women could save more than 1 000 premature births a year
7903378 the links between infections and premature birth are so strong that women should be routinely screened around the 15th week of pregnancy and given antibiotics if needed

7903386 take any decisions or measure that have a bearing on the agenda of the dialogue save by consensus such decisions or measures include but are not limited to the convening of parliament or the formation of a new government
7903387 we must remember that the split in 2005 was engineered by a small clique we always suspected that the rank and file membership in matabeleland did not support the split now this has been confirmed
7903388 mutambaras political life has ended and for him to sit at the same negotiating table as morgan tsvangirai and robert mugabe would be ridiculous
7903389 what mutambara forgot was that the people of matabeleland whom mugabe brutalised in the 1980s would never throw their lot with zanu pf so his flirtation with mugabe was bound to see him disgraced
7903390 it can be argued that tsvangirai now commands an absolute majority in parliament and in the negotiations with mutambara out of the way mugabe can no longer push tsvangirai around as he has been doing
7903391 although the political impasse is set to continue with the economy in the state it is now we might see a more determined effort to conclude the inter party talks

7903396 all of those in formal employment should be thrown in jail because they have all become thieves anyone going to work in this economy is only doing so because he can steal something to supplement the peanuts he gets at the end of each month or has found a corrupt way to abuse his position to make extra cash all these people should be arrested for corruption or theft
7903397 in a day i make more than 500 zwd 30 us dollars and i am just hoping that this crisis continues so that i can buy foreign currency and save money for rent and food for my kids for the next three to four months
7903398 we charge a commission of 30 per cent on the money the person wants to withdraw if the person has more than one account its 30 per cent per transaction so for the maximum limit of 200 zwd i get 60 zwd and if the person has only one account but wants more money i will supply it and charge 35 per cent as long as there is a cash crisis i can make my monthly salary in an hour
7903399 when goods in short supply arrive we only sell a fraction to the public the rest we keep for ourselves buying them and reselling them on the black market

7903403 our reporters are working in some very risky areas and are taking on some very edgy topics
7903404 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7903405 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7903406 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7903407 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7903408 all christians have an important role to play in developing their own environmental awareness and encouraging it in others i am delighted that the church of england now has this helpful guide which will prove invaluable for those wanting to plan their own services and for all those looking to find a deeper theological understanding of our christian concern for creation
7903409 this book offers us not just tips on energy saving but a reorientation the intention is not to urge christians to get measured for a hair shirt but to rediscover how good and joyful a thing it is to dwell together in unity with all that lives

7903421 the united states says jewish settlements in the occupied west bank threaten any peace between israel and the palestinians yet it also encourages americans to help support settlers by offering tax breaks on donations but a review by reuters of u s tax records found 13 tax exempt organisations openly linked to settlements that have raised more than 35 million in the last five years alone

7903436 what we have found is we can take the red tomato molecular form of lycopene and by processing it and heating it in combination with added oil we can change the shape of the molecule so it is configured in this bent form
7903437 some people like to cook tomato sauce for prolonged periods sometimes reheating it day after day because it tastes better on the second and third day they add fat by using oil or meat and thats going to start to induce cis isomers of lycopene if fat is present and the cooking continues
7903438 so its possible people could induce this process and increase lycopene absorption by routine food preparation procedures as well
7903439 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention in denver or the people of colorado
7903440 i think if that is eventually where we have to go i dont think they can say theyre the least bit surprised

7903476 we mochten verhulsts boeken w l in hun kasten hebben toen die nog niet verkochten

7903614 the question for her as well as for him is what is their foundation
7903615 their big challenge is convincing people that they will continue to be active in politics and theyre going to continue to have a voice
7903616 an imperfect man with a truly progressive vision who spoke to and for those whom others ignored yes that is who i supported

7904149 john is incredibly unfortunate when you consider that his employment at insulation amp partitions limited was relatively brief but thats the nature of asbestos a single fibre can cause serious health problems and the level of exposure he endured during those 18 months was pretty intense
7904150 the fact insulation amp partitions no longer exists provides complications but it may still be possible to process a claim if we can trace the companys former liability insurers that is so far proving difficult because there is no public record of who holds the relevant policy
7904151 so the more we know about the employer the better not just in terms of the type of work john and others like him did but also in terms of who ran the company and the suppliers it dealt with im particularly keen to trace anyone who worked in accounts because they might remember where and to whom insurance payments were made

7904156 its going to be a tough place to go but it should be a good game
7904157 coventry have started off well i know they were beaten on saturday but they started off with six points from the first two games and they have got a guy who i really respect in charge there chris coleman who i brought to fulham
7904158 they are a club that are looking to build and go places and their ambition is to be in the league we are in it is a good test for us in a competition we will take very seriously

7904447 welche aufgaben wirst du jetzt bernehmen oder ndert sich f r dich nicht sehr viel
7904448 wir l sen eigentlich die probleme falls welche auftauchen eher kollektiv sollten bestimmte tendenzen in der mannschaft auftauchen werde ich mich nat rlich darum k mmern und bei bedarf entgegensteuern vielleicht muss man den jungen spielern manchmal den weg zeigen aber in erster linie will ich wie schon die ganzen jahre hinweg vor allem sportliche leistung und ein vorbildliches verhalten zeigen
7904449 wie ist zur zeit die stimmung im team konnten sich die neuzug nge alle integrieren
7904450 die stimmung ist sehr positiv sportlich wie auch menschlich gibt es keine differenzen untereinander es macht einfach spa mit der mannschaft die neuzug nge haben sich denke ich leicht integriert au er joakim hat ja schon jeder in der bundesliga gespielt und somit denke ich war dies recht einfach f r joakim ist es gut dass mattias andersson da ist im notfall kann er ins schwedische bersetzen richtig zeigen wird sich dann alles erst wenn es los geht und es darauf ankommt
7904451 andi du studierst nebenbei an der fh in ansbach wie vereinbarst du dein studium und das handballspielen
7904452 es klappt zur zeit sehr gut die fh in ansbach ist nur f r profisportler und dadurch kann ich viel von zuhause aus machen das erste semester ist jetzt rum und es passt alles gut meine zeiteinteilung funktioniert gut und ich lerne stundenweise zwischen den trainingseinheiten zudem habe ich ja mit michael spatz einen studienkollegen der mich perfekt motiviert
7904453 was sagst du zu eurem auftaktprogramm 5 spiele in den ersten 13 tagen und davon 4 auch noch ausw rts
7904454 ich sage immer irgendwann muss man gegen jeden spielen wir d rfen die
7904455 wie wirst du dir die linksau en position mit gregor schmei er teilen
7904456 wir alle sind froh dass gregor die vorbereitung ohne r ckschl ge berstanden hat
7904457 welche ziele habt ihr euch f r die kommende saison gesteckt
7904458 der einstellige tabellenplatz ist denke ich schon bei jedem im kopf wir wissen aber auch dass wir zahlreiche konkurrenten haben man wei nie welche verletzungen noch auftauchen werden deshalb finde ich es immer schwer einen bestimmten platz oder hnliches vor der saison bei solchen fragen anzugeben wir wollen als mannschaft auf jeden fall angreifen und einfach unser bestes geben
7904459 ist denn die nationalmannschaft auch noch ein thema f r dich
7904460 ja klar auf jeden fall das ist immer ein thema aber ich arbeite nicht speziell auf dieses ziel hin man will immer besser werden das geh rt einfach dazu und sollte man wegen seinen guten leistungen in die nationalmannschaft berufen werden ist es selbstverst ndlich f r jeden eine gro e sache
7904461 es w re ein gro artiger moment f r mich wenn madrid k me und die festgeschriebene abl sesumme zahlen w rde
7904462 real madrid ist der beste verein spaniens und es w re sehr schwierig
7904463 wird der sc freiburg immer etwas besonderes f r sie sein
7904464 consumer confidence readings suggest that the economy remains stuck in neutral but may be showing signs of improvement by early next year
7904465 however overall readings are still quite low by historical standards and it is still too early to tell if the worst is behind us
7904466 yeah my wife and son wouldnt mind eating ramen noodles for three months
7904467 what stood out for melbourne is that the community there appeared a bit hungrier they appeared to want it more they were able to put up proposals and a number of ideas and suggestions and also produce more volunteers
7904468 i picked traditional shop house facades as a theme and the colours of these old streets of shop houses will all be pastel colours weve applied it to all the marquees were also using it as the backdrop of the stage and weve got them on all the collaterals as well

7904474 there is a girl in high school who has been chosen to fight evil and theres a great deal of it in her town here are her friends and here is her watcher
7904475 we had an opportunity to do something about how animation changes and affects how things look
7904476 for me drew a line where everything that came after would be compared to this particular show buffy would have been the next generation of that
7904477 wed take to one network and theyd say how can we make this more mature well do you want more violence to have the language like it is in the show to have the actors do the voices so it sounds like the show we had all that we would say this is what we have big piles of money and gold and its sitting in the street and you can come out and take it they would ask but you do have copper pans no we have money and gold but they would want copper pans
7904478 everything still exists the designs the scripts its such a no duh project so why the hell not all you need is to draw it eight years ago there was no fascination with family guy or robot chicken but theres an audience now that could drive to it you cant stand in the way of pop culture

7904482 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
7904483 i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world and i come here as a daughter raised on the south side of chicago by a father who was a blue collar city worker and a mother who stayed at home with my brother and me
7904484 barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7904485 it is an indescribable feeling finally we did it we broke the siege and arrived to gaza
7904486 we had no satellite connections no mobile no internet and no means of connection everything around us was blue water we could not even make out where we were exactly but we were determined to continue
7904487 it is a crucial moment and it is a strong lesson on how to make a decision amidst a moment of tension
7904488 it was a consensus we decided to continue despite troubles difficulties and threats all of that because of a noble and human mission for those who suffer from the siege in gaza
7904489 when connection was cut we hesitated but when we remembered the everyday struggle of patients and of children in gaza we decided to continue despite the threats from israel
7904490 it is a unique and exceptional experience i decided to make a film to show the world the difficulties the peace activists faced for the sake of peace and justice and to encourage others to challenge prejudice
7904491 after two years of work and waiting for sailing physicians advised epstein not to join us in our voyage to gaza we miss her

7904510 this lack of preparedness poses a threat to both the role and personal wealth of the principal and will almost certainly affect the other owners of the management company as well as investors in the firms funds

7904540 not all of them have a talent or vocation for the profession of course only 20 or 25 percent actually become luthiers
7904541 the hardest part was to identify by name all of the tools we use in this work which requires manual skill and patience especially in the marquetry part gluing pieces of wood in others
7904542 a good luthier needs to know about acoustics the chemistry of wood and ecology and they have to study music theory as well

7904586 je kan er niet over spreken als in termen van mooi of lelijk het is een ingreep in de kunst het is een gedurfde combinatie dat je iets vergankelijks als een schedel decoreert met diamanten ik denk dat het een icoon wordt in de kunstgeschiedenis het is te vergelijken met de pissoir van duchamps de franse kunstenaar die gewoon een pisbak presenteerde als kunst het veranderde de kunstwereld als galeriehouder zie ik vaak kunst waar mensen aan moeten wennen ik zelf ook maar als je bereid bent die drempel over te gaan dan kun je tot nieuwe inzichten komen kunst is eigenlijk het steeds weer ontdekken van een nieuwe taal of ik de schedel ook had willen tentoonstellen dat is vragen of je met tien koningen en prinsen aan een avondmaal wil zitten
7904587 de schedel draait om drie belangrijke elementen van het leven geld roem en dood alleen seks ontbreekt nog geld vanwege het platina en de diamanten die in de schedel zijn verwerkt roem het werk is net zo beroemd als het melkmeisje van vermeer en het is de kunstenaar die een imago cre ert waarmee hij beroemd wordt tot slot verwijst de schedel ook naar de dood ik vind het goed en eigenlijk is het ook heel mooi prachtige diamanten en platina het is heel pregnant in de kop uitgedrukt die roem en schoonheid daarom is het ook zo duur nee ik ben niet jaloers dat wij het niet hebben we zouden het nu ook niet kunnen tentoonstellen het stedelijk museum is dicht vanwege renovatie red ik zou het niet hebben gekocht het idee is al zo mooi je hoeft niet alles wat je goed vindt ook te hebben
7904588 weerstand levert een kunstwerk altijd op als er veel geld mee is gemoeid mensen zeggen dan dat je zo veel betere dingen met dat geld had kunnen doen
7904589 damit endet die phase der unsicherheit nun k nnen wir mit der umsetzung des wirtschaftlich zwingend notwendigen abbaus und den gespr chen mit den betroffenen mitarbeitern unmittelbar beginnen

7904601 the fact of the matter is that everyone has been crossing their fingers including def jux hoping that cannibal ox would get their shit together as a group even to the point where i re signed them i really hoped and prayed that they would get their shit together thought they were at a certain juncture in time

7904607 we have decided to immediately suspend disabling our nuclear facilities
7904608 this measure has been effective on aug 14 and related parties have been notified of it
7904609 we actually are in discussions with the north koreans and i think well just see where we come out in a few weeks
7904610 north korea is trying to muddle through and delay as much as possible
7904611 at the same time this is a last ditch effort trying to somehow influence u s presidential politics
7904612 i think the timing of the hu jintao visit to south korea was very depressing to the north koreans
7904613 i see it as another card at the negotiation table to urge the u s to remove it from the terrorism blacklist as soon as possible
7904614 the united states and china can think that they are drawing north korea into true nuclear disarmament but north korea has continued to nuclearise throughout the six party process
7904615 such action by north korea will surely hurt foreign investor sentiment towards south korean shares even further i expect foreign exchange markets in particular to be vulnerable to the news
7904616 we know it wont always be smooth sailing the more difficult the circumstances the more we must remember the important commitments made by each party and abide by a spirit of mutual respect in encouraging mutual confidence
7904617 the settlement activity is not conducive to creating an environment for negotiations
7904618 the peace process is not and should not be affected by any kind of settlement activities
7904619 hopefully what were talking about is something that will not happen
7904620 if it does we wouldnt just say come back next year what we would do is work with them on where they fell short provide them the resources they need the tutoring and when we feel like they need to be evaluated again we would evaluate
7904621 we play so good overall when you win you should give your speech in english
7904622 this should be a priority in their professional development just the way working on their short game is a priority
7904623 the lpga could come out and say they only want 10 koreans but theyre not
7904624 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
7904625 to prove the point that tone is on the uprise

7904643 it doesnt matter who your god is homosexuality is wrong even if you dont have a god and you simply live your life by self evident things like nature and science homosexuality is wrong nature strictly using biology as a source here put you here to breed we happen to not be asexual but reproduce with sexual organs if youre not having sex in a fashion conducive to breeding you go against nature itself god doesnt even need to come into it he invented nature and biology and evolution more on that at a later date and in so those laws state that organisms are here to reproduce

7904647 it puts russia of course in opposition to a number of security council resolutions to which it is party most appallingly as a member of the p 5
7904648 we obviously cant allow what russias done to go without there being some consequences
7904649 it simply means that the russian president continues not to honor the commitments that the russians have signed on to

7904652 you can save quite a bit by going from a 250 to 1 000 deductible
7904653 also shopping these for prices every couple years is important
7904654 just make sure you go with a list and only buy those things that you are actually going to consume
7904655 it makes no sense to get a bargain on a bulk item if you are going to throw half of it away
7904656 realizing how much things cost over the course of a year can really help put things in perspective
7904657 you may decide that the object desired really isnt worth the price
7904658 theres no reason to pay for stamps and envelopes and run the risk of a late payment fee when bill pay programs are usually free
7904659 most of the time if an item is 20 off we waste 8 to save that 2

7904715 but i cant help but feel after the first night of the convention that it was largely a wasted night

7904752 drilling in anwr and increasing oil shale development will provide no price relief to the families of riverside county will have potentially catastrophic environmental consequences and will make billions for huge oil and gas companies like exxonmobil
7904753 when voters look at the candidates they should ask why mack supports these ideas and votes to give big oil and gas companies billions in taxpayer money

7904760 i believe we have a strong squad and i believe in the players i have instead of always looking at who might be coming in
7904761 it is up to us as a team to show personality strength and belief within the squad that will make the difference
7904762 we just look at the right player and if we can get him we get him if we dont we dont
7904763 if nothing is done it will not limit our ambitions because of it
7904764 we have talked about everything needed to be successful in a team and commitment is needed for any success no matter how much quality you have
7904765 we live in a world now where you have to accept the critics and a definite conclusion from everybody
7904766 but i know my squad is good my team is good our spirit is good
7904767 we are intelligent enough to know we did not play well on saturday but we know as well we have the needed quality to respond

7904777 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

7904780 bekommt ein passagier im flugzeug kurz vor dem start pl tzlich panik hat er keinen rechtlichen anspruch den flieger zu verlassen das luftfahrtrecht auf das sich jeder fluggast berufen k nne regle nicht das aussteigen aus einer maschine
7904781 dann hat der kapit n die startgenehmigung erhalten und am zielort ist klar wann die maschine landet da ist es nachvollziehbar dass nicht jeder einfach aussteigen darf

7904790 hes a great looking shortstop great hands good arm and his offensive arms are outstanding i like his makeup he was way up on our list to begin with and once i got the chance to get to know him a little bit i liked him even better
7904791 he really impressed me during the futures game he caught the first three innings we dont give the signs to the catcher he told pitcher brett anderson to throw over to first and he picked a runner off his numbers are outstanding for a catcher great offensive catcher and i got reports that said everything about him is good
7904792 she really rallied and was sitting up in bed talking to people that was the best day weve had
7904793 i had asked her if she wanted to vote and she said yes i really would like to vote for hillary
7904794 so i filled out the papers she signed them and i went to the courthouse and got the ballot
7904795 then i got mother her glasses and she sat up she was very alert very serious in studying the ballot
7904796 and when she marked it she just kept circling and circling that mark with her pencil i thought she was going to mark a hole in it
7904797 im so flattered to have the support of florence and so many like her
7904798 i have met so many women from my mothers generation who come up to me and say they were born before women could vote and now want to see a woman in the white house
7904799 they called my husband and said the president wanted to meet us
7904800 he said he was really sorry and he understood our loss he really appreciated that my mom had made an effort to get out and vote for hillary by absentee ballot he has great respect for women of my mothers generation
7904801 i suppose everyone who is losing their mother thinks the same thing she was always there
7904802 she taught me to excel in everything i did she always wanted my daughter and me to be able to take care of ourselves and have an assertive role in our own lives
7904803 i think there are a lot of similarities between them
7904804 my mother certainly doesnt have the wealth or notoriety or reputation but shes been a survivor just like hillary and whether you like her clinton or not shes a survivor you have to respect her for that
7904805 subjugated non muslim individuals or peoples that accept the restrictive and humiliating subordination to an ascendant islamic power to avoid enslavement or death
7904806 beginning early in the eighth century a formal set of rules to govern relationships between muslims and non muslims was elaborated based upon islamic conquests practices theology and jurisprudence
7904807 doctrine of jihad established the relationship between muslims and non muslims in terms of belligerency temporary armistices and submission
7904808 those who oppose the establishment of islamic law or its spread mission or sovereignty over their lands
7904809 protects them from jihad and guarantees limited rights under a system of discriminations that they must accept or face forced conversion slavery or death
7904810 the refusal to allow the propagation of islam in the lands of truce is tantamount to a casus belli and jihad can resume
7904811 europes evolution from a judeo christian civilization with important post enlightenment secular elements into a post judeo christian civilization that is subservient to the ideology of jihad and the islamic powers that propagate it
7904812 europe as reflected by the institutions of the eu has abandoned resistance for dhimmitude and independence for integration with the islamic world of north africa and the middle east
7904813 officially sponsored anti americanism anti semitism anti zionism and palestinianism
7904814 preached hatred of western civilization and modern western secularism and maintained that europe could be redeemed only through islam
7904815 the arab israeli conflict deliberately blown out of all proportion by the euro arab associative diplomacy is just one arena of an incessant global jihad that targets the entire west
7904816 frances association with a muslim federation extending over north africa and the middle east would bring it an ascendancy that would impress the soviet union and rival the united states
7904817 two elements thus cemented the franco arab alliance in the 1960s french anti americanism fed by frustrated power ambitions and a convergence of french vichy anti semitism with the arab desire to destroy israel from then on america and israel were inextricably linked in this policy
7904818 arabs who had settled in the byzantine holy land after the early arab conquest had never manifested any political or cultural autonomy that differentiated them from other muslim arab conquerors in the surrounding regions the idea of an arab palestinian people distinct from the larger arab islamic nation was not only utterly new but contrary to two fundamental historic concepts that of the umma the worldwide islamic community and of the arab nation the ideology dating from the 1890s that promoted a pan arab totalitarian nationalism proclaiming the arabs and superior people and combined with pan islamism
7904819 in the name of palestinian rights new horrors would soon be unleashed upon israel and the world
7904820 recognition of the plo was an essential condition for the eec to be granted huge markets in the arab world
7904821 the arab world could contribute manpower and raw material the europeans technology
7904822 henceforth europe would consider the question of israels right to exist only in connection with the european oil supply
7904823 while the europeans did all they could to please their arab partners none of the progressive policies the ead promoted for the arab world were accepted or applied
7904824 flourished on an international scale during the 1970s and 1980s with the 1972 massacres of the israeli athletes at the munich olympic games the blowing up of airplanes the attacks and murder of civilians by the black september group and the bloody war against the christians in lebanon
7904825 the slowness of the peace process and the palestinian peoples frustration
7904826 hostage taking ritual throat slitting the killing of infidels and muslim apostates are lawful carefully described and highly praised jihad tactics recorded over the centuries in countless legal treaties sic on jihad yet british foreign secretary jack straw and french ex foreign secretary dominique de villepin declared to the press that the arab and islamic world were angered by the injustice felt by the palestinians and that this was the most important issue in the world and in euro arab relations
7904827 the dhimmi policies of submission humiliation and services blended with antisemitism and anti americanism have given eurabian dhimmitude its complex fabric it follows a historical jihadist pattern by fomenting animosity between dhimmi groups and division between infidel nations
7904828 integrated in bushs declared war against terrorism the iraqi conflict has debunked europes complacency and collusion furthermore president george w bush has unveiled the lethal danger of islamist terrorism and placed it on the international world stage dethroning the palestinian cause and thus revolting many europeans by weakening the euro arab struggle against israel
7904829 the product thats in question was some of the roast beef products on the extended maple leaf recall list
7904830 it was in our production on a certain day which was july 29
7904831 we do not normally use any products from 97 b but it was one of those fluke things that we would have bought any products different than what we normally use and it just happened to be part of the extended list from the maple leaf recall
7904832 we took them all off the shelf as precaution because theres a possible chance that other varieties of roast beef could have been in contact with the roast beef that we used for irving and sub delicious
7904833 we have removed them from the shelves and have replaced them with new products that are not part of that plant number at all which we normally dont have in our plant anyway

7905044 the decision is historic but the joy is very personal for families all across california knowing that we are finally able to have the basic protections and opportunities that come with marriage

7905054 the ohio delegation is scheduled to meet today to keep us updated and to make our plans for today and tomorrow
7905055 and of course the hillary clinton delegates are set to meet with her wednesday afternoon when we anticipate she will instruct us on giving our support to barack obama
7905056 i am sure it will be a very hard speech for her after her very strong primary election race but i really believe the democrats will be united after this convention because of her efforts to bring her supporters to the obama campaign i am and was a clinton supporter but i am prepared to work for the obama campaign when we complete the convention
7905057 started her adrenaline running and made her proud to be a democrat
7905058 the passing of the torch is really true it is time to pass the torch to the next generation that will provide new leadership
7905059 sen kennedy gave us such a wonderful speech with such sincerity and such conviction he is still very dynamic and still has it as a great speaker
7905060 i believe she gave a fantastic address she knows her husband the best and his love of family showed through her speech i was very impressed with michelle obamas speech monday
7905061 gave very stirring tributes to the late congresswoman stephanie tubbs jones
7905062 and the ohio delegation also heard from leo gerard president of the united steelworkers monday who really brought home the issue of lost steelworker jobs and a growing trade deficit gerard told us that a billion seconds ago it was 1958 and a billion minutes ago jesus christ was walking the earth but we now have a billion plus dollar trade deficit with china alone
7905063 and i honestly believe there are about three reporters for every delegate at the convention i gave an interview monday to the polish national radio and we have seen and talked to reporters from all over the world who are covering the convention
7905064 on the jog back kelly passed everyone and sprinted to the end of the trail she gave her all on that last run and then came back to help and encourage others who were struggling she gave her all and ran to the end of the race
7905065 kelly was such a beautiful person and she gave herself to so many people she didnt wear her faith on her sleeve like so many others do she wore her faith in her heart in her smile and in the joy she brought as well as the hugs she had for everyone she lived life to the fullest
7905066 people would ask her why she ran but she would try anything and always had a smile on her face she didnt have the best times in her races but she always ran beyond her potential kelly said last year that her goal was to finally start liking the running i truly believe on her last day that she loved running i feel blessed that i got to spend a last run with her
7905067 it is hard to be sad today because kelly is shining more than ever now because she is with god
7905068 have been relying on their faith as they cope with this tragedy
7905069 we have seen and talked to a number of people since the accident last week and we encourage them to be strong in their faith unfortunately we have been down this road before with student deaths in past years and this is a tough way to start the new school year
7905070 we also see people who may never have fully grieved for someone who died in the past and this brings all that back and for many of our students this accident is the first time they have seen someone they know die it is a tough time for everyone
7905071 who she felt didnt care for her there were her friends in reno nev who thought her strong faith was odd but she maintained her joy through her life
7905072 when kelly was a freshman she was on the university track team and there was a day when the team was at carnegie mellon for a meet it was raining and miserable and some of the team members were complaining about the conditions but kelly volunteered to run a race and after she ran she asked her coach how did i do then she volunteered to run a second race and again asked her coach with a big smile on her face how did i do
7905073 that joy she always had was the joy of being a child of god i suggest to you that the end goal of heaven was closer for kelly than for the rest of us we believe kelly has reached the goal but we have not reached that goal yet
7905074 cross country runners usually want to know the way before a race jesus christ is the way he is the truth he is the light and he is the course we must take on the race kelly was a runner her race has ended she has won victory in christ yet our race continues
7905075 to the parents sisters grandparents uncles aunts and cousins i can assure you kelly and you will remain part of our university family as long as teachers teach here as long as students learn in our halls and as long as runners press on to the finish line
7905076 thank you to all who negotiated this came to a nice happy ending
7905077 then just before dawn one morning late in august a derelict schooner that had been tied up for weeks at a ramshackle wharf of morgan city put out into the gulf she was low in the water had a surly pick up crew of spaniards and half castes a skipper who didnt talk and a top heavy deck cargo of southern pine nothing particularly unusual about her it was the kind of vessel the kind of cargo and the kind of crew that was commonplace in the sleepy fishing and lumber port between new orleans and galveston the customs house officials cleared her in routine fashion for progresso yucatan her papers were in order her declared cargo was lumber
7905078 only the silent captain and a few of the well paid crew knew that the schooner had stowed below her decks a stand of 4 000 winchesters and 1 500 000 rounds of ammunition enough rifles and cartridges to oppose any army in central or south america

7905107 every team has to go into the year thinking that they are going to win the stanley cup
7905108 but there are 29 teams that go in with that thought and dont get it done but you have to at least start the year with that being your first goal you are not going to win every game but you have to go in thinking that you can its not about the players playing for the coach its about the players playing for each other

7905111 will give the usw international and the usw bargaining committee the authority to call a strike if it becomes necessary
7905112 but at this point the local union presidents have been asked to hold these membership meetings wednesday to update our members and to ask for a strike authorization vote from the members
7905113 i cannot stress enough how important these two meetings are for our union members we have been negotiating with arcelormittal for the past 14 weeks and unfortunately are now at this point but i will provide a complete and detailed report to the membership at the two meetings and we will decide at that point what direction we will take
7905114 at all arcelormittal plants in the united states for the more than 14 000 steelworkers covered by this basic labor agreement
7905115 it is more important than ever that we all stand strong and send a unified message to the company that the steelworkers will not back down and will not go away we continue to stand by our commitment to bring back a contract that provides the employment security earnings security and retirement security that we need and deserve
7905116 it is extremely important to attain these cornerstone issues in a new labor agreement and we need investment in our facilities so we can stay on the cutting edge of technology
7905117 we have witnessed the severe pain of our retirees suffering because of the weirton steel bankruptcy and the pension plan termination as well as the loss of their health care
7905118 the pattern was set this month with the new contract with u s steel we must remain united on these issues in order to obtain the contract that meets our goals
7905119 that provides very significant wage substantial bonus and pension increases and improves benefit programs for active employees and retirees as well as reduces health care premiums for retirees
7905120 weve gone through some tough times in the steel industry during the last 20 years
7905121 our union was instrumental in restructuring the industry and this new contract rewards our members for their hard work improves the living standards of our retirees and the capital investments that will be made in our mills protect our communities far into the future this contract is the new standard in the industry
7905122 yet the company arcelormittal continues to demand a 39 percent increase and the company still has not agreed to a continuation of adequate funding for our voluntary employee beneficiary association trust fund
7905123 continue to demand a new financial incentive program that would reduce incentives and force us to make new improvements just to get back to our current levels of pay

7905143 we are very sceptical that the current process being procured by eskom not even by government is the right way to go we believe that a professional independent institution should control that procurement process
7905144 but the problem is the economics didnt make sense and the conditions for ipps to come into south africa at that point were simply inappropriate and they are still maybe we have made some progress in the last six months but they are still probably inappropriate
7905145 we tried to come up with a multi market model it did not work

7905164 if you buy something with bradmans name on it you would assume it is the top of the range that is very simple for the market to understand
7905165 but do you want bradmans name on a can of paint even if its a good can of paint
7905166 it is a difficult balance because when he was alive he didnt believe in the commercialisation of his name
7905167 in the centenary year he is a brand but obviously if that is not exercised it will pass with time as the generations forget those were some of our arguments to the museum and the family
7905168 we were always perplexed by this bradman stood for absolute amateur values the old days in cricket when winning and money did not override sportsmanship how do you mix that in its purest form with commercial enterprise which is what branding and licensing is
7905169 we are extremely keen as we go into the second century to keep his values at the forefront education being the key driver for that
7905170 his statement was that the museum was for the youth of australia now the challenge is that cricket is global and his fame is global so how do we take bradman and keep him up there in australia and how do we do it around the world
7905171 a loved and missed family member not a brand name like mickey mouse
7905172 having known sir donald as closely as i did i certainly have full confidence that he would happily have approved of the venture sometimes we can be a bit precious about these things sir donald bradman its probably the greatest name in australian history we want to keep that name alive and if it means turning him into a biscuit name well weve gone ahead and done it

7905190 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7905191 if the democrats think were going to be able to nominate someone who can win without that person being able to table unimpeachable credentials on national security and foreign policy i think were making a tragic mistake
7905192 i am not going to fail to protect these kids as long as we have a single solitary troop in iraq
7905193 this isnt cutting off the war this is cutting off support that will save the lives of american troops
7905194 we can call it quits and withdraw from iraq i think that would be a tragic mistake or we can set a deadline for pulling out which i fear will only encourage our enemies to wait us out equally a mistake

7905271 alex was such a nice happy wee guy he was very close to all the family and was particularly fond of his late grandmother and mum
7905272 he was very attentive to both and did everything for them
7905273 just a few weeks ago i mentioned to alex in passing that i didnt have my oap bus pass
7905274 a few days later he came up to my flat and presented one to me hed sorted the whole thing out without me knowing
7905275 that was alex for you always thinking of other people
7905276 he was very happy go lucky with a very dry sense of humour and was always cheery
7905277 he would do anything for anyone and was very popular in the local community there were over a hundred people at his funeral
7905278 alex was always there to give anyone a helping hand if someone was ill he would do their shopping and would regularly check on them
7905279 he had cared for one elderly woman gladys for years and after her death last year the nhs wrote a letter thanking him for all the care he provided
7905280 alex was also instrumental in our childrens garden project the kids used to run wild around the estate smashing windows and daubing the walls with graffiti
7905281 then alex helped teach them all about gardening and their misbehaviour was virtually wiped out
7905282 he was thought of that highly by the local community he was asked him to stand for council
7905283 however he declined as he didnt want to be in the spotlight and preferred to stay in the background
7905284 i will miss both as a colleague and also as a good friend he was simply the best
7905285 he had a heart of gold and would do anything for anyone
7905286 he absolutely loved being part of the community and edinburgh he had four pictures of the castle up in his flat
7905287 we are struggling to come to terms with what has happened but are taking comfort from all the lovely things people have had to say about him

7905289 comment par quelle m thode puis je prouver et examiner ma foi dois je mattendre recevoir un signe de dieu
7905290 j sus leur r pondit vous tes dans lerreur parce que vous ne comprenez ni les ecritures ni la puissance de dieu car la r surrection les hommes ne prendront point de femmes ni les femmes de maris mais ils seront comme les anges de dieu dans le ciel pour ce qui est de la r surrection des morts pas lu ce que dieu vous a dit je suis le dieu dabraham le dieu disaac et le dieu de jacob dieu nest pas dieu des morts mais des vivants
7905291 le jour du sabbat nous nous rend mes hors de la porte vers une rivi re o nous pensions que se trouvait un lieu de pri re nous nous ass mes et nous parl mes aux femmes qui taient r unies lune delles nomm e lydie marchande de pourpre de la ville de thyatire tait une femme craignant dieu et elle coutait le seigneur lui ouvrit le c ur pour quelle f t attentive ce que disait paul lorsquelle eut t baptis e avec sa famille elle nous fit cette demande si vous me jugez fid le au seigneur entrez dans ma maison et demeurez y et elle nous pressa par ses instances
7905292 alors le ge lier ayant demand de la lumi re entra pr cipitamment et se jeta tout tremblant aux pieds de paul et de silas il les fit sortir et dit seigneurs que faut il que je fasse pour tre sauv paul et silas r pondirent crois au seigneur j sus et tu seras sauv toi et ta famille et ils lui annonc rent la parole du seigneur ainsi qu tous ceux qui taient dans sa maison il les prit avec lui cette heure m me de la nuit il lava leurs plaies et aussit t il fut baptis lui et tous les siens les ayant conduits dans son logement il leur servit manger et il se r jouit avec toute sa famille de ce quil avait cru en dieu
7905293 cependant crispus le chef de la synagogue crut au seigneur avec toute sa famille et plusieurs corinthiens qui avaient entendu paul crurent aussi et furent baptis s
7905294 jai encore baptis la famille de st phanas du reste je ne sache pas que jaie baptis quelque autre personne
7905295 et il se r jouit avec toute sa famille de ce quil avait cru en dieu
7905296 par le bapt me tous les p ch s sont pardonn s le p ch originel et tous les p ch s personnels non seulement le bapt me purifie de tous les p ch s mais il fait aussi du n ophyte une nouvelle cr ature
7905297 quiconque croit que j sus est le christ est n de dieu et quiconque aime celui qui la engendr aime aussi celui qui est n de lui
7905298 etant donc justifi s par la foi nous avons la paix avec dieu par notre seigneur j sus christ
7905299 et maintenant que tardes tu l ve toi sois baptis et lav de tes p ch s en invoquant le nom du seigneur
7905300 cette eau tait une figure du bapt me qui nest pas la purification des souillures du corps mais lengagement dune bonne conscience envers dieu et qui maintenant vous sauve vous aussi par la r surrection de j sus christ
7905301 ayant t ensevelis avec lui par le bapt me vous tes aussi ressuscit s en lui et avec lui par la foi en la puissance de dieu qui la ressuscit des morts
7905302 car vous tes tous fils de dieu par la foi en j sus christ vous tous qui avez t baptis s en christ vous avez rev tu christ
7905303 allez faites de toutes les nations des disciples les baptisant au nom du p re du fils et du saint esprit et enseignez leur observer tout ce que je vous ai prescrit et voici je suis avec vous tous les jours jusqu la fin du monde
7905304 j sus r pondit en v rit en v rit je te le dis si un homme ne na t deau et desprit il ne peut entrer dans le royaume de dieu
7905305 si un homme ne na t pas par le bapt me il ne peut entrer dans le royaume de dieu
7905306 cest l quil y aura des pleurs et des grincements de dents quand vous verrez abraham isaac et jacob et tous les proph tes dans le royaume de dieu et que vous serez jet s dehors
7905307 tu es le docteur disra l et tu ne sais pas ces choses
7905308 puis il leur dit allez par tout le monde et pr chez la bonne nouvelle toute la cr ation
7905309 ceci est mon corps ceci est le sang de la nouvelle alliance
7905310 devons nous comprendre les paroles de j sus comme tant litt rales comme les catholiques laffirment ou sont elles symboliques comme les protestants lassurent
7905311 car toutes les fois que vous mangez ce pain et que vous buvez cette coupe vous annoncez la mort du seigneur jusqu ce quil vienne
7905312 je vous le dis je ne boirai plus d sormais de ce fruit de la vigne jusquau jour o jen boirai du nouveau avec vous dans le royaume de mon p re
7905313 et apr s avoir rendu gr ces le rompit et dit ceci est mon corps qui est rompu pour vous faites ceci en m moire de moi de m me apr s avoir soup il prit la coupe et dit cette coupe est la nouvelle alliance en mon sang faites ceci en m moire de moi toutes les fois que vous en boirez
7905314 cest pourquoi celui qui mangera le pain ou boira la coupe du seigneur indignement sera coupable envers le corps et le sang du seigneur
7905315 sur la croix christ notre p que a t offert en sacrifice 1 cor 5 7 ce m me sacrifice est r p t chaque messe ce qui permet de poursuivre l uvre de notre r demption
7905316 il existe dans leglise catholique un v ritable sacrifice la messe institu e par j sus christ ce sacrifice est identique celui de la croix car christ est la fois le sacrificateur et la victime la seule diff rence est dans la mani re doffrir ce sacrifice il a t sanglant sur la croix il est non sanglant sur lautel de la messe la messe est un sacrifice propitiatoire pour lexpiation des p ch s des vivants et des morts pour lesquels elle est offerte christ a ordonn pr tres ses ap tres en leur donnant le pouvoir et lordre de consacrer son corps et son sang afin de perp tuer et de renouveler son sacrifice
7905317 car christ nest pas entr dans un sanctuaire fait de main dhomme en imitation du v ritable mais il est entr dans le ciel m me afin de compara tre maintenant pour nous devant la face de dieu et ce nest pas pour soffrir lui m me plusieurs fois quil y est entr comme le souverain sacrificateur entre chaque ann e dans le sanctuaire avec du sang tranger autrement il aurait fallu quil e t souffert plusieurs fois depuis la cr ation du monde tandis que maintenant la fin des si cles il a paru une seule fois pour abolir le p ch par son sacrifice et comme il est r serv aux hommes de mourir une seule fois apr s quoi vient le jugement de m me christ qui sest offert une seule fois pour porter les p ch s de plusieurs appara tra sans p ch une seconde fois ceux qui lattendent pour leur salut

7905319 if a single pawn has advanced to the seventh rank and is threatening to promote everything depends on whether the attacking king can assist the queen with a central pawn this is almost always possible no matter how far away the king is
7905320 folks often remember that q vs p is drawn only if theres a rook or knight pawn on the 7th supported by their king thats an oversimplification and troitzkys study reveals the lie if a queen has no good checks or pins because her own king blocks her path the position is drawn even if the weaker side has a central pawn so before evaluating a q vs p endgame with a pawn on the 7th as won or lost do some calculation to determine whether the stronger side can actually make time gaining checks

7905327 mattel itself had approached the indian courts in february 2008 seeking an order for taking down scrabulous from facebook and other servers
7905328 the honble high court has reserved judgment in this matter after hearing both parties it surprises us that mattel chose to direct facebook to take down scrabulous without waiting for the honble high courts decision mattels action speaks volumes about their business practices and respect for the judiciary
7905329 it is even more astonishing that facebook which claims to be a fair and neutral party took this step even though they were fully aware of the circumstances under which the mattel letter was sent to them
7905330 this blog is about understanding the value of modeling to a project team and is focused on helping solution architects gain a practical understanding of the value of modeling to in turn help explain its value to the project team for adoption
7905331 where he discusses many things including the value of a metamodel
7905332 my recommendation to developers and architect is metamodel as a verb metamodel completely and thoroughly and even if you dont create a platform independent model of your solution and a compiler based on this metamodel write code with the metamodel in mind this will end up looking like a framework of course for instance define precisely what a business entity is an association a business process a task remember you are not creating an oo model you are creating a metamodel every solution domain has a metamodel there is nothing absolute about it the metamodel of an information system is different from the metamodel of an industrial process control system and what works for a travel company may not work for an insurance company

7905379 has faced questions about the banks multi million dollar loans to michael gioranago a convicted bookmaker and prostitution ring promoter
7905380 is concerned by revelations that the bank owned by illinois democratic treasurer nominee alexi giannoulias family gave loans to a chicago crime figure and said the candidate owes him and the public a full accounting
7905381 newly discovered public records show broadway bank made 11 8 million in additional mortgage loans to giorango just last year giannoulias said he oversaw the servicing of those loans
7905382 was gunned down in an execution style slaying after selling the gambling fleet to a group that included indicted washington lobbyist jack abramoff
7905383 giannoulias is so tainted by reputed mob links that several top illinois dems including the states speaker of the house and party chairman refused to endorse him even after he won the democratic nomination with obamas help
7905384 j ust why did sen obama last week endorse for illinois treasurer an unknown 29 year old whose financial experience is limited to working at a family owned chicago bank and who as recently as five years ago was shooting professional hoops as point guard with team panionios of athens greece

7905394 i dont care what jesse jackson does im going to this convention and im going to win
7905395 obama agrees to roll call vote for clinton does that make him a sissy
7905396 the democratic national convention is now shaping up to be quite a party for hillary clinton her name will be placed in nomination shell give a prime time address
7905397 overall between 1972 and 1992 10 democratic candidates who lost the nomination in the primaries went on to have their names formally placed in nomination at the convention
7905398 sure hillarys fat and waddly and screechy and gives pantsuits a bad name
7905399 reports of strife between negotiators for sen hillary clinton and sen barack obama are exaggerated
7905400 multiple sources in both campaigns have described the negotiations as relatively free of acrimony
7905401 my sources say the obama campaign was enthusiastic about the idea of putting clintons name in nomination having independently reached the conclusion that it was the best way to honor her achievement and do more to win over her supporters
7905402 the conversations with her folks were very cordial and weve been able to work very closely with them as we unify this party we couldnt be happier about how things are going with senator clinton and her team
7905403 hillary clintons attempt tacitly to take over the obama victory
7905404 i thought journalists were supposed to uncover the facts and report the story not decide on the story and then interpret the facts to accommodate their storyline
7905405 russia rolls over georgia hillary clinton does the same to barack obama now we know whos boss
7905406 if hillary clinton can ride roughshod over this guy what do you think bin laden will do
7905407 russia invades georgia hillary invades obamas convention obama does nothing constructive on either count
7905408 the average battery chicken walks in a very ungainly way they kind of lurch from side to side when they walk this chicken looks a lot more agile and healthy
7905409 if you took the average chicken from a factory farm and plonked it down in a small households backyard in bangalore it wouldnt be able to run away from a cat or dog if it needed to and it would probably get ill very quickly because its immune system is seriously undermined
7905410 this chicken if a dog was trying to catch it could fly away its sturdier and does very well on scavenging household waste
7905411 were encouraging the farmers so that they can have healthy food in their diets and also they can make income make money out of this
7905412 its down to the economics a fast growing breed costs less to produce and therefore costs less to the retailer
7905413 its all being driven by what the consumer wants and farmers and companies have been driven to produce that

7905615 long years ago we made a tryst with destiny and now the time comes when we shall redeem our pledge not wholly or in full measure but very substantially at the stroke of the midnight hour when the world sleeps india will awake to life and freedom a moment comes which comes but rarely in history when we step out from the old to the new when an age ends and when the soul of a nation long suppressed finds utterance it is fitting that at this solemn moment we take the pledge of dedication to the service of india and her people and to the still larger cause of humanity at the dawn of history india started on her unending quest and trackless centuries are filled with her striving and the grandeur of her success and her failures through good and ill fortune alike she has never lost sight of that quest or forgotten the ideals which gave her strength we end today a period of ill fortune and india discovers herself again the achievement we celebrate today is but a step an opening of opportunity to the greater triumphs and achievements that await us are we brave enough and wise enough to grasp this opportunity and accept the challenge of the future that future is not one of ease or resting but of incessant striving so that we may fulfil the pledges we have so often taken and the one we shall take today the service of india means the service of the millions who suffer it means the ending of poverty and ignorance and disease and inequality of opportunity the ambition of the greatest man of our generation has been to wipe every tear from every eye that may be beyond us but as long as there are tears and suffering so long our work will not be over and so we have to labour and to work and work hard to give reality to our dreams those dreams are for india but they are also for the world for all the nations and peoples are too closely knit together today for any one of them to imagine that it can live apart peace has been said to be indivisible so is freedom so is prosperity now and so also is disaster in this one world that can no longer be split into isolated fragments we have to build the noble mansion of free india where all her children may dwell the appointed day has come the day appointed by destiny and india stands forth again after long slumber and struggle awake vital free and independent the past clings on to us still in some measure and we have to do much before we redeem the pledges we have so often taken yet the turning point is past and history begins anew for us the history which we shall live and act and others will write about it is a fateful moment for us in india a new star rises the star of freedom in the east a new hope comes into being a vision long cherished materializes may the star never set and that hope never be betrayed we rejoice in that freedom the future beckons to us whither do we go and what shall be our endeavour to bring freedom and opportunity to the common man to the peasants and workers of india to fight and end poverty and ignorance and disease to build up a prosperous democratic and progressive nation and to create social economic and political institutions which will ensure justice and fullness of life to every man and woman we have hard work ahead there is no resting for any one of us till we redeem our pledge in full till we make all the people of india what destiny intended them to be we are citizens of a great country on the verge of bold advance and we have to live up to that high standard all of us to whatever religion we may belong are equally the children of india with equal rights privileges and obligations we cannot encourage communalism or narrow mindedness for no nation can be great whose people are narrow in thought or in action to the nations and peoples of the world send greetings and pledge ourselves to cooperate with them in furthering peace freedom and democracy and to india our much loved motherland the ancient the eternal and the ever new we pay our reverent homage and we bind ourselves afresh to her service jai hind

7905623 one day some years ago i was lying down and awake when i distinctly felt my body rise higher and higher i could see the physical objects below growing smaller and smaller until they disappeared and all around me was a limitless expanse of dazzling light after some time i felt the body slowly descend and the physical objects below began to appear i was so fully aware of this incident that i finally concluded that it must be by such means that sages using the powers of siddhis travel over vast distances in a short time and appear and disappear in such a mysterious manner while the body thus descended to the ground it occurred to me that i was at tiruvottiyur though i had never seen the place before i found myself on a highroad and walked along it at some distance from the roadside was a temple of ganapati and i entered it
7905624 this week we were invited to another indian village function an annual ceremony where they ask the gods to bring rain this is always held on the same day of the year so on june 23 2008 we went into samuthiram village to see the ceremony the rain is particularly needed this year there are two monsoons that bring the bulk of the rain to the area the northeast monsoon in october and november and the southwest monsoon in the summer the northeast monsoon failed to come last fall and so far the southwest monsoon has failed to arrive as well tamil nadu has vast agricultural areas much of which are rice fields farmed as small plots by village farming families the rice fields can grow three crops each year but they use lots of water the english when they came to india said that these south indian fields were the most productive in the world they depend each year on the monsoons now we may have had two monsoon failures in a row

7905628 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic

7905658 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews

7905662 other stations that follow sinclairs lead should expect a similar response from people who dont want the political discourse cheapened with these false negative attacks
7905663 we dont want to create negative problem for the neighborhood and that was an unfortunate consequence
7905664 but it wasnt me he wasnt ready he was getting his voice
7905665 they have the potential to cause quite a bit of economic damage and theyre transported easily
7905666 the good news is we know more about the biology now and their interaction with ants there has been a lot of hard work and investment by the university of california uc on this problem as a result we have a lot more options and choices of softer materials now
7905667 in some shape or form were either monitoring it or treating it this time of year mid summer weve got all generations eggs nymphs and adults that makes it even more difficult there are a lot of decisions to be made on how youre going to approach the problem and figure out the best timing for a treatment timing is everything with the softer pesticides were using now
7905668 if you want to improve bio control you have to kill the ants
7905669 weve pretty much avoided category 1 pesticides for the past couple of years
7905670 weve been working with uc berkeley on ant baits as well as doing a lot of research with parasitoids we actually started with the parasitoids and then realized ants were the key once we found out how to control the ants we came back with the parasitoids
7905671 the best time to put out ant baits is early spring right after the heavy rains quit
7905672 if you put them out too late they wont work then we start releasing parasitoids in late spring early summer and release once a week up until harvest
7905673 with these newer pesticides you have to hit them in the juvenile stage
7905674 i do want to use it but im waiting until the european maximum tolerance levels are set

7905682 weve done our best to create the next great mmorpg experience but its the fans that will bring our world to life the day of reckoning approaches and its going to be glorious its time to go to war
7905683 when i came on board the original homesteaders were still making decisions but the operations were beginning to be turned over to the next generation
7905684 unlike other areas where farm advisors might be trying to convince farmers to adopt new practices i was in the position of asking people to wait a year to be sure of our research results
7905685 there were missteps mainly due to the way laws were written and enforced by wildlife agencies the crisis was a wakeup call that such decisions can have wide ranging impacts the stakeholders are determined to develop more of a planned response so future water shortages dont come as such a drastic shock
7905686 essentially we have 1 500 high quality photographs of several entire museum slide collections of thrips of importance to california on a cd rom that is highly portable and will be web accessible too on sept 1 at no charge
7905687 also included is a novel interactive glossary of technical terms concerning thrips morphology it works either by selecting a body part name or by clicking on the body part of a cartoon thrips to get the name and definition of that particular body part structure
7905688 until now there existed few tools for identifying california thrips and of available tools many are in excess of 40 years of age
7905689 in most cases the vast majority of native california thrips are closely associated with native california plants and they dont feed on to any significant extent important crop plants
7905690 exotic invasive thrips on the other hand almost always turn out to be important pest species this occurs because in most cases they have arrived on exotic plants that are of some economic value to california either agriculturally or for beautifying the landscape with vast monocultures to attack no natural enemies or significant competition for resources great year round climate especially in coastal areas the small invading populations explode spread rapidly and do immense damage
7905691 knowing their identity will help greatly in predicting how that species may behave
7905692 additionally the cd rom can identify serious pest species not yet in california and early detection and accurate identification is key to successful management of an invasive species
7905693 the states fauna is extremely unique because of the high diversity of native plants here plants found on beaches deserts to mountain tops and everything in between we have an immense amount of agriculture in california and a baffling variety of exotic plants in urban areas
7905694 this second phase of the cd rom will allow users to identify fragments of thrips as well as the thrips larvae and eggs
7905695 this will be very valuable for border inspection officials who may find only immature stages of thrips infesting plants molecular tools are extremely useful in this instance because traditional morphological approaches cannot identify immature thrips to species
7905696 meeting the growing demand for row crop supplies for food and energy production is being achieved thanks in part to innovations in plant biotechnology
7905697 according to usdas report issued today soybean production is forecast at 2 97 billion bushels up 15 percent from last year corn yields are expected to average 155 bushels per acre up 3 9 bushels from last year if realized this would be the second highest corn yield on record behind 2004
7905698 plant biotechnology helps contribute to crop yield increases allowing farmers to meet the growing demand for food feed and fuel currently 91 percent of soybeans and 73 percent of corn grown in the united states are biotech varieties which enable these plants to resist insect and weed threats

7905703 having privacy native in the browser as opposed to just an extension is something weve been advocating for a long time from all the browser manufacturers
7905704 incorporating all of these privacy features at once is a major step forward safari has some built in privacy and firefox has extensions native privacy is better
7905705 if you are using a shared pc a borrowed laptop from a friend or a public pc sometimes you dont want other people to know where youve been on the web internet explorer 8s inprivate browsing makes that over the shoulder privacy easy by not storing history cookies temporary internet files or other data
7905706 there is some worry that i might be a lightning rod
7905707 some of it is because i challenged the system at guant namo
7905708 i can see why muslims wanted to go underground after 9 11
7905709 but i have found that if you speak up in politics you can have a positive influence
7905710 by far the strongest advocate for following the geneva conventions for habeas corpus for following the constitution for everyone and for reaching out to all faiths
7905711 that theyll now read from the quran at a national political convention that shows we have come a long way in this country
7905712 i wouldnt characterize it as a good pr move what i would say is that we are always concerned when someone takes his own life because as americans we value life even the lives of violent terrorists who are captured waging war against our country
7905713 did not know whether al utaybi had been informed about the transfer recommendation before he killed himself
7905714 a mid to high level al qaeda operative who had key ties to principal facilitators and senior members of the group
7905715 autopsies were performed by physicians from the armed forces institute of pathology at naval hospital guant namo on june 10 and 11
7905716 a short written statement declaring their intent to be martyrs was found in the pockets of each of the detainees
7905717 lengthier written statements were also found in each of their cells
7905718 more than 3 000 pages of military investigative documents medical records autopsies and statements from guards and detainees
7905719 case file will be posted in its entirety on the dod foia web site in the near future
7905720 i am informing you that i gave away the precious thing that i have in which it became very cheap which is my own self to lift up the oppression that is upon us through the american government
7905721 i did not like the tube in my mouth now go ahead and accept the rope in my neck
7905722 i turned in my koran not insult now im turning in my body and sacred are so you not insult it
7905723 due to similarities in the wording of the statements and the manner of suicides as well as statements made by other detainees interviewed
7905724 there was growing concern that someone within the camp delta population was directing detainees to commit suicide and that additional suicides might be imminent
7905725 the cells of other detainees were searched during the week following the suicides in an attempt to find evidence regarding whether the suicides had been part of a larger conspiracy which might result in additional detainees also taking their lives
7905726 additional handwritten notes found in cells other than those where the suicides took place
7905727 and other documents reveal that the men took advantage of lapses in guard protocol and of lenient policies toward compliant detainees to commit what suicide notes described as an attack on the united states
7905728 investigators found that guards had become lax on certain rules because commanders wanted to reward the more compliant detainees giving them extra t shirts blankets and towels detainees were allowed to hang such items to dry or to provide privacy while using the toilet but were not supposed to be able to obscure their cells while sleeping guards told officials that it was not unusual to see blankets hanging in the cells and that they did not think twice when they passed several cells on the night of june 9 2006 with blankets strung through the wire mesh authorities believe the men probably hanged themselves around 10 p m but they were not discovered until shortly after midnight on june 10
7905729 who was arrested near his college in pakistan in march 2002 and was turned over to u s authorities on may 2 2002 in afghanistan was not someone they could prosecute
7905730 a mid to high level al qaeda operative who had key ties to principal facilitators and senior members of the group
7905731 although many of the individuals apprehended during the raid have strong connections to al qaeda there is no credible information to suggest ahmed received terrorist related training or is a member of the al qaeda network
7905732 senior pentagon official who read the report and provided details in exchange for anonymity
7905733 that the navy investigation found the simultaneous suicides to be acts of defiance and martyrdom
7905734 left unexplained one key question why guards had not checked on the men for two and a half hours before they were discovered hanging in their cells
7905735 tours of the prison camps have described a strict doctrine that had guards check on each detainee every few minutes
7905736 its simply astounding that it took the government over two years to conclude a so called investigation of three men who died in a small cage under the governments exclusive control the investigation itself is what needs to be investigated along with the people whove perpetrated the disgraceful extra constitutional detentions
7905737 several of the detainees had had a vision in which three of them had to die for the rest to be freed
7905738 they have lost hope in life they have no hope in their eyes they are ghosts and they want to die no food will keep them alive now even with four feeds a day these men get diarrhea from any protein which goes right through them
7905739 said that dinner had come early that evening and that everyone in the block suddenly got tired and had fallen asleep even though it was never quiet in the block at that hour even when the guards left us in peace there was always someone who couldnt fall asleep who wanted to pray or who kept waking up throughout the night
7905740 the metal shutters in front of the windows had also been closed from the outside as if a storm were approaching
7905741 he had been woken up in the middle of the night by a loud bang
7905742 we didnt think that could be true he would have had to attach the noose to the sharp metal lattices with his hands and feet tied and with no chair to stand on that was nearly impossible
7905743 it seemed highly unlikely that the guards would have failed to catch him in time
7905744 they barely let us out of their sight for a minute
7905745 the guards claimed he had covered the walls of his cage so that they hadnt seen him do it but what was he supposed to have used to cover the cage the same sheets with which he allegedly hung himself
7905746 it was not unusual to see blankets hanging in the cells
7905747 and what about the rule prohibiting us from hanging anything on the walls of our cells
7905748 it seemed too much of a coincidence that the other two dead men had hung themselves at exactly the same time in exactly the same way in the same block while all the other inmates had been sleeping like babies when the guards were patrolling the corridors it never took long before other guards came to ensure we were following the rules the guards never took a break since they too were kept under surveillance to ensure that they too were carrying out their duties
7905749 and what about the sharpshooters in the watchtowers hadnt they noticed anything
7905750 didnt seem to have much of a reason for killing himself
7905751 no we prisoners unanimously agreed the men had been killed maybe they had been beaten to death and then strung up or perhaps they had been strangled
7905752 if prisoners died in guant namo it would create trouble for the bush government and they wouldnt have to take part in the war
7905753 throughout our history the words of the declaration have inspired immigrants from around the world to set sail to our shores these immigrants have helped transform 13 small colonies into a great and growing nation of more than 300 people
7905754 while i had tremendous opportunities as a student the students today have even many more
7905755 as a student it seemed like there were many options but now really the options are endless for students who are looking to get into any of our majors
7905756 these days it seems like many students who you meet are doing two or even three majors and a minor on top of it its neat to see that they have those opportunities to combine all of their interests rather than having to choose just one thing that will help prepare them for their career
7905757 its very rare to meet a student who doesnt know where he or she is going after graduation
7905758 all of us who have worked with kathleen know that she brings a high level of energy and creativity to her assignments
7905759 she has led innovative programs to help attract top students to our school including overseeing the direct admission program and coordinating the young womens institute having received her undergraduate degree here will give her a special perspective on the undergraduate experience
7905760 for example there are many more global opportunities such as our taking students to india or our emerging markets trips over spring break
7905761 none of those opportunities were there our students benefit so much from trips like that as well as the classroom learning that accompanies those types of programs
7905762 weve really become a forerunner on the international front and were talking about forming partnerships with other universities beyond the traditional studies abroad programs
7905763 nows the time to go beyond that whether its more of these short term experiences or helping students find an internship abroad and take that area of interest to the next level
7905764 kathleen with her enthusiasm tireless effort and kind disposition will enhance student experiences outside of the classrooms and in the professional development dimension combination of world class staff and her leadership will usher in an era of innovation in student services at the kelley school of business
7905765 on the 12th instant i booked at bombay for madras by the mail train and paid rs 13 9 it was labelled to carry 22 passengers these could only have seating accommodation there were no bunks in this carriage whereon passengers could lie with any degree of safety or comfort there were during this night as many as 35 passengers in the carriage during the greater part of it some lay on the floor in the midst of dirt and some had to keep standing there were two nights to be passed in this train before reaching madras after reaching raichur the pressure became unbearable the rush of passengers could not be stayed the fighters among us found the task almost beyond them the guards or other railway servants came in only to push in more passengers on the way passengers got for tea tannin water with filthy sugar and a whitish looking liquid so called milk which gave this water a muddy appearance i can vouch for the appearance but i cite the testimony of the passengers as to the taste not during the entire journey was the compartment once swept or cleaned the result was that every time you walked on the floor or rather cut your way through the passengers seated on the floor you waded through dirt the closet was also not cleaned during the journey and there was no water in the water tank refreshments sold to the passengers were dirty looking handed by dirtier hands coming out of filthy receptacles and weighed in equally unattractive scales these were previously sampled by millions of flies on reaching the station i found that the ghari wala would not take me unless i paid the fare he wanted i mildly protested and told him i would pay him the authorised fare i had to turn passive resister before i could be taken i simply told him he would have to pull me out of the ghari or call the policeman one of the punjabis had already travelled three nights and was weary and fatigued but he could not stretch himself he said he had sat the whole day at the central station watching passengers giving bribe to procure their tickets another said he had himself to pay rs 5 before he could get his ticket and his seat i have got down at raichur dhond sonepur chakradharpur purulia asansol and other junction stations and been at the mosafirkhanas attached to these stations they are discreditable looking places where there is no order no cleanliness but utter confusion and horrible din and noise passengers have no benches or not enough to sit on they squat on dirty floors and eat dirty food they are permitted to throw the leavings of their food and spit where they like sit how they like and smoke everywhere the closets attached to these places defy description i have not the power adequately to describe them without committing a breach of the laws of decent speech disinfecting powder ashes or disinfecting fluids are unknown the army of flies buzzing about them warns you against their use but a third class traveller is dumb and helpless compare the lot of the first class passengers with that of the third class in the madras case the first class fare is over five times as much as the third class fare does the third class passenger get one fifth even one tenth of the comforts of his first class fellow it is but simple justice to claim that some relative proportion be observed between the cost and comfort
7905766 about 100 protesters were being processed early today at denvers temporary processing center in a former warehouse if the detainees have the resources they could post bond others could end up being taken back to the main jail
7905767 some exquisite mural paintings that adorned tamil nadus temples are lost thanks to neglect and state sponsored vandalism these treasures belonging mostly to the vijayanagar and nayaka periods 14th 17th century have been whitewashed or sandblasted in the name of temple renovation or kumbhabhishekam a consecration ritual officials of the state hindu religious and charitable endowments department have allowed the whitewashing or sandblasting of murals to present a clean surface to devotees claiming that devotees do not like to see faded paintings
7905768 in some cases it is ignorance that has led to the neglect of these works of art soot from oil lamps settle over the murals electrical cables and switchboards are installed over them or cracked ceilings allow water and sunlight to seep in and spoil the murals in what conservationists describe as a classic example of murder of art these paintings are reportedly repainted by signboard artists who merrily use modern poster colours to re create them the state archaeology department use artists unfamiliar with the conservation or restoration of ancient murals to repaint murals found on the ceiling of some temples wth the result that the murals now dazzle in bright colours

7905799 what i would say is that we are always concerned when someone takes his own life because as americans we value life even the lives of violent terrorists who are captured waging war against our country

7905862 kita hanyalah memberikan islam moderat kesempatan yang layak disandangnya dan komunitas internasional mendukung orang orang yang melepaskan diri dari cengkraman kaum radikal dan dari cengkraman kaum ekstrimis

7905939 they were provided covering fire by their colleagues from across the
7905940 the border firing and attempts of infiltration are a matter of concern
7905941 a people betrayed the role of the west in rwandas genocide
7905942 french policy towards rwanda had been largely decided by the former president francois mitterrand during his second term
7905943 there were french officers embedded in the elite rwandan army units who would have known i am sure what was happening the public opening of the mitterrand archives shows that he feared what he called a tutsiland would be created in rwanda and once rwanda was lost to anglophone influence that would be a big blow to french credibility on the continent
7905944 i dont see the release of this report as a sort of tit for tat as part of a diplomatic spat its far too serious for that this is a european army being accused of human rights abuses in africa and i think that it needs careful consideration by international human rights groups
7905945 the documents at the ictr also describe a systematic cover up of the crimes in rwanda by the u s government and un personnel including kofi annan beginning in august 1994 and continuing to present
7905946 the rwandan invasion of the congo has led to a 12 year war in which nearly six million have died although little reference is made to this in u

7905953 subprime mortgage issues remain a key factor in influencing mortgage fraud directly and indirectly the subprime share of outstanding loans has more than a doubled since 2003 putting a greater share of loans at higher risk of failure additionally during 2007 there were more than 2 2 million foreclosure filings reported on approximately 1 29 million properties nationally up 75 percent from 2006 the declining housing market affects many in the mortgage industry who are paid by commission during declining markets mortgage fraud perpetrators may take advantage of industry personnel attempting to generate loans to maintain current standards of living
7905954 that we are having a major speculative splurge as this is written is obvious to anyone not captured by vacuous optimism there is now far more money flowing into the stock markets than there is intelligence to guide it there are many more mutual funds than there are financially acute historically aware men and women to manage them i am not given to prediction ones foresight is forgotten only ones errors are well remembered but there is here a basic recurrent process it comes with rising prices whether of stocks real estate works of art or anything else this increase attracts attention and buyers which produces the further effect of even higher prices expectations are thus justified by the very action that sends prices up the process continues optimism with its market effect is the order of the day prices go up even more then for reasons that will endlessly be debated come the end the descent is always more sudden than the increase a balloon that has been punctured does not deflate in an orderly way to repeat i make no prediction i only observe that this phenomenon has manifested itself many times since 1637 when dutch speculators saw tulip bulbs as their magic road to wealth and 1720 when john law brought presumptive wealth and then sudden poverty to paris through the pursuit of gold to this day undiscovered in louisiana in these years aslso the great south sea bubble spread financial devastation in britain
7905955 through 1925 the pursuit of effortless riches brought people to florida in satisfactorily increasing numbers
7905956 not more than three fourths of a mile from the prosperous and fast growing city of nettie
7905957 this reluctance to concede that the end has come is also in accordance with the classic pattern the end had come in florida in 1925 bank clearings in miami were 1 066 528 000 by 1928 they were down to 143 364 000 farmers who had sold their land at a handsome price and had condemned themselves as it later sold for double treble quadruple the original price now on occasion got it back through a whole chain of subsequent defaults sometimes it was equipped with eloquently named streets and with sidewalks street lamps and taxes and assessments amounting to several times its current value
7905958 he was a director to general motors an ally of the du ponts and soon to be chairman of the democratic national committee by choice of al smith
7905959 the shrewd worldly wise candidate of one of the great political parties chooses one of the outstanding operators in the stock market as a goodwill creator and popular vote getter
7905960 if smith should be elected with a democratic congress we are almost certain to have a resulting business depression in 1929
7905961 the election of hoover and a republican congress should result in continued prosperity for 1929
7905962 there is no cause for worry the high tide of prosperity will continue
7905963 some of those in positions of authority wanted the boom to continue they were making money out of it and they had an intimation of the personal disaster which awaited them when the boom came to an end but there were also some who saw however dimly that a wild speculation was in progress and that something should be done for these people however every proposal to act raised the same intractable problem the consequences of successful action seemed almost as terrible as the consequences of inaction and they could be more horrible for those who took action a bubble can easily be punctured but to incise it with a needle so that it subsides gradually is a task of no small delicacy among those who sensed what was happening in 1929 there was some hope but no confidence that the boom could be made to subside

7905969 but i cant help but feel after the first night of the convention that it was largely a wasted night
7905970 they did a poor job explaining what the choices are
7905971 they are trying to race across the viability threshold before the republicans can say that this man is not ready to be president
7905972 if we want the american people to read this weve got to produce it in a length that theyre comfortable with
7905973 i came from mindanao and i feel so bad about whats happening there
7905974 first of all i think no one wants violence no one wants killing so whatever they want and how its done everything has to be done within the bounds of the constitution we cannot just take the law into our hands and start killing everybody
7905975 i feel sad because for 11 years i was in that area i want to write my brother bishops and also the imam and ulama islamic cleric scholars and leaders as a brother minister
7905976 any disagreement must be settled in a peaceful way pag aralan nang mahusay we should study this very well whatever must be done must be done in a peaceful way
7905977 certainly this is not the way of civilized people most of all people who believe in religion
7905978 the fund will help the families to start again besides this we have already provided them assistance on the evacuation feeding and health assistance
7905979 our same store sales compared to last year headed in a positive direction during the quarter despite depressed consumer confidence and a tougher economy
7905980 challenges in our soft lines were offset by improved performance in our big ticket areas
7905981 these are human beings its our duty to protect the care for them
7905982 i think one of the things that was brought out in these papers is that maybe these warnings arent enough
7905983 maybe the warnings need to be complemented with other things like guidelines
7905984 the rates that those drugs looked like they were increasing was a little bit blunted
7905985 the warnings didnt have i would think the effect that people might have wanted to have seen on the way the drugs are being prescribed
7905986 do you really want to use it all up burning mass amounts of natural gas for a fairly low quality crude that you are going to export to the u s
7905987 injecting propane and butane into the well produces more oil
7905988 making the variables right to actually make money is what we are working on
7905989 one case has been confirmed and two are being tested in the lab
7905990 we have removed a lot of meat products off shelves
7905991 people should just discard the any kind of maple leaf meat products
7905992 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
7905993 all of us are driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
7905994 a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
7905995 mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world theyre the first thing i think about when i wake up in the morning and the last thing i think about when i go to bed at night
7905996 michelle obama has me in tears with her speech at the dnc

7906000 because the root at the base of the hair follicle secretes an infectious serum which oozes out of the glands through the oil sac the serum covers the area around it on the scalp and healthy hair surrounding the white hair turn white within a couple of months if you want to get rid of these few white hair cut them close to the root with a pair of small scissors
7906001 he doesnt understand how come people would want to pay money to him because of something bad happening to him
7906002 the area is quite difficult to get into for foreigners theres a war going on in the area so there are quite a few landmines and there are different factions that are fighting
7906003 one of the relatives of min min is a monk in mae sot and hes able to go back and forth and hes also a very trustworthy person so we may use him as a courier to get the money in and also to get the pictures of the project as it progresses
7906004 there are many things they dont have in that village
7906005 so min min is hoping to provide some opportunities for the children there that he didnt have when he was in the village
7906006 were trying to save our culture and our heritage by working
7906007 im tired of seeing young people in the city with nothing to do with no chance
7906008 littering is a problem in the forest because its so close to a major population
7906009 the first solution is to get into a discussion on what needs to happen we will be talking to these people about what theyve built
7906010 when we do something like this we are putting back
7906011 there is no threat to any of the visitors that are using the park
7906012 what you need is basically a flooding period with a drying period and hot weather with high humidity
7906013 if you meet all those characteristics theres a chance it might happen
7906014 its like a dog you take its food bowl and what does it do it gets angry
7906015 i think that women we have to get away from the politics of victim this is about you go out there and you fight
7906016 i think that what hillary clinton did was tremendous for the country she has kicked open many doors which now we have to bring many more women through millions more women through my being speaker of the house was breaking the marble ceiling in congress which is hard sen clinton had a bigger challenge to run for president of the united states what we have to do now is say we have to translate that not just for individuals but for all women
7906017 the mont st sauveur resorts can be compared to u s ski areas like camelback or wachusett
7906018 they like working in urban markets and have been very successful at it jay peak was their only u s resort property and their only destination
7906019 these arent empty beds in a village and thats how we developed them
7906020 ariel is a silent financial partner we are moving forward very quickly
7906021 we get equity to create jobs investors can place their money in a good business and theres the added attraction of a green card
7906022 we expect to be able to fill our beds not only in winter and summer but in the fall and spring as well not many resorts are in a position to do that
7906023 it was a remarkable voyage to be with him for three days i was a good listener and walters passion for the sport was still very evident
7906024 draw a circle around the resort and you can count upwards of 100 million people from two countries in it montreal is 1 5 hours away and ottawa and boston are only 3 5 hours if the circle goes west of toronto and includes new york to baltimore the market is immense
7906025 with the way the economy is going i think many people will opt out of the dual problem of airline cost and hassle and will drive to new england this winter for their vacations
7906026 the north american market remained static despite another season of positive snow reports and the weakness of the dollar north america may face similar challenges for 2008 9 with capacity constraints on flights and potentially further rises in the cost of transatlantic travel deterring passengers
7906027 it would appear that increases in fuel surcharges are dampening demand for north american ski holidays although its still relatively early days immigration isnt a factor in my view although the new rules may come into play as they become more widely known
7906028 it is very important to realize that most families have already booked their february 2009 half term holidays from our earlybird 08 09 brochure which was launched last december 2007 families choose to get in early to secure the best accommodation and flights suited to them generally at lower prices than our first edition brochure published in the spring some families will have booked in december january for february 2009 before they even travelled on their 2008 february half term holiday
7906029 our strong initial results have fallen back and were running slightly behind last season in like for like sales for north america our european ski sales france switzerland austria are currently 57 percent ahead so we can see a clear pattern emerging
7906030 as i understand it the airlines have seen north american demand softening so id expect tactical offers and discounts to come into play in the autumn which should help to get prices back on track weve now had confirmation that there are some exceptional tactical fares to the u s on sale with canadian fares to follow looking at the new fares were very confident the reductions will re stimulate the market and we expect strong demand from this point on
7906031 on the other hand inghams charter flights are doing well as we fixed our rates to the calgary gateway so this is currently the best option in terms of long haul the resorts served include banff lake louise fernie panorama kicking horse and jasper with the excellent exchange rates canada is great value when you get to the resorts too
7906032 it took off slowly then rocketed in 2000 when the boston globe did a story that launched it to the next level
7906033 i love skiing love mom and pop kind of ski areas lost americana old diners hojos amusement parks that kind of stuff i love to find the before and after look at the process of succession and deterioration its amazing how fast things disappear in new england how quickly the farms grew in and became forest again everywhere you look you can find cellar holes in the middle of the woods
7906034 it has a little section on lost areas in maine i was yes other people like this too
7906035 the site started growing and attracted what i call rabid fans theyre very supportive its amazing how people latched onto it the best thing about that is that when i started i had to do all the research myself now the material just comes to me its amazing how much comes to me its overwhelming but thats a good problem to have
7906036 people started on the site when they were 12 now theyre graduating from college
7906037 thorn had potential to be a great ski area it was the first area in new england that had two chairlifts at once it was way ahead of its time with some really interesting trails
7906038 there are so many reasons high energy costs in the 70s and early 80s high insurance because people got sue happy lack of volunteers for club run areas changing family habits where people dont have as much time impact of divorce on families area owners dying or selling the interstate highway system physically obliterating areas bad weather patterns where it only takes one bad year for an area not to open
7906039 i visited one of the smaller family resorts for the first time last season
7906040 i wish there could be more support for the smaller older areas that are left maybe the big resorts could sponsor smaller ones give them free groomers or something in return for an affiliation as a feeder ski area where people could learn cheaply and work their way up to the bigger mountain there are still a dozen or two dozen in new england that are really small and really fun

7906042 the existing library is a fine building but its outdated its too small
7906043 its time we improve on what we have going to a library you probably can save a lot of money borrowing books movies magazines
7906044 we have roads that people cant drive down without chattering their teeth twenty five million dollars is a lot of money its going to limit what we can do
7906045 si antes no os hablabais ahora ya pod is hacerlo
7906046 these two payments are currently made to two distinct and different groups namely social welfare dependent families and working low earning employees with families
7906047 for this reason amalgamating the two payments is extremely complex and would involve the extension of income testing to a much wider section of families than currently applies
7906048 mohammad i believe was trying to make his way away from the incident and during the course of the incident he has fallen and struck his head on the pavement sustaining serious head injuries
7906049 the questions we need to answer are was he assaulted was he punched or pushed did he fall and try and find the exact circumstances of how it came to be
7906050 clearly much of the investigation will seek to establish to what extent race played a part in what happened to young mohammad
7906051 they are completely in pieces over what has occurred and will be flying back to qatar shortly
7906052 mohammed was a young student who was loved by his family friends and teachers he was a charming loving boy and there is nothing that can replace our loss
7906053 justice has to be done in all this investigation all of those involved in committing this crime should be punished for this crime on a young innocent 16 year old boy

7906085 this study revealed a consistent 20 per cent increase in the risk of type 1 diabetes
7906086 type 1 diabetes occurs when the immune system destroys the insulin producing cells in the pancreas and one theory suggests that being born by caesarean section may affect the development of the immune system because babies are first exposed to bacteria originating from the hospital environment rather than to maternal bacteria
7906087 the study findings are interesting but unless a biological mechanism is established it would be unwise to read too much into this association between caesarean section delivery and diabetes
7906088 fortunately figures from the northern ireland type 1 diabetes register indicate that only around two per 1 000 children will develop diabetes by their 15th birthday so a 20 per cent increase is on quite a low baseline risk
7906089 not all women have the choice of whether to have a caesarean section or not but those who do may wish to take this risk into consideration before choosing to give birth this way
7906090 we already know that genetics and childhood infections play a vital role in the development of type 1 diabetes in children but the findings of this study indicate that the way a baby is delivered could affect how likely it is to develop this condition later in life diabetes uk northern ireland would welcome more research in this area
7906091 our studies in mice showed that we could selectively kill the defective autoimmune cells that were destroying insulin producing islets
7906092 these results show that the same selective destruction can occur in humans cells and connect what we saw in our animal studies with the protocol we are pursuing in our phase i clinical trial
7906093 the fact that these animals dont die and are restored to normal health despite a total lack of insulin is hard for many researchers and clinicians to believe
7906094 many scientists including us thought it would be a waste of time to give leptin in the absence of insulin weve been brainwashed into thinking that insulin is the only substance that can correct the consequences of insulin deficiency
7906095 but if we gave them the leptin gene within two weeks the terminally ill rodents were restored to full health without any other treatment
7906096 my hope is that you could give leptin for one type of action glucagons suppression for example and insulin for another or perhaps give a substance other than insulin entirely
7906097 what would be a tremendous advance would be the ability to give an oral agent that suppresses glucagon without injections
7906098 one of the things that happens when a child gets type 1 diabetes is their growth is stunted until theyre given insulin
7906099 the same is true with these mice however we found that if you take a diabetic rat thats not receiving insulin and make it hyperleptinemic it almost catches up growthwise

7906113 i feel with my previous education experience i have a lot to contribute to the board
7906114 i feel my education background provides a good background for knowing how the system operates
7906115 i think we have a strong school system i care about our kids and our district
7906116 having grown up in elma now being a resident of cresco and having three kids in the school district i think i have a good overall perspective on what we need to continue to do to be successful
7906117 i wanted to be more involved within the school system
7906118 id like to put a standard writing curriculum in to make the students even stronger writers than they are now
7906119 it would be nice if it happens to be part of a group of people that makes decisions well
7906120 to be an asset to the district by being a part of the board
7906121 i like to feel like im doing something for the students in the area and giving back to the community
7906122 all the studies had undergone scientific scrutiny and had all the required regulatory and ethical approvals

7906127 as our friendship grew and i learned more about barack he introduced me to the work hed done when he first moved to chicago after college instead of heading to wall street barack had gone to work in neighborhoods devastated when steel plants shut down and jobs dried up and hed been invited back to speak to people from those neighborhoods about how to rebuild their community the people gathered together that day were ordinary folks doing the best they could to build a good life they were parents living paycheck to paycheck grandparents trying to get by on a fixed income men frustrated that they couldnt support their families after their jobs disappeared those folks werent asking for a handout or a shortcut they were ready to work they wanted to contribute they believed like you and i believe that america should be a place where you can make it if you try

7906135 bioglass is used to help mend broken bones recently researchers working at imperial college discovered a new kind of bioglass which seemed to work better but they could not work out all the details why
7906136 we looked at it through our nmr machine and were amazed by what we saw fluid simulating patients bodies rushed calcium out of the bioglass and then into the new bones it seems perhaps a glass of milk a day really is what the doctor ordered
7906137 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention in denver or the people of colorado

7906143 the data today paint a mixed picture but its clear it will still take some time to work through the downturn in housing
7906144 once housing prices stabilize that will signal a return to a housing industry that can contribute to economic growth
7906145 we understand that disablement activities have been halted temporarily and that north korea has linked the resumption of these activities to the rescission of its designation as a state sponsor of terrorism
7906146 weve informed north korea that we will take action to rescind its designation when it fulfills its commitment regarding verification
7906147 it is clearly a step backward and we will be having discussions with our other partners in the six party talks to see how things play out
7906148 it is a violation of their commitments to the six party framework it certainly is in violation of the principle of action for action
7906149 we actually are in discussions with the north koreans and i think well just see where we come out in a few weeks
7906150 we are awaiting a verification mechanism that could assure the accuracy of north koreas statement or give us a way to verify the accuracy
7906151 antagonizing russia could impact the reliability and prices of supplies
7906152 mid level managers in several polish companies have expressed to us their serious anxiety about the implications of the missile shield deal they know the russian energy supply chain just got a lot more vulnerable
7906153 it would be counter effective for russia from an economic point of view
7906154 on the other hand russia wants to increase its political influence using energy and political issues dominate the economic ones
7906155 russians openly speak about shutting down the friendship pipeline after 2012 due to technical reasons
7906156 we have to be ready to receive supplies only by sea
7906157 this the missile shield deal will certainly not make the negotiations any easier
7906158 in the event that russia uses its oil supplies to put pressure on poland it will provide a test case for the eu as to how far it will go to support poland
7906159 tymoshenko is the arch pragmatist whereas both yanukovich and yushchenkos positions are much more positions of principle i think you have to interpret her silence as an effort to gauge where the swing voters are on this issue
7906160 what this is about is the long term view that to launch a successful presidential bid in ukraine requires you not to make an enemy of russia shes obviously looking back to 2004 and thinking i really dont want to be fighting next years campaign against a headwind from moscow
7906161 only the president has forcefully put his position forward and he has taken this and that measure to complicate relations with russia
7906162 tymoshenko has more or less taken the position not to get directly involved and her priority is to find a peaceful resolution
7906163 the last couple of months in the west she is winning more points as a politician in relation to domestic events and deteriorating relations with the president
7906164 she has attracted more attention from western partners who are increasingly disappointed with yushchenko and she is concentrating more on bringing about reform than he is

7906301 this study revealed a consistent 20 per cent increase in the risk of type 1 diabetes
7906302 type 1 diabetes occurs when the immune system destroys the insulin producing cells in the pancreas and one theory suggests that being born by caesarean section may affect the development of the immune system because babies are first exposed to bacteria originating from the hospital environment rather than to maternal bacteria
7906303 the study findings are interesting but unless a biological mechanism is established it would be unwise to read too much into this association between caesarean section delivery and diabetes
7906304 fortunately figures from the northern ireland type 1 diabetes register indicate that only around two per 1 000 children will develop diabetes by their 15th birthday so a 20 per cent increase is on quite a low baseline risk
7906305 not all women have the choice of whether to have a caesarean section or not but those who do may wish to take this risk into consideration before choosing to give birth this way
7906306 we already know that genetics and childhood infections play a vital role in the development of type 1 diabetes in children but the findings of this study indicate that the way a baby is delivered could affect how likely it is to develop this condition later in life diabetes uk northern ireland would welcome more research in this area

7906309 the average battery chicken walks in a very ungainly way they kind of lurch from side to side when they walk this chicken looks a lot more agile and healthy
7906310 if you took the average chicken from a factory farm and plonked it down in a small households backyard in bangalore it wouldnt be able to run away from a cat or dog if it needed to and it would probably get ill very quickly because its immune system is seriously undermined
7906311 this chicken if a dog was trying to catch it could fly away its sturdier and does very well on scavenging household waste

7906386 i have never had someone inspire me the way people tell me my father inspired them but i do now barack obama
7906387 barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to thats not how he sees the world
7906388 he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation
7906389 even though he had this funny name even though hed grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine
7906390 he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did and like my family they scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them

7906393 the party that once emphasized individual rights has gravitated in recent years toward regulating values
7906394 the party of military responsibility has taken us to war with a country that did not attack us the party that formerly led the world in arms control has moved to undercut treaties crucial to the defense of the earth the party that prides itself on conservation has abdicated its responsibilities in the face of global warming and the party historically anchored in fiscal restraint has nearly doubled the national debt squandering our precious resources in an undisciplined and unprecedented effort to finance a war with tax cuts
7906395 there are going to be some of senator clintons supporters who were going to have to work hard to persuade to come on board thats not surprising
7906396 if you take a look this week i am absolutely convinced that both hillary clinton and bill clinton understand the stakes
7906397 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7906398 we are united and we are together and we are determined
7906399 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message

7906417 this forum will also discuss the teams performance and in particular the issue of funding going forward for 2010
7906418 some of those lessons will be to look at what other countries are doing right the outcome of the consultation will be to produce a working model that will not only take us through to 2012 but beyond
7906419 its a multi stakeholder issue we realise that to be a world beater we have to work together with government schools and experts and energise the country around what needs to be done
7906420 a strong desire to see sport succeed in the country
7906421 people should note that we have a number of newcomers between 18 and 25 of age and the experience they are gaining here will make them better for the next games
7906422 we must underline the point that the majority of the team was very young and almost two thirds of the team were first time olympians
7906423 our athletes have done south africa proud and i am satisfied that this team gave of their best
7906424 as for the money im going to blow the money
7906425 im very happy because i made my country proud i went to the games hoping to get any medal whether it was a bronze silver or gold i just wanted to do well

7906452 our performance in li ge was poor but the result was good we did not concede an away goal and we hope that playing the second leg at anfield will make a massive difference
7906453 the entire team did not play well they li ge were organised pressed well and were very aggressive
7906454 football is about winning it does not matter how well you play so long as you come off the pitch having picked up the points
7906455 when you do not play as well as you know you can but you are still getting results then that is a sign of a good team we have got two wins out of two in the league and that is all you can ask for now we will look ahead to the champions league game against li ge and we know how important it is to make sure we get into the group stages i am looking forward to being able to play here on a european night
7906456 we did not play well in li ge and we know we will have to improve at anfield everyone knows how important it is for our season to get into the group stage it would be unthinkable for us not to be in the champions league as players we expect to be there and so do the fans we know all the pressure is on us

7906534 perhaps more importantly given the central role of the bible for protestantism this new trend meant that the bible tended to be read through the prism of confessions statements of faith that frequently influenced and sometimes determined how certain passages of the bible were to be interpreted this shift was a contributing factor to the rise of proof texting citing isolated decontextualized verses of the bible in support of often controversial confessional positions paradoxically this development actually lessened the influence of the bible within prostestantism in that biblical statements were accommodated to existing doctrinal frameworks rather than being allowed to determine them and even to challenge them

7906827 the black sea is just a small pool for their arms with the range of 2 500 kilometers
7906828 the actions of russian troops in the conflict zone are directed at the unconditional fulfillment of the obligations that were made and thats why the excessive level of activity of nato naval forces in the black sea that continues to increase its groupings in the area is a cause for bewilderment

7906843 auch im rahmen der nato m chte ich den gespr chsfaden mit moskau nicht abrei en lassen
7906844 ich bedauere die entscheidung des russischen pr sidenten dmitri medwedew s dossetien und abchasien anzuerkennen
7906845 dieser schritt ber hrt die territoriale unversehrtheit eines souver nen nachbarstaates das ist f r uns nicht akzeptabel die l sung der konflikte in abchasien und s dossetien wird dadurch noch schwieriger
7906846 das ist eine verh hnung der opfer und aller leidtragenden

7906848 there may be parts of the speech that arent going to get a lot of applause but ive got to say what i believe will get out country back on the right path
7906849 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it tonight i promise you that
7906850 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
7906851 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7906852 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7906853 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7906854 to discuss ways in which his foundation is addressing some of the worlds most pressing problems

7906859 im not aiming for a lot of high rhetoric im much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families live their lives
7906860 people know that i can give the kind of speech that i gave four years ago thats not the question on voters mind i think theyre much more interested in what am i going to do to help them in their lives
7906861 and so in that sense this is going to be a more workman like speech
7906862 you know 2004 i think was unique nobody knew who i was and i think even up to the time that i walked onto the stage and we had handed out obama signs people were thinking what is this
7906863 i dont think you can duplicate that kind of moment
7906864 i think its fair to say that had it not been for not just for the speech but the movement behind the speech the sentiments behind the speech the work and toil and the risks that were taken by previous generations then i wouldnt be in denver on thursday accepting the nomination for the presidency
7906865 we understand that disablement activities have been halted temporarily and that north korea has linked the resumption of these activities to the rescission of its designation as a state sponsor of terrorism
7906866 weve informed north korea that we will take action to rescind its designation when it fulfills its commitment regarding verification
7906867 it is clearly a step backward and we will be having discussions with our other partners in the six party talks to see how things play out
7906868 it is a violation of their commitments to the six party framework it certainly is in violation of the principle of action for action
7906869 we actually are in discussions with the north koreans and i think well just see where we come out in a few weeks

7906897 she said neither wells nor kittery is an approved configuration
7906898 in kitterys case they cannot be approved as they are because of the way the law is written
7906899 they have fewer than 1 200 students in the case of wells they have over 1 200 students but fewer then 2 500 the commissioner was not sufficiently convinced theyd be able to sustain the educational component
7906900 theyd probably keep separate school bus depots because of the distance but there are other areas

7906924 we expect the population of russia to shrink by 32 million people to about 110 million that means russia will lose about a quarter of its population to sustain its economy russia increasingly will have to look elsewhere for workers some of them will be immigrant russians coming from the former soviet states what the russians call the near abroad but there arent enough of them to make up that population loss others will be chinese and non russians from the caucasus central asia and elsewhere potentially aggravating russias already uneasy racial and religious tensions

7907022 i read the newspaper and i realized the investigation into the accusations of these two dogs might entail breed profiling as they were a pit bull and a mixed breed
7907023 i think these two dogs are wrongfully accused and i think if we determine the owner we can find alibi witnesses for both of them
7907024 were going to make a pitch perhaps file a so called emotion to see whether the dogs should be put to sleep
7907025 we are holding them as we would any other stray animal for potential reclaim by an owner
7907026 or that they were taking very good care of themselves
7907027 as i explained to mr chacon i am not adverse to someone adopting these animals and trying to rehabilitate them if in fact they can demonstrate that they have the proper facilities to make sure that these animals dont become a threat to any other animals in the community or to human beings
7907028 if they had any id we would hold them for six days but they didnt have any id microchips or tags
7907029 we have 20 000 animals a year that come through this facility and the majority of them are euthenized because nobody wants to adopt them

7907047 the global distribution of the highly pathogenic h5n1 avian influenza has caused the world health organization to show its profound concern regarding the possibility of the virus spreading from human to human in the future
7907048 furthermore the development of resistance to two approved anti influenza drugs oseltamivir tamiflu r and zanamivir relenza r as well as the lack of adequate vaccines has increased the need of developing new antiviral drugs
7907049 consequently i am delighted to be involved in the preclinical research stage of this innovative antiviral candidate and look forward to continuing our successful collaboration with canopus biopharma in this area

7907064 thats what theyre going to step into thats the advantage of it our economy everything in the nation and the world is very diverse so its just training
7907065 its not that theyre not staying in school its that when you look at the basic achievement indicators on average hispanic public school students are well behind their white peers in both math and reading
7907066 theyre behind in elementary school and the gap slightly widens when they get into middle school and it widens slightly further by high school

7907079 our research disputes a major pillar holding up the long held assumption that homo sapiens were more advanced than neanderthals
7907080 it is time for archaeologists to start searching for other reasons why neanderthals became extinct while our ancestors survived
7907081 technologically speaking there is no clear advantage of one tool over the other
7907082 colonising a continent isnt easy colonising a continent during the ice age is even harder so for early homo sapiens colonising ice age europe a new shared and flashy looking technology might serve as one form of social glue by which larger social networks were bonded
7907083 thus during hard times these larger social networks might act like a type of life insurance ensuring exchange and trade among members of the same team

7907101 allow expanded oil exploration and extraction in the santa barbara county region
7907102 we didnt need the revenues property values were such that we were paying our own bills we didnt need the jobs employment was very sound but the threat to the tourist industry if we were going to have sticky beaches that would be a disaster
7907103 technology has preempted that last argument we do need the jobs we do need the money we do need the oil
7907104 by gradually and sensitively expanding offshore exploration and drilling the estimated revenue to the county runs in many millions of dollars
7907105 santa barbara city has been anti oil for 40 years and is still anti oil
7907106 why should we be opening up brand new areas when there are already leases the oil companies are sitting on
7907107 is a short sighted limited symbolic vote that would be in keeping with the whole confusion on the national level that we can drill our way out of this and that its the panacea
7907108 maybe theres an argument that if you expand offshore oil production you reduce the seeps and reduce marine pollution and provide california with more energy and the tax revenues to pay for the transition to solar energy and electric vehicles
7907109 if they are there then that is what the plan would be

7907113 there was input from different parts of the community including the unions and residents
7907114 they told us that we needed somebody from outside the district in order to take these calls initially
7907115 that connections going to be very important for the caller to follow up with the call otherwise it will hamper the investigation
7907116 well get a report every month and well be able to track where things are
7907117 pat tydings really spearheaded it and sought our input which is all were asking for and he did it which is a great example of how things should be
7907118 i dont think we see any evidence of retribution now certainly not like what we saw in former superintendent steve walts days but i think for some folks the fear of it will hold them back a little bit
7907119 will it help members i guess that remains to be seen
7907120 ss spanking rocks any male dominated sexual activity rocks in my book something about feeling a man in that authoritative way is such a turn on though i did date a guy that liked to be choked when i rode him ham that rocked too
7907121 its always unexpected so when it happens in the heat of the moment it just adds to the excitement you dont have to beat a girl nothing like a lil tap of that ss ooh yeah and pull my hair too while your at it
7907122 it has something to do with not having as much control over themselves as they usually do and there is a certain level of danger that brings excitement into the fray
7907123 its kind of a turn on for me the man being in control is sexy not a full on spanking but an occasional slap on the ss ooooh sh t that does something for me it tells me that he loves my ss and that he wants to get this ss and i am more than happy to give it to him i love this blog you are the bomb boo
7907124 i liked to be dominated by my man in bed i carry out all my wifely duties and keep it tight so at night time then i can be his little slu and he can pull my hair do anything he wants with me
7907125 it hurts good the sting mixed with the pleasureable things going on between my thighs turns me on even more
7907126 there will be some starters that wont play at all others that will play based on the snaps they have received to date
7907127 there are others like deuce mcallister mike mckenzie jeremy shockey and josh bullocks that we will want to give snaps to and then theres another group of guys that wont play at all in this game
7907128 i thought defensively we did a good job in our third down situations
7907129 i thought we tackled well helped up against the run early i though our effort to the ball and pursuit went well there werent many big plays it was a big improvement from the week before and thats encouraging offensively although we moved the ball there were situations that were somewhat frustrating we had a turnover a couple of drops and a couple of field goals i thought the kicking game was solid i thought we played with good energy and that was noticeable
7907130 ive been at a few other teams where in this game there have been players that have done something very well and merited making the team yo answer your question the evaluation isnt over it will basically end when the game ends thursday night and then its time for us to get our roster down as best we can were trying to gather all the information we have on these player and give them the fairest opportunity to make this team
7907131 in his first start he did a pretty good job were not at week 1 yet so i dont know if he will start we still have time
7907132 you want them to play well and i thought they were vastly improved
7907133 each week once we get into the regular season well have a set of base and nickel pressures based on the opponent
7907134 they key is to not be as predictable and to have flexibility i thought we did a good job of executing the pressures i liked the tackling on their ground where the ball was thrown near the sticks and we got them off the field
7907135 i wouldnt want to elaborate whether a player is d safe or whether hes involved in discussions but were evaluating all of our players for this final roster
7907136 jason has quick feet he gets to the ball quickly hes someone who can transition to cover real well those are some of the things that he can do well he keeps working with technique but specifically his transition and ball skills are good
7907137 i think the decision on who plays and who doesnt is based on how much work these guys have gotten or not gotten when you talk about the front line guys
7907138 it kind of gets annoying we didnt win a ring off of
7907139 probably a lot of the big schools are tired of hearing about and appalachian state
7907140 in my mind i think lsu probably one of those schools theyre tired of hearing about these guys a i aa school i think well have to play as close to our peak as we can for an opening game

7907147 a call to arms to researchers educators policy makers and others concerned with these issues to understand how youth think about credibility in the digital media environment and to devise a plan to assist youth in finding and evaluating the information they need
7907148 perhaps the most consistent theme across all these stakeholders is that digital technologies complicate traditional notions of hierarchies and authority structures
7907149 meaningful access to digital information resources and systems in schools is about much more than a physical connection to the internet digital natives are not necessarily skilled or critical consumers of digital information many are still novices when it comes to searching selecting and assessing the meaning and value of the information they find
7907150 just like libraries used to produce pathfinders and annotated bibliographies users will soon be able to find a piece of information such as a web site and follow that information to all of the other public information used in a given conversation

7907156 the single most important event that happened at the dnc
7907157 has faced questions about the banks multi million dollar loans to michael gioranago a convicted bookmaker and prostitution ring promoter
7907158 is concerned by revelations that the bank owned by illinois democratic treasurer nominee alexi giannoulias family gave loans to a chicago crime figure and said the candidate owes him and the public a full accounting
7907159 newly discovered public records show broadway bank made 11 8 million in additional mortgage loans to giorango just last year giannoulias said he oversaw the servicing of those loans
7907160 was gunned down in an execution style slaying after selling the gambling fleet to a group that included indicted washington lobbyist jack abramoff
7907161 giannoulias is so tainted by reputed mob links that several top illinois dems including the states speaker of the house and party chairman refused to endorse him even after he won the democratic nomination with obamas help
7907162 j ust why did sen obama last week endorse for illinois treasurer an unknown 29 year old whose financial experience is limited to working at a family owned chicago bank and who as recently as five years ago was shooting professional hoops as point guard with team panionios of athens greece
7907163 consumer purchasing power can make a difference by supporting those fisheries and fish farms that are better for the environment while at the same time relieving pressure on others that are not doing as well

7907167 we suffer with not one but two blinding diseases river blindness onchocerciasis and trachoma
7907168 in many places such as in west africa river blindness has been completely eradicated
7907169 but the years of war have meant that its not been possible to do that in south sudan
7907170 we just dont have the surgeons or the clinical officers
7907171 the problem in south sudan is not only disease itself its the problem of how to build the capacity of the local people to help them cater for their own people
7907172 we work hard but we survive on our own without funding
7907173 these are too expensive each is about three dollars and we cannot even get the papers we need for writing braille for our educational programme

7907179 for the avoidance of doubt the only person who can officially open parliament will be determined by the outcome of the on going dialogue
7907180 we will not attend we dont expect any member of the executive to address us until that dialogue has been concluded

7907184 then the world of the twenty first century is the world of the one way mirror the world of the all seeing eye
7907185 obviously if youre a terrorist privacy is enormously important so the more we think of privacy as endangering us that will reinforce these commercial incentives to surrender privacy
7907186 why isnt there a law against this why isnt the government protecting me from every possible negative occurrence i might get myself into

7907188 saben los representantes del r gimen que nosotros contamos con una tica distinta a la de ellos jam s hemos actuado sin que sea una justa respuesta por lo que m s adecuado ser a que no se siga actuando como lo est n haciendo en contra de los ciudadanos y sobre todo con los luchadores sociales
7907189 que el gobierno del ileg timo felipe calder n hinojosa los presente de inmediato e informe a los medios de comunicaci n a las organizaciones no gubernamentales de derechos humanos a las organizaciones sociales y pol ticas de oposici n y al pueblo en general el estado f sico y ps quico en que est n y el lugar en donde se encuentran detenidos nuestros militantes
7907190 jam s ha sido f cil enfrentar una detenci n de compa eros para la familia y amigos menos para la estructura a la que pertenec an los detenidos por lo que el comit del valle de m xico conciente de lo que esto significa se pone a la disposici n de la direcci n de nuestro partido para realizar las actividades que determinen
7907191 estos son los rostros de nuestros compa eros raymundo rivera bravo y edmundo reyes amaya detenidos desaparecidos por las fuerzas represivas del estado mexicano el 25 de mayo del a o en curso cuyo secuestro e ilegal detenci n sigue siendo negada por las distintas autoridades de los diferentes niveles el r gimen encabezado por el ileg timo felipe calder n est develando su verdadero rostro el rostro del fascismo
7907192 desde la frontera norte hasta la frontera sur de nuestra patria encontramos ejemplos lamentables como estos no s lo en las d cadas mencionadas sino en los m s recientes per odos de gobierno incluyendo el de fox y ahora el de felipe calder n sin que hasta ahora los pasados y actuales gobernantes primero del pri y ahora del pan se hayan preocupado por esclarecer presentar y liberar a los cientos de desaparecidos por razones pol ticas cu ntos delincuentes organizados son protegidos por los representantes del poder estatal o federal en turno es por esto que nuestro comit estatal se une a la demanda y exigencia de presentaci n con vida de nuestros compa eros y de todos los presos y desaparecidos pol ticos que se encuentran en alg n centro de reclusi n y de tortura clandestino de los que el estado niega tener y que todos los luchadores sociales sabemos existen en todo el territorio nacional igualmente exhortamos a todo el explotado y oprimido a continuar con la organizaci n difusi n y defensa de las demandas m s sentidas de nuestro pueblo
7907193 cu ntos a os han pasado y cu ntos pasar n esto ltimo no lo sabemos lo que s sabemos es que por muchos a os que pasen a nuestros seres queridos no los olvidaremos jam s nuestros desaparecidos asesinados y presos desde la ya para unos lejana d cada de los 70 para nosotros parece que fue ayer es por eso que ahora que dos m s de nuestros compa eros de lucha se encuentran desaparecidos sentimos c mo nuestros corazones se estremecen al recordar aquella d cada y su guerra sucia nuestro pueblo de guerrero se une a la condena de la desaparici n forzada de los luchadores sociales en el territorio nacional por lo que exigimos al gobierno de ulises ruiz gobernador repudiado por el pueblo de oaxaca y al usurpador de la presidencia de la rep blica mexicana felipe calder n hinojosa presenten de manera inmediata a todos los luchadores sociales que se encuentran en las c rceles clandestinas y cuarteles militares
7907194 ante la detenci n de nuestros militantes en oaxaca informamos al comit central que las estructuras del partido y ej rcito en nuestro estado nos encontramos agrupados como la circunstancia lo amerita y cada uno de los militantes y combatientes con la disposici n a recibir rdenes para actuar como se nos indique por lo que solicitamos a nuestras m ximas instancias de partido y ej rcito que determinen ya como proceder
7907195 informamos a nuestro pueblo al bur pol tico y al comit central que dadas las circunstancias se ha hecho el recuento de fuerzas y cada compa ero y estructura se encuentra ocupando su lugar correspondiente conscientes de que este momento demanda una estricta disciplina como producto de las convicciones revolucionarias nos reportamos en completa disposici n a las rdenes que dispongan la comandancia general y el comit central dispuestos a asumir los retos que demande la presente etapa de lucha a nuestro pueblo le preguntamos qu hacer ante la euforia de ultraderecha ante la ofensiva policiaco militar resistencia organizada combinando todas las formas de lucha o resignaci n poniendo la otra mejilla
7907196 el comit estatal del pdpr epr del estado de chiapas manifiesta que con el pretexto del combate a la delincuencia organizada y narcotr fico el gobierno de la ultraderecha representada por felipe calder n hinojosa intenta contener toda manifestaci n de oposici n a su r gimen mediante acciones fascistas asesoradas por las diferentes estructuras de inteligencia extranjeras representadas por los gobiernos m s sanguinarios de este siglo entre ellos el norteamericano el espa ol y el israel demandamos enf ticamente del comit central y bur pol tico que tome en sus manos directamente el caso de oaxaca y que determinen las decisiones correspondientes porque la militancia como dice la consigna estamos presentes y resueltos a vencer consideramos que el deber de todo militante de todo revolucionario es identificarnos en la acci n como producto de las convicciones ideol gicas son tiempo de unidad tanto en el terreno revolucionario como en la lucha popular
7907197 informamos a nuestro comit central que una vez m s cumpliremos cualquier tarea que nos demande sin importar que este gobierno para castigarnos impunemente nos llame criminales o terroristas de manera infame sin que lo seamos para justificar el terrorismo de estado que prevalece en nuestro pa s
7907198 los compa eros aprehendidos que siguen siendo torturados fueron a causa de un se alamiento aclaramos la fuerza est en la prudencia todo lo hemos resuelto privilegiando soluciones pol ticas pero tambi n el pueblo nos ha dado el derecho de la autodefensa por lo tanto podr amos cambiar de t ctica y si en esta t ctica de autodefensa la hacemos como tales agotando la soluci n pol tica y dando otro paso
7907199 hemos recibido de todos nuestros comit s estatales y regionales la disposici n de recibir rdenes por lo que se ordena a todo militante y combatiente a concentrarse a sus unidades correspondientes y mantenerse en alerta general quien no lo haga ser tomado como un desertor

7907255 it appears that sales of agricultural commodities produced and sold by farmers in china such as wheat cotton and corn are exempted from the vat

7907270 i got a letter from the commissioner aug 11 strongly encouraging us to consider forming a regional school unit rsu or an alternative organizational structure aos with kittery
7907271 she said neither wells nor kittery is an approved configuration
7907272 in kitterys case they cannot be approved as they are because of the way the law is written
7907273 they have fewer than 1 200 students in the case of wells they have over 1 200 students but fewer then 2 500 the commissioner was not sufficiently convinced theyd be able to sustain the educational component
7907274 theyd probably keep separate school bus depots because of the distance but there are other areas

7907317 i have a real love hate relationship with ebay ive learned that its extremely difficult to conduct business in circumstances where the rules are always changing
7907318 my shipping is at 4 7 which i am very happy with the problem is going to come in when buyers who usually do not have as good of an understanding of how shipping really works downgrade me because of shipping costs many consumers dont realize that shipping a 250 pound engine from ohio to california just cant be done for fifty dollars
7907319 we do deliver a lot of our own freight simply because this saves our customers money
7907320 the product i sell is unique enough that i believe that i will continue to do well in best match searches but with the burden of so many changes being put on sellers this is just another issue that hinders your ability to keep things business as usual on ebay
7907321 we looked at a number of alternative selling sites but felt none were big enough even craigslist was unsuitable for our business despite the traffic it gets
7907322 wigix customer service is excellent and they are in a position where they can assist sellers regardless of their need for my own listings i required some very specific categories and they had no problem with working one on one to meet my needs
7907323 you have to look at the overall investment and most people who claim to know such things will tell you not to put all your investment into one stock thats the road too that we are going to take with tunerjunkyard com were going to spread it out a bit and consider the more viable selling channels like wigix rather than leaving all of our stock in ebay so to speak

7907328 the cane toads cannot survive in much of southern australia because they would be too cold to move about and forage or spawn
7907329 we found that cane toads can barely hop once they get below about 15 degrees celsius
7907330 their range would also be constrained by the limited availability of water for their tadpoles in some parts of australia
7907331 these are perfect conditions for growing wine but you are unlikely to meet a toad at a winery
7907332 our study is particularly helpful in predicting where cane toads could live under climate change because we have identified a cause and effect way that climate limits the toads
7907333 in one way it is obvious why dry conditions are bad for frogs they lose too much water
7907334 but having wet skin also provides frogs with a thermal challenge because the evaporating water takes heat away from their bodies and often makes them colder than the air

7907368 an increase in water temperature of just a couple degrees celsius results in visible damage to adult corals and their offspring
7907369 corals are most vulnerable when they are very small and our protected nursery will help them to get through the first critical days
7907370 poachers often collect wild corals to satisfy the demand for aquariums but aquarium professionals are looking for alternative less destructive sources of these animals secores goal is to develop methods to eventually breed corals in captivity thereby reducing some of the pressure to collect corals from the wild
7907371 we are starting by raising juveniles from wild caught eggs and sperm which enables us to provide aquariums with the corals they desire without damaging wild adult colonies in return the aquarium operators help us to perform the experiments and give us tips on how to raise adult corals in captivity which is something they are very good at
7907372 a device that measures cancer specific gases in exhaled breath would change medical research as we know it
7907373 improved methods to detect molecules have been demonstrated and more people need to be using these methods to detect molecules given off from cancer we have developed laser based methods to detect molecules mid infrared lasers can measure suspected cancer biomarkers ethane formaldehyde and acetaldehyde
7907374 you often have to go outside your discipline to pioneer new areas of research and oklahoma has an advantage with so many experts in other fields but getting funding for interdisciplinary research is challenging however more capital and research infrastructure are needed for this device to become a reality as we build upon our existing capabilities oklahoma can become more widely known as a center of excellence in this important area
7907375 the study results show that current australian guidelines for prescribing antibiotics for pneumonia are appropriate dr charles said
7907376 it shows that australian doctors should resist the push which is occurring in some parts of the world particularly the us to prescribe broad spectrum antibiotics to treat essentially all possible causes
7907377 the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens is one of the biggest threats to australian health care standards and is closely linked to the inappropriate use of antibiotics dr charles said
7907378 by continuing to use more traditional antibiotics to treat most cases of pneumonia australian doctors can limit or delay the emergence of more resistant strains of bacteria
7907379 by using the broad spectrum antibiotics less often we can also prolong the effective lifespan of these drugs

7907381 this lidar will serve as a reference for future or existing systems especially since this kind of remote sensing is experiencing rapid development
7907382 the research found this noninvasive method of cardiac imaging will effectively detect stenosis a constriction or narrowing of the coronary arteries which can lead to heart attacks and may require surgery to repair
7907383 this is good news for patients who in the past might have been forced to undergo a more expensive and invasive procedure to determine if they suffered from blockages in the arteries leading to their hearts
7907384 we know from previous research that the uninsured have poor outcomes on a number of measures and they are less likely to seek care when they need it
7907385 but we know less about what actually happens when the uninsured try to obtain health care in various settings and more specifically how institutions deal with these patients
7907386 we found that the public institution was the most open to seeing patients in a variety of settings by contrast the for profit institution would really only see patients in the emergency department
7907387 the for profit basically took its losses and seemed to say well just see these folks in the emergency department we wont work too hard to get money from them and so be it
7907388 and not surprisingly the not for profit fell in between
7907389 the eastern portion of the fault has moved at a predictable rate and the earthquake activity associated with it has been what we would expect
7907390 but the western part of the fault has been lagging in terms of the number and size of earthquakes it seems to be straining absorbing the motion
7907391 it could mean that the fault is getting ready for a large earthquake or it could mean that the movement has been so gradual that we couldnt detect it
7907392 land stations also detected a four fold increase in the number of earthquakes along the blanco fault in 2008 compared to background rates
7907393 our monitoring may be missing a lot of earthquakes that are less than 3 0
7907394 the western side of the fault may be experiencing a series of mini quakes that we cant detect or it could be slowing creeping along in a way we cannot measure
7907395 but we cant discount the possibility that its energy hasnt been released and it will some day in the form of a good sized earthquake

7907401 i wouldnt be walking tomorrow if i spilled those beans but im psyched especially about the wardrobe
7907402 it gives us a little bit of history of the cullen family they are just shooting a couple of different added scenes and the scene im in i can tell you its me and robert pattinson rosalie and emmett are in that scene
7907403 well i am going to be in the prom scene now at the very end of the film

7907417 republicans who are thinking about holding their nose and voting for mccain out of fear of obama are going to experience their worst fears anyway
7907418 mccain will govern much like obama for four years be a one term president and leave us in 2012 with a democratic president probably obama or possibly hillary clinton
7907419 id say we still have to be careful with him and make sure hes ready to go in the regular season

7907424 the direct market caters primarily to a closed network of 25 35 year old men whove been reading marvel and dc comics for over a decade and have next to no interest in buying anything that doesnt cater to their narrow set of interests you can occassionally snag a moderate number of readers by producing work that grabs them by the fanboy short hairs vampires zombies and licensed versions of characters or creative works that they fondly remember from childhood are usually required but anything else is slow death where money is concerned treat the direct market as though it were a healthy diverse and dependable sales environment and you might as well be jumping off a cliff

7907428 i know that the cost of college continues to rise faster than inflation costs more than a loaded luxury car and petrifies college bound students of modest means

7907436 theres not a line that goes here that rhymes with anything
7907437 air strikes on civilian targets uncoordinated house searches and illegal detention of afghan civilians
7907438 found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men fifteen other villagers were wounded
7907439 the destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with seven to eight houses having been destroyed with serious damage to many others
7907440 local residents were able to confirm the number of casualties including names age and gender of the victims
7907441 this is matter of grave concern to the united nations i have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations
7907442 the impact of such operations undermines the trust and confidence of the afghan people in efforts to build a just peaceful and law abiding state
7907443 repeatedly discussed the issue of civilian casualties with the international forces and asked for all air raids on civilian targets especially in afghan villages to be stopped
7907444 the issues of uncoordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of afghanistan which has been shared with the commanders of international forces in afghanistan
7907445 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here
7907446 and nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7907447 to stand with you to change america to restore its future to rise to our best ideals and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7907448 i have never had someone inspire me the way people tell me my father inspired them but i do now barack obama
7907449 and i know someone else whos been inspired all over again by senator obama in our family hes known as uncle teddy more than any senator of his generation or perhaps any generation teddy has made life better for people in this country and around the world
7907450 for 46 years he has been so much more than just a senator for the people of massachusetts hes been a senator for all who believe in a dream thats never died
7907451 john mccain has spent more than 25 years in washington voting against womens freedom
7907452 and has pledged to appoint justices to the supreme court who will overturn roe v wade
7907453 republicans say john mccain has experience we say john mccain has the experience of being wrong
7907454 an eternal optimist who understood that parents are our first and best teachers
7907455 barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation
7907456 about the only guy who seems to have done really well these last eight years
7907457 is a guy with a private jet and so many homes that he loses count
7907458 the problem for any of them might be getting a word in edgewise
7907459 let me state what i think about their tactics and these ads
7907460 im hillary rodham clinton and i do not approve of that message
7907461 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
7907462 barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to thats not how he sees the world he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree
7907463 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7907464 put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7907465 barack obama will close the book on the old politics of race and gender of group against group of straight against gay
7907466 we say john mccain has the experience of being wrong
7907467 dont know much about industry really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7907468 i just want to make it absolutely clear we cannot afford four more years of george w bushs failed policies in america and thats what we would get with john mccain
7907469 there is no stronger surrogate for sen obama than sen clinton
7907470 it may take a little time for some people to come around
7907471 bill clinton knows a little bit about trying to yank an economy out of the doldrums and helping middle class families and it wouldnt make much sense for me to want to edit his remarks to prevent him from making a strong case about why we need fundamental economic change in this country
7907472 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here

7907476 we know which employee took the server and sold it but we believe it was an honest mistake and it was not intentional to sell it without the server being cleared
7907477 this case is just a bit of a close shave although it is hardly isolated
7907478 unless youve been particularly careless with your personal details the bank will always cover the cost of any fraudulent activity on your account
7907479 of course people still suffer potential damage to their credit records which can be annoying not just in terms of the cost of phone calls or time spent sorting out the problem to the individual but it may also hold up applications for credit like a mortgage for example

7907495 at least part of the explosive dollar rebound over recent weeks
7907496 i think it is important that canadians understand what is on our agenda and what is not on our agenda
7907497 what is on our agenda is being tough on crime and punishing criminals and what is not on our agenda is re opening a debate on abortion that clarity i think is helpful for canadians especially as we go into a period where they might be forced to make a choice

7907507 in the last number of years there have unfortunately been far too many deaths where montreal police have been involved
7907508 in none of these cases has any real information circulated
7907509 the families in almost all complain that the system seems designed to keep things hidden and freeze them out so they do not know whats happened to their deceased love ones
7907510 the public does not have confidence in the system in almost every case no charges have been proffered by the crown against any police officer and the circumstances are not well explained
7907511 a lot of the sights and sounds i did take directly from ndg and westmount and i was really happy to do that

7907626 i have i have felt it both ways to be honest with you i have felt a good flow and then last week lets face it we played a very good defense its a playoff caliber team so they were able to do some stuff against us pretty well to be able to make adjustments down there on the field to be able to make adjustments at half thats one of the things i thought we did the best was that we did make an adjustment when we came out at half we had a chance to finish the drive with a touchdown we ended up dropping a pass that would have put us on the five but we got points and moved the ball those are some of the things we will continue to work with
7907627 were not going to say we were the official difference maker
7907628 but they let us know after the trade was off that they took that into consideration

7907633 i believe in my fellow citizens our headlines are splashed with crime yet for every criminal there are 10 000 honest decent kindly men if it were not so no child would live to grow up business could not go on from day to day decency is not news it is buried in the obituaries but it is a force stronger than crime
7907634 i believe in the patient gallantry of nurses in the tedious sacrifices of teachers i believe in the unseen and unending fight against desperate odds that goes on quietly in almost every home in the land
7907635 i believe in the honest craft of workmen take a look around you there never were enough bosses to check up on all that work from independence hall to the grand coulee dam these things were built level and square by craftsmen who were honest in their bones
7907636 i believe that almost all politicians are honest for every bribed alderman there are hundreds of politicians low paid or not paid at all doing their level best without thanks or glory to make our system work if this were not true we would never have gotten past the thirteen colonies

7907639 in each we put a name local address and phone number family pictures receipts and 50 in cash we dropped 120 wallets ten each in three large cities three major suburban areas three medium cities and three small towns we left them in parking lots malls bus stops and on sidewalks then we waited to see what would happen to each person who returned the wallet we offered the 50 as a reward this was no rigorous scientific study but rather a real life test of integrity would people in small towns return the wallets more often than those in big cities old folks more than young women more than men
7907640 even those who kept the wallets still had a conscience judging by the furtive glances and the attempts at concealment many of them made as they left the scene

7907642 while voters lapped up the sheriffs harsh approach to inmates in his jails from forcing them to wear pink underwear to feeding them oxidized green bologna to working them in chain gangs to housing inmates in tents new times writers pointed out that the cruelty and violence in arpaios lockups prompted amnesty internationals first investigation in america and people continued to die under arpaios care crippled people blind people people out of their minds local attorney michael manning has collected nearly 20 million in damages from the county over inmates killed in arpaios custody when arpaio stood yet again for election in 2004 new times relationship with the sheriff was 12 years old sheriff arpaio hid nearly 790 000 in cold hard cash in three real estate investments that former new times staff writer john dougherty discovered in july 2004 in the middle of a heated primary election arpaio stashed an indeterminate amount of cash in another six parcels of commercial and residential real estate with more than a million dollars invested how could there not be questions columnist dougherty wondered how a public servant surviving on a 78 000 sheriffs salary and a government retirement check could afford such an investment portfolio it was not a pointless query in 12 years overseeing at the time a 140 million law enforcement empire arpaio had never suffered a thorough audit by the county perhaps the sheriff inherited a fortune from a distant relative a paper trail that should have been public would have reassured voters but the normal public real estate records maintained by the government were not available when it came to sheriff arpaio he used an arcane statute meant to conceal home addresses of law enforcement officials to shield his investments

7907790 cad is drawing based and manages data as drawing files or a set of drawing files the set of drawing files can be a set of map tiles that share a common coordinatesystem but are physically disjointed the main product of a cad system is a papermap

7907794 gis scales from one person to hundreds with no changes in the system interface
7907795 gis can use cad data without conversion arcgis for example can display cad data in dgn dwf and dwg files directly and in the same map display asgis layers arcgis symbolizes cad data as defined in the cad file
7907796 gis can control how the data is symbolized and use the cad data in gis analysis solong as the cad data is added as simple point line and polygon features to a gislayer if you create a layer file from a cad feature class you can change thesymbology used to draw its features join attributes stored in separate tables to thelayer and select which features to display according to their attribute values

7907814 the press the national press i dont care what they think i wish we could have done this in private because you know i dont know if i would have made it through a lot of tough times in my life without you guys i mean it sincerely
7907815 the boy may be a jerk but hes my first cousin
7907816 the most incredible opportunity any president and vice president will have since franklin roosevelt
7907817 this is a guy who has as my mother would say a sixth sense this guys got it this guys got it hes going to make you proud
7907818 the first guy who looks at things from a perspective like no one ive worked with and ive been around a long time hes going to transform america and hes going to transform the world
7907819 during that time we found that an inordinate amount of piracy involved students on college campuses
7907820 no one wants to get caught and many students believe there is a sense of anonymity that comes with these peer to peer networks
7907821 individuals receiving a letter need to make contact and discuss their case as soon as possible
7907822 a lot of people believe that people in music have these huge deep pockets
7907823 illegal file sharing affects everyone in the industry from truck drivers delivering the finished product to engineers and technicians many of these people are trying to earn a living just to fee their families
7907824 this is no different than going into a retail store picking something up off the shelf putting in your pocket and walking out
7907825 thats theft thats essentially whats happening with illegal file sharing and illegal downloading of music
7907826 number one they believe its ok because everyone else is doing it and thats not true
7907827 the second thing is the belief that im anonymous and i cant get caught i think this lawsuit works as a good example that they can get caught and will get caught
7907828 as students arrived we took time to explain the cases going on at arkansas tech
7907829 of course we let them know that it was illegal but we also told them that everything they downloaded at arkansas tech could be monitored and traced
7907830 i explained that there is a lawsuit pending not against the university but against students who illegally downloaded or shared files some students were a little nervous but i think they understood the gravity of how the entertainment industry was fighting back

7907837 ahora estamos jugando mejor mucho mejor de eso estoy seguro en lieja hicimos un partido muy pobre pero el resultado fue bueno no concedimos ning n gol y jugar la vuelta en anfield va a suponer una gran diferencia
7907838 no se quedaron en el banquillo por el partido que tenemos ante el liverpool simplemente estaban demasiado cansados como para jugar respeto todas las competiciones y siempre quiero jugar con el mejor equipo posible no todos los jugadores son siempre titulares para m creo que el cansancio va a ser nuestro principal problema esta temporada alcancemos o no la fase de grupos de la liga de campeones lo cierto es que mi plantilla no es muy extensa
7907839 tienen un gran estadio como nosotros una gran afici n como nosotros y tienen grandes jugadores como nosotros lo nico que tienen y nosotros no es experiencia en partidos de la premier league
7907840 i am a quaker and i believe in nonviolence and i can fairly certainly say that i have never hurt anyone physically
7907841 hes adamant about that and they dont have any evidence
7907842 i dont know what to say about this i dont have any particular knowledge of that
7907843 if i had known that i wouldve had an easy access to a european passport i think the first thing i would have done was hop on a plane and go see my daughter
7907844 i have a clear memory of picking strawberries in oregon
7907845 i remember clearly going to mount rushmore in the back of a woody wagon i believe it was a 68 ford
7907846 i am quite sure i grew up in new york city i remember the taxi strikes i remember going to the zoo in central park
7907847 a name i used temporarily i was working on wall street in those days i was never particularly good at what i was doing
7907848 he was trying to get into the acting business and he thought it was a more appropriate name
7907849 and i had not seen her in so so so long and i missed her so much
7907850 i would say she should wish that wed be reunited and that there is hope for the two of us to be reunited again
7907851 natalie i cannot predict the future i dont know i only hope so and i wish for it
7907852 he had nothing to do with it hes a nonviolent person he has no record
7907853 maybe he has amnesia we have gotten to that issue
7907854 to have the court give custody to the mother when he was the dad at home who basically raised the child is outrageous
7907855 there was no marriage how could there be a divorce its ridiculous that whole proceeding was invalid
7907856 we dont rule out that he might be the individual from germany but he has a block he doesnt remember his early childhood
7907857 people say hes not a serial killer hes just a con man
7907858 well con men are psychopaths and we dont know what theyre going to do they do not have any empathy for other people he is dangerous to everyone its very possible for him to be violent
7907859 he got back at his ex wife by doing it and everybody was chasing him so he was the man of mystery who was on the run and he was in all the newspapers
7907860 i dont think he cared one bit about the actual child or he wouldnt have done it if he did
7907861 but since hooking up with angelina jolie brad seems to be pursuing his more

7907870 domestic workers are dying in lebanon at a rate of more than one per week
7907871 these suicides are linked to the isolation and the difficult working conditions these workers face in lebanon
7907872 many domestic workers are literally being driven to jump from balconies to escape their forced confinement
7907873 suggest that forced confinement excessive work demands employer abuse and financial pressures are key factors pushing these women to kill themselves or risk their lives

7907888 the warriors offensive line lined up yesterday for the first time with the five men position coach brian smith intends to deploy at the swamp on saturday center john estes guards keith ahsoon left and lafu tuioti mariner right and tackles laupepa letuli left and keoni steinhoff right
7907889 we worked hard to evaluate everybody everybody has been evaluated through spring training and through this camp theres a lot of information a lot of evaluation i think the players trust were going to make the right decision for the team its business i dont care if a player is the most popular guy on the team or i like him the most on the team it comes down to whos the best player we want to play the best players
7907890 i would have liked to have set the group a couple of days to a week ago with injuries it was tough to move a guy ahead whos not quite 100 percent yet then have him get hurt and sent back down then youre constantly swapping guys i had to be a little more patient with it
7907891 i like his toughness he still has a long way to go fundamentally but hes getting better with every rep hell be starting against florida
7907892 i have to keep myself mentally prepared i have to sharpen up
7907893 hes got a great punch hes got a good anchor he changes direction well hes tough hes physical hell start in florida
7907894 it was a matter of waiting and being patient until i got my chance i dont care about starting i want to play and help the team
7907895 i wasnt expecting anything just getting ready for the game and coach just told me youre with the first team i think they wanted to see how i was with the starting players and the different fronts that they give us i just have to be mentally ready for this game
7907896 coming into camp starting is what i was looking at aaron kias a really good player and i had to work hard to get a spot and im always looking ahead to starting on saturdays
7907897 ray hisatake had been taking reps with the first team at right guard while tuioti mariner rested a calf injury and smith confirmed hisatake proved himself enough during that span to warrant playing time against fifth ranked florida expect a seven man rotation at the minimum
7907898 thats the group im planning on going with kias going to play a bunch left and some right too im planning on ray getting in and playing and well see from there

7907919 he did bad things and he doesnt want us to end up like him
7907920 i took the mess that i was and turned it into a message
7907921 we got some mayweathers and some alis and some sugar ray leonards and we have a couple of mike tysons too
7907922 no matter where you start we are all the same
7907923 he says turn your tv off larry i get flashbacks to prison that is when i have to remind myself its randy it is not a prison guard it is not a judge he taught me how to be responsible
7907924 every time i jump ahead of myself i get my nose chopped off by ruth clanagan she is like my mother
7907925 he is no joke he is going to be the one i will sic him on randy sometime
7907926 those two days he took off he has to get back i think the next couple of practices are going to be really important for rausch
7907927 during yesterdays one hour practice rausch threw during warmups in team drills he threw only a few hard passes
7907928 i just couldnt get loose my arm would tighten up on me in my first 10 throws coming out here i just needed to rest it let it heal by itself i did not throw one thing they wouldnt even let me touch a football
7907929 were really happy about that that he gets to play his senior year but hes got to fit into the program weve been out here since aug 4 and hes a little bit behind
7907930 later on down the line if he can get some reps and show that hes a leader and get back with the team then well evaluate it im just glad he has a chance for himself its been a hard grind on him and he got himself eligible and thats a step in the right direction were in this thing to work with kids so i dont hold any grudges or anything i just hope that things work out for him
7907931 theres too many quarterbacks so they put me there that was by surprise there was some talk that i would go to defense oh it was a big change
7907932 he pushes everybody even players who arent at his position thats the kind of coach he is and its good motivation
7907933 playing a heisman trophy winner playing a top team and playing in the swamp theres a lot to look forward to theres a lot to be excited about
7907934 i think there are a lot of teams that are on our side of the country the west coast or middle of the country that we can play theres no reason to play somebody that far away again
7907935 just getting there is going to be a big accomplishment
7907936 i have more confidence and the coaches are starting to have more confidence in me too as far as plays i ran that last year it was more getting my rhythm back and getting my confidence back and getting my swagger back
7907937 hes done a great job of taking notes studying his playbook looking at film all the intangible things hes been there played against georgia played against washington he was really coming on at the end of the season its not gonna be too big for him and we just feel like him being a senior being conscientious hes gonna do a good job for us
7907938 mana is going to get into the game too and get his feet wet so to speak hes gonna get baptized and its a great baptismal when you go to the swamp
7907939 my ankles feeling a lot better im a lot healthier and i thank god because you take football for granted sometimes im blessed to be on the field im just blessed to be back at practice
7907940 brashton gives us that big body in the middle and sollys good enough where he can play both inside and out but it gives us a pretty good rotation with all our backers this camp was real good where we could play a lot of people and the experience they gained during this camp is going to be valuable this season
7907941 brashtons been doing a great job in the middle and coach thought it would be best for me to play outside its been good and coach cals doing a great job in helping me come along and make the transition
7907942 i feel confident in my play calls confident in my reads i feel like i can play faster now that i know the defense better getting those reps
7907943 were shocked by the magnitude of the numbers especially given that the company revised its investment plans only a month ago
7907944 this raises questions about whether the management actually intends to generate any meaningful free cash flow
7907945 in terms of the cost of the conflict the impact on the economy is negligible
7907946 were not expecting to take a negative action with regards to russias rating the main potential impact on russia is through an impact on capital flows into the country affecting foreign investment
7907947 given that russia has 580 billion in foreign exchange reserves it has the ability to ride out weekly changes
7907948 there are a significant number of corporates who are very dependent on international capital markets
7907949 there could be an impact on the russian banking system as well
7907950 we dont see any immediate impact its more a potential impact if russia decides to take more aggressive action in due course
7907951 that the russian government leadership now has chosen this route means they have chosen a policy of confrontation not only with the rest of europe but also with the international community in general
7907952 the decision represents a russian choice of path that will have sweeping consequences for a long time to come
7907953 the decision represents a breach of international law and basic principles of stability in europe which is as obvious as it is intentional
7907954 the balkanization of the caucasus on an ethnic basis is a serious danger for everyone
7907955 we reject this categorically and reaffirm georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
7907956 this is contrary to obligations that russia has repeatedly taken on in united nations security council resolutions
7907957 we consider this a regrettable decision and i recall our attachment to the territorial integrity of georgia
7907958 there will scarcely be a neighbor of russias that wont judge this negatively
7907959 russia will face accusations of breaching international law by europe and much of the rest of the world hardly any other state will follow this recognition russia will stand relatively alone with this step in contrast to the recognition of kosovo
7907960 europe is standing relatively helplessly as regards an effective response to this russian statement
7907961 russia knows that there are very different views among europeans about sanctions and that they have limited capacity to impose sanctions economic sanctions boomerang back on those who impose them and diplomatically you cant break off all diplomatic contact if you still hope to exert some influence on russia
7907962 we could expect it because the regions were de facto independent and especially in the last two three years russia has invested large money into both republics especially after the conflict in south ossetia it was just a question of time before they would recognize them officially
7907963 the russians are saying there is a kosovo precedent but this situation is completely different in each of the republics
7907964 i dont think there could be a return to fighting because basically they achieved all their goals except maybe the removal of georgian president mikheil saakashvili on the other hand his position is now quite weak
7907965 its likely capital outflow will continue and probably even intensify on the back of a possible escalation of the conflict and possible economic sanctions against russia
7907966 capital outflow is likely to add to the weakening of the rouble which we have been witnessing recently
7907967 the whirlwind crescendo of bad news seems never ending but the lower this market goes the more attractive it becomes for fundamental based investors who have a longer term horizon
7907968 were in a very very thin market right now the second half of august is the peak of the vacation season its almost dysfunctional right now
7907969 this is one of the worst corrections weve seen in a decade its bigger than the one in 2004 bigger than the one in 2006
7907970 across the board the valuations speak for themselves but and its a big but no one wants to be the first to stick their foot back into the market
7907971 its self fulfilling the fewer people buy the worse the prices get what you need is an indisputable catalyst for the domestic market at this point the only thing we can think of is some kind of announcement on the oil tax regime that would be indisputably linked to the major part of the market have an immediate bottom line impact and draw some people in
7907972 if you look at the rtsi futures they dropped about 25 points on the news russia had recognized abkhazia and south ossetia i think what investors have been hoping in the last couple of weeks is for the government to take active steps to minimize the conflict and the recognition of these two entities is clearly a step in the wrong direction from the stock markets point of view
7907973 this is a symptom of the poor sentiment toward russia on the international public level on the domestic political level and oil prices are at a new low in recent days and weeks it is very hard to see any positives for the russian market at the current time

7908243 the first is that it reduces throughput and there is less stress on the hospital in terms of cleaning and disinfecting the instruments and the second is disease transfer you dont take any chance of having bacteria on the instrument its possible after a sterilization process that instruments werent cleaned completely
7908244 most of the field testing is done by the surgeons so they can make sure it has the feel and strength of a metal instrument while at the same time being lighter
7908245 but deploying the appropriate technology is being hindered to some extent by a lack of focus on policy and is often being driven by operations or security departments and not by the business units
7908246 in today s era of mobility there is simply no clear perimeter to stop the bad guys from coming in trent fitz vice president of marketing for mirage networks
7908247 organizations across all industries are recognizing the greatest threat to the network is the endpoint that connects to the interior
7908248 we were trying to get the best power performance and cost and keep it below 30w because we know customers have trouble cooling above 30w
7908249 youre constantly being put in a situation where you have to meet new people everyday
7908250 its like practicing a sport you keep being put in this situation and you learn how to be more social
7908251 you see how much rejection you can take and how you handle it with this type of job
7908252 its a skill for life because people arent going to say yes all the time you need to try and come back with something different to try and get a yes
7908253 we ve found that the job can give people the things we look for things like communication skills discipline and a work ethic knowledge of customer service sales and marketing and the ability to work on your own

7908258 after working in the clinton administration in the department of commerce on internet privacy and online commerce issues hunter consulted for five years as an expert on these very same issues at a time of enormous expansion in online banking
7908259 not in my wildest dreams did i think id be on the programme
7908260 it was almost a spiritual experience i woke up easter morning and sent in my idea and within four weeks i was in the den
7908261 its a bit like a rabbit in the headlights you are stunned into silence but at the same time your brain is running at a hundred miles an hour
7908262 i had the three dragons i wanted so i thought id make them a proposal of 80k i think they were quite amused by that
7908263 senator obama needs to close the sale with voters who want a democrat but because of senator mccains strength at this point they dont want this democrat
7908264 how can you make sure you fill it with the most fun and that you visit all the coolest places on earth before you pack those bags for the very last time
7908265 now i possess and am possessed of the land where i would be and the curve of half earths generous breast shall sooth and ravish me
7908266 9 years is a pretty long time to do anything
7908267 i have signed decrees on the recognition by the russian federation of the independence of south ossetia and the independence of abkhazia
7908268 many people have lost their lives have lost their homes
7908269 russia has stopped it and russia has become a peacekeeper in the area
7908270 abkhazia and south ossetia are a part of the internationally recognised borders of georgia and are going to remain so
7908271 as to the russian apparent intention to recognise two parts i think it is regrettable
7908272 it puts russia of course in opposition to a number of security council resolutions to which it is party
7908273 it simply means that the russian president continues not to honour the commitments that the russians have signed onto
7908274 we consider this is a regrettable decision and i recall our attachment to the territorial integrity of georgia
7908275 we reject this categorically and reaffirm georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
7908276 this is contrary to obligations that russia has repeatedly taken on in united nations security council resolutions it does nothing to improve the prospects for peace in the caucasus
7908277 the current atmosphere reminds me of the situation in europe in 1914 when because of one terrorist leading world powers clashed
7908278 perhaps the most extreme case of religious pluralism in the world
7908279 the conditions for diversity seem to stem from a democratic government that permits immigration and protects religious freedom by law
7908280 in every major world religion you can find a common message of tolerance but i think a democratic government that protects religious freedom by law is the only way to guarantee this
7908281 u s religious freedom owes debt to colonists radical document
7908282 there are half a dozen hindu temples two sikh gurdwaras several mosques japanese chinese and korean buddhist temples a taoist temple over 100 korean churches latin american evangelical churches falun gong practitioners jehovahs witnesses mormons as well as some of the oldest churches and synagogues in the city
7908283 one new york city neighborhood is a world of religious diversity
7908284 i think the real question people are wondering about now for the 21st century is if places like flushing are now too diverse to still allow for a sense of community
7908285 asian americans who grew up in flushing are now more politically engaged with the local community than their parents
7908286 to bring various religious and ethnic groups in the community together led by local religious leaders and activists
7908287 but then these efforts fade as a result interaction between groups has been limited and relatively superficial but at least leaders got to know each other
7908288 only very recently has there been more of an organized attempt to bridge the divisions and find common ground
7908289 different faiths team up to bridge differences in new york
7908290 recent studies show that the 2nd 3rd generations of immigrants ultimately become more civically involved as youre starting to see in flushing now with the current city councilman john liu the citys first asian american to hold that office
7908291 i predict there will be much more civic participation and meaningful interfaith activity in the coming years
7908292 u s minorities will be the majority by 2042 census bureau says
7908293 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war but we dont want one and in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners
7908294 voters are indifferent to events abroad during u s elections
7908295 a special case in kosovo a special case in abkhazia and south ossetia
7908296 until recently we tried to help restore state unity but the last nail was driven in following georgias decision to attack
7908297 oooh maybe hell be an athlete and be really rich and buy me a convertible
7908298 hey why dont you guys give each other a hug

7908305 crew sues doj for failing to provide records of v p s interview in plame leak investigation on august 25 2008 crew sued the department of justice for failing to provide records of special counsel patrick fitzgeralds interview with vice president richard cheney stemming from the investigation into the leak of valerie plame wilsons covert identity as a cia officer for over a year the house committee on oversight and government reform has been seeking documents from doj related to the leak of ms wilsons covert identity while some records have been provided doj has refused to provide the committee with access to records related to the vice presidents interviews despite the fact that the interviews were not grand jury material and the office of special counsel had made no promises to the vice president regarding their use when the committee subpoenaed the records attorney general michael mukasey asked president bush to assert executive privilege over the records and on july 17 2008 the committee announced that the president had done so blocking doj from providing them crew then sent a freedom of information act request to doj for the interview records requesting that they be processed on an expedited basis due to public interest in the matter though it agreed to expedition the department has failed to provide crew with any records or identify a date by which processing would be complete as a result crew filed suit in federal court alleging violations of the freedom of information act the matter has been assigned to u s district judge emmett sullivan

7908347 former democratic u s rep tim penny came to denver on monday to help launch a new group supporting republican presidential candidate john mccain it was like a sharp stick in the eye for the minnesota delegates to the democratic national convention in the mile high city penny who represented southern minnesota in congress from 1982 through 1994 spoke at a news conference announcing formation of a citizens for mccain organization to appeal to independents and moderate democrats penny now an independent will be minnesota chairman of that group
7908348 i dont think hes had a very remarkable record as governor he focused mostly on easy issues and popular issues and this is a step up and im not sure hes as well prepared as others for this step up but its mccains choice to make
7908349 remind me what penny said about t paw would ya michael

7908363 as the chief executive of the county his coming to this area gives a ray of hope if whatever he has promised is implemented
7908364 but if his coming here is for politicking reasons then it wont impress people at all
7908365 it is a good idea but the problem we have is these resources trickling down to the common man in the past we have seen things that are meant to benefit poor people being hijacked by those who are already wealthy
7908366 there is a lot of redundant land in my village and if people can be supported to plant fruits then even the poorest people in villages can earn some money
7908367 you see with our mangoes for instance that you dont need to look after them

7908371 wir haben vor nichts angst auch nicht vor der aussicht auf einen kalten krieg
7908372 alles h ngt von der haltung unserer partner der weltgemeinschaft und unserer partner im westen ab
7908373 wenn der westen gute beziehungen zu russland aufrechterhalten will wird er die gr nde f r eine solche entscheidung verstehen und die lage wird ruhig sein
7908374 unsere streitkr fte haben sich aus georgien zur ckgezogen mit ausnahme der sogenannten sicherheitszone

7908380 wir m ssen deutlich machen dass die zukunft des projekts davon abh ngt dass sich beide seiten auch russland den genannten leitlinien wirklich verpflichtet f hlen
7908381 this is not an easy choice but it is the only way to save the lives of people
7908382 it stands quite clear now a peaceful resolution of the conflict was not part of tbilisis plan
7908383 the georgian leadership was methodically preparing for war while the political and material support provided by their foreign guardians only served to reinforce the perception of their own impunity
7908384 this is not just about georgia but about relations between russia and the west
7908385 we repeatedly called for returning to the negotiating table and did not deviate from this position of ours even after the unilateral proclamation of kosovos independence
7908386 however our persistent proposals to the georgian side to conclude agreements with abkhazia and south ossetia on the nonuse of force remained unanswered regrettably they were ignored also by nato and even at the united nations
7908387 puts russia in opposition to the security council resolution to which it is a party
7908388 since the united states is a permanent member of the security council this simply will be dead on arrival in the security council
7908389 in direct violation of numerous un security council resolutions regarding georgias territorial integrity resolutions that russia itself has endorsed
7908390 russias actions in recent weeks call into question russias commitment to peace and security in the caucasus
7908391 this is in violation of the principle of territorial integrity which is one of the basic principles of international law and this is therefore absolutely unacceptable and i think the whole of the european union will come forward in stating this very clearly
7908392 we reject this categorically and reaffirm georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
7908393 weve been caught up in the delicious fight of hillary clinton and barack obama
7908394 as hillary clinton takes the stage tuesday night i think that will fade away and people will begin to focus on the real differences between these candidates
7908395 women especially older women are still a little bit unsure about obama this is the opportunity for them to get to know him
7908396 i know this son of a single mom will stand up for the dreams of our daughters and i know that john mccain wont
7908397 i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world theyre the first thing i think about when i wake up in the morning and the last thing i think about when i go to bed at night their future and all our childrens future is my stake in this election
7908398 hillary clinton who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7908399 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7908400 its going to take a period of adjustment for a lot of women
7908401 some people had their hopes shattered but obama is incredible
7908402 i think clinton will enthusiastically endorse this ticket shes made her choice very clear
7908403 they cant afford to take their children to lessons to practice
7908404 i can bring you pages of negative quotes about john mccain from fellow republicans
7908405 weve been caught up in the delicious fight of hillary clinton and barack obama
7908406 as hillary clinton takes the stage tuesday night i think that will fade away and people will begin to focus on the real differences between these candidates

7908410 hillary clinton who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7908411 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7908412 its going to take a period of adjustment for a lot of women
7908413 some people had their hopes shattered but obama is incredible

7908415 they cant afford to take their children to lessons to practice
7908416 i can bring you pages of negative quotes about john mccain from fellow republicans
7908417 but i think its going very strong now for obama
7908418 everything the organizing the venues the environment in beijing all went so smooth no trouble no problem weve been enjoying it
7908419 sports in china is good the country is very progressive and weve seen more technologies in this olympics were happy that russia is third on the gold medal chart but china did better
7908420 it is a spectacular feat by china i hope india can do the same one day
7908421 the opening ceremony and the closing ceremony were really good introductions to chinese history and i hope they gave everybody a better understanding of how much pride the chinese people have for their country and history
7908422 it was so spectacular and i think everybody was impressed by what they saw
7908423 i think the americans now talk a lot about how really good the chinese audiences have been especially when the americans were part of the competition
7908424 as a chinese i am so proud that we have achieved so much in the olympic games
7908425 the games have shown to the world a different china and lifted our international image
7908426 the strengthening dollar and more bad news for economic growth worldwide are putting downward pressure on prices but its hurricane season and gustav has reached hurricane status
7908427 while it is far too early for definitive forecasts of its path there is a possibility for it to pass over the western side of cuba and into the gulf of mexico oil producing region next week
7908428 gustav will be the major driver of prices this week
7908429 for all the hand wringing that this storm may cause we should remember that the price sell offs following storm systems that have failed have usually far outpaced the initial run higher
7908430 seems to be strengthening and the latest track now has traders worried
7908431 the track depending how it comes off haiti could have the storm move towards some sensitive production and refining areas
7908432 this is not an easy choice to make but it represents the only possibility to save human lives
7908433 poor german ifo and gdp data highlighted the frailties of the european economy and once again sparked fears that a global slowdown would result in reduced demand for oil

7908436 before any rumors get started or this incident is blown out of proportion
7908437 women represent the fastest growing population of persons infected with hiv in this country and heterosexual transmission has become a much bigger factor
7908438 there are two basic messages for patients every woman should know her hiv status and its a simple test
7908439 dramatic shift for some ob gyn practices especially those that are currently testing only pregnant patients patients at high risk and or patients upon request
7908440 rates of infection among african americans and also among hispanics are much higher than among white women sixty four percent of women with hiv are black even though blacks only make up about 13 of the u s population
7908441 sorry about the delay i have been trying to fix a quickpwn 2 0 2 bug
7908442 it is very important to keep this new information this new way of seeing the world to yourself
7908443 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
7908444 moderation in temper is always a virtue but moderation in principle is always a vice
7908445 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
7908446 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
7908447 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
7908448 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
7908449 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
7908450 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
7908451 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
7908452 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
7908453 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
7908454 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
7908455 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
7908456 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
7908457 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
7908458 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
7908459 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
7908460 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
7908461 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
7908462 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
7908463 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
7908464 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
7908465 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
7908466 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
7908467 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
7908468 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
7908469 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear

7908476 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs

7908593 dissident republicans groups pose a significant threat to both the police and the general public
7908594 the secretary of state has admitted as much in the house of commons and the recent attempt to murder police officers in lisnaskea by way of a rocket propelled grenade shows that these groups are developing their capacity to inflict injury and damage on people and property
7908595 the chief constable has said that the dissident republicans will be pursued to the ends of the earth now lets see it backed up with serious and co ordinated action to take the criminals behind these groups out of circulation and put those involved behind bars were they belong
7908596 we therefore have no problem in supporting a serious and robust campaign against these dissident terrorist groups
7908597 people will be aware that the provisional ira itself started out as a splinter group and because it wasnt strangled at birth in the early 1970s it grew
7908598 tough action is called for now to eliminate these groups the police should be given the resources and the support they need to take the fight to the dissident republicans
7908599 the dup will continue to monitor the situation closely and we will be meeting with the security minister to discuss the threat posed by these groups and the resourcing of policing in the areas where these groups are most active specifically in the west of the province

7908602 the mdc views this continued harassment and arrest of mdc legislators by the state security agents as a direct affront to the will of the people of zimbabwe
7908603 the capture of the speakers chair by the mdc levelled the ground effectively achieving a power sharing structure in the legislature outside the negotiations
7908604 this represents a shift of some power away from zanu pf and this should provide some considerable leverage for the mdc when talks resume

7908616 my only interest was to establish the truth im happy that the court has made its declaration of falsity and that the authors and publishers have recognised their falsehoods and apologised as far as i am concerned thats the end of the matter
7908617 many so called revelations about sir salmans home life his relationship with his wife son and interactions with police protection officers
7908618 in addition to the invasion of his privacy which this book represented of particular concern to the claimant were a series of utterly and demonstrably false statements which it contained
7908619 allegations of this nature are of course highly defamatory and they were particularly offensive to the claimant because they are simply not true
7908620 in fact as a number of his protection officers volunteered to testify in the event that this matter came to trial sir salman conducted himself with dignity and courtesy throughout a time of great personal danger and concern
7908621 they are also here to apologise unequivocally to sir salman rushdie as well as ms west for the hurt and damage which they have suffered as a result of the publication of these allegations
7908622 in view of sir salman rushdies belief in free expression he has uniquely in a british libel action not sought damages nor has sir salman asked for any opinions in the book to be altered only that the false and defamatory content be taken out
7908623 pioneered a new way of reconciling the right to freedom of speech with the right to reputation you nail the lie for all time with a court ordered declaration of falsity and you receive your legal costs but you decline to chill free speech by putting authors and publishers to an expensive trial and making them pay heavy damages
7908624 i am very gratified by the outcome it seems to me to have been an avoidable business the facts were not checked before publishing these allegations
7908625 my interest was solely to establish the truth over the number of serious allegations about myself elizabeth west and indeed about the behaviour of the police force
7908626 stand up in the high court and own up to being a liar
7908627 i hope it will be an original and new method by which to establish facts rather than going for enormous financial damages

7908678 and the court has so ruled that these 11 statements were defamatory and untruthful
7908679 as far as im concerned thats the end of the matter
7908680 it was never my desire to seek any financial reward from this but simply to have it established that the truth is the truth and lies are lies im happy to have nailed that
7908681 many so called revelations about sir salmans home life his relationship with his wife son and interactions with police protection officers
7908682 in addition to the invasion of his privacy which this book represented of particular concern to the claimant were a series of utterly and demonstrably false statements which it contained
7908683 i hope that maybe this device of the declaration of falsity is another way of pursuing these matters
7908684 instead of going for the megabucks you simply go to court for the important thing which is to establish whats true and whats not

7908704 we believe the development of owner to owner relationships with merchants is an important factor to an offices success
7908705 individual sales reps that have never run a business are not in the best position to understand the challenges a business owner faces our individual office owners will know what it takes to run a business so they will be able to advise based on experience not based on a standard sales model

7908756 if local co2 concentrations get too high it displaces the oxygen supply your respiratory system becomes disrupted and you are no longer capable of extracting enough oxygen from the air one of the irritating properties of co2 is that it behaves like a heavy gas and does not disperse immediately or spread through the air it can cling like cotton wool and hang around like a blanket

7908779 we have this strong bias toward individual action you know we idolize the john wayne hero who comes in to correct things with both guns blazing but individual actions individual dreams are not sufficient we must unite in collective action build collective institutions and organizations
7908780 dont wrangle with us so long as you apply to our intended abolition of bourgeois property the standard of your bourgeois notions of freedom culture law etc
7908781 keeps appealing to that old individualistic bootstrap myth get a job get rich and get out and they also have hijacked the higher moral ground with this language of family values and moral responsibility
7908782 now we have to take this same language these same values that are encouraged within our families of looking out for one another of sharing of sacrificing for each other and apply them to a larger society lets talk about creating a society not just individual families based on these values
7908783 to give everyone one big refund on their government divvy it up by individual portions hand it out and encourage everyone to use their share to go buy their own health care their own retirement plan their own child care their own education and so on

7908795 how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they nave not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher
7908796 so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god
7908797 and as we tarried there many days there came down from judaea a certain prophet named agabus and when he was come unto us he took pauls girdle and bound his own hands and feet and said thus saith the holy ghost so shall the jews at jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle and shall deliver him into the hands of the gentiles
7908798 praise him with the sound of the trumpet praise him with the psaltery and harp praise him with the timbrel and dance praise him with the stringed instruments and organs praise him upon the loud cymbals praise him upon the high sounding cymbals

7908805 hes great and really funny whats interesting is that hes like a tsunami underneath calm water
7908806 its in the early stages but i can tell you its not going to the be the usual collection of obvious needle drops it will be of the time and of the spirit of he time its whatever works dramatically
7908807 disastrous imperial war and a corrupt government and people struggling to express themselves
7908808 its funny but its not cynical humor part of what were doing here is that its 40 years later but were not that much smarter we have a lot to learn
7908809 he gets waylaid by an acid trip and a three way
7908810 i think if that is eventually where we have to go i dont think they can say theyre the least bit surprised
7908811 i think its clear they want to bring down the government and not say when
7908812 well have to ask whether its appropriate to have people vote twice in the space of a few weeks
7908813 have tabled an economic agenda that stands diametrically opposed to everything this government stands for
7908814 i think you really have increasingly in parliament two different visions of where we should be leading the country particularly during challenging economic times and thats something im going to have to reflect upon
7908815 its not a question of wanting to go to an election its the reality
7908816 when we passed the law the purpose of the fixed election date is to create certainty obviously in a minority parliament you cant be certain
7908817 in the lack of certainty about an election date it falls back to the government to create that certainty
7908818 if any of the opposition parties wanted to provide any degree of certainty that well be here until october 2009 then well have an election in october 2009 i think all the signs are clear that theyre all committed to precisely the opposite
7908819 if thats what we have to do thats what we will do
7908820 he is looking for an excuse for an election the prime minister wants this election on his timing not on the opposition parties timing
7908821 except that this is the prime minister who campaigned on a fixed election date the idea being that future governments could not exploit their ability to manipulate the date of the election towards their own favourable timing well thats what the prime minister is now doing
7908822 they said they wanted some way to get to know the people in the community
7908823 its nice for new people in the area to meet people

7908841 by 2008 the market has become completely player driven and thats where i came in
7908842 the whole economic structure has become so complex the data so vast that a specialist was needed
7908843 the number of possible one to one relationships grows like the square of a population so a population of one thousand has a potential for one million unique relationships while a population of 100 000 has a potential for 10 billion
7908844 and thats why its so important that eve is on a single server
7908845 by 2005 with 50 000 players some began to feel that corporations were not enough so they themselves implemented alliances
7908846 they asked us to implement it officially which we did and they have since become the dominating political institution in the game so you could already see emergent social structures with only 50 000 players

7908854 while there is no national turnaround in residential real estate prices it is possible that we are seeing some regions struggling to come back which has resulted in some moderation in price declines at the national level
7908855 depending on where you focus the details of the report you can see some different stories on where home prices are headed record year over year declines were reported in both the 10 city and 20 city composites in june however they are very close to the values reported in may the rate of home price decline may be slowing
7908856 its concerning because the pattern of revisions from the census bureau has been systematically downward instead of random as youd expect
7908857 chances are well see some downward revision when they put out the august numbers
7908858 the uptick is still good news but well see if it holds
7908859 inventory of existing home sales has definitely been affected by foreclosure sales and the new home market has been afflicted by that negatively
7908860 but in recent quarters weve seen sales volume exceeding housing starts for sale so that will run inventory down if that continues
7908861 although weve been talking about weakness in the u s economy for some time the credit crunch and slowdown is newer for europe
7908862 a stronger dollar would make domestic produced goods less competitive
7908863 to the extent that we continue to have lower interest rates because of the credit crunch as well as inflation concerns there will be downward pressure on the dollar
7908864 there may be a decline in exports from the stronger dollar but i dont view the increased value in the dollar as a negative since reduced commodity prices are beneficial to u s consumers
7908865 when you look at global politics despite the fact there will be a vigorous presidential election in the fall there is a lot less uncertainty in the u s than say russia and georgia
7908866 the u s is certainly the lesser of all evils when it comes to economic growth
7908867 the u s is much healthier than other parts of the world
7908868 there may not be a huge dollar rally until the economic problems worldwide are dealt with everyone is in the same boat europe is linked to the global economy
7908869 just because you bottom out doesnt mean you cant bounce around the bottom for some time

7908894 can i just say obama is mixed race and anyone that says that he is african american are sic racist
7908895 barack obama is a great man you know he is clearly hes clearly just just wow you know he dresses awesome and he speaks so well and hes just awesome and so we want a piece of that and since his mom was white then technically we already have a piece of that and its not fair that people overlook that its just not fair not to him or us we helped make that and he shouldnt have to choose also if we make him white then it makes it a lot easier for us to deal with our wives wanting to sleep with him

7909036 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
7909037 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemnation of abortion did not depend on and was not limited in any way by theories regarding the time of fetal animation even during the many centuries when church penal and penitential practice was based on the theory of delayed animation the condemnation of abortion was never affected by it whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abortion
7909038 destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life to raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue the simple fact is that god certainly intended to create a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life and that is nothing but murder
7909039 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
7909040 we respect the right of elected officials such as speaker pelosi to address matters of public policy that are before them but the interpretation of catholic faith has rightfully been entrusted to the catholic bishops given this responsibility to teach it is important to make this correction for the record
7909041 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law

7909048 we have made much progress since our first show in 2004 and year on year exhibitor and visitor numbers grew by 20 when the show was last held in 2006 3700 people visited the 130 exhibitors this year we will sustain the momentum and i am sure that even against a tight economy good business will be conducted the character of the show is a strong bias towards marketing and when times are tough marketers become assertive in their strategies and an accelerated marketing spend is normally visible
7909049 due to the commercial nature of the exhibition we enjoy the fact that the exhibitors want to go the proverbial extra mile in presenting themselves to visitors who have high expectations of the latest trends in marketing collateral the exhibition which had little impact on our upgraded inventory of carpets exhibition systems panels fascias and electrical connections which formed part of our scope of delivery is also a showcase for our own competence our own exhibition booth under the oasys brand demonstrates that we have total confidence in the regional market to take decisions about marketing support material without always having to refer the matter to the proverbial head office in joburg we will showcase our corporate position as well as demonstrate our five activation companies exhibitions events audio visual hiring and electrical

7909055 hi tom this is gina i think you know who i am ive continually attempted to contact you regarding my microwave and its become increasingly clear that you have no plans to fix it which is a problem its a problem for me because its entirely unacceptable for you to break things in my home take no responsibility for it and continue to waste my time by allowing me to think that youre going to fix it when you clearly have no intention of doing so until now this hasnt been a problem for you which is very unfair so heres what ive decided to do just to balance this situation tom the first action i will take is to give you bad reviews on every website with every person i know with every contractor with every friend im going to give you tremendously bad reviews because you deserve them it will be my personal mission if you would like to fix the microwave i will stop if not well let the games begin you have a great day
7909056 because bats can detect objects with echolocation they seldom collide with man made structures

7909068 as a gay man i know how it feels to be called hateful names simply because of who i am
7909069 i believe one of the unintended consequences of forbidding such words to be spoken is imbuing those words with more power than they should ever have and helping create the illusion that the bigotry and racism expressed by such cruel epithets is less prevalent than it actually is which we all know is sadly not the case
7909070 for it was you who formed my inward parts you knit me together in my mothers womb i praise you for i am fearfully and wonderfully made wonderful are your works that i know very well
7909071 because your love is better than life my lips will glorify you

7909077 this is not a debate about abortion this is about the baby bonus being misused and misapplied to women who do have terminations
7909078 clearly that is not the intention its not in keeping with the support of mainstream australians for the baby bonus
7909079 i think it is a very humane gesture from society to say you are going through enough already were not going to withhold the bonus

7909109 edward decide di opporsi ai propri istinti primari di negare lidentit stessa dellessere un vampiro
7909110 lunica differenza che le scene dazione non ci sono nel libro che scritto dal punto di vista di bella e spesso bella svenuta o non capisce cosa succede perch i vampiri si muovono velocissimi invece nel film lazione visibile
7909111 no affatto ho sempre visto molti film americani quindi in un certo senso se reciti in un film sembra pi naturale adottare quellaccento ti d pi limpressione di star recitando di interpretare qualcuno che non sei tu
7909112 e facile trasformarli in un clich visto tutti i libri e i film sui vampiri degli ultimi centanni ma questi non sono vampiri convenzionali non ne hanno laspetto e non muoiono allo stesso modo quindi ho cercato di semplificare al massimo ti mordono e diventi anche tu un vampiro diventi immortale e hai una forza sovrumana eccetera e neppure tu sai il perch

7909125 quando la carta mi tagli il dito lo alzai per esaminare il danno dalla ferita invisibile colava una minuscola goccia di sangue poi accadde tutto molto velocemente edward si lanci verso di me scagliandomi dallaltra parte del tavolo ero caduta vicino al pianoforte gettando le braccia in avanti per proteggermi in mezzo alle schegge di vetro affilate dal polso al gomito ormai il dolore minvadeva acuto e bruciante confusa e disorientata cercai di non badare al rosso vivo del sangue che mi colava dal braccio e incrociai gli sguardi eccitati di sei vampiri improvvisamente famelici
7909126 nel silenzio assoluto unintuizione improvvisa rimise ogni dettaglio al suo posto cera qualcosa di cui edward non aveva voluto parlarmi qualcosa che jacob non mi avrebbe tenuta nascosta qualcosa che aveva attirato i cullen e i lupi nella foresta e li aveva fatti avvicinare pericolosamente tuttavia stavo aspettando proprio quel momento lo temevo ed ero pronta ad affrontarlo malgrado desiderassi con tutta me stessa che non arrivasse mai ma i miei guai non potevano aver fine vero
7909127 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro lorizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso
7909128 se vuoi che sia io a compiere il gesto lo far ma a una condizione
7909129 il tempo passa anche quando sembra impossibile anche quando il rintocco di ogni secondo fa male come il sangue che pulsa nelle ferite passa in maniera disuguale tra strani scarti e bonacceprolungate ma passa persino per me

7909142 its also probably an endorsement of our game and our rules

7909181 in our opinion if she was that determined to get out she would have done
7909182 whether it was because she was upset or she panicked and thought there had been a fire alarm we will never know
7909183 she had been widowed 15 months earlier and had not been coping well i dont think she enjoyed being on her own

7909204 regrettably durban ii is looking more and more like the original durban debacle of 2001
7909205 by failing to review the performance of african countries on racism and related intolerance the conference is ignoring its primary mission and squandering a golden opportunity to help africas many victims of racism and xenophobia
7909206 this message of impunity for african states places all africans at risk
7909207 apart from un watchs plenary speech on sunday neither the conference nor the draft declaration have addressed the sudanese governments racist crimes against humanity in darfur including the ethnic killings of at least 200 000 black africans mass rape and the displacement of over 1 million men women and children
7909208 moreover the text fails to review the xenophobic attacks that recently broke out in south africa the leading organizer of the abuja meeting and the overall durban process where foreigners notably from zimbabwe and mozambique were targeted in may during a wave of anti immigrant attacks in which at least 62 were killed and tens of thousands were displaced
7909209 nor does the text review the ethnic crimes in kenya this year that killed 1 000 people displaced another 600 000 and burnt down 40 000 buildings in an outburst of tribal bloodletting millions of african victims of xenophobia present and future are ill served by the conferences grant of impunity for racial or ethnic crimes committed in african countries
7909210 inflexibly clinging to free speech in defiance of the sensitivities existing in a society and with absolute disregard for religious feelings
7909211 these mirror efforts by islamic states at the un human rights council to insinuate islamic anti blasphemy prohibitions into international law yet the un expert on religious freedom asma jahangir and other international human rights experts have expressly opposed defamation of religion resolutions which seek to alter international human rights law by defining religions instead of individuals as the bearers of rights
7909212 the draft declarations attack on free speech contravenes the article 19 guarantee of freedom of expression of the universal declaration of human rights whose 60th anniversary the un will be celebrating next week in paris the language goes far beyond the recognized norms for balancing prohibitions of racial hatred with respect for free speech which is the lifeblood of democracy if the right to express ones beliefs to question the dogmas of the day in society law politics art science and yes religion is to be restricted by the feelings and sensitivities of others this will mark the end of free speech as we know it
7909213 seeks to impose a hierarchy of religions placing adherents of islam above all others
7909214 this is contrary to the basic principles of equality enshrined in the un charter and the universal declaration of human rights and undermines the very premise of the global struggle against racism
7909215 reiterat ing its concern about the plight of the palestinian people under foreign occupations
7909216 why is a non african situation referenced in a declaration about africa one that references neither sudans racist killings nor any other country in africa
7909217 the message of the special reference to the palestinian issue is that israel is practicing racism
7909218 describing the arab israeli conflict in racial terms instead of territorial or political is more than political mischief its an attempt to dehumanize israelis and their supporters as uniquely evil we urge african states not to allow the extreme political agenda of certain middle eastern governments to undermine their legitimate cause
7909219 it is something were going to think about in the future its worrying to see how much waste is left over at gigs and festivals it does make you think
7909220 what were actually seeing now is a different kind of equality that comes out of complementarity and a more complex set of negotiations based on peoples different circumstances
7909221 the indications are very strong that theres a much greater sense of convergence between men and women now in the work that theyre doing
7909222 are unclear it is possible that as the demand for workers has risen the number of experienced and presumably more efficient tradespeople and other workers available to work on construction projects has been limited but even if this were the case it is unlikely that it would fully explain the drop
7909223 if youre out there sing along with me stand up and say it loud tomorrows starting now

7909225 we do not rig elections we have that sense of honesty i cannot sleep with my conscience if i have cheated in elections
7909226 we sit here in order for us to chart a new way a new way of political interaction
7909227 it is only a dramatic way of saying we are waging a struggle to overthrow the settler system it does not literally mean that we go all out to destroy the whites
7909228 under his leadership this is exactly what his cabinet ministers and lower ranking members of his gang have done unless the principle is malleable one does not have to look far to see who the biggest beneficiary of his largesse are some of them are so
7909229 we are thinking in terms of one army the patriotic front is going to emerge with one army there will therefore not be any sector for zapu or a sector for zanu we are one and that we shall remain the principle to merge zipra and zanla is there and it is our hope that very soon our two armies will constitute one force as indeed our two command constituted one joint operations command
7909230 we have the patriotic front and our hope is that we shall fight as one we would like to constitute one front with just one leader campaigning as president of the front
7909231 we havent been fighting for individual benefits we have been fighting to get power into the hands of the people in other words we have been fighting a peoples struggle s o it is the interest of the people really that is the decisive factor that is the paramount issue
7909232 landmark agreements have been concluded with every expectation that everybody will sign up

7909237 for the avoidance of doubt the only person who can officially open parliament will be determined by the outcome of the on going dialogue
7909238 we will not attend we dont expect any member of the executive to address us until that dialogue has been concluded

7909244 psu george you obviously read the story proving by default it is newsworthy get it also the fact that you are driving across town alone proves why this is a news story if you cant see that well then there may be little hope
7909245 hopefully wim will ride to work a few times a week he will be in good company along side numerous psu students staff and faculty who practice and study sustainablity if trends continue this story will someday be commonplace and unworthy of mention

7909274 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7909275 its really very interesting that with all these efforts that have gone into building safer highways safer cars better enforcement this really dramatic change were seeing is due to economics to the price of gasoline
7909276 this is really the first time since the 1970s that people are thinking about driving and about what is the cost of an individual trip
7909277 it really changes the picture of what the current face of poverty is
7909278 if youre serious about tackling poverty youve got to have good information
7909279 youve got to be willing to test and innovate and try new ideas and if you have a measure that doesnt allow you to have the knowledge to understand whether what youre trying is working you cant seriously try to tackle poverty
7909280 we all have the same questions particularly here in san francisco where the cost of living much like new yorks is really high

7909304 after receiving an honorary doctor of letters degree from his alma mater university of north dakota lakers coach phil jackson touched upon a range of subjects from the schools nickname to the greatest athlete he has ever coached and it wasnt michael jordan or kobe bryant or shaquille oneal not karl malone derek fisher rick fox scottie pippen steve kerr bill cartwright or smush parker ok so he might not belong no the player jackson called the greatest that he has coached is that wedding dress aficionado and newport beach polices favorite basketball bad boy dennis rodman
7909305 for one thing the 30 something stars are going to need some fresh young legs to spell them also well need to keep up with the younger more athletic teams like atlanta that gave us problems in the playoffs last year finally there are the economic forces driving the roster younger when the payroll is tied up with three max contracts you can only fill the roster veterans looking for one last shot at glory broken down players looking for another shot and young players on rookie contracts ainge went with the latter two this offseason clearly every team has bench players with question marks if they were free from doubt theyd more than likely be starters somewhere however this squad just seems a little more stacked with doubt than in the past all have the potential to do great things but all have a good chance at failure too
7909306 its time to change our thinking about the future of lebron james time to turn the viewpoint that james will leave cleveland on its ear for good reason because the cavs seem to have something very slick and important up their sleeve and that is to keep james and give him a superstar caliber cohort as a teammate the vision and its not a pipe dream has james staying and playing on the same team as dwyane wade or chris bosh or josh howard or amare stoudamire or any of the other big name nba guys who can become a free agent in the summer of 2010 dont laugh there is only one nba team positioned to sign two superstars in 2010 and thats the cavaliers thats because theres only one team with a superstar and the cap room to sign another
7909307 its been a big nba offseason for players turning down mediocre paychecks and no playing time in the u s and going overseas where opportunities are more prevalent is jason kidd next ok hell still play for the dallas mavericks this season but the footwear hell sport no longer will have the swoosh before making his trip back to the u s after the beijing games kidd announced he will wear shoes made by peak a chinese company and ditch nike the timing on kidds departure is interesting because the market in the u s has been flooded recently with many of his old retro classics kidd also spent a brief time sporting jordans in his career
7909308 it was a much different feeling than wednesday when china was eliminated and yao no longer had the tangible significant role of putting on the team china uniform

7909310 wade rehabilitated his reputation and proved himself whole and healthy as well while helping lead the united states on an eight game march to the olympic gold but knows he still has to prove himself over the long haul
7909311 were trying to make a statement trying to make a stand
7909312 what wade gave us over the past few weeks was either a reminder a statement or a tease maybe all three he reminded us of the vintage unstoppable guard we fell in love with and that delivered an unexpected title he made the statement that he is no anferenee hardaway a flash in the pan phenom destined for injury induced obscurity and he teased us because the wade we watched this summer is not the wade well see in fall this summer wade played in staccato bursts picking his spots offensively deferring to equal talents when necessary and playing with the unabashed recklessness of a man with something to prove and a limited amount of time to do it in this fall wade will play in grueling slogs carrying an offense jostling his way to the free throw line and playing with the burden of a man with the hopes of a franchise resting completely on his back the olympics was a joy the nba is work
7909313 managing director the man who sets the tone and has the strongest voice in choosing a coach and players colangelo has been noncommittal about whether he wants to sign up for another tour if he does the job is his hes earned it and if not two words jerry west the logo is a perfect fit in so many ways great presence respected within the nba offices and this is an nba operation unemployed and therefore able to devote the time coach same as colangelo let krzyzewski come back if he wants to come back but it wont happen it never happens with olympic coaches gregg popovich of the spurs an assistant at the 2004 olympics and mike dantoni of the knicks an assistant this time are the favorites both have extensive international experience both are players coaches who could properly balance driving a team with the understanding its a summer job players this is where it gets tricky

7909319 they did a poor job explaining what the choices are
7909320 they are trying to race across the viability threshold before the republicans can say that this man is not ready to be president
7909321 although we may sometimes be ashamed to admit it the slave trade is an integral part of british history
7909322 it is inextricably linked to trade colonisation industrialisation and the british empire
7909323 it is important that children learn about this and the links to wider world history such as the american civil rights movement the repercussions of which are still being felt today
7909324 that is why the slave trade will join the british empire two world wars and the holocaust as compulsory parts of the secondary school history curriculum from this september
7909325 learning about slavery and associated issues such as trade and decolonisation is crucial so that young people can fully understanding the shape of todays world
7909326 however it is vital that the government provides better guidance and support to teachers so that they can teach these complex and difficult topics with confidence and success

7909337 william harms has managed to put a truly unique spin on the vampire story by taking vlad the impaler and making him a vampire hunter

7909359 ive been doing a lot of interviews and stage shows and half the questions are like will mgs4 be coming out on 360 or other formats and in the near future i hope theyll ask me about metal gear about us about our future projects and will stop caring about the hardware but you know what kind of disturbs me sometimes because a lot of people ask me about this ps3 360 question is that its not about the hardware i want people to look at the game itself sometimes i even feel like it should be on a pc so that people dont ask me about hardware and platforms
7909360 is that its not about the hardware i want people to look at the game itself

7909391 in turn 4 and 5 i think there was a bit of a battle in front of fernando and me i think he tried to avoid the car in front and i just couldnt avoid him as i was right behind
7909392 i think he slowed down to avoid sebastien bourdais i think he was on the inside curb and tried to come back to the track and fernando tried to avoid him with backing off i was just about to accelerate and there was no time to react to anything

7909400 we have got to elect barack obama and joe biden as president and vice president
7909401 the first part of the message is a great big hello and thank you
7909402 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7909403 i hope people wake up and emotionally engage in issues
7909404 its about the issues that everyones talking about but theres a lot of hope
7909405 at this moment in my life writing about anything else would be uninteresting and impossible because i feel such urgency
7909406 it usually isnt a good idea to make people wonder what your publication is about
7909407 but theyve managed to turn it to their advantage once you get past the name its a great magazine
7909408 but if we had called it something like the south today it would have been such a snore
7909409 we extend our condolences to the victims family and those affected by this tragedy
7909410 the combination of our north american operations under the leadership of greg lampert a skilled and proven operating executive will provide a more streamlined approach to our north american business allowing us to serve our markets and our customers even more efficiently
7909411 in addition to my ongoing operating responsibilities the selection of a ceo for north america will allow me to further focus on our globalization strategy leveraging our manufacturing platform in 23 countries selling in nearly every country of the world in addition to the acquisition of phelps dodge international recent activities have included entry into north africa china and india as well as the expansion of our positions in mexico and the philippines
7909412 mike has been an important member of the companys leadership over the last several years and a trusted business advisor to me personally
7909413 he has built a solid platform for our utility and specialty businesses which are well positioned to capture the long term growth in energy infrastructure investment in north america
7909414 easy amp fancy web based graphic user interface remote support to help solve more complicated issues
7909415 we are very pleased to be a partner of the algerian government in the privatization of the wire and cable industry which will enhance economic growth and development
7909416 enica biskra has a solid platform of assets and a talented labor force led by the management team and together we will be able to invest and grow this business and the workforce into a highly successful enterprise reaching far into europe and the neighboring middle east region
7909417 the acquisition of enica biskra represents the latest step in positioning general cable as a global leader in cabling systems for energy infrastructure which began with the 1999 acquisition of bicc
7909418 general cable expects to have as much as 200 million euros of annual revenue in the middle east and north african region after giving effect to this investment project this acquisition establishes an important position in these markets and a platform to further invest and grow in the region
7909419 i am pleased with the record financial results the company achieved in the first quarter because of the strength of our broad based global infrastructure products the company was able to overcome rapidly rising copper prices during the latter part of the quarter and a weakening u s economy to deliver nearly 20 earnings growth this is a strong testament to the success of the companys efforts to diversify its product and geographic reach over the last several years and our culture of continuous improvement
7909420 today nearly 30 of the companys production capacity in spain is exported into other markets in europe north africa and the middle east with our export experience from spain combined with pdics operations in thailand which also reaches into these markets we have excellent visibility into the opportunities that these regions present we are working diligently to identify unique investment opportunities in these areas with a particular emphasis on energy and industrial infrastructure products where we believe growth rates will far exceed that of western europe and north america
7909421 despite the recent reductions in cable demand from the north american electric and telecommunications utilities the company has continued to deliver significant year over year overall earnings growth due to the strength of international markets nevertheless we continue to view the long term fundamentals for transmission cable in north america to be strong and expect our low voltage electric utility products to recover with the construction cycle in the united states
7909422 the company is clearly benefiting from its strategic investments to expand into new products and geographies more than offsetting the ongoing weakness in certain product lines in the developed economies despite the weakening u s and spanish economies as well as rapidly increasing copper and other raw material prices for the second quarter the company expects to report earnings per share of 1 20 to 1 30 compared to adjusted earnings per share of 1 07 in the second quarter of 2007 a double digit percentage increase on revenues of approximately 1 7 to 1 8 billion
7909423 i am pleased that we have been able to deliver on an adjusted basis 28 year over year earnings growth despite difficult economic conditions in two of our major markets the united states and spain the growth we have achieved is a direct result of the continuing internal investments in new product development acquisitions we have made over the last several years and ongoing continuous improvement initiatives the company is generating about 70 of its revenues outside the united states with a high and growing proportion of revenue generated in markets such as latin america the middle east asia and africa the recent promotion of gregory j lampert to president and chief executive officer of north america will allow me to intensify my focus on global operating excellence coordination and growth
7909424 demand for cable products in the developing regions of the world is being driven by high levels of energy infrastructure construction and mining activities particular strength is coming from government sponsored infrastructure projects in latin america and southeast asia additionally the core infrastructure investment required for the upcoming 2010 world cup soccer event in south africa has added pressure to an already taxed energy grid that is also supporting growing mining activities in the region resulting in increased spending for energy transmission and distribution as well as construction
7909425 demand has slowed and margins were pressured in the second quarter versus a very strong prior year period across a broad spectrum of product lines in north america as a result of the weak construction environment competitive dynamics and surging raw material and energy input costs the year over year comparison gets somewhat easier toward the fourth quarter as the slowdown for many products began in that timeframe
7909426 the company has continued to deliver significant year over year earnings improvement despite a challenging economic environment particularly in the united states coupled with inflation in the cost of raw materials and logistics in the third quarter of 2008 we again expect to show strong earnings per share growth versus the prior year for the third quarter the company expects to report earnings per share in the range of 1 17 to 1 27 compared to adjusted earnings per share of 1 03 in the third quarter of 2007 an increase of 14 to 23 on revenues of approximately 1 675 to 1 725 billion in the third quarter we expect our row segment to be our most profitable
7909427 for sure there has been interest from various parties within the gulf there is a precedent in the cases of ferrari or daimler and those kinds of solutions could be very realistic solutions

7909434 seems to me this would be a good time to send no strings attached a check for 200 million to iran
7909435 the thing i would worry about is that it would almost look like a publicity stunt
7909436 you have to grow up and my administration has to grow up with all due respect and find out if there is any common ground
7909437 i hope were all smarter about this smarter than weve been
7909438 i hope our leadership is brighter because if its not its a very dull picture for the region and for humanity

7909447 i want to remember him in his days of just undiluted glory
7909448 you listen to the ones who were concerned with what lyndon johnson did on the domestic side and you say there never was a surer touch
7909449 then you turn to vietnam reading the minutes of the meetings talking to people you have a sense of a man who didnt know what to do if i write this book correctly that contrast will emerge
7909450 i said to him if you really want to do this you have to go back and get your notes on the delegates and what went on out there and talk to me in detail
7909451 these were long hours of interviews you feel youre sitting there and you are a hearing a story that with everything everybody thinks they know about american politics nobody knows this story
7909452 he was very pale and thin and it was harder and harder for him to breathe
7909453 began to be realized when president lyndon johnson passed the civil rights act of 1964
7909454 i see barack obama as the apex of the lyndon johnson legacy
7909455 but you cant talk about iraq without talking about vietnam
7909456 you cant leave that out his presidency did not end in triumph
7909457 every generation pays very close attention to the major controversies of the time and when johnson left office in 1969 vietnam was still raging and a lot of americans were furious at johnson
7909458 they werent thinking about a lot of things they had liked about him like civil rights and in 1969 people were not as aware as historians are now of the efforts he made to get the country out of the war
7909459 the sense of that seems to be very much lost
7909460 i will have to answer that for myself before i can answer it for you
7909461 heh um do you uh have prince alfred in a can
7909462 psych youre not at all but i still love you whats up
7909463 yeah you beep your dealer as soon as he can get to a pay phone he calls you and tells you when hell be coming by convenient if youre in that too paranoid or wired to leave the house mode but not really preferable to just going out to get what you need
7909464 we dont have those so much anymore although there is the occasional meth lab
7909465 meth as in crystal meth are you in new york or the ozarks insane do you ever go to the lingerie store
7909466 no no this is a lingerie store that probably never sold a single maidenform in fact its not really even a lingerie store we just call it that because of the chipped nose mannequin in the front window wearing a pink and maroon teddy all of the clothes looked like they were stolen from laurie andersons laundry hamper and then recombined in the most mismatched of ways
7909467 patience buddy so you go to the counter and hopefully youll meet a nice middle aged lady with salt and pepper dreadlocks ask etta for something special shell then ask how much youre looking to spend step through a door behind the counter and come back with your weed voila
7909468 but what kinds of weed are available i prefer a specific grade of canadian organic seedless that
7909469 no its like starbucks now people have very specific tastes
7909470 well starbucks sounds like a good place to buy weed but ive never heard of it if you start asking etta a bunch of questions youd meet big guy for sure hell big guyd actually probably come out before you even got to your questions anyway unless you had an introduction
7909471 the place is run by these jamaicans or like trinidadians or tobagoans or somethingians if youre black or latin then you probably wont have a problem but if you come in there looking all nypd blue meets police academy and asking a million questions big guy is going to come out luckily i was banging a latin guy that introd etta to me but even then there was the occasional trouble when etta wasnt working
7909472 one time i came in and said the usual thing the i was looking for something special
7909473 but if i wasnt white it wouldnt be a big deal thats discriminatory
7909474 dude its good business sense when it comes to marginal activities white people are just trouble
7909475 you know what my dealers been telling me twenny minnit for two hours now so maybe i should go check this place out
7909476 attaboy okay so you want to go to east second street the lingerie stores on the same side of the street as that cute little cemetery that always serves to freak a body out when youre walking home from the club and its closer to first than second ave dont be a numbnuts and look around at the clothes go straight up to the counter with a confident but kind of unfriendly smile then just stick with the script i gave you and dont be such a white boy about it
7909477 it sounds too easy if i end up missing my dealer and this store isnt around anymore im gonna be annoyed for instance if it became some sad run down property management office
7909478 most get up in the morning to work hard feed their families and pay for soccer uniforms and maybe a vacation if they can stand the security lines at the airport

7909480 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good
7909481 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
7909482 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
7909483 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner
7909484 he is a very skilled player a very hard thrower
7909485 there are a lot of beginners this is not a high powered league this is a developmental league whose main purpose is to promote the sport
7909486 i have never seen behavior of a parent like the behavior jerichos mother exhibited wednesday night
7909487 hopefully what were talking about is something that will not happen
7909488 if it does we wouldnt just say come back next year what we would do is work with them on where they fell short provide them the resources they need the tutoring and when we feel like they need to be evaluated again we would evaluate
7909489 we play so good overall when you win you should give your speech in english
7909490 this should be a priority in their professional development just the way working on their short game is a priority
7909491 the lpga could come out and say they only want 10 koreans but theyre not

7909506 ziggurat communities can be almost totally self sufficient energy wise apart from using steam power in the building we will also employ wind turbine technology to harness natural energy resources
7909507 whole cities can be accommodated in complexes which take up less than 10 of the original land surface
7909508 if these projects were realized today the world would see communities that are sustainable environmentally friendly and in tune with their natural surroundings
7909509 potential for gustav to become a major hurricane over the next four days depends primarily on two factors how close it tracks to cuba and the interaction it has with the island
7909510 the longer gustav stays over the warm water in the caribbean the stronger it gets and the greater the chance that it will become a category 3 hurricane by saturday
7909511 the storm will weaken if it moves close to cuba but it will strengthen if it tracks farther south across the caribbean

7909523 we can understand their reason but it is disappointing because it is an opportunity to raise the profile of the game nationally
7909524 with all due respect if there is a walkabout group it will be very small
7909525 it takes about two hours out of your day by the time you drive there and back were in the same dressing rooms as last year and were pretty comfortable with our knowledge there
7909526 its our choice you cant tell me going to a walkabout at wembley is going to make you bond as a group of players
7909527 it will probably benefit the players to get away from it the day before the game and just relax their minds so they are not constantly thinking about the game local amp nations

7909530 heres the problem if fannie mae and freddie mac collapsed then probably the financial system would receive such a body blow that it could be disastrous you probably couldnt get a mortgage
7909531 i think long term what we have to do is we have to go ahead and make a decision if these are public entities then maybe they ought to get out of the profit making business and if theyre private entities that we dont bail them out
7909532 if they are there then that is what the plan would be
7909533 the whole idea of a roll call vote could be in flux at this point
7909534 the clinton people here theyve said they wanted catharsis they wanted that roll call but they may not get it
7909535 they dont want to be blamed for any trouble at this convention
7909536 arent they supposed to do that on the convention floor if the vote is official before they vote isnt that breaking the rules
7909537 if a bank robber was caught stealing money and at their trial they made a plea bargain to give most of the money back it still doesnt exculpate them from the crime they committed the robber should be punished regardless puma was formed to protest the dncs hijack of democracy we want democracy back in the democratic party and you will not get our support and votes until our democratic leaders start acting democratically again

7909540 the clintons are doing everything they can to make this convention all about them and to absolve themselves from the substantive criticism of both clintonism and bill clintons behavior on the campaign no bill clinton was not painted as a racist he was a racist during the campaign

7909568 we are extremely grateful to the evelyn and walter haas jr fund for generously supporting this important collaboration
7909569 the more than 2 5 million individuals in the 3 100 congregations supported by the institute for welcoming resources and these partner organizations are some of our movements most valuable advocates in promoting understanding reclaiming what unfortunately has become a narrow view of moral values espoused by those who seek to divide and advancing lgbt equality we thank the haas jr fund for not only recognizing this but for providing the critical resources to advance these pro lgbt faith organizing efforts
7909570 we are excited that this grant will help the institute for welcoming resources realize its vision to significantly increase the number of local congregations and parishes committed to the full inclusion of lgbt people
7909571 were convinced that this unique partnership among the task forces iwr program and denominational advocacy organizations holds the potential to transform the larger lgbt movement by greatly expanding its supporters and extending its reach
7909572 a sea change is under way in faith communities across the country
7909573 the day is fast approaching when people will hear the word christian and associate it with justice equality and support for all including lgbt people this collaborative grant is one concrete way were going to get there
7909574 this is the kairos time the opportune time when the church and the world are about to turn while full inclusion of lgbt people in the life of the lutheran communion requires a marathon strategy what we do in the next 12 months will be critical to the success of the mission of lutherans concerned north america over the next 20 years
7909575 the timely and generous grant from the haas jr fund will enable lutherans concerned north america to maximize its strategic impact by increasing organizational and financial capacity enhancing volunteer and leadership development at the grassroots fostering continued expansion of our reconciling in christ program and organizing for the 2009 evangelical lutheran church of america synodical and churchwide assembly seasons where major decisions will be made about the full inclusion of lgbt people and families and pastors
7909576 haas jr was able to see the longtime activism and organizing in frontier territory provided by reconciling ministries network rmn for equality for lesbian gay bisexual and transgender persons rmn puts these monies to work immediately building infrastructure training new leaders creating networks in new regions and strengthening advocate teams across the united methodist church such strategic investment allows us to impact denominational change from the grassroots to the worldwide legislative sessions of the church
7909577 we are extremely thankful for this grant it will enable us to move to the next level of programming and effectiveness as a faith in action organization this includes developing and implementing a systematic process to help episcopal parishes become more welcoming and affirming of lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people in their congregations and communities
7909578 the haas jr fund helps the ucc coalition for lgbt concerns equip volunteers for our mission to educate and advocate for lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people and their allies and to save lives by training people in suicide intervention
7909579 developing and vitalizing open and affirming churches that not only welcome lgbt people in but also reach outside their congregations makes a difference in both church and society this investment from the haas jr fund makes it possible for the coalition to build the internal systems that make more effective the hundreds of our volunteers who participate in the movement for lgbt rights
7909580 as a national grassroots movement working for lgbt equality in the presbyterian church usa and civil society since 1974 we have been able to accomplish much as a nearly all volunteer network with one full time staff person the funding from the evelyn and walter haas jr fund allows more light presbyterians to build capacity and take our next steps as an organization and network by hiring additional staff
7909581 we stand at the threshold of accomplishing policy change and ending discrimination against lgbt persons and their families in the presbyterian church usa as we enter a national campaign to ratify the recent legislative victory at the 218th general assembly of the presbyterian church usa this grant makes it possible for more light presbyterians to create this national campaign

7909585 this study revealed a consistent 20 per cent increase in the risk of type 1 diabetes
7909586 type 1 diabetes occurs when the immune system destroys the insulin producing cells in the pancreas and one theory suggests that being born by caesarean section may affect the development of the immune system because babies are first exposed to bacteria originating from the hospital environment rather than to maternal bacteria
7909587 the study findings are interesting but unless a biological mechanism is established it would be unwise to read too much into this association between caesarean section delivery and diabetes
7909588 fortunately figures from the northern ireland type 1 diabetes register indicate that only around two per 1 000 children will develop diabetes by their 15th birthday so a 20 per cent increase is on quite a low baseline risk
7909589 not all women have the choice of whether to have a caesarean section or not but those who do may wish to take this risk into consideration before choosing to give birth this way
7909590 we already know that genetics and childhood infections play a vital role in the development of type 1 diabetes in children but the findings of this study indicate that the way a baby is delivered could affect how likely it is to develop this condition later in life diabetes uk northern ireland would welcome more research in this area

7909683 lastly i think the bpp was an amazing organization there stance on guns in cali was a great moment of act up style political theater
7909684 anyway what i am trying to get at expanding on tnl is that if we have an organized educated and armed people our chances of success and continuation are much higher
7909685 i think we need to remember that the bpp did not advocate indiscriminate distribution of guns to their communities but insisted that people go through political training before getting one from them
7909686 the guns in the hands of my proletarian neighbors are not being used to
7909687 i agree with tnl us gun culture isnt going anywhere now that the sc has spoken i would hope some of our more liberal friends would re focus there demands or move on
7909688 where populations have been black urban and poor the ruling class approach has been to sharply restrict and forbid owning and bearing guns and to portray an armed population as a nightmare
7909689 they had a 10 point program in the beginning they had rigorous political training and they spoke to what was really going on more specifically in the black community
7909690 must have killed a few women wearing berkahs oh well
7909691 since when has any state given anyone permission to rebel against it
7909692 in the eighteenth brumaire marx describes the lumpenproletariat as a class fraction that constituted the political power base for louis bonaparte of france in 1848
7909693 according to marx the lumpenproletariat had no real motive for participating in revolution and might have in fact an interest in preserving the current class structure because the members of the lumpenproletariat usually depend on the bourgeoisie and the aristocracy for their day to day existence in that sense marx saw the lumpenproletariat as a counter revolutionary force
7909694 in general i think the idea that you would write off the revolutionary potential of an individual based on their class position whether they are a drug lookout or a bankers kid seems wrongheaded it makes perfect sense to me to develop a strategic orientation towards particular classes and fractions of classes but only if we recognize enormous amount of contingency involved in shaping the consciousness of individuals
7909695 imho the notion of the well armed population as a guarantee against tyranny is something marked by the same old jeffersonian liberal democratic illusions
7909696 they were all nothing but a bunch of evil slaveowners

7909700 and the lynchings and the klan that characterized the south after the war were arguably ugly blowback from the invasion just as the rise of fundamentalism and al qaeda in the middle east is blowback from u s intervention in that part of the world could it have been avoided if slavery had been peacefully abolished as it was in the rest of the world or if there had been a way to launch a multiracial revolt against the old regime in the south to bring it down from within rather than through an external invasion speculation i guess and sort of off topic now

7909705 understanding of the difference between libertarianism and left revolutionary currents is rooted in three things the question of capitalism the question of patriotism related to constitutionalism and the question of the state
7909706 the northern capitalists headed by lincoln were not overall too aggressive and militant they were maddeningly slow and conciliatory and cautious
7909707 well if only we kill more of those evil terrorists then iraqi democracy would have a chance
7909708 we can understand their reason but it is disappointing because it is an opportunity to raise the profile of the game nationally
7909709 with all due respect if there is a walkabout group it will be very small
7909710 it takes about two hours out of your day by the time you drive there and back were in the same dressing rooms as last year and were pretty comfortable with our knowledge there
7909711 its our choice you cant tell me going to a walkabout at wembley is going to make you bond as a group of players

7909731 there is now a perfect overlap between zones of high risk and regions of high opium cultivation
7909732 opium production has dropped less dramatically down six percent from 8 200 tonnes to 7 700 tonnes
7909733 the threat of eradication is very weak development assistance is slow
7909734 this applies to an enterprise trying to cut costs a young business unexpectedly saturated with customer demand or a start up looking to launch
7909735 a head in the cloud the power of infrastructure as a service
7909736 classic disruptive innovation where the mainstream dismisses the product and small companies have time to create a real differentiated value
7909737 to afford reasonable opportunity for the discussion of conflicting views on issues of public importance
7909738 the state pays for the blunders of private enterprise profit is private and individual loss is public and social
7909739 there are many reasons why it would be a great advantage to everyone to have an atheist prime minister
7909740 military operations lasted several hours during which air strikes were called in
7909741 the destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with some 78 houses having been totally destroyed and serious damage to many others
7909742 the impact of such operations undermines the trust and confidence of the afghan people in efforts to build a just peaceful and law abiding state
7909743 airstrikes on civilian targets unco ordinated house searches and illegal detention of afghan civilians

7909754 i see fields daffodils and funny looking yellow plants it is quite easy for the wind to blow each away i find it a shame that i drift away like this sometimes
7909755 no doubt without daydreaming there would be no fiction inspiration the scientists would have you believe that imagination is a cultivation of chemicals how do they account for that which is around us the not man made nature
7909756 they cannot children run through urban streets all day cars do not look for them the people who drive them do but only by accident in the double use of the word
7909757 do you sometimes stare at flowers and see childrens eyes
7909758 only when i really get into my memories when i search hard right back to where i began this is when i remember
7909759 remember what memories are just visions look at these visions and describe each there is no need to delve or try undoubtedly it will come natural
7909760 im not quite sure if you havent guessed by now and brother this is sarcasm i do get quite nervous especially when i look and do not see the clear images that we all see mine are distorted this worries me
7909761 i get scared of the future myself things that may or may not happen i play the image like video feed and then boom im back to the present
7909762 neither the past nor the future is retrievable by staring through glass yet when i do the earth appears to me i cherish it and begin to wonder would you like me to tell you just what it is that i wonder

7909767 a simultaneous jam is a great idea do it grab the reigns for your region work out the logistics and email derek to post about it
7909768 if you think a bloke is a mate and then he does that to you hes obviously not a mate
7909769 i guess my son is disappointed about that to be used as a scapegoat and i can understand that position its crazy really
7909770 from a fathers point of view im extremely disappointed with whats happened
7909771 i guess its a kick in the arse when you get a call from a mate asking you to do a favour that in fact could put you in jail its a bit hard theres not too many who would agree to that unless they have rocks in their head
7909772 it just goes to show you what mateship is realistically im extremely disappointed for my son
7909773 i think its put tremendous pressure on the boy at this stage of his life
7909774 everybody from me to you to the pope has to be given a chance of showing that theyre innocent and thats the position that hes in now
7909775 but unfortunately its not my decision its a decision for the club and for tony zappia but were showing a lot of compassion towards both people who were involved in this
7909776 the important battle thats being won is right across the football culture there is now a recognition that the community will not tolerate violence towards women
7909777 its a bit like drink driving forty years ago it was acceptable today its not but some idiots still do it
7909778 does that mean we give up educating young people about it does that mean we stop having law against it no
7909779 its the same thing with violence against women we need to stay the course and you will always get young men who think its ok to abuse or assault women and we just have to keep at it
7909780 there is a lot of emotional attachment but it is hard to say it is a viable industry to maintain in the long term
7909781 it is our intention we should announce the sale of assets worth us10 billion or more this year and that could include the packaging business
7909782 were driven in all these things by value and so whether or not the packaging business is sold this year will depend on getting a good price for the business
7909783 what were seeing so far is stronger aluminium demand in china this year than were seeing for copper by almost a factor of two and even stronger than steel

7909791 talking to trade exposed industries about the best way to shield them from the full effects of the emissions trading scheme
7909792 australia would lose valuable export earners jobs and investment will be lost
7909793 i might also add that a number of these industries are located in regional centres where the opportunities for alternative employment will be limited and the effect on working families could be devastating
7909794 otherwise we will be forced to move our new investments offshore and supply australia from there
7909795 there was nothing untoward in the results rio tinto seems to be controlling the business on all fronts very well its a pretty pleasing result from our point of view
7909796 i think rio tinto has every right to stare down bhp still
7909797 rio is contributing less than 37 per cent of underlying profit of a merged company which is similar to the average of the last four reporting periods and confirms our belief that the 44 per cent of the combined company we are offering rio shareholders remains a substantial and compelling premium
7909798 despite heavy rain impacts in the first half the energy and minerals businesses substantially outperformed our expectations
7909799 other divisions were generally slightly lower than our forecasts offset by a lower interest charge

7909804 a lot of labels theories and bits of conventional wisdom have been tossed around by pundits and experts lately as they try to figure out how citizens will vote in november we are conservative and liberal we are boomers gen yers the hip hop generation we are blue collar voters working class voters and black voters there are energized democrats disaffected republicans and unaffiliated voters
7909805 there is one demographic category however that regularly gets overlooked
7909806 the moniker may seem like an oxymoron at first but the worldview that it encompasses fits the politics of many in the post civil rights generation
7909807 it may be easier in some ways to begin with what a hip hop republican is not a hip hop republican is not an uncle tom a hip hop republican is not a sellout a hip hop republican is not a race traitor willing to sell out the best interests of the black community for the scraps off of the proverbial political table a hip hop republican is not meek and mild content to be a poster child for gop diversity

7909849 el gran proyecto de comunicaci n es radio televisi n y prensa
7909850 es importante que la gente entienda que es una radio del estado y no del gobierno
7909851 un componente principal es el gobierno porque es parte del estado una sociedad parte de eso respetando todas las jerarqu as
7909852 el gobierno est brindando todas las facilidades econ micas para que exista una radio distinta a lo que ofertan las radios privadas que se dirigen la mayor a a un p blico de 14 a 20 a os

7909854 haremos una concienciaci n y una catequesis de la seguridad social no vamos a entrar en una campa a electoral porque el iess no puede hacer eso lo que vamos a hacer es lo que hace la iglesia cat lica concientizando a sus fieles en nuestro caso a los afiliados yo tengo 1 mill n 400 mil interesados
7909855 la universalidad de la seguridad social al incluir a las amas de casa trabajadores aut nomos desempleados debido a que en el ecuador tenemos 28 de cobertura de los seguros
7909856 a un afiliado le interesar que su esposa tambi n est afiliada que tenga una cobertura para sus hijos ese es un ideal y si el gobierno pone todos los recursos debemos apoyarlos el estado aporta con el 40 de las pensiones
7909857 hay un art culo que dice que las nuevas prestaciones deber n tener financiamiento en el presupuesto del estado los recursos del iess y de los afiliados no ser n tocados para nuevas prestaciones

7909864 se est reuniendo casi a diario para tener el mejor equipo posible
7909865 s por supuesto que es una ventaja que siempre debemos considerar y juega a favor
7909866 der erste schritt liegt also beim betroffenen mann der sich nicht scheuen sollte zu mir als arzt zu kommen die n tige diskretion ist ihm hier sicher es freut mich immer auch wenn sich betroffene frauen melden wenn das ihr mann nicht bers herz bringt
7909867 eine offene kommunikation schafft klarheit verst ndnis und gegenseitiges vertrauen
7909868 one of the assumptions that people make is that if they buy virus protecting software that will protect them from all known viruses
7909869 that may well be true but theres an awful lot out there that we dont know about
7909870 so designing more effective systems and designing security models to ensure that we dont have these problems is what the course is based around
7909871 we have a strong vetting procedure in the uk we use things like disclosure scotland to ensure that people that were taking on arent coming from a criminal background
7909872 we will take some new measures to ensure that air quality will reach a new level after the olympic games
7909873 whether it is automobile emissions reduction or construction site dust reduction or coal pollution reduction i believe that the requirements will be more stringent
7909874 if they cant resolve the pollution problems they must stop or limit their production
7909875 we have had 100 compliance days in august and nine great single days
7909876 without these measures the current air quality would have been impossible
7909877 i never did that in the past because i didnt want to wake up to a room full of dust
7909878 it will get worse once they are back on the road but it could still be better than it was because of the environmental measures taken regarding the factories
7909879 its most important to note that this was clear it was meant to be a temporary program
7909880 to me the interesting thing is whether the people of beijing now have the political clout with the authoritarian regime there to require change or whether it will go back to business as usual
7909881 but the atmosphere is transient you expect that as soon as the emissions come back the air quality will rapidly reach the levels of before
7909882 if they were to keep some of the dirtier factories shut that would have an effect
7909883 that would be kind of a shift in the stated or unstated national priorities for china
7909884 i think thats really what its going to take its going to need to be either recognition from above or demand from below and its very different there because of the authoritarian regime in the united states its really demand from below
7909885 thanks to the concern of olympic organizers the chinese government and the cooperation of the korean government we have a huge and unprecedented opportunity to observe a large reduction in everyday emissions from a region that is very industrially active
7909886 it will be very interesting to see how this plays out
7909887 i know beijing has done a lot and you have to give them credit for trying to make some progress in this regard you hope that its going to be a long lived thing not just for the olympics
7909888 we have noticed overseas and domestic public opinion has pinned high hopes on the efforts
7909889 that things can be done in the short term to really improve the environment
7909890 what does it matter if i can buy a hydrogen car if i cant get fuel for it
7909891 weve been working some different people at safety some different combinations at safety and hes a great kid
7909892 he worked really hard gave effort every day and i think with anybody thats released at this time the one thing that you always talk to them about it just because it didnt work out here doesnt mean its not going to work out for you
7909893 at this moment in time the computer models show gustav as being a pretty strong threat to the gulf of mexico by early next week
7909894 it could become a category 3 storm as early as sunday which is worrying energy traders that it might disrupt supply coming from the gulf

7909898 lost confidence in the fairfax board and its ability to manage the company through these challenging financial times when its only strategy is to cut editorial staff again and again
7909899 we believe fairfax is abandoning the quality journalism market leaving a hollow ring to david kirks commitment to uphold these values
7909900 media companies fit for the modern media world need to be lean and agile
7909901 management is clearly struggling to deal with how to handle the complex demands of high end quality journalism
7909902 our newspapers will remain true to their heritage and their values of quality and excellence
7909903 in a week when weve invested in the product and we continue to invest in our people the story out of fairfax is that theyre cutting 550 jobs
7909904 to lose 80 journalists i struggle to see how you can do that without affecting quality
7909905 what would produce a solid financial return yesterday will not do so tomorrow
7909906 in the release of our annual results you would have noticed that the metropolitan mastheads financial position has declined
7909907 it would be a shame to see a good property like toorale taken out of production and turned into a national park but if thats what the taxpayers want then so be it
7909908 the government is carefully considering the likely future benefits for the environment and the communities of western nsw

7909922 each of these individuals has a tremendous track record of success which will benefit our company in many ways
7909923 we saw an increase in their confidence in the direction of the overall economy but that was offset by more owners saying theyre having cash flow issues
7909924 their perceptions of the conditions for their own businesses were flat making this gain harder to pin down there is still a great amount of caution out there
7909925 its not that surprising that small business owners are less apt to get involved in the political process
7909926 they are so fiercely independent and hard working that for one they dont have a lot of leftover time or money to donate and two they dont have the lobbying power in congress that larger corporations do

7909936 theres something about a good bomb night after night day after day each majestic scene i witnessed was so terrible and so unexpected that no city would ever again stand innocently fixed in my mind big buildings and wide streets cement and steel were no longer permanent they too were fragile and destructible a torch a bomb a strong enough wind and they too would come undone or get knocked down

7909965 gezielt verl ngert werden n her zu den h usern oder sogar bis in die einzelnen wohnungen
7909966 i think she has one of the toughest speeches of the entire convention
7909967 shes got to basically put together a jigsaw puzzle and its not going to be easy but everybody will be listening
7909968 you can only achieve so much with words if the conviction isnt there
7909969 people will be watching to see how invested hillary clinton will be in the democratic ticket
7909970 shes going to be a powerful advocate for people maybe we havent closed the deal with
7909971 we have to make sure they know how many delegates are voting for her
7909972 she can say i made history but now its time to move on and there may be the another day
7909973 would be interpreted as very big step toward disunity and for all the obama supporters she cant alienate them because they might be her supporters in a future run
7909974 the average battery chicken walks in a very ungainly way they kind of lurch from side to side when they walk this chicken looks a lot more agile and healthy
7909975 if you took the average chicken from a factory farm and plonked it down in a small households backyard in bangalore it wouldnt be able to run away from a cat or dog if it needed to and it would probably get ill very quickly because its immune system is seriously undermined
7909976 this chicken if a dog was trying to catch it could fly away its sturdier and does very well on scavenging household waste
7909977 were encouraging the farmers so that they can have healthy food in their diets and also they can make income make money out of this
7909978 its down to the economics a fast growing breed costs less to produce and therefore costs less to the retailer

7909982 i think itll be a great matchup i would have liked to see it a bit later because of the experience difference but i think its a great matchup
7909983 every time they give us a bunch of opponents but the opponents dont come through now ken shamrock we find out it goes back and forwards he doesnt mind who he fights its really me and randy kotami giving him fighters that he should fight because we want him to have a great career and to put him against a top 10 heavyweight right now is just not a smart thing to do
7909984 it will sell very good i think for cbs its going to do really really good if shamrock would have been on a roll good but he comes off seven losses in eight fights you know i always said ken is a very dangerous guy it doesnt matter if he has five losses in a row but for people theyre gonna say now if kimbos gonna win hes gonna win against a guy with five losses in a row and if he loses to a guy with five losses in a row its never gonna be good
7909985 it doesnt matter it was 95 i beat guys that beat shamrock after that its not a big pressure i think for kimbo maybe its extra motivation to get the guy who gave his trainer his last loss but he didnt even talk about it
7909986 were really looking for a knockout of course and we know ken is going to go for the ground why would ken stand up his ground games really good he should be smart so kimbos stand up is too strong so ken for the ground obviously hes going to go for leg locks its not a big surprise whats going to happen
