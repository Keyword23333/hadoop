8880221 klart mere sp ndende n sten instrueret som en klassisk thriller
8880222 best r den af tydeligt flere lag og er mere begavet
8880223 det havde v ret mest korrekt hvis hun havde svaret at der gjaldt en tommelfingerregel om et tidsforl b p et par uger som g r sagerne mere enkle for det er hendes ministerium klar over og hun taler p sit ministeriums vegne og skal fort lle det som ministeriet ved at hun ikke g r det kan skyldes at hendes embedsfolk ikke har kl dt hende godt nok p eller at hun taler imod bedre vidende
8880224 hun b r svare konkret n r hun bliver spurgt konkret en minister m ikke tr de s meget i vande at man reelt f r svaret upr cist i folketinget det skal v re s dan at n r folketingsmedlemmerne sp rger tilpas konkret skal ministeren svare s der bliver givet et konkret svar der bliver i mine jne spurgt meget konkret over flere gange fra mfernes side det havde v re rigtigst hvis hun havde svaret mere pr cist hun svarer reelt ikke p sp rgsm l som hun ved eller burde vide nok til at svare pr cist p
8880225 man skal v re ekstremt varsom med at tale om brud p ministeransvarsloven vi n rmer os her men det er i den milde ende fordi der er tale om at hun svarer mindre pr cist end hun burde men diskussionen er relevant nok her for det er p en m de en vildledning hvis man ikke svarer pr cist nok
8880226 hun er ikke videre pr cis i sit svar men omvendt g r hun ikke noget forkert eller svarer direkte forkert hun henholder sig sikkert helt bevidst til at hun ikke kan tage konkret stilling fordi det beror p hver enkelt sag retningslinjer er netop retningslinjer og ikke noget konkret der kan bruges i hver enkelt sag som kommer p bordet i udl ndingeservice derfor har hun ret i at det ikke er en automatregel men at man skal tage stilling i hver enkelt sag hun er snu nok til ikke at ville svare p de generelle regler men holder sig til at hun ikke kan sige noget konkret og det er sv rt at kritisere hende for at v re snu
8880227 folketinget er ikke blevet tilstr kkeligt informeret man m forvente af en minister at hun informerer folketinget om alle v sentlige oplysninger n r hun bliver stillet et sp rgsm l
8880228 det er meget uheldigt og utilstr kkeligt at folketinget ikke f r oplysningerne om forklaringen ligger hos ministeren eller i embedsv rket kan jeg ikke vurdere
8880229 man m forvente at integrationsministeriet er organiseret s det sikrer at v sentlige oplysninger n r frem til ministeren en orientering fra udl ndingeservice om at der findes en norm for l ngden af et ophold i udlandet er v sentlige oplysninger det er ikke en undskyldning at ministeriet har modtaget oplysningerne fra udl ndingeservice dagen f r og at der dermed er kort tid til at orientere ministeren desuden har hun jo selv bedt om dem
8880230 embedsv rket har tilsyneladende generelt rent mel i posen ministeren har bedt om en orientering og den har hun f et med redeg relsen st r det klart at ministeren i hvert tilf lde fra 15 maj har vidst at der fandtes en norm i udl ndingeservice for hvor l nge det var n dvendigt at opholde sig i udlandet hun har selv bedt om en orientering fra udl ndingeservice og den har hun f et

8880239 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8880240 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way
8880241 the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8880242 he obama promised he would cut taxes for 95 per cent of working americans and that he would cut the capital gains tax for small businesses but nobody can out tax cut the republicans theyre down with both of those things and theyd like to eliminate the capital gains tax entirely
8880243 he made promises of becoming independent of middle eastern oil in ten years john mccain says the same thing anyone can make that promise its a very shallow one he called for clean coal as if there is any such thing and he promises to rebuild the united states military that basically is a promise to increase the military budget
8880244 i think it obamas speech was progressive obama laid out a vision of hope very much like john kenedy the former us president but he buttressed that message of hope with specific plans how he plans to fund it
8880245 he did make an attempt tonight at least to be specific about tax policies and people are going to be excited about that and i think the overall intention here was to win the votes of those who are independent those who might be wavering on the fence and certainly those who are supporters of hillary clinton who had also run for the nomination before backing obama
8880246 to mention the march on washington and to not mention the fact that the majority of people there were african americans and they were there because they had racial grievances with america and they want to bring this to the attention of the powers that be and desire some change i just found that unusual that that wasnt mentioned

8880262 there have been other cycles where even though we all were like ok were going to fight the good fight it was very hard to believe it was actually possible
8880263 colorado has always been a tough state and it will be a tough state but as i have traveled around some 25 counties in the last few weeks i can tell you that i have never in my history here in this state seen the kind of presence for a presidential campaign that we have from s campaign
8880264 i have never seen a presidential campaign propose to have more than 20 offices opened up all around
8880265 were going to have just as good or better of an organization
8880266 now that we have our nominee republicans will be coming out
8880267 do you want to lose one leg or both legs

8880275 if we start seeming like that we lose our comparative advantage which is our supporters enthusiasm
8880276 we have to check ourselves on a daily basis for brand erosion
8880277 he will read everything baracks going to do or say just to get a sense of whether it seems like old politics
8880278 barack obama would like to see a different style of politics and i would too
8880279 but i think the reality is the political scene today is the way its been for a long time
8880280 we took a deep breath after a few days and recognized that we were quickly becoming what we were running against
8880281 the people in this country are tired of that harsh back and forth
8880282 youve got to be mindful that if you go too far youre going to turn them off

8880284 if first time buyers were given a very substantial grant in the order of 30 000 that would act as a stimulus for the industry
8880285 buyers cannot afford the substantial deposits that are being asked of them and until such time as they can get mortgages of 90 and 95 they wont be buying houses in the same numbers as they used to

8880351 svendita ad air france che il governo prodi intendeva realizzare
8880352 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
8880353 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
8880354 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
8880355 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
8880356 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza
8880357 in condizioni meno favorevoli per litalia per i lavoratori i consumatori e gli azionisti
8880358 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani scaricando il buco dellalitalia sulle spalle dei cittadini
8880359 per valutare limpatto che il nuovo piano di ristrutturazione di alitalia avr sulla citt di roma

8880365 il consiglio dei ministri ha espresso parere favorevole in merito al ritorno al maestro unico per la scuola primaria ha detto il ministro il provvedimento sar contenuto nel piano programmatico per la scuola contenuto nella finanziaria e su cui stiamo lavorando con il ministro tremonti

8880371 quello di sapere ispirare la gente infondere la speranza guidarla verso un orizzonte pi alto ha lintelligenza e la curiosit che non possono mancare in un presidente ha mostrato di avere una chiara comprensione della politica estera delle sfide sul fronte della sicurezza nazionale e una ferma determinazione a rimettere in sesto le nostre forze armate
8880372 il mio candidato non ha vinto ha voluto sottolineare ma sono orgoglioso della sua campagna elettorale e di tutta la gente che lha sostenuta hillary far di tutto per appoggiare obama e cos siamo in due anzi siamo 18 milioni
8880373 voglio che tutti sappiano che sono orgoglioso di avere joe biden e tutta la sua famiglia al mio fianco per riprenderci lamerica

8880431 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8880432 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8880433 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8880434 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8880435 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8880436 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8880437 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8880438 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8880439 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8880440 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8880441 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8880442 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8880443 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8880444 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8880445 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8880446 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8880447 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8880448 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8880449 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8880450 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8880451 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8880452 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8880453 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8880454 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8880455 who are open to doing something on the production side
8880456 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8880457 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8880458 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8880459 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8880460 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8880461 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8880462 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8880463 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8880464 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8880465 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8880466 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8880467 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8880468 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8880469 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8880470 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8880471 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8880472 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

8880486 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8880487 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8880488 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8880489 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8880490 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8880491 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8880492 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8880493 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8880494 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8880495 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8880496 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8880497 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8880498 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8880499 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

8880508 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8880509 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8880510 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8880511 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8880512 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8880513 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8880514 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8880515 for a long time hro suppliers were mostly focused on larger companies with 15 000 employees or more serving these companies involves more complexity more customization requirements and much longer implementation timeframes than the mid market would require
8880516 to take advantage of the barely penetrated mid level market suppliers have developed profitable offerings by leveraging economies of scale and standardized solutions this is why were seeing a significant increase in hro suppliers including offshore suppliers and offerings focused on the mid market buyer and this in turn is really good for the buyer because they now have more suppliers and offerings from which to choose the issue now becomes how to choose wisely
8880517 with mid market buyers suppliers can potentially look at a higher profit margin given the relatively higher price points in the mid market lower pursuit implementation and operational costs and the ability to create economies of scale through adoption of one to many solutions
8880518 as of december 2007 116 out of 229 hro transactions were in the mid market segment although the current hro penetration levels are low in the mid market reflecting the relative immaturity of this segment yet they indicate significant growth potential besides americas and europe which represent a huge market potential of 5450 and 6350 companies respectively asia pacific too holds a huge hro market potential with as many as 5050 companies however with just 3 hro transactions in the asia pacific the current penetration is a low 0 1
8880519 suppliers need to understand the unique characteristics of the 3k 15k employees segment as they target this market solution offerings are significantly different between the 3k 15k segment and the gt 15k in terms of service delivery requirements how they are sold implemented and operated the suppliers need to ensure that both their technology strategy and organizational structure are aligned to make that happen

8880529 we will use this period productively and revisit the plans for the stadium to increase its capacity to 73 000 seats
8880530 i think they will be the most difficult because they are regulars in the champions league and have more experience

8880536 smallholder farmers in africa need to be empowered to become rural entrepreneurs who can build productive and profitable partnerships with the private sector
8880537 too often agriculture is seen as an unproductive and unprofitable sector
8880538 but the truth is that agriculture and those tilling the land men and women smallholder farmers have the capacity to feed the world while managing and protecting some of the key assets of our global environment
8880539 smallholder farmers do not need hand outs or short term fixes they need effective innovative and sustained investment

8880544 the entrance of intel into client and enterprise ssds will expand the market in the near term as another credible ssd supplier joins the ranks of samsung stec toshiba and potential challengers sandisk and micron
8880545 however longer term intel poses a serious competitive threat as a stand alone supplier or as a possible partner for example seagate has publicly stated that it is interested in pursuing enterprise grade ssd
8880546 sandisk also would be challenged by intels presence because sandisk has been slow to get its next generation ssd to market and does not have the enterprise relationships necessary to quickly penetrate the enterprise segment
8880547 this is especially true because sandisks strength is in retail and there will be limited traction of ssds in retail for at least the next three years
8880548 weve refined our manufacturing techniques and redesigned our low density ssds to get what the low priced pc market is looking for in the way of improved cost performance and availability

8880562 pre season is about getting your best players available and at a level available for leicester in the guinness premiership
8880563 tomorrow is a continuation of that process and i think we are in pretty good shape

8880628 we all realized there was a systematic plan by the state and the national guard
8880629 they intended to criminalize the activity that was being carried out by the yukpa and their allies
8880630 how can a fully armed and equipped military official actually call us paramilitaries

8880694 the afp has concluded its active inquiries although some long standing overseas inquiries are yet to be fully resolved the afp said in a statement
8880695 at the present time there is insufficient evidence to institute proceedings against dr haneef for any criminal offence
8880696 delighted at the news but wanted an apology from the government and as yet unspecified damages
8880697 we are ready to negotiate the terms of any apology and a damages settlement with the government so as to avoid the unnecessary expense and further angst of civil litigation mr hodgson said
8880698 a matter for further down the track after a federal government inquiry into the case
8880699 he still loves australia but no decision has been made about whether hell come back to australia and if so when
8880700 it is hard to know with the afp they dont deal with things with a straight bat he told the abc
8880701 so only time will tell but it would be comforting for him to know that the afp no longer regard him as a suspect in any wrongdoing in australia or elsewhere
8880702 the continued claims by mr keelty that dr haneef was a person of interest which is the police euphemism for a suspect has continued and exacerbated the damage to dr haneefs reputation that the unreasonable and unjustified actions of july 2 2007 had already caused he said
8880703 the long delayed admission by the afp that theres no basis for suggesting that dr haneef had committed any criminal offence must surely call into question mr keeltys tenure in his present position mr hodgson said
8880704 it also heightens the need for the clarke inquiry to be given royal commission powers and widened terms of reference so that the afps continued efforts over the last 13 months to destroy dr haneefs good name and reputation can also be investigated
8880705 whatever can be done to have him come back to this country should be done greens leader bob brown said
8880706 but you couldnt blame him if he didnt want to risk it a second time

8880728 die stadionauswahl ist der erste meilenstein auf dem weg zur n chsten wm in deutschland auch jenseits der gro en arenen die wir von der wm 2006 kennen konnten wir einmal mehr feststellen wie sensationell gut die stadien hierzulande sind auch in st dten wie augsburg sinsheim und dresden wo momentan die bagger rollen werden schmuckk stchen entstehen auf die sich die fans in den regionen freuen k nnen
8880729 wir stehen vor dem spagat einerseits eine auch wirtschaftlich vern nftige anzahl an spielen je spielort zu garantieren andererseits aber die insgesamt 32 begegnungen auf m glichst viele st dte im ganzen land verteilen zu wollen

8880739 there are little gearbox things here and there but with the engine freeze allegedly going on at the moment its hard to find improvements in that area
8880740 aerodynamics is a huge window of opportunity for cars to be developed during course of the year thats where this car has improved a lot from last year as has everybody elses
8880741 in the last few races youve seen renault and toyota jump away from us and probably a lot of that is down to aero
8880742 i dont like the way i am being treated so im gonna take my ball and go home

8880744 toyota are a team that have been up and down really throughout their history perhaps less so this year than previously

8880767 these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8880768 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain
8880769 what i will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes

8880777 if we come to the irrevocable conclusion that we should have an election its not because we have polls that are any different than anybody else

8880783 we dont want one he has a big responsibility not to start one
8880784 we are in a situation which marks a clear end to the relative and growing calm in and around europe since the collapse of the soviet union
8880785 the current crisis in the caucasus does not mark the return of the cold war nor is it likely to mark the start of open warfare between russia and the west
8880786 it is more simply the return of the traditional imperialism practiced by the russian empire more than a century ago
8880787 russia knows that when it comes to conducting a serious foreign and security policy europe is all mouth
8880788 i doubt whether anything tougher than strongly worded communiques will ever be employed
8880789 among our partners there are indeed some who apparently are not so clear about the fact that anyone who goes out through a door must know how to get back in
8880790 once russia sees it has reached none of its strategic goals
8880791 russia will be forced to step back revisit its position and come to a more rational approach to georgia
8880792 russia knows well that the us is involved in conflicts in several parts of the world where it needs russias support such as afghanistan

8880808 not just out reach out to our members and tell them what were doing but because we get a lot of good ideas from them
8880809 i tend to have close relationships with the campaigns team the licensing expert and the new membership coordinator and have at least weekly conversations with those staff members on particular issues and projects
8880810 we have to work carefully with support from the community and from a very small financial base

8880826 we are not sure where this story came from but as prime minister gordon will be focused on running the country and the party will be focused on running the by election
8880827 gordon brown has come under intense pressure from cabinet colleagues to break with prime ministerial convention and campaign in the crucial glenrothes by election
8880828 gordon got the flak for glasgow east even though he did not go there he is going to get the flak for glenrothes even though he goes and we lose he might as well go
8880829 theres no question about it he has to go and campaign this time because this is his home political territory by going he would lift morale by not going he would be sending a terrible message to labour people on the ground that the seat isnt worth fighting for
8880830 i hope that gordon brown will rise to the challenge of campaigning in his own backyard so that the voters can see for themselves the choices on offer
8880831 it is time for him to stop running scared and to stand up and be counted i will be in glenrothes will he

8880840 as he weighs a bid to rewrite new york citys term limits mayor michael r bloomberg is encountering an unlikely group of opponents his own aides three of mr bloomberg s most trusted advisers at city hall deputy mayors edward skyler patricia e harris and kevin sheekey have confided to associates that they oppose revising the citys election laws so that he can seek a third term according to people familiar with the conversations
8880841 the deputy mayors have told associates that any campaign to change term limits which restrict citywide elected offices to two consecutive four year terms could be viewed as an undemocratic end run around voters who approved the current laws twice in 1993 and 1996 they fear that a third term could produce unexpected crises that might tarnish mr bloomberg s strong record the fate of mayor edward i koch s administration
8880842 even so his flirtation with making the change has left his closest advisers unsettled their biggest fear is that a mayor who built a reputation as an anti politician and common sense problem solver will appear self serving and power hungry

8880908 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8880909 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8880910 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8880911 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8880912 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8880913 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8880914 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8880915 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8880916 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8880917 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8880918 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8880919 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8880920 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8880921 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8880922 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8880923 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8880924 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8880925 spa is a fantastic race track with unique corners and a very special character
8880926 its very impressive the way the cars come roaring along downhill and then accelerate uphill again in the current race calendar spa is the nearest gp circuit to my home town of m nchengladbach and thats another reason for me to look forward to the belgian grand prix where ill be aiming to achieve a good result
8880927 from my point of view the race in spa is one of the best grands prix in the calendar
8880928 the circuit is very long and very tricky you have to find the right balance and the right configuration of the car in order not to lose any lap time another crucial factor is the weather in belgium it can rain in one sector and it can be dry in another sector i am really looking forward to the race
8880929 spa francorchamps is one of the specialities in the formula one calendar
8880930 spa may not be the track with the highest speeds that accolade belongs to monza but in spa we have the longest stretch taken at full throttle
8880931 nicks f1 08 is scheduled to take on a new bmw p86 8 engine with a new transmission while robert will be driving with the same engine and gear box as in valencia in the first two thirds of the season we didnt have a single retirement caused by any technical fault we aim to maintain this high level of reliability on the sporting side we plan to improve further and see both cars finish solidly in the points at spa
8880932 spa is one of the last natural circuits remaining in the calendar and therefore ranks among the classics
8880933 venga por las pizzas qu dese por el se or
8880934 era un genio pero muri pobre le atropell un tranv a
8880935 eh joey dame la cuenta que aqu hay unos chicos que quieren darme dinero y no saben cuanto
8880936 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8880937 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8880938 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8880939 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8880940 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8880941 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8880942 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8880943 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8880944 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8880945 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8880946 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8880947 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8880948 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8880949 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8880950 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8880951 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8880952 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8880953 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8880954 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8880955 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
8880956 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
8880957 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
8880958 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8880959 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8880960 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8880961 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8880962 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8880963 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8880964 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8880965 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8880966 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8880967 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8880968 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8880969 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8880970 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8880971 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8880972 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8880973 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8880974 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8880975 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8880976 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8880977 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8880978 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8880979 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8880980 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8880981 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8880982 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8880983 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8880984 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8880985 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8880986 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8880987 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8880988 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8880989 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8880990 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8880991 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8880992 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8880993 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8880994 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8880995 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8880996 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8880997 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8880998 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8880999 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8881000 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8881001 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8881002 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8881003 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8881004 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8881005 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
8881006 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8881007 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8881008 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8881009 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8881010 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8881011 no one works for someone we all just work together
8881012 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8881013 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8881014 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8881015 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

8881116 id feel so stupid if i ruined my chances of graduating because i plagiarized
8881117 but it seems like such an easy mistake to make
8881118 in regards to the overall caseload i would say that most of our academic dishonesty cases are plagiarism cases
8881119 with new plagiarism software like turnitin com it is now so easy to detect plagiarism and this could possibly be the reason for the influx of plagiarism cases
8881120 we talk to all incoming freshman at preview so every single freshman is aware of the honor code
8881121 its one way we try to be proactive while only so many people get it they all hear the message
8881122 i am nervous about fall semester because i did not learn how to cite essays in high school
8881123 i attended the workshop at preview and i hope i can remember all the rules
8881124 i think navigating the swamp will remind me of all the rules i forgot from the workshop at preview
8881125 getting in trouble for plagiarism can be avoided so im definitely going to take all the precautions and learn all the rules
8881126 i dont think they fully prepared us to understand how to write properly
8881127 so i believe a writing workshop is necessary especially for grad students who are teachers assistants

8881132 landlords outside of london and the south east experienced considerable price increases between 2003 and 2008 and subsequently made substantial returns on their investment properties
8881133 however with these returns came large tax burdens and it is clear that those who sat tight and waited to sell in q2 2008 instead of q1 really saw the benefit of the governments cgt reform
8881134 the boards priority has been to ensure that we can continue to fund our business safely and we have achieved this with a strong capital base following our rights issue our new chief executive richard pym will review our plans for the business to enable us to continue to operate effectively in these economic conditions
8881135 the whole thing has been ridiculous and has made me think twice about ever using endsleigh again
8881136 the bike was a 21st birthday present and as such was priceless to me i locked it up properly using a substantial lock but after i filed my claim i was told that because i hadnt removed the saddle and front wheel the company wouldnt pay out even though the whole bike was taken they told me that this was stipulated in the policy which was complete news to me only when i looked at the small print did this point emerge
8881137 endsleigh market themselves to students and the idea that everyone would be forced to take their front wheels and saddles into their lectures is completely unworkable
8881138 endsleigh has updated its policies this year so that customers do not now need to remove the front wheel saddle or any other part of the bicycle in order to be covered from theft we recognised that this was often impractical for policyholders and so have updated our cover in order to make things easier for our customers although ms khanams older policy clearly stated that they should be removed in order for it to be covered we have decided to retrospectively pay her claim in light of the updated policies and as a goodwill gesture to a valued customer
8881139 the growth opportunity for off deck services continues to grow globally weve seen phenomenal growth in markets in south asia and africa and in the coming year we expect to see this growth to include markets in europe and usa
8881140 the common footprints we have make this a strategic relationship for developing our media properties particularly in south africa india and thailand we look forward to working closely with the group to ramp up our growth
8881141 the past year for us has also been marked by partnerships with some of the worlds leading wap publishers and mobile digital agencies buzzcity has been on an aggressive development programme and secured overwhelming interest from businesses to be part of our growth plans
8881142 users are clearly loving what buzzcity is offering the number of users has grown exponentially and traffic to mygamma network of partner sites has exceeded 6 billion pageviews in the first 6 months of 2008
8881143 the market opportunity for buzzcity is clear buzzcitys mygamma community has made stunning headway in the mobile social networking space reaching 2 7 million users across 70 countries as an off deck application it has successfully applied the d2c business model in an operator dominated market and established a strong advertising base that hit 1 7 billion paid ad impressions in july 2008 alone

8881149 if he was out flying he would come by and buzz the camp
8881150 he was definitely fun to be around a loyal and loving family member
8881151 he took me for a plane ride at littlebrook one time and when we came in for a landing he continued full speed down the runway and took off again at the last possible moment he really scared the hell out of me and my mother we will really miss him
8881152 i remember when he babysat us as children he literally went around the house with an apron on taking care of us he continued his military legacy by assigning demerits to us for bad behavior
8881153 if you want to know when we did something just go to bobbys records

8881164 50 of the most legendary musical motion pictures of all time
8881165 the afp has concluded its active inquiries although some long standing overseas inquiries are yet to be fully resolved the afp said in a statement
8881166 at the present time there is insufficient evidence to institute proceedings against dr haneef for any criminal offence
8881167 delighted at the news but wanted an apology from the government and as yet unspecified damages
8881168 we are ready to negotiate the terms of any apology and a damages settlement with the government so as to avoid the unnecessary expense and further angst of civil litigation mr hodgson said
8881169 a matter for further down the track after a federal government inquiry into the case
8881170 he still loves australia but no decision has been made about whether hell come back to australia and if so when
8881171 it is hard to know with the afp they dont deal with things with a straight bat he told the abc
8881172 so only time will tell but it would be comforting for him to know that the afp no longer regard him as a suspect in any wrongdoing in australia or elsewhere
8881173 the continued claims by mr keelty that dr haneef was a person of interest which is the police euphemism for a suspect has continued and exacerbated the damage to dr haneefs reputation that the unreasonable and unjustified actions of july 2 2007 had already caused he said
8881174 the long delayed admission by the afp that theres no basis for suggesting that dr haneef had committed any criminal offence must surely call into question mr keeltys tenure in his present position mr hodgson said
8881175 it also heightens the need for the clarke inquiry to be given royal commission powers and widened terms of reference so that the afps continued efforts over the last 13 months to destroy dr haneefs good name and reputation can also be investigated
8881176 whatever can be done to have him come back to this country should be done greens leader bob brown said
8881177 but you couldnt blame him if he didnt want to risk it a second time
8881178 the last government owes both him and his country an apology it should come from john howard senator brown said
8881179 this all started because we asked our customers what they liked about our stores and what they didnt like
8881180 more cosmetic changes like changing signs and names are creative but dont address that more fundamental problem of competitive pricing
8881181 it is just not like the state stores when i grew up they are very well run well prepared
8881182 we put in a really decent performance on saturday we played some good football
8881183 although they put us under some pressure in the first half for long periods we always looked like wed hold out
8881184 we defended well where last year we would have cracked
8881185 that is more punishment than any probation or any period of incarceration
8881186 hell be told what to do when to do it and why by the u s army
8881187 the court found that mister redrow was not the cause of those serious injuries
8881188 this was a very serious case with some very serious injuries
8881189 military service will be a very eye opening experience for him
8881190 it will make him take responsibilities for his actions as well as take care of others
8881191 the study has shown for the first time that metabolic response to brain tumour treatment can be detected earlier and faster by metabolic imaging instead of through structural imaging or assessment of the neurological status of a patient
8881192 frequent use of this type of imaging may be a useful tool to follow a patients response to chemotherapy for malignant brain tumours
8881193 we strongly recommend restrictions in the use of thiazolidinediones the class of drugs and question the rationale for leaving rosiglitazone on the market
8881194 at this time justification for use of thiazolidinediones is very weak to non existent
8881195 further compound their already increased risk of developing ischemic heart disease
8881196 represent conditions that are major precursors of congestive heart failure
8881197 the channel senses the pressure inside the bacteria as a result the channel alters its shape and creates an opening releasing the pressure
8881198 the motion is just like that of a camera iris and being able to see this motion is an amazing discovery
8881199 not only is this a major step forward in scientific understanding of a fundamental process in biology but it paves the way for the development of new drugs against bacteria
8881200 new chemicals forcing channels to stay open or shut are likely to kill or at the very least greatly slow down the growth of bacteria slowing down the growth gives the bodys natural defences time to tackle its bacterial invader

8881208 they the bjp are trying to take the amarnath issue to other parts of the country to create communal disharmony but it is clear that their efforts have failed miserably
8881209 today the agitation is purely political and is being conducted with a vested interest despite the fact that there is no real underlying issue
8881210 the statements and activities of bjp also give an opportunity to antinational elements in the valley to mobilise counter protests giving rise to calls of azadi
8881211 this is the highest ever number of pilgrims in over 20 years
8881212 we are proud to be enabling these activities to happen and to see the excitement of the pupils as they start to discover the opportunities available in this industry
8881213 this is an investment in the future and we need fresh blood to help us meet the challenges we are facing this is an exciting time in this industry and courses like this help to involve young people and open their eyes to it
8881214 this kind of course gives the students a taste of university life and a genuine insight into the real life challenges faced by engineers in the nuclear sector we see this as a successful collaboration which works for everyone involved
8881215 its a difficult battle more of a struggle that our family goes through

8881217 what im trying to say is if you were not planning on living long why would you buy that boat
8881218 i think the impact is that they have raised the level of als research to a level we wouldnt have been able to receive without their efforts
8881219 not just on the money side either he has really boosted the level of research but he has also brought attention to the disease that didnt have it before he has given greater hope
8881220 it is important for my mental outlook not to be viewed as someone who has no ability to help others
8881221 my entire life was helping people get fit and now i have a new passion helping people have help
8881222 the petty things we worried about before go out the door
8881223 the life we have we play it out the best we can
8881224 what i am looking forward to is the day that i no longer have als

8881232 my wife and i intend to retire sell up buy a boat and go sailing that is while we are still young and fit enough to do so
8881233 i have a contract which goes until christmas next year and i suspect by that time i will simply retire and simply disappear
8881234 you will not find me re emerging as an aspiring politician or in any other field
8881235 i hope to be extremely quiet and hopefully a long way away taking the sun on a coral atoll
8881236 im not retiring im not doing a tony blair if anyone has told you i am retiring they are mistaken
8881237 reports of my demise are sadly exaggerated it is not happening ive got work to do
8881238 i will retire one day i will die one day but not any time soon
8881239 whilst we remain alert to the impact of difficult economic conditions our outlook for the remainder of 2008 remains unchanged

8881252 when the residential flats project was pulled we lost potential turnover and faced the costs already incurred though we werent quite on site if the client had gone bust when we were part way through the build process it would have been much worse

8881302 this is significant in two ways one is that we can avoid the ethical issues of stem cells because wisdom teeth are destined to be thrown away anyway
8881303 also we used teeth that had been extracted three years ago and had been preserved in a freezer that means that its easy for us to stock this source of stem cells
8881304 because extractions of wisdom teeth are commonly operated in dental clinics we can expect a lot of donors of stem cells

8881314 recent studies have shown that a significant proportion of eukaryotic genes are mispredicted at the transcript level
8881315 as the mispred routines are able to detect many of these errors and may aid in their correction we suggest that it may significantly improve the quality of protein sequence data based on gene predictions
8881316 to a much lesser extent than uniprotkb trembl or the ensembl or gnomon predicted entries
8881317 some secreted proteins may truly lack secretory signal peptides since they are subject to leaderless protein secretion similarly it cannot be excluded at present that transchromosomal chimeras can be formed and may have normal physiological functions

8881337 i had an offer to stay on at united in 2007 but there is no talk about that now
8881338 it isnt 100 percent that henke will stay with us
8881339 we havent talked to henke about this he hasnt told us that he is looking at offers so that i do not know about that possibility
8881340 we fully appreciate henke in one respect this is football related but it is also for how much he means for the club but i neither want to nor can speculate now
8881341 its a fantastic club and i had great times there
8881342 the supporters were brilliant i joined when they were second bottom of the championship and 92 games later we were in the top league for the first time in 20 odd years
8881343 i was just upset about the way it ended about what was going on i had no problem apart from with one person and some around him
8881344 you will never hear me mention his name i never have and i never will i dont want to sully myself i will never get over how i think he treated me and my family
8881345 simon has nothing to be aggrieved about as he played a lot of games last year
8881346 his performances had dipped and i just told him the facts
8881347 he was probably man of the match in a lot of games last season but those games were always the big ones
8881348 hed be outstanding at parkhead ibrox and tynecastle but we were losing other matches and i told him he had to perform the same way in them
8881349 i left him out whether he liked it or not
8881350 he took everything on board though and cant be doing too badly because he got himself into the jamaican national squad in the summer
8881351 simons own words to me not long after i signed him were that he needed someone to be at him all the time to get the best out of him
8881352 pablo zabaleta and albert riera have not taken part of this mornings training session with espanyol in order to avoid any risk before completing their transfers to manchester city and liverpool respectively
8881353 whereas the four year deal between zabaleta and city is complete with the sky blues having assured espanyol they are to pay the players contract cancellation sum 8 million rieras transfer is to be resolved in the next few hours
8881354 it could have been the track that he didnt like it could have been the ground of it could have been both
8881355 but he came back fine there was nothing physically wrong and we will press ahead with training him for the leger
8881356 he may also run in the leger but we will decide late on whether he takes his chance
8881357 we need someone from the highest level to clarify for all of us administrators players and referees
8881358 is striking with the open hand to the face of a player not a category 2 offence which will result in a penalty of four weeks we need that clarified at the highest level to clear up the confusion
8881359 the official guide of the gaa says that a category 2 offence which is punishable by a four week suspension includes striking or attempting to strike with the hand
8881360 now it was clear for all to see that aidan omahony was struck with the hand on sunday and the degree of force has nothing at all to do with it
8881361 its the horses people say im riding better than ever done but really i dont feel it its just the horses
8881362 its so exciting going to ride those horses id walk to ballydoyle if i had to
8881363 aidan knows all the teams and everyone in the team we all know about the effort he puts in so we dont mind working as hard as he does
8881364 but its not just that its the atmosphere horses pick up on atmosphere
8881365 aidan is the one who creates the atmosphere in the yard
8881366 ive worked with some great trainers and i know he obrien makes them some people are just better than other sat what they do
8881367 declans a very successful coach and i think hell do very well
8881368 if i can get performances going for london irish you never know
8881369 its early stages of the season and we need to get guys on the park integrate them as i said with the guys who have already had a run as much as we can try out combinations see how they work and go from there

8881470 nations with binding commitments have not i repeat have not delivered on those commitments
8881471 the most effective initiative though politically difficult would be a major expansion in quotas for skilled immigrants
8881472 perhaps 150 000 of those are loosely classified as skilled
8881473 a double or tripling of this number would markedly accelerate the absorption of unsold housing inventory for sale and hence help stabilize prices
8881474 if unions raise wage rates in a particular occupation or industry they necessarily make the amount of employment available in that occupation or industry less than it otherwise would be just as any higher price cuts down the amount purchased the effect is an increased number of persons seeking other jobs which forces down wages in other occupations since unions have generally been strongest among groups that would have been high paid anyway their effect has been to make high paid workers higher paid at the expense of lower paid workers unions have therefore not only harmed the public at large and workers as a whole by distorting the use of labor they have also made the incomes of the working class more unequal by reducing the opportunities available to the most disadvantaged workers
8881475 unions have generally been strongest among groups that would have been high paid anyway their effect has been to make high paid workers higher paid at the expense of lower paid workers

8881508 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
8881509 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
8881510 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
8881511 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
8881512 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8881513 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

8881518 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8881519 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8881520 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8881521 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

8881532 in brief for the united states eurasian geostrategy involves the purposeful management of geostrategically dynamic states and the careful handling of geopolitically catalytic states in keeping with the twin interests of america in the short term preservation of its unique global power and in the long run transformation of it into increasingly institutionalized global cooperation to put it in a terminology that hearkens back to the more brutal age of ancient empires the three grand imperatives of imperial geostrategy are to prevent collusion and maintain security dependence among the vassals to keep tributaries pliant and protected and to keep the barbarians from coming together
8881533 the issue of how a globally engaged america copes with the complex eurasian power relationships and particularly whether it prevents the emergence of a dominant and antagonistic eurasian power remains central to americas capacity to exercise global primacy
8881534 a geostrategic issue of crucial importance is posed by chinas emergence as a major power the most appealing outcome would be to co opt a democratizing and free marketing china into a larger asian regional framework of cooperation
8881535 in effect japan should be americas global partner in tackling the new agenda of world affairs a regionally preeminent china should become americas far eastern anchor in the more traditional domain of power politics helping thereby to foster a eurasian balance of power with greater china in eurasias east matching in that respect the role of an enlarging europe in eurasias west
8881536 in brief america as the worlds premier power does face a narrow window of historical opportunity
8881537 the sudden emergence of the first and only global power has created a situation in which an equally quick end to its supremacy either because of americas withdrawal from the world or because of the sudden emergence of a successful rival would produce massive international instability
8881538 in that context for some time to come for more than a generation americas status as the worlds premier power is unlikely to be contested by any single challenger
8881539 accordingly once american leadership begins to fade americas current global predominance is unlikely to be replicated by any single state
8881540 what will america bequeath to the world as the enduring legacy of its primacy
8881541 meeting these challenges is americas burden as well as its unique responsibility
8881542 in brief the u s policy goal must be unapologetically twofold to perpetuate americas own dominant position for at least a generation and preferably longer still and to create a geopolitical framework that can absorb the inevitable shocks and strains of social political change while evolving into the geopolitical core of shared responsibility for peaceful global management a prolonged phase of gradually expanding cooperation with key eurasian partners both stimulated and arbitrated by america can also help to foster the preconditions for an eventual upgrading of the existing and increasingly antiquated un united nations structures a new distribution of responsibilities and privileges can then take into account the changed realities of global power so drastically different from those of 1945
8881543 by pioneering in the integration of nation states into a shared supranational economic and eventually political union europe is also pointing the way toward larger forms of postnational organization beyond the narrow visions and the destructive passions of the age of nationalism
8881544 in the current circumstances the expansion of nato to include poland the czech republic and hungary probably by 1999 appears to be likely after this initial but significant step it is likely that any subsequent expansion of the alliance will either be coincidental with or will follow the expansion of the eu the latter involves a much more complicated process both in the number of qualifying stages and in the meeting of membership requirements see chart on page 83 thus even the first admissions into the eu from central europe are not likely before the year 2002 or perhaps somewhat later nonetheless after the first three new nato members have also joined the eu both the eu and nato will have to address the question of extending membership to the baltic republics slovenia romania bulgaria and slovakia and perhaps also eventually to ukraine
8881545 it follows therefore that states that are in a position to begin and are invited to undertake accession talks with the eu should automatically also be viewed henceforth as subject in effect to natos presumptive protection
8881546 given the growing consensus regarding the desirability of admitting the nations of central europe into both the eu and nato the practical meaning of this question focuses attention on the future status of the baltic republics and perhaps also that of ukraine
8881547 a geostrategic issue of crucial importance is posed by chinas emergence as a major power the most appealing outcome would be to co opt a democratizing and free marketing china into
8881548 the united states would do well to consider the adoption of an american japanese free trade agreement thereby creating a common american japanese economic space such a step formalizing the growing linkage between the two economies would provide the geopolitical underpinning both for americas continued presence in the far east and for japans constructive global engagement
8881549 tokyo can carve out a globally influential role by cooperating closely with the united states regarding what might be called the new agenda of global concerns while avoiding any futile and potentially counterproductive effort to become a regional power itself the task of american statesmanship should hence be to steer japan in that direction an american japanese free trade agreement creating a common economic space would fortify the connection and promote the goal and hence its utility should be jointly examined
8881550 a transatlantic free trade agreement already advocated by a number of prominent atlantic leaders could also mitigate the risk of growing economic rivalry between a more united eu and the united states in any case the eus eventual success in burying the centuries old european nationalist antagonisms with their globally disruptive effects would be well worth some gradual diminution in americas decisive role as eurasias current arbitrator
8881551 it is also a fact that america is too democratic at home to be autocratic abroad
8881552 a genuinely populist democracy has never before attained international supremacy the pursuit of power and especially the economic costs and human sacrifice that the exercise of such power often requires are not generally congenial to democratic instincts
8881553 indeed the critical uncertainty regarding the future may well be whether america might become the first superpower unable or unwilling to wield its power might it become an impotent global power
8881554 in that context for some time to come for more than a generation americas status as the worlds premier power is unlikely to be contested by any single challenger no nation state is likely to match america in the four key dimensions of power military economic technological and cultural that cumulatively produce decisive global political clout
8881555 moreover most americans by and large do not derive any special gratification from their countrys new status as the sole global superpower
8881556 more generally cultural change in america may also be uncongenial to the sustained exercise abroad of genuinely imperial power that exercise requires a high degree of doctrinal motivation intellectual commitment and patriotic gratification yet the dominant culture of the country has become increasingly fixated on mass entertainment that has been heavily dominated by personally hedonistic and socially escapist themes the cumulative effect has made it increasingly difficult to mobilize the needed political consensus on behalf of sustained and also occasionally costly american leadership abroad mass communications have been playing a particularly important role in that regard generating a strong revulsion against any selective use of force that entails even low levels of casualties
8881557 in addition both america and western europe have been finding it difficult to cope with the cultural consequences of social hedonism and the dramatic decline in the centrality of religious based values in society the parallels with the decline of the imperial systems summarized in chapter 1 rome for example are striking in that respect the resulting cultural crisis has been compounded by the spread of drugs and especially in america by its linkage to the racial issue lastly the rate of economic growth is no longer able to keep up with growing material expectations with the latter stimulated by a culture that places a premium on consumption
8881558 moreover as america becomes an increasingly multicultural society it may find it more difficult to fashion a consensus on foreign policy issues except in the circumstances of a truly massive and widely perceived direct external threat such a consensus generally existed throughout world war ii and even during the cold war
8881559 it is also a fact that america is too democratic at home to be autocratic abroad this limits the use of americas power especially its capacity for military intimidation never before has a populist democracy attained international supremacy but the pursuit of power is not a goal that commands popular passion except in conditions of a sudden threat or challenge to the publics sense of domestic well being the economic self denial that is defense spending and the human sacrifice casualties even among professional soldiers required in the effort are uncongenial to democratic instincts democracy is inimical to imperial mobilization
8881560 a possible challenge to american primacy from islamic fundamentalism could be part of the problem in this unstable region by exploiting religious hostility to the american way of life and taking advantage of the arab israeli conflict islamic fundamentalism could undermine several pro western middle eastern governments and eventually jeopardize american regional interests especially in the persian gulf however without political cohesion and in the absence of a single genuinely powerful islamic state a challenge from islamic fundamentalism would lack a geopolitical core and would thus be more likely to express itself through diffuse violence
8881561 it is also noteworthy that international conflicts and acts of terrorism have so far been remarkably devoid of any use of the weapons of mass destruction how long that self restraint may hold is inherently unpredictable but the increasing availability not only to states but also to organized groups of the means to inflict massive casualties by the use of nuclear or bacteriological weapons also inevitably increases the probability of their employment
8881562 these efforts will have the added historical advantage of benefiting from the new web of global linkages that is growing exponentially outside the more traditional nation state system that web woven by multinational corporations ngos nongovernmental organizations with many of them transnational in character and scientific communities and reinforced by the internet already creates an informal global system that is inherently congenial to more institutionalized and inclusive global cooperation

8881564 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8881565 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8881566 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8881567 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8881568 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8881569 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8881570 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8881571 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8881572 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8881573 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8881574 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8881575 one of the reasons we had no exit plan from iraq is that we didnt intend to leave
8881576 may escalate competition for oil to something as hot and dangerous as the nuclear arms race between the us and the soviet union
8881577 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8881578 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8881579 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8881580 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8881581 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8881582 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8881583 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8881584 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8881585 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8881586 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8881587 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8881588 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8881589 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8881590 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8881591 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8881592 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8881593 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8881594 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8881595 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8881596 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8881597 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8881598 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8881599 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8881600 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8881601 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8881602 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8881603 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8881604 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8881605 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8881606 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8881607 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8881608 lultima cosa da fare cercare dei riscontri della propria libert nei giudizi degli altri perch in questo modo si va incontro a grandissime amarezze
8881609 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8881610 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8881611 h algo excitante acontecendo no brasil e nao estamos falando de carnaval

8881614 signaller wayne bland was a superb soldier full of character and a highly popular member of 16 signal regiment
8881615 there is a view that we are close to a ceiling for the paid for download market simply because there are so many ways for consumers to get music for free
8881616 consumers are showing that they want their music for free and record labels are finally starting to ask can we make money from free
8881617 so the labels are looking across at the people who are making money under the free model and that is the device manufacturers such as apple and nokia
8881618 never say never but customers dont seem to be interested in it the subscription model has failed so far
8881619 we have completed a cursory search of the annexe part of the main building which is relatively intact following the fire
8881620 we have got a situation where the met management board is riven between two men who have a burning sense of injustice against each other
8881621 how on earth can an institution let alone its most senior corporate decision making body function in those circumstances as fully functioning members of the mps youd have to say theyre both finished
8881622 its not a matter of sir ian setting out to create some kind of policing oligarchy in his office these are all professional and committed men who are very far from being head nodding toadies but when youre under attack like he sir ian has been there is an instinct to draw the wagons around you and listen to your most trusted that has created an atmosphere where some are afraid to get involved others are too involved and others feel frozen out
8881623 my opinion is that the met would be better off without sir ian blair hes lost a lot of his authority through the gaffes hes made if the stockwell shooting had been handled differently it would not have turned into the own goal it has turned out to be
8881624 everything the met has done in terms of putting right so many years of failure to address the problems faced by minority officers has turned out to be window dressing
8881625 bbc radio bristol has now confirmed that it will provide live coverage of the away games of all three teams in the region until the end of the current football season
8881626 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8881627 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8881628 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8881629 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8881630 de beslissing om te verhuizen is door verschillende redenen ingegeven

8881632 could pave the way for the development of new drugs against bacteria
8881633 new chemicals designed to force channels to stay open or shut are likely to kill or at the very least greatly slow down the growth of bacteria
8881634 the future path is to find new chemicals and processes that exploit the importance of the channels to these bacteria
8881635 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

8881637 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8881638 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

8881657 wir sind der bundeskanzlerin sehr dankbar und f hlen uns geehrt dass wir diese f r ganz deutschland wichtige entscheidung an einem solch herausragenden und symboltr chtigen ort bekannt geben d rfen gleichzeitig unterstreicht dies wie sehr sich die bundeskanzlerin pers nlich mit dem m dchen und frauenfussball identifiziert es ist ein eindrucksvoller beleg f r die gro artige unterst tzung der bundesregierung die alles tut um die weltmeisterschaft der frauen zu einem hnlich unvergesslichen ereignis werden zu lassen wie es die wm 2006 war
8881658 auch die unterst tzung der medien beweist das gro e interesse an der frauen wm 2011 nun freuen wir uns sehr gemeinsam mit dem radio berlin brandenburg der f r die ard die sendung produziert eine gleichsam anspruchsvolle informative und unterhaltsame fernsehsendung vorbereiten zu d rfen
8881659 wir wissen um die bedeutung der festlegung der spielorte f r manche regionen geht es darum als wm spielort pl tzlich auf die weltkarte des fussballs zu kommen daher werden wir nicht nur die eingereichten unterlagen ber cksichtigen sondern auch die erkenntnisse der stadiontour in die beurteilung einflie en lassen
8881660 die stadionauswahl ist der erste meilenstein auf dem weg zur n chsten wm in deutschland auch jenseits der gro en arenen die wir von der wm 2006 kennen konnten wir einmal mehr feststellen wie sensationell gut die stadien hierzulande sind auch in st dten wie augsburg sinsheim und dresden wo momentan die bagger rollen werden schmuckk stchen entstehen auf die sich die fans in den regionen freuen k nnen
8881661 wir stehen vor dem spagat einerseits eine auch wirtschaftlich vern nftige anzahl an spielen je spielort zu garantieren andererseits aber die insgesamt 32 begegnungen auf m glichst viele st dte im ganzen land verteilen zu wollen
8881662 wir haben die qual der wahl insgesamt haben sich alle elf kandidaten hoch professionell kompetent und mitunter sehr sympathisch und emotional pr sentiert wir haben gesp rt dass wirklich jeder dabei sein m chte fast berall waren die h chsten repr sentanten der st dte anwesend
8881663 fabio will need players who are 100 per cent fit to play a game of that nature against croatia
8881664 we sent owen to the right specialist and he had the right treatment so it is just a matter of him getting on with it now
8881665 owen will not be ready as he needs recovery time as well as getting down to training
8881666 it has not been easy for him having tendonitis can be irritating for a player
8881667 but he has trained for 10 days and it is now important to give him some minutes on the pitch
8881668 the game is extremely important we did not realise that a few years ago
8881669 there are no league games to distract us so there is no excuse this time
8881670 we need to go out and get the victory as this is a prestigious game and one we want to win there is a great incentive for us
8881671 what he is doing there is fantastic the dutch have always been travellers in football and do not mind coaching anywhere
8881672 that is a great asset to have dick for his part has been in places as far apart as glasgow and st petersburg
8881673 when he was in charge of holland he was one of the best at understanding the dilemma of a club manager
8881674 he has proved to be a successful and competent coach you just have to look at his record with zenit
8881675 zenit were the best in the competition they overcame leverkusen and bayern munich on the way as well
8881676 you tend to take notice of results like that and their attacking play captured a lot of peoples attention but we want to win this trophy while there is no pressure on either team there is a lot of prestige
8881677 the once every four years hope for the lever pull sensation of democratic power blinds people to the opportunities for democratic representation deliberation activism and change that surrounds us in local elections
8881678 bad for democracy how the presidency undermines the power of the people
8881679 even the best presidents need social movements to accomplish transformational change
8881680 fdr could not have succeeded without the agitation of the unemployed workers councils and the unions and lbjs greatest accomplishments were made possible by the civil rights movement
8881681 it is in vain to summon a people which has been rendered so dependent on the central power to choose from time to time the representatives of that power
8881682 this rare and brief exercise of their free choice however important it may be will not prevent them from gradually losing the faculties of thinking feeling and acting for themselves and thus gradually falling below the level of humanity
8881683 this proposal will certainly win dalton mcguinty some green points but it also represents a hefty new energy tax
8881684 if renewable energy was affordable and efficient a government mandate to force people to buy it wouldnt be necessary
8881685 resource planning in the case of electricity generation ordinarily requires analyses of the benefits and costs of all available sources of electricity supply
8881686 yet the governments proposed power supply mix is largely based upon its fixation with abolishing coal fired power plants placing a ceiling on the amount of nuclear capacity and courting the green vote consumers would be far better served if market forces not government fiat were allowed to determine the best mix of electric generation capacity
8881687 government is ill equipped to micro manage the energy sectors
8881688 experience elsewhere has shown that deregulated markets yield a more affordable and reliable supply of energy
8881689 the x360 pushes back the boundaries of form and function to deliver real style with substance

8882021 a football banning order was granted in respect of mr angus as a result of intelligence surrounding his activities with other individuals affiliating themselves with hibernian fc
8882022 the conditions of the football banning order are that he is banned from every football ground in the uk for the next three years and that he is required to surrender his passport whenever hibernian fc travel abroad
8882023 however there is no requirement for him to surrender his passport should he choose to travel abroad with another club
8882024 he is a jambo and always has been his mates went to the hibs game so paul decided to just sit in the pub and catch up with them after the game
8882025 when he met them later he got caught up in a fight at falkirk station which ultimately led to his banning order
8882026 the individual concerned is one of a small minority who continue their attempts to tarnish the otherwise good record of hibernian supporters

8882036 se trata de un fallo objetivo yo apel el fallo del juez de menor instancia subi al de distrito quien decidi que s hab a m rito para condenar al se or cardenal por el delito de injurias por qu hasta ahora hombr no te lo puedo explicar pero creo que tiene que ver con el proceso de limpieza de casos viejos que se est dando en los juzgados
8882037 de este sistema judicial no pod s esperar otras cosas sobre todo cuando responde a intereses pol ticos de daniel ortega
8882038 se trata de una manifiesta manipulaci n de los tribunales lo cual debe ser causa de aflicci n para el pa s porque se trata de una acci n temeraria en contra de una figura que tiene una relevancia mundial y no tiene otro calificativo m s que de una barbarie
8882039 y podr amos ver un alud de nieve gigantesco en contra de los autores de la barbarie
8882040 porque ante estas situaciones debemos ser solidarios sobre todo con figuras como ernesto que han puesto muy en alto el nombre de nicaragua
8882041 imaginate que se trata de un caso por el que el mismo sistema judicial ya lo hab a absuelto y que lo traen a colaci n ahora que el poeta ha sido homenajeado en paraguay es decir todo apunta a una decisi n de orden pol tico
8882042 esto no es m s que una demostraci n de debilidad del gobierno esto se llama miedo porque saben el peso que tiene la voz de ernesto cardenal y por eso vamos a denunciar este atropello a nivel internacional porque somos solidarios con l y lo advertimos no est solo y un ataque contra ernesto es un ataque contra todos nosotros las y los escritores del pa s
8882043 no es m s que una muestra de la cobard a con que act an los que ostentan el poder en contra de quienes se muestran cr ticos y adversos
8882044 esto es horrible lo que est pasando y te digo que es tanto as que no encuentro palabras para describirte lo que siento
8882045 estoy impactada de ver la arbitrariedad y el abuso que se est cometiendo en contra de personalidades que lo nico que han hecho es poner en lo m s alto el nombre de nicaragua y que dedic su vida a la revoluci n estoy espantada porque estamos volviendo a lo m s puro del somocismo
8882046 una venganza pol tica de daniel ortega y rosario murillo y es para obligar a callar a todo el mundo
8882047 lo que no pudo hacer el somocismo no lo podr n hacer rosario murillo y daniel ortega ste es un gobierno vengativo venga traidos pol ticos y pretende callar a todo el mundo ste no es hecho aislado es s lo una represi n m s
8882048 es una jugada m s del r gimen que est utilizando a su juguete favorito que es el poder judicial para premiar a amigos y castigar a adversarios esta vez ni siquiera tuvieron el tacto de dejar pasar un tiempo sino que lo hacen inmediatamente despu s de lo ocurrido en paraguay es decir no se guardan las apariencias y embisten de manera directa
8882049 quieren responsabilizar al padre de la falta de acogida del presidente en paraguay parece que hay una envidia por el nivel de reconocimiento que tiene el poeta y que lo va a seguir teniendo esto evidencia que seguimos en camino hacia el autoritarismo en el r gimen m s intolerante que ha habido desde somoza porque la consigna es est s conmigo o contra m

8882097 the sequence of events of the case would show that the appellant association coai and its members have been enjoying the benefit of the tdsats observation that it expects parties not to proceed further after the matter has come before it

8882099 because of the fact that even the latest congestion report has now become a part of the pending appeal proceedings the authority has been left with no option but to await the final decision of the tdsat as the pending case has effectively tied the hands of the authority from taking any steps for ensuring quality of service

8882148 you rushed as a yellow skeleton into every dream if i screamed myself awake you waited until the long skinny leaves of sleep choked me back to you again you came clacking and scuttling like a yellow spider until i screamed crimson tears a package arrived from the post office of dreams and you skittered out to punish me something smelled bad in my closet and everyone knew that you were rotting there i walked a hotly endless course of graves that suddenly whirled like marble trap doors beneath my feet to pitch me down to black liquescent corpses whose stench screamed through my dreams
8882149 i would just stay at one of the hotels sometimes i still occasionally stay there you know i like the kind of hotel where you dont have to buy your own crack because the crack smoke kind of drifts through the walls from an adjacent room and you can just enjoy the fragrance
8882150 jesus on the very cross of torture and shame never suffered like she suffered and i dont care how much he gave he never gave like she did
8882151 im not doing it for the money and therefore i cant see any reason to compromise
8882152 i would say dont fixate on getting published because thats really the least important concern if you really care about writing you should do it because it makes you happy and you should be just as happy if you can write something that you think is beautiful and you can keep it in a drawer and show it to a few people and theyre thrilled thats just as important if you can have that attitude then no one can take the pleasure of it away from you you have to think of the sad lives and commercial failures which so many great writers have experienced look at somebody like melville if youre an aspiring writer do you want to write moby dick sure well if youre going to do that that means youre willing to accept not just no success but poverty and even a certain measure of disgrace for the rest of your life can you proudly accept that if so you may still not be a good writer but youre on the right track if your thing is getting recognition as quick as possible then i would say why why do you want that and is writing going to help you do that and are you going to be a happier person by having that recognition

8882173 als entlastung k nnte auch die tochter cominvest mit einem wert von rund 1 5 milliarden euro der allianz als asset tausch angeboten werden
8882174 die allianz ist ihr sorgenkind dresdner bank zwar los m sste zun chst aber einen hohen buchverlust ausweisen eine denkbare l sung w re auch gewesen dass die allianz anteilig an dem konstrukt beteiligt bleibt dann w rde es keinen buchverlust geben
8882175 f r die allianz w re es allerdings nur die zweitbeste l sung da die commerzbank den n tigen kaufpreis wohl nicht alleine stemmen kann und der versicherer daher wahrscheinlich mit 20 bis 30 prozent beteiligt bleiben k nnte die allianz h tte mit sicherheit das geld lieber bar in der hand

8882247 my wife and i intend to retire sell up buy a boat and go sailing that is while we are still young and fit enough to do so
8882248 i have a contract which goes until christmas next year and i suspect by that time i will simply retire and simply disappear
8882249 you will not find me re emerging as an aspiring politician or in any other field
8882250 i hope to be extremely quiet and hopefully a long way away taking the sun on a coral atoll
8882251 im not retiring im not doing a tony blair if anyone has told you i am retiring they are mistaken
8882252 reports of my demise are sadly exaggerated it is not happening ive got work to do
8882253 i will retire one day i will die one day but not any time soon
8882254 i love answers and ill do whatever it takes to find them i dig through books that havent seen the light of day in 300 years i scour databases that are harder for you to get into than a red carpet premiere i search in basements so deep just going down there gives me the bends and i dont come up for air until i got what i came for guess you could say i find answers like its my job cause it is im scot colford librarian at the boston public library what do you want to know

8882257 there wont be baseball in nashua next year as we presently know it or at least under my ownership
8882258 for three years we sat here and worked very diligently to keep the nashua pride here in nashua
8882259 im sorry we werent able to succeed to accomplish what our goal was which was to keep baseball in nashua it just didnt make business sense we took it as long as we could we accomplished a lot
8882260 whether its because youve got affiliated baseball 17 miles to the north the double a manchester fisher cats or to 17 miles to the south single a lowell mass spinners all i can tell you is i couldnt energize the nashua fan base to get here i did everything i know how to do ive taken this as far as i can so there will be no nashua pride as you know it today in nashua next year
8882261 which would allow me to look for a group here or somewhere else to buy the franchise
8882262 but between the weather and youve been here if a local company wants to come in it could be done but youve got to get the large corporations to commit they dont have to commit to a hell of a lot
8882263 my wife and i didnt want to do this a month ago i thought we could still pull it off not a very happy day sometimes you have to face the realities of life
8882264 im not willing to give up that there might be something that can be done
8882265 john stepped up when nobody else would you can only do it for so long i think there are people in the community who thought he was sitting back there raking in money that is so not the case
8882266 i am hopeful that we have an opportunity here to think of something to keep this stadium as beautiful as it is
8882267 if there isnt a professional team in holman that wouldnt be beneficial to the community
8882268 i dont think the league sees that as their role
8882269 theres a way to keep it here some how some way we were making progress but its hard for john
8882270 and one of the saddest things is people dont even realize it
8882271 this years success will start from the goal cage out
8882272 if our defense plays strong we may suprise some teams in our first season
8882273 last year we had trouble scoring we have a great group of girls and everybody is giving 110 percent in practice
8882274 we are a very young team but we have lots of heart and dedication
8882275 were looking forward to taking that dedication and building off it
8882276 coming together as a team will be a key for us
8882277 for the team to work well together it will take communication both on and off the field
8882278 speed and overall chemistry and devotion are keys for us
8882279 though we lost nine players seven starters our returning players have worked hard in off season
8882280 offensively we are solid playing confidently between our midfield and offense our two goalies are both solid players and communicate well on the field defensively we lost all three starters so we continue to work daily on strengthening and rebuilding we are a team of competitors
8882281 obviously if you would ask me at the moment if im playing like a no 1 probably not
8882282 its very frustrating because i know i can play so much better
8882283 i was thinking am i really made to play tennis
8882284 i think what i experienced so far is girls when they play against higher ranked players they have nothing to lose so they go for their shots
8882285 many times they play matches of their life not only in womens tennis also in mens
8882286 whichever way the draw goes whichever way the matches go as long as hopefully its a win for me im pretty happy about it
8882287 oh yes i remember i wont forget but id like to have a more recent memory as of like 08

8882294 our goal is to offer the best customer service and the widest range of pop culture items on ebay at down to earth prices
8882295 rates have fallen but they are still very restrictive given the current macro
8882296 this is the first bit of helpful news for a while but it comes on the back of a sizeable upward shift the prior month so rates are still higher than two months ago
8882297 we always talk about the fact that we have a win here we have a win there
8882298 coming to australia and everyone knowing that we can be competitive not asking do you think you might win a game how many games are you going to win is what i want people to ask
8882299 its happened to us before and weve lost not just to bangladesh but to a lot of teams
8882300 as soon as you take things for granted i think you find yourself asking questions why youve lost that game so its important we concentrate on saturday

8882357 most of the art team is actually working on the second act of the game because a lot of the team is really production focused now and were generating content for the most part a lot of the tech and underlying engine is really solid
8882358 most of the design team is still on act 1 because were refining and improving the quests and flow and some of the big game systems that we havent really announced yet we kind of dove back into content production fairly quickly
8882359 the cap prides itself on providing pathologists with the highest caliber of timely practical continuing medical education therefore recognition of our efforts by an external accrediting body is most encouraging

8882362 our hope is that this research will improve the screening process for migraine in soldiers and increase education about migraine for soldiers and their health care providers u s military personnel should receive the best health care available and improving the diagnosis and treatment of migraine will likely improve soldiers personal and professional functioning
8882363 patients who used statins before an ami and continued to take them after were 16 less likely to die over the next year than those who never used them so even if it appears that the statins failed to prevent your ami it is beneficial to continue taking them and potentially quite harmful to stop
8882364 in the general population the statin discontinuation rate within the first year of prescription is 30 percent thats very high
8882365 because statins are preventative drugs patients may not feel the immediate benefit of taking them and sometimes stop however it looks like this might be quite a dangerous practice after an ami
8882366 regardless of the mechanism or explanation physicians should be careful when assessing each patients medication needs
8882367 patients also need to take their medications exactly as prescribed after an ami statins in particular should only be withdrawn after an ami under close clinical supervision

8882371 we are pleased with the clinical progress of art621 and are excited to be finalising the ind documentation the submission of which is a crucial milestone towards the commercialisation of art621
8882372 subject to feedback from the fda u s food and drug administration we look forward to the commencement of our rheumatoid arthritis program by the end of this year which we have been carefully planning for some time now
8882373 we are targeting two of the key anti tnf markets rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis if successful in trials the unique nature of our product should enable us to gain a valuable share of the large and growing anti tnf market
8882374 i found the course very useful it was both interesting and stimulating and attending has made me more confident about preparing medico legal reports i would recommend that anybody looking to get involved in any aspect of medico legal work signs up the course has something to offer any expert irrespective of their level of experience
8882375 feedback from delegates is always extremely positive there is widespread agreement amongst gps and specialists that the importance of completing medical reports to a high standard is paramount and knowing how to do so effectively as well as give evidence in court is important for gps and specialists in their busy and often hectic lives

8882377 channels in bacteria perform absolutely key roles in cell survival we have been able to show how this channel opens and closes understanding how they work will play a major role in inhibiting the survival of bacteria and could have applications as basic as cleansing hospital equipment and wards or helping to make food safer these channels are found in mrsa and c difficile and this knowledge has not yet been exploited the future path is to find new chemicals and processes that exploit the importance of the channels to these bacteria
8882378 the system is mechanical the channel senses the pressure inside the bacteria as a result the channel alters its shape and creates an opening releasing the pressure the motion is just like that of a camera iris and being able to see this motion is an amazing discovery
8882379 not only is this a major step forward in scientific understanding of a fundamental process in biology but it paves the way for the development of new drugs against bacteria
8882380 new chemicals designed to force channels to stay open or shut are likely to kill or at the very least greatly slow down the growth of bacteria slowing down the growth gives the bodys natural defences time to tackle its bacterial invader
8882381 this was a very demanding project and is down to tremendous team work in both universities in particular dr wenjiang wang dr michelle edwards and dr susan black performed the crucial experiments

8882389 most clubs are just interested in supplements for their players the exact nutrition is not their focus which is not the way it should be
8882390 i am here to talk to the medical personnel of clubs so they do not forget the basics of nutrition they must make sure the general nutrition is involved and enforce it too the scientists must know this
8882391 caffeine is just one element of a diet just like in coffee but why focus on just caffeine when there is a whole area of nutrition that is important
8882392 i am not going to get involved in what brands the footballers should take or not but i will tell you that in a sports drink you have a little bit of carbohydrate plenty of sodium and then glucose and most importantly the fluid
8882393 this is just a start there is a lot we can do for nigerian football but of course we must start somewhere
8882394 we do not just have a product we have a whole science academy which is almost like a school set out to help sports people improve their performance
8882395 when this conference came up we thought it will be good to have a first engagement with the local clubs to show our interest and support for sports in nigeria
8882396 we are not just signing udi we have also added eric facindo and a former national team goalkeeper i do not want to mention yet until i get his clearance
8882397 naj ljudje z glasovanjem odlo ijo o ustavi e se mi ki smo na oblasti ne moremo sporazumeti
8882398 a lot of the team is really production focused now and were generating content for the most part a lot of the tech and underlying engine is really solid
8882399 most of the design team is still on act 1 because were refining and improving the quests and flow and some of the big game systems that we havent really announced yet
8882400 but you want your best work which you tend to do latest in the project to be at the beginning of the game
8882401 its pretty much how blizzard works we have a tendency to iterate over and over again on everything we do so we build something and then we rebuild it
8882402 if we havent rebuilt something five times it really doesnt deserve to be shipped thats pretty much our policy
8882403 a bartering system is actually a very exclusionary trading system
8882404 a currency really provides a common language thats the point of a currency we dont want to do some of the stuff that diablo ii did where they kind of actively devalued gold
8882405 really were trying to allow more people to get into the trading game because the more people that are in it the more fun it will be
8882406 were going to give people lots of ways to expand and deal with your inventory and more info on that coming in the future
8882407 the necromancer is an awesome class actually my favourite class from diablo ii and the class im currently playing the most of
8882408 its not that we just dislike him we love the necromancer but the issue we have is he was so well designed theres certainly some things we could do a little differently but do we feel like we can make him so much better and change his core gameplay experience if anything wed say we really dont want to
8882409 after we felt like weve kind of established the core diablo iii game
8882410 we really want to make sure that the tone of the game is right that its dark that its foreboding
8882411 what we showed at wwi really is a very early game content you know its first act dungeon first act environments
8882412 recent in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that a single genetic event in the map kinase signaling pathway may be sufficient for thyroid cell transformation and tumor development
8882413 thyroid cancer is associated with exposure to external or internal ionizing radiation elucidation of mechanisms of radiation induced cancer in humans especially early steps and pathways has potential implications for epidemiological risk analyses early clinical diagnosis and chemopreventive interventions
8882414 that means that a younger person living close to the bombing site would be more likely to have adult onset thyroid cancer having ret ptc rearrangements
8882415 it could be either by direct dna damage or by other pathways such as a result of radiation induced genomic instability
8882416 the prevalence of adhd is concerning to the medical community adhd may affect adults in their professional life social life and relationships
8882417 vyvanse is a recently approved adhd treatment option for the adult population in a clinical study with adults vyvanse was shown within the first week to significantly improve adhd symptoms inattention such as the ability to focus and organize and hyperactivity and impulsivity such as restlessness and interrupting

8882429 the close evolutionary and genomic relationships of maize or corn to other grasses will take us one step closer to some new good sources of bioenergy
8882430 maize cell walls and the genes responsible for wall formation are characteristic of all grasses
8882431 maize has the same genes arranged in the same order and on the same chromosomes as the other grasses
8882432 well switch genes on and off as we identify them to see what they do once we know the genes and their functions then we can assess which ones might make good targets for modification for enhanced biomass and sugars for processing into biofuel
8882433 its a cause of celebration that we are all living healthier and longer lives
8882434 but with the population living longer we are seeing additional pressures on long term care we are committed to ensuring that every single person in wales receives the best possible care when they need it and todays significant investment is further proof of our commitment
8882435 we are also committed to working with local government the nhs and others to ensure that when people do go into hospital they are moved on quickly at the right time to the right place for ongoing treatment or safe timely discharge into the community
8882436 such delays were reduced by 50 per cent between 2003 and 2006 and todays figures show continued improvement in reductions
8882437 the extra money that im announcing today will further help the nhs and local authorities in their efforts to build on this progress
8882438 this conference aims to encourage the nhs to recognise the power of music as a crucial form of treatment and health promotion we are delighted to welcome a wealth of experts from across the globe who will provide groundbreaking insights into the enormous value of music and singing on health and well being
8882439 the evidence shows that the contribution of arts and health is grossly underestimated by many healthcare professionals the royal society for public health encourages all organisations involved in healthcare to invest in these evidence based interventions this conference will hopefully raise awareness about the health outcomes possible and in particular the contribution singing makes to health improvement
8882440 the work of the sidney de haan centre could provide some important pointers as to how we can use the arts to improve the quality of life right across our community i am very pleased that my family trust is continuing to support the research that is taking place and i hope that this conference will help to generate much greater awareness of the potential benefits of involvement with the arts
8882441 an active engagement with music can be good for an older persons overall physical and mental health i will particularly focus on the positive effects of singing on the mind and the immune system and how music and art can have positive influences on the course of illness with aging
8882442 i believe singing for health brings huge benefits to certain people last spring the pct held a health and well being event in folkestone a singing workshop engaged participants for a fun filled half hour that made everyone feel great afterwards i have never seen such a gathering of smiling faces the pct is committed to supporting this sidney de haan research programme and i wish the conference every success

8882561 as i get to know this place better i feel more and more that it communicates with so many cultures of the world at the same time which makes this adventure interesting and defining
8882562 as i start to feel more and more at ease im exploring more deeply this part of the world connects you with other possibilities its a center of so many things
8882563 a true artist has the obligation you must be ready to evolve and leave the comfortable places
8882564 people always ask me what music of buenos aires is like

8882566 im a natural born adventurer volont which is my mothers last name and i chose to work under in a sense means volunteer of adventure i cant think of a better definition for myself
8882567 the beauty that comes when you dare turn down the decibels and venture a little bit into quietness into intimacy
8882568 the offer provides compelling value and liquidity for the shareholders of euro and gives shareholders an opportunity to crystallize value now rather than retain an interest in an entity with euros financial position and asset base
8882569 this transaction is consistent with iamgolds strategy of rationalizing our structure and significantly reducing cash costs at all of our operations completion of the transaction is a logical step towards this goal as was the recent acquisition of the doyon royalty we continue to demonstrate our focus on operational efficiencies and costs at our operations with the long term objective of reducing our cash costs below the industry average

8882571 weve had a great start four points from glentoran and cliftonville is brilliant and it could have been six had we not conceded late against the glens
8882572 now we have to put in the same kind of performance against newry
8882573 thats not going to be easy either gerry flynn has put together a good team there a young team with a lot of experience in it too and they have done ok this season as well
8882574 we just have to carry on with what we have been doing its been a great start for us and for the league as a whole
8882575 in the past you could have picked the top four but now
8882576 we are struggling to get a team there was a mass exodus last season we lost six or seven of the backline and a few in the pack
8882577 well not have our new signings for five or six weeks but it gives us the opportunity to look at other guys
8882578 it makes me think about all the suffering all the pain all the hurt so many people who gave all they had this is a down payment on the dream of martin luther king
8882579 when i got knocked down by guys bigger than me she sent me back out and said bloody their nose so you can walk down the street the next day
8882580 students and parents must understand that attending school is not optional
8882581 the benefit of them carrying a gps instrument is they have an opportunity to opt out of peer pressure
8882582 obviously the players were disappointed to have conceded so late on in the cobh game when it looked as though we won the game
8882583 but on the up side we have taken four points out of six from the last two games
8882584 the fact that we have this big derby game against derry tonight means that the players have to put that behind them very quickly
8882585 theres nothing like a local derby for getting players motivated and theyll be well up for this one
8882586 derry are on the crest of a wave and we know its going to difficult game we also know that derry have already beaten us this season but we played quite well in that game
8882587 harps have a strong squad and we cant afford to be complacent were still an emerging team and so we have to improve every week and thats the way we view this
8882588 were still two points behind cork in the european places so we have to try and stay in touch with them for when we go down there next week and we need to beat finn harps in order to do that
8882589 we have scored a lot of goals in recent weeks and thats a good sign the players are playing with confidence and expressing themselves and we want that to continue this
8882590 a windfall tax on the huge profits of energy companies
8882591 what we shouldnt do is create a climate that makes it harder to attract new investment
8882592 a clear grasp of our foreign policy and national security challenges
8882593 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8882594 we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and inexperienced to be president
8882595 and it wont work in 2008 either because barack obama is on the right side of history
8882596 embraces the extremist philosophy that has defined his party for 25 years
8882597 they actually want us to reward them for the last eight years by giving them four more thanks but no thanks
8882598 i was giving a team talk earlier in the season and told the players what a privilege it is to sign an international
8882599 its not too many teams that have proper international footballers on their books and to get peter kennedy as a player im delighted to get him as a person im delighted to get his experience im delighted
8882600 i think hell be the glue that will knit and link us together because i want him to play in the middle of the park i see four people playing for two places we are blessed that we have a 2 to 1 ratio in almost all places and i feel there is good quality competition
8882601 we have four quality centre backs albert watson gary haveron and gavin mcdonnell and archie aaron stewart
8882602 we have four central midfielders and theres a nice mix in there
8882603 up front we have neil teggart kevin kelbie davitt walsh and michael ward they are the four principle strikers so its getting the pairing right look at our left side we have mcclean hogan mullan king and cushley and king can play down the right
8882604 wee picky mark picking whos jinky on the right and we have michael mcginlay whos more pace power and purpose and doesnt need to beat you to get a cross in so all over its good
8882605 its a big game for both teams and im looking forward to it
8882606 we know we havent been playing well but we have shown that we are a good team and it wont take long for us to find that form again
8882607 as far as we are concerned things can only get better and i see no reason why that cant start immediately
8882608 we have got cliftonville tomorrow if we were to get a win against them it would be a massive boost for us and i think that people would then forget about the last two matches
8882609 we had a lot of very hard matches against cliftonville last season so we know what we are up against
8882610 they like us probably havent hit form just yet but they have strengthened since last year too and i know that they will give us another very hard game
8882611 they are always up for it when they come to the oval and this will be no different especially seeing as they are coming off the back of a defeat on tuesday night against distillery
8882612 we are conceding goals from cross balls and set pieces which is disappointing from our point of view because it is something that we feel we are strong at
8882613 we are working on it and well keep working on it but i wouldnt get too carried away
8882614 perhaps it is a bit of a confidence thing but that is something that can be easily sorted out
8882615 as a defender you want clean sheets roy coyle always said it was clean sheets that win championships and i feel if we get one then we will settle and go on a run where we dont concede
8882616 i was brought up to train with the first team about a year ago and it has really helped me improve my game
8882617 when you are marking peter thompson and glenn ferguson in training it is only going to help you get better and it has been really good for me
8882618 i have been waiting for my chance in the first team since last year after playing against glenavon in the cis cup and i came on against glentoran in the setanta cup at the oval
8882619 i cant really blame the manager for not giving me a chance before because of the way william murphy and noel bailie have been playing
8882620 they are quality players and have been quality players for years
8882621 people ask questions about how long they can go on for but winkie murphy is still one of the fittest players at the club and seems to be fitter this year than he has been before
8882622 getting in ahead of either of those two is going to be hard
8882623 i have been lucky to get my chance and it is usually through injuries that players get into a team
8882624 i got in because steven douglas was out and conor hagan got injured and i knew i had to do well to stay in the team
8882625 hopefully i can keep playing well and keep my place but i know how hard it is to do that
8882626 there are a couple of players who will be trying to get in ahead of me but that is all good for the team
8882627 if i score a couple more goals then maybe that will help me keep my place i will just have to wait and see what happens
8882628 this has probably been one of the most stimulating and exciting hours i
8882629 things need to be ahead of their time and in football we need to stop talking about the past i commend this project and lets get it built lets not talk about it for the next five years like the national stadium
8882630 this is about ambition and drive and it will happen
8882631 good community relations a modern stadium a step change in our schools youth academy and community sport programmes will all help us reach a different level
8882632 this is a much needed vision which could not come a minute sooner were committed to making it happen
8882633 placing the emphasis exclusively on the use of force has no prospects
8882634 russia had no other moral choice but to support the appeal of the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia for recognition of their right to self determination
8882635 il y a au sein de la famille une grande fiert quil se soit engag pour la france

8882641 mi m sica es una interesante combinaci n entre la tradici n y la innovaci n va m s all del amor que me une a las ra ces del tango como de la m sica folcl rica argentina
8882642 hay algo maravilloso en que uno se atreva a seguir su propio impulso en mi caso se prob con el tiempo
8882643 me abrieron los brazos y me admitieron como nuevo miembro de la academia y destacaron precisamente que mi repertorio como el de gardel siempre incluyera otros g neros m s all del tango y que no tuviera miedo de experimentar

8882645 never go to bed sober alone or with a red cent left in your pocket
8882646 please tell everyone in russia in the world that we want to be with russia we dont want saakashvili he has brought us nothing but trouble
8882647 we dont need nato we dont need america we need to be friends with russia
8882648 we are all people who have been through a lot in our lives we are not easily scared
8882649 but now we are all scared many people have died here who will defend us who will look after us we are left here all alone
8882650 we dont know what to do we need medicines doctors but nothing is coming
8882651 russia protected georgia for hundreds of years we have always been close to russia
8882652 the ossetians behaved like dogs but if russia is our friend then the ossetians will be our friends too
8882653 perhaps all the intellectuals in tbilisi who want to be with america are far cleverer than us perhaps they understand the world better than we do but we are the ones left here who have to live with this
8882654 hes a very good player hes got good technique on the ball hes strong and a good tackler as well
8882655 we get on really well off the pitch as well and we take that onto the pitch with us
8882656 we know each other really well already and its good to have that understanding
8882657 he has all the attributes to go on and play at the top level
8882658 keith was someone who paul identified from the first day he took the job
8882659 if paul knows anything from his own career its midfield players
8882660 he captained his country playing in that position and he was always keen to bring keith here if we could do the right deal and thankfully we have
8882661 he andrews is going to be a big loss for this club he has been fantastic here at mk and it is a bit of a shame
8882662 but it is the players wish and dream and we wish him good luck
8882663 can u honestly see this guy being an improvement on our 1st xi
8882664 although dr conley and accd alamo community college district agree that these communications using an accd computer were unfortunate it is also clear that dr conley never commented about his students as the other party did
8882665 i may actually be making progress with this girl music may be the quickest way to a teen girls heart after stuffed animals
8882666 do you have any news to report i believe there was a private tutoring session scheduled for today
8882667 i have sort of ignored her since she stopped the provocative mode of dress
8882668 that fountain of youth youve found yours i just wish i could get me one
8882669 i may have lost mine as of jan 3 when she stood me up its sort of a long story if you want to hear it call me
8882670 its not over for the people that broke the law and tried to manipulate the outcome of the election
8882671 if you see evidence you see that almost all the recounts never deviate except ones called by this caller
8882672 we obviously noticed this severe discrepancy and contacted the attorney generals office
8882673 because flores did not establish by clear and convincing evidence that voting irregularities materially affected the outcome of the election the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to order a new election
8882674 if you are projecting decades of substantial traffic growth along u s 281 and then taking on debt based on those projections then you are basically betting in favor of polluting the aquifer and paving the hill country
8882675 i said thank you very much i want a specific gas price analysis
8882676 u s 281 tollway is seen as a road to 2 1 billion
8882677 he drew what he saw such as watching black people getting baptized in the rivers of east texas
8882678 back in the day they didnt have computers or cameras that do what they do now
8882679 so theyd fly over war zones and take their naked eyes and binoculars and draw maps by hand for the troops
8882680 during the 80s and 90s doc spellmon was a major force in african american art in texas
8882681 doc had formal art training but he paid homage to the self taught style of painting
8882682 he applied thick layers of paint on the canvas to tell his story layer after layer and still a heavy glaze over that it seemed a great way to tell the narrative
8882683 his style was unique and its recognizable but his art was both aesthetically stimulating and a historical documentation
8882684 he was as vibrant and colorful as his art he was a great spirit
8882685 we have gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8882686 tonight we witness in part what has become of his dream acceptance of a democratic presidential nominee decided not by the color of his skin but by the content of his character
8882687 but weve made significant progress diversity is an accepted thing
8882688 the other historic thing that is going to happen will be in november when we elect an african american man president
8882689 it is time for latinos and immigrants to rally behind the next president of the united states barack obama
8882690 i think the public is going to turn the page
8882691 i have a friend who owns a ski boat and im going to try to do it on my own
8882692 the good news is weve got some good talented young statewide leaders i dont know whether theyre ready to run statewide in 2010 or not
8882693 youre going to see a lot of people think more seriously about running for statewide office
8882694 im not as worried about the talent as being diligent in building the groundwork for a solid base
8882695 im going to die with my boots on when it comes to politics
8882696 while sen barack obama and surrogates may be high on drama they continue to be light on substance
8882697 although the department asserts it briefed all commission members individually no briefing documents specific dates or calendars were provided to auditors to verify these briefings
8882698 i am committed to increasing the departments transparency and the recommendations identified in this audit put us another step closer to realizing that goal
8882699 the people of texas deserve a world class transportation system
8882700 im hopeful this report along with recommendations made by the sunset commission will provide the legislature with a good roadmap for making immediate and long term improvements to our transportation system
8882701 however i must admit i am dismayed to learn that there were persons in the department who became aware of this error as early as september 2007 and yet it was not brought to the legislatures attention until early this year
8882702 we have had problems with this referee in the past and now we have problems with him again
8882703 i raised concerns about stephen weatheralls appointment to our game against lisburn distillery on tuesday night when i first found out he was the referee but that fell on deaf ears
8882704 it is a while since stephen refereed one of our games and then we had him for the county antrim shield match against brantwood the league game at distillery and then he was due to be fourth official for saturdays match against glentoran
8882705 i know that he has now been taken off that game but we feel that we have been left with no alternative but to make an official complaint to the ifa
8882706 his handling of the match and some of the decisions he made left a lot to be desired
8882707 in a climate where referees have brought themselves into the public eye we need a better standard of officiating
8882708 we have incidences like our captain chris scannell asking the referee to consult his linesman over a decision and being yellow carded for it and there were other things as well
8882709 people are going to say that its sour grapes on our part because we lost the game 3 1 but thats not the issue
8882710 lisburn distillery deserved to win the game they deserve a lot of credit and paul kirk has put together a very good team
8882711 the problem was with the referee we thought we had moved on from things that happened last year but we are just back to the way we were
8882712 we arent doing this because we lost one game we are doing it for the good of football because we want better officiating than what we have at present
8882713 we have supporters who part with their hard earned cash to follow our team people who give up their time and work hard for the club and if we keep getting poor refereeing displays they will stop coming to games
8882714 we have a new league with marketing campaigns to bring more people into grounds and still we have the same referees and the same performances
8882715 it is a stodgy expensive revenge movie with a pompous belief in its own brilliance the arrogance could cost ritchie his hollywood career
8882716 bulldozes through controversy hosted the dalai lama chastised mugabe and wants to make the euro a bigger player in global financial markets as the dollar wanes
8882717 but these awards are for actresses and im not really an actress
8882718 because the more i know about what real actors are subjected to in terms of their position within the film making process i realise that im not one at all
8882719 ive never chosen a role in my life the idea is an anathema to me thats why i say im not a proper actress because ive heard other actors talking about how they have to fight to be part of the conversation and ive never had that experience i choose the person and then well decide what were going to do together and magically it will appear four years later
8882720 i am strangely impervious to that i think its partly because i was never going to be bimbo material so i just kept my head down in my twenties i had this strange instinct that i would only begin to start my real work within my forties
8882721 ive always been a huge film geek and the second i started making films i knew
8882722 can look like dietrich one minute and gollum the next
8882723 which is probably why i was attracted to the arts in the first place it seems to me that the job of an artist is kind of to report from outside the pale besides the outside place was always where the most fun was happening
8882724 luckily im pretty lightweight in terms of overheads i dont have a major heroin addiction to support or any airplanes to fuel people get so caught up in thinking that they need their lives or career to go a certain way i dont get it
8882725 in the last few years ive had small children xavier and honor and ive been loath to be away from them much
8882726 but thats going to change now that theyre 10 im just on the verge of starting my lifes work well not necessarily with benjamin button but theres a whole series of other films just wait and see
8882727 he joel has won a huge following by making emptiness seem substantial and holiday inn lounge schlock sound special hes the sort of popular artist who makes elitism seem not just defensible but necessary
8882728 eh now which is as annoying re how can i get out of the habit of saying eh before everything i say
8882729 pero el impacto que ha tenido muestra que se est cocinando esa posibilidad

8882739 the story spoke to me on so many levels both personal and artistic
8882740 the women in johns early life truly shaped who he became and the strengths and weaknesses of their relationships are central to this film
8882741 im truly excited at the prospect of sam taylor wood bringing her singular artistic vision to the story
8882742 combined with the genius of john lennon i think thats a very arresting and dynamic combination

8882794 smoking during pregnancy is a double edged sword with respect to sids
8882795 not only does it raise a mothers likelihood of having a preterm baby who is already among the most vulnerable to sids but it increases the infants susceptibility to sids even further
8882796 preterm babies are known to have increased breathing difficulties in proportion to their prematurity and cigarette smoke is known to increase apneas in full term babies
8882797 but until now cigarette smoke exposure and preterm birth have not been investigated together with respect to their potential effects on respiratory dysfunction
8882798 our study shows that preterm infants make incomplete and or delayed recovery from interruptions in breathing
8882799 this has clear implications for their risk of sids but there is even still another reason for concern even after the risk of sids has passed inability or delayed recovery from repeated low oxygen episodes can also be detrimental to brain development there is increasing evidence that infants exposed to prenatal cigarette smoke are at high risk for developmental and behavioral disorders
8882800 this is a potentially revolutionary advance in the field of forensics
8882801 by employing the powers of genomic technology it is now possible to know with near certainty that a particular individual was at a particular location even with only trace amounts of dna and even if dozens or even hundreds of others were there too
8882802 as technology advances we need to be prepared to keep evidence that down the road could prove again to be useful
8882803 it opens up a whole new can of worms of whats possible to do forensically
8882804 we demonstrate an approach for rapidly and sensitively determining whether a trace amount of genomic dna from an individual is present within a complex dna mixture

8882848 we were disappointed not to find a smoking gun that would explain the common association between obesity and asthma
8882849 however this research points us to other possibilities that future research should examine
8882850 we hypothesized that the low grade systemic inflammation present in obesity would augment the inflammation of asthma a synergistic effect
8882851 or alternatively that the inflammation of obesity might affect the airways independently an additive effect perhaps resulting in mixed airway inflammation
8882852 what we found was that although inflammatory cells and other biomarkers of inflammation were increased there was no significant interaction demonstrated between obesity and asthma
8882853 this does not change the fact that there is a well established link between asthma and obesity sometimes a negative result is important and the results add to our body of knowledge regarding the obesity asthma link now we need to look in other directions for the answers
8882854 we did not look at this in our patients given that asthma is immunologically driven this is a potential avenue for further research
8882855 alternatively it may be that dynamic changes in lung function that occur with episodes of asthma are different with excess body weight
8882856 to our knowledge this is the first report of a direct association between childhood abuse and asthma and asthma related outcomes
8882857 we wanted to explore whether exposure to stress and violence is associated with an increased risk of asthma in urban children living in puerto rico
8882858 we already know that there is a high prevalence of asthma in puerto rican children and many studies have linked stress and exposure to violence to health problems in childhood including asthma
8882859 children with a history of abuse had higher frequencies of all outcomes of interest than those without a history of abuse
8882860 after adjusting for relevant covariates history of abuse was associated with an approximate doubling of the odds of current asthma healthcare use for asthma and allergic rhinitis
8882861 it is not simply the exposure to a particular stressor but the physiological response to that stressor that predicts physical health outcomes
8882862 latino culture places an emphasis on certain values and social supports that may buffer the effects of poverty and community violence experienced by children in puerto rico
8882863 we wanted to know how the brain areas that encode memory are organised if your memory is affected by ageing or alzheimers disease is there a way to learn that can capitalise on the brain structures that may still be working well

8882899 these microdomains are so tiny you could fit five million on them on a full stop there are 10 000 receptors on each cell and we are able to follow how single drug molecules bind to individual receptors in these specialised microdomains
8882900 what makes this single molecule laser technique unique is that we are looking at them in real time on a living cell other techniques that investigate how drugs bind to their receptors require many millions of cells to get a big enough signal and this normally involves destroying the cells in the process
8882901 this is a promising new lead in the search for biological pathways that contribute to obesity

8883081 celtic christians had a name for the holy spirit an geadh glas or the wild goose the name hints at mystery much like a wild goose the spirit of god cannot be tracked or tamed an element of danger an air of unpredictability surround him and while the name may sound a little sacrilegious i cannot think of a better description of what its like to follow the spirit through life i think the celtic christians were on to something most of us will have no idea where we are going most of the time and i know that is unsettling but circumstantial uncertainty also goes by another name adventure

8883084 i hope that leicester dont expect to come and walk all over us because we wont let them do that
8883085 well forget about oldham because the players let the manager and themselves down and although i didnt travel i am part of that so i was gutted with the result the manager has made it clear that if we lay down and die we will be out of the door and he will get people in who can do it or even play the youth team
8883086 chris is a very experienced head who will complement our young backline very well he was put through some rigorous testing and passed with flying colours
8883087 we had a few players emerging last year who were maybe a year off being ready but it looks like they are now ready to play lots of games for us
8883088 its not a time for slaughtering the lads we are adjusting to a new division after winning promotion we would still rather be here than in league two and we have to learn quickly mistakes we got away with last season will be punished at this higher level
8883089 the orient game is very important for us because we havent shown the majority of the fans what we can do
8883090 its important we get our home record together and make withdean a fortress again
8883091 im sure mr hoyer didnt even know who the sponsor was
8883092 if we look at the sheer number of people going spain is still the number one top seller
8883093 forget travelling to the far corners of the world brits would much prefer to holiday closer to home
8883094 i think the fact that people are travelling more than theyve ever done before has meant that people are more open minded and more curious about visiting countries and cities that probably wouldnt have been high on a list some years ago
8883095 with north africa in your sights youll gallop through the waves towards the sand dunes at the windsurfers paradise of tarifa canter through tranquil pinewoods on secluded nature reserves and explore hidden villages where you can enjoy an ice cold fino against dramatic views sweeping out over the ocean
8883096 people are much more likely to cut back on other aspects of their life rather than forego a summer holiday
8883097 people are no longer necessarily going to spain for a package holiday
8883098 its just a wonderful gritty environment theres a sense of discovery
8883099 they had the large population the industrial living you had three and four families living in a dwelling
8883100 the strip district was an ideal place for us to start
8883101 there really arent many chain stores around here its like local mom and pop businesses and the strips kind of become like a gourmet foodie destination
8883102 people come down to get fresh ingredients and unique stuff and just to walk around
8883103 pittsburgh is a community town and thats why everybody that lives here loves it
8883104 pittsburgh isnt the type of town that you go to that has strip malls
8883105 i wanted to grow my hair long and stop wearing suits
8883106 culinary tours are really offered everywhere all of the big cities
8883107 so it was just a matter of time that pittsburgh needed to offer it as well

8883117 landlords outside of london and the south east experienced considerable price increases between 2003 and 2008 and subsequently made substantial returns on their investment properties
8883118 however with these returns came large tax burdens and it is clear that those who sat tight and waited to sell in q2 2008 instead of q1 really saw the benefit of the governments cgt reform
8883119 what maybe we have not done in the past is given people what they want but rather assumed what they want not surprisingly they have dropped out of sport at 16 this scheme is about giving something for everybody
8883120 the right thing to do if you want to build a healthier nation and also a happier one
8883121 ten years ago we were looking at 26 of children doing that level of sport
8883122 the government can say quite justifiably that we have seen quite a transformation but we now have a chance to go further
8883123 between 1979 and 1997 10 000 school playing fields were sold
8883124 stuck in a time warp when it comes to their perceptions of school sport in this country
8883125 school playing fields arent being sold off left right and centre pe is not being abandoned from the timetable and competition is no longer a dirty word in fact there has been a dramatic and unparalleled transformation of school sport that emulates the transformation of elite sport in britain
8883126 todays announcement by sport england is further proof of that and builds on our olympic medal success
8883127 i understood why coach eric mangini didnt want to play the starters
8883128 sure i wanted to play but it wasnt a big deal i never really brought it up
8883129 now well move on to some really tough decisions on roster cuts
8883130 somebody asked me what my name was and i told them the devil
8883131 i cant make this up theres no benefit in me telling the world that basically i was demon possessed in my right mind im not going to tell anybody im the devil
8883132 after every game i would have a 40 ounce of malt liquor and then i would uh have a blunt which is like a cigar gutted with you know with marijuana in it
8883133 then i would have half a pint of jack daniels
8883134 that was kind of the first time i actually had a real conversation with god
8883135 if you look at the attitude of someone like an antonio pierce who you will probably see his personality coming through on that defense he has been one of these guys that had to prove people wrong to get where he is
8883136 they beat the patriots with their pass rush you can break down that game any way you want but they won that game by pressuring tom brady
8883137 tuck was able to wreak havoc because he was on the inside getting blocked by guards
8883138 the great advantage the giants had was taken away by injuries and retirement its not an insult to tuck and kiwanuka but what was an impossible situation can be manageable by opposing offenses
8883139 the eagles were finished by jan 1 and a month later they are lifting weights and getting ready for next season while the giants were drinking champagne and going to the white house
8883140 the results for the half year are of course disappointing
8883141 the group has robust fundamentals with a business model focused primarily on food a balanced portfolio of formats leading positions in the countries where it operates and a sound balance sheet
8883142 in an uncertain and challenging environment the implementation of the operational action plan we announced in july makes me confident that we will achieve our 2008 objectives
8883143 if i look at the situation in the second quarter we would have to say it was more self inflicted
8883144 whenever youre restarting growth what i can tell you is its an imprecise process there were some parts of the business where we were probably too aggressive
8883145 we are also well positioned with strong publishing lists for the second half and beyond
8883146 we are not suggesting that schools should adopt a soft approach to bullying but simply stating that on the basis of the evidence bullying is a more complex issue than some people believe it to be
8883147 early interventions that teach children coping strategies for developmental difficulties such as hyperactivity may also alleviate the later possibility of being targeted as victims and or engaging in bullying
8883148 tax is one reason but we have had this idea for a long time and see it as a way to internationalise the business
8883149 the boards priority has been to ensure that we can continue to fund our business safely and we have achieved this with a strong capital base following our rights issue our new chief executive richard pym will review our plans for the business to enable us to continue to operate effectively in these economic conditions
8883150 until this hurricane hits the trend has to be higher toward the 120 level
8883151 if this turns out to be a non event the market could really come roaring back down
8883152 it seems there will be at the very least a slight hit to production
8883153 but everything is up in the air until monday or tuesday
8883154 ppr has always been able to take advantage of periods of slower growth and the present case is no exception
8883155 if i look at the situation in the second quarter we would have to say it was more self inflicted
8883156 whenever youre restarting growth what i can tell you is its an imprecise process there were some parts of the business where we were probably too aggressive
8883157 vor allem in einem derart schweren spiel wie gegen kroatien braucht man spieler die zu hundert prozent fit sind
8883158 i know im not where i can be im not playing up to my potential yet but for having one week of practice with my hand in the dirt i felt good about it
8883159 he has to take part of the blame for what has happened in the last five years as far as whatever is showing up now
8883160 its been a cumulative effect but what weve got to do myself and my brother hal is get this thing back on track like they did in the 90s
8883161 the bottom line i am the gm this is not a joe girardi issue and we have a terrific hitting coach and extremely talented players i put together the club
8883162 i am responsible for that its my job to fix it my job is frustrating the hell out of me the owners have done everything needed to do
8883163 there is enough blame to go around certainly its not joe girardi thats for sure
8883164 there was a five year period where things didnt go very well building the minor leagues and this is the first full year that myself and my brother have to straighten things out it wasnt just brian there were some people that arent with us any more as usual it was a group effort
8883165 yet to be determined but i am leaning that way
8883166 you want to be patient and this game is a marathon not a sprint i understand that i want to get this thing strong and try to come back and help as much as i can
8883167 its a discussion we have to have if theres enough time left to stretch him out as a starter
8883168 i dont know lester has pretty good control if so its part of the game but i know lester hes a good kid
8883169 fortunately it got me in the right spot on the wrist any further up or down id be in big trouble
8883170 as far as girardi is concerned who i think is brilliant this is his first year and hes had to play the hand he was dealt
8883171 not only that he lost a lot of his parts through injuries baseball managers cant perform miracles its easier for a football coach to do that for a baseball manager its more leadership and having the parts having the players
8883172 the dodgers are in the easy division the national league west
8883173 if the dodgers were in the american league east they would be nowhere thats the bottom line but joe torre was a great manager and joe girardi is going to be a great manager we try to avoid picking bad managers torre was great and girardi is going to be great so no it wouldnt have made a difference
8883174 for now they are without josh beckett but they would have had to go longer without beckett or beckett and daisuke matsuzaka or beckett and jon lester to match what weve had with joba chamberlain and chien ming wang plus everybody else
8883175 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8883176 until this hurricane hits the trend has to be higher toward the 120 level
8883177 if this turns out to be a non event the market could really come roaring back down
8883178 it seems there will be at the very least a slight hit to production

8883183 but everything is up in the air until monday or tuesday
8883184 there are a lot of yankees red sox games in this building that mean more than this
8883185 you cant make this one of the great games ever unless something else occurs down the road to make it important
8883186 but as good as that was nobody would remember it if we didnt come back and win
8883187 hopefully this is where i unhook that train ive been carrying around behind me
8883188 its going to be a fight all the way down the road
8883189 youve got the two top teams in the division for the last couple of years
8883190 i like the guys and i think weve got a good club but whether the option is picked up is beyond my control
8883191 i knew what i was doing wrong if i had good mechanics and my bat was wrong its a different story but i knew that the bat speed was there the strength was there and the health was there so it was just a matter of making it work
8883192 thats is something that well deal with in the offseason
8883193 most people were excited theyd seen work happening on the building and were anxious to find out what is going in there i was invited into some houses and introduced around a couple of people went out of their way to get me in contact with some of the others on my list who didnt happen to be around when i showed up one property owner in particular who doesnt live in the building they own asked me to leave a petition with a neighbor so she could come down and pick it up she brought it to her husband who i later found out is very ill she mailed it back to me with the signatures and a little note wishing me good luck on my new adventure some of the doors i knocked on were answered by people who obviously werent expecting a stranger doors were answered by women in tears one woman was nursing a baby one man was in a towel all of these people while they were being inconvenienced agreed to sign all in all it forced me to meet people i otherwise may not have met and i think itll make my business and hopefully in turn the neighborhood stronger
8883194 as a pro humane no kill shelter were running out of space because we dont euthanize to create cage space
8883195 these cats came in as strays between may and july were offering this special on adoptions to open cage space and relieve stress on the animals
8883196 sometimes cats appear shy and dont come to the front of the cage
8883197 thats just the shelter setting take a little more time to spend with the cat out of the cage once you do that youll see the more lovable side of the cat
8883198 hold on to your hats and grab your seats the red sox just reached for their throats the world series is going to a seventh game
8883199 im not feeling like im 100 percent i like the way theyre using me to get one out or one inning once in a while im just trying to finish the season get some rest and come back ready to go in spring training next season will be a little different
8883200 i can go up there and hit i just cant get out of the box
8883201 i dont care about that anymore im here thats all that matters
8883202 i havent received any calls from somebody initiating a conversation we dont have any conversations going on
8883203 becoming a knuckleball pitcher at this stage of my career is like a hitter converting to a switch hitter late in his career the transition has a high degree of difficulty and its still not fully complete but im glad to be headed in this direction
8883204 we should not spend time on voices that say climate change is not real
8883205 as for whether this momentum will continue past next week im somewhat skeptical

8883213 i felt comfortable felt like i was back home playing ball in high school and college and first couple of games in houston before it got real ugly
8883214 if i can feel comfortable and feel like i can slow the game down we can do anything out there on the field
8883215 in the position im in thats what i got to do got to be ready any time
8883216 it was really fun to get some reps with them and handing off to brandon jacobs is like handing off to a d lineman kind of cool
8883217 a little dude tried to tackle me i couldnt let that happen
8883218 for example it is highly unlikely that there is a positive correlation between advertising expenditures and corporate profitibility some profitable firms spend little on advertising and many advertising expenditures produce disappointing results
8883219 i think theres going to be a steady drip drip drip of bad news
8883220 weve only seen the very tip of the iceberg in terms of bank failures
8883221 i fully expect the fdic insurance fund to be depleted
8883222 the fdic is going to be one of what is going to be an increasing string of government bailouts
8883223 the reality is anybody who is within that threshold shouldnt lose any sleep at night
8883224 for all the kind of unjustifiable bailouts being done on wall street theres no chance that the government is going to let john q publics money disappear
8883225 consumer confidence readings suggest that the economy remains stuck in neutral but may be showing signs of improvement by early next year however overall readings are still quite low by historical standards and it is still too early to tell if the worst is behind us

8883245 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8883246 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time

8883254 la paradoja es que los colegios no pueden recibir esa demanda porque no tienen el dinero necesario para ampliar los establecimientos
8883255 por eso pedimos que el estado revise el r gimen de subsidios la matr cula aumenta pero el aporte no acompa a ese crecimiento

8883259 we are always right and well bomb you if you think differently
8883260 her people are checking and double checking her schedule to make sure she doesnt go within a mile of brad let alone bump into him
8883261 shes already concerned about her break up with john mayer overshadowing her movie so the last thing she wants is another ex in the picture its inconvenient having to duck and dive but more than anything she finds it embarrassing
8883262 went crazy when she found out brad and jen will be in the same town at the same time
8883263 compounding angelinas pain is the fact that she is feeling insecure about the baby weight that she is still carrying while jen looks sexier than ever since her split from john mayer
8883264 angelina is having a difficult time dropping the estimated 50 lbs she gained while pregnant with vivienne and knox she has zero sex drive because she hates her post pregnancy body
8883265 she told a close friend that if brad sees jen looking as hot as she does right now he could be tempted

8883269 we have a good team and well go up there with the idea of playing well
8883270 our guys are going to be super juiced i know i will
8883271 we made a majority of the home games the last 2 years when wally started
8883272 id be lying if i said this wasnt a special game to me we get a chance to play in front of more than 100 000 people in the same stadium that my brother played in i never would have imagined something like this when i was younger
8883273 i dont get back to penn state as often as i would have liked mainly because i became a college coach after i finished playing in the nfl
8883274 a lot of those reunions happen during football season so for me it was almost impossible
8883275 they did have a reunion of our teams a few years back i was going to go but i was coaching at the university of connecticut then and tv switched the time of our kickoff from noon to 7 30 p m so that took care of that
8883276 i know jack ham will be there because he does the radio broadcasts for penn state
8883277 i havent gotten a full list of those attending but chuck burkhart and steve smear are in charge of that so theyll be there for sure i heard pete johnson is coming too
8883278 im hoping mike reid comes back and franco harris ted kwalick i want to see them all and it goes without saying of course that i have the deepest respect for my old coach joe paterno
8883279 i liked the idea of playing a team that has so much tradition and support
8883280 penn state does things the right way at coastal we feel that thats what were doing we have a successful program and not just in terms of winning football games to an extent weve modeled our program very much after the penn states of the world
8883281 i told our guys theyd better not get caught looking around with their mouths wide open or they could get embarrassed
8883282 i had never played safety before corner is my natural position
8883283 but as a return man he sure looks like hes got a little zip to him
8883284 the next time if it did happen again like that id probably let that one go
8883285 im spending it just as fast as im making it

8883297 espero que en estas fechas llegue a tu casa paz gloria y esperanza y que te puedas follar a las tres felices fiestas
8883298 i guess if they can move into a new yankee stadium they can have instant replay the game is evolving much to my chagrin
8883299 i dont like it the game is the game let the game be pure in what it is
8883300 otherwise they are going to set themselves up for some embarrassing situations that could possibly occur and i dont think major league baseball at this particular time needs that
8883301 come on i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco at first
8883302 its armageddon baseball is a game of human error it always has been and always will be why would you want to take that away i think its dumb
8883303 they should remove two rows of seats in the rightfield stands and raise the wall to the same height as it is in leftfield 12 feet that would eliminate line drive home runs that barely clear the 8 foot wall
8883304 they should put wind screens up in the gap in the stands between home plate and third base that causes a jet stream to right and right center
8883305 its the only sign weve missed all year and you only have to look for one thing
8883306 its going out there every game every win is crucial
8883307 all of a sudden you come into this scenario from where i was coming from
8883308 i dont know im not a bat maker and im not a termite so i cant tell you whats good wood and whats bad wood
8883309 im happy to see manny i respect him in my career barry bonds and ramirez have been the two best of my time
8883310 its just that they dont know what theyre doing out there what pitch to throw what to do in a given situation also pitchers are told to try to pitch to the hitters weakness instead of staying with their own strength do you think nolan ryan pitched to a hitters weakness or stayed with his strength

8883320 completes a pattern of hyped one sided reportage that goes back a while
8883321 found 63 percent of voters support u s or israeli military action against iran if diplomacy fails
8883322 ive been asked to talk about orange juice cell phone service furniture
8883323 the whole basis of the whole thing was were going to go into iran and what do we have to do to get you guys to along with it
8883324 ive never seen a moderator who was so persistent in manipulating and leading the participants
8883325 i got the general feeling that george bush didnt have a shot in hell
8883326 it is not going to be so easy this time around
8883327 there is virtually no public support for an attack on iran
8883328 its harder for pro israel groups to avoid the charge that they are indifferent to american interests and they have the added difficulty of being aligned with the christian zionists some of whom are openly calling for war with iran
8883329 its a difficult situation for pro israel groups to be in
8883330 they have to lie low and bring pressure from the sidelines
8883331 information provided to the president by the cia which he will use to make his decisions may prove to be false or non existent
8883332 because of the billions of dollars given to the cia the cia will be unwilling to admit it has no intelligence on iran and will instead be tempted to provide a false assessment of the threat

8883342 who the fuck are you youre gonna get the tickets alloted in your contract
8883343 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it
8883344 i am tired of being bent over by elitexc with no vaseline
8883345 we are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty that sits on its hands while a major american city drowns before our eyes
8883346 john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8883347 the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and nbled together and some died together under the same proud flag
8883348 they have not served a red america or a blue america
8883349 they have served the united states of america so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8883350 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8883351 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8883352 barack obamas speech tonight laid out his specific bold solutions and optimistic vision for our nation and our childrens future his speech crystallized the clear choice between he and senator mccain four more years of the same failed policies or a leader who can tackle the great challenges we face revitalizing our economy and restoring our standing in the world i am proud to support senator obama our next president of the united states and joe biden our next vice president of the united states
8883353 were just floored there was never a time never a moment that felt so important and made us want to give a little more go a little further
8883354 he gave us the confidence to do that im proud to be a democrat and im proud to be an american
8883355 just day to day were going to keep checking be smart with it
8883356 were not talking about the end of a season were talking about the end of a career when youre dealing with a pitchers arm
8883357 were just dealing with it the best way we can i dont think we can do anything different
8883358 the dvd is tucked away we met the governor we had the jackets the parade the dinner etc etc all of that was important but its yesterdays news
8883359 im worried about september our early schedule is very tough
8883360 finishing in the top eight would be great were looking for a home playoff game but until we play together you dont know
8883361 our opener against campbell will be a good test for us
8883362 if we hold our own against campbell it should be a good season for us
8883363 i think dr king would have been proud to have witnessed tonights events
8883364 no place in my mind or im sure his would we have imagined seeing so many people of all type of backgrounds rallying behind someone like us who had been denied full participation for so long
8883365 the walls that king and obama are trying to tear down are much different
8883366 king was trying to tear down the walls of injustice obama is trying to build walls of opportunity
8883367 he couldnt mention martin he couldnt mention the civil rights movement he couldnt mention those who sacrificed and gave so much its very very difficult to actually create a new world if you dont acknowledge the world from which you are emerging
8883368 if we were being true to kings dream wed be talking about poverty how to eradicate it and the long list of things that mattered to him
8883369 i just fear that his legacy will get glossed over
8883370 for most americans august 28 1963 was the dream speech day and for them its like a happy day
8883371 that is a one dimensional view of the risk and terror of that day
8883372 the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation
8883373 has given the negro people a bad check a check that has come back marked insufficient funds but we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt we refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation
8883374 i feel that he truly does offer hope for this nation for all americans not some americans all americans
8883375 we have two boys in the palumbos that are playing at a higher level than most of the kids in the united states
8883376 steve is in the top 25 in the national pool and robbie is in the top 100 or 200
8883377 when you have two kids on the field like that the level of play comes up and everyone tries to emulate them you have to be careful to not get caught watching them but helping them
8883378 the higher level players have to be patient and let the other kids skills come up
8883379 all these kids are excellent athletes so we have to wait for them to gain touch and decision making ability in order to be a cohesive unit
8883380 the same sort of thing happened last year where we just tried to make it cohesive team unit where you have a diversity of players from kids nationally ranked to those who are seasonal players
8883381 another strength we have is the leadership of our captain josh diburro
8883382 he makes sure the work rate is up gives pep talks and adds to our continuity we have the quiet elite leadership of steve and rob palumbo and the vocal active leadership of josh diburro
8883383 we were just a bounce or two away from the semifinals
8883384 my hope is we will play to our potential and grow as each game is played with controlled possession with great patience and skill
8883385 i know this team is capable because they get better each day and with each practice
8883386 this team plays very well together and trusts each other on and off the field if you have team chemistry like this anything is possible during the season and when the playoffs begin
8883387 from two miles to maybe three and a half i had this older lady driving alongside of me with two small dogs in the car
8883388 the lead police officer was signaling her to get off the road but she was a little unaware
8883389 i eventually had to tell her that he was going to ticket her if she didnt back off she was right next to me and the dogs were freaking out
8883390 ive run it two or three times in the past
8883391 my dad took me there back in 96 for my first 10k i was confused as to why no one was given a shirt at the registration table he told me that id have to come in the top 100 to get one but he made it sound impossible
8883392 i actually wore that shirt his first 10k t shirt to work monday
8883393 i had a goal of breaking 32 00 which ive only done once before back in 2002
8883394 i hit the mile all alone in 4 57 and two miles in 10 00 unfortunately i didnt wear my watch i was relying on people being at the mile splits but all i found were orange markers in the road without a person in sight
8883395 after the woman in the car left i ran the rest of the race alone
8883396 i gave a few glances back as i was starting to feel the effects of a fast start but only saw a pack a ways back i thought that they might have a chance at catching me but i lucked out
8883397 basically i worked here and there but really got my training back on the right track
8883398 ive been battling a foot injury since dec 8 2006 but it seems to be under control theres some occasional pain but dr timothy kemple in derry really helped me fix the problem
8883399 ive been really working on getting my base mileage in for the fall cross country races and eventually indoor track
8883400 ive been logging 65 to 80 mile weeks for the past two months and the fitness is starting to come around
8883401 i want to set some personal records this winter in the 800 meters 1 000 meters 3 000 meters 5 000 meters and my favorite the mile i dont think im too old to stop dreaming of a sub 4 minute mile
8883402 i got in a solid 17 mile run sunday after work i love long runs but this one hurt lets just say i spent 20 minutes in the tub afterwards in sub 50 degree water from the waist down i think that was as painful as the run
8883403 obviously if you would ask me at the moment if im playing like a no 1 probably not
8883404 its very frustrating because i know i can play so much better
8883405 i was thinking am i really made to play tennis
8883406 whichever way the draw goes whichever way the matches go as long as hopefully its a win for me im pretty happy about it
8883407 oh yes i remember i wont forget but id like to have a more recent memory as of like 08
8883408 he was specific enough to give comfort to those seeking more meat
8883409 once you remove the gloss tonights speech was the same tired democratic rhetoric of the past 30 years
8883410 permitting and encouraging children to be verbally active fosters concentration effort problem solving and task success

8883414 ich bin nicht so gro wie die klitschkos und mir wird nachgesagt dass ich nur klammern w rde aber die sogenannten experten schauen nicht richtig hin es muss doch einen grund daf r geben warum ich schon so viele gute boxer besiegt habe
8883415 nat rlich fiebere ich diesem kampf entgegen denn es geht um den weltmeisterschaftsg rtel
8883416 was ich von ruiz halte ich spreche generell nicht viel ber meine gegner ich wei dass er sehr erfahren ist
8883417 ich glaube dass ich mich zum damaligen kampf verbessert habe und es keine diskussionen um meinen sieg geben wird dank meines neuen trainers alexander zimin hat sich meine technik stark verbessert und ich verf ge ber mehr selbstvertrauen
8883418 was soll die ganze sache mit seinem neuen trainer ich habe auch einen neuen coach daher sind wir quitt ich bin hier um mir den titel zur ckzuholen der mir vor drei jahren gestohlen wurde
8883419 i dont care about the first two games this one hurt
8883420 we played our hearts out we lost a really tough game
8883421 its sad to see it go but i think itll be fun to move to the new stadium
8883422 you dont ever want to get swept especially in the situation were in
8883423 we had to really fight to win that last one

8883427 i am very grateful for this opportunity and i understand my responsibilities to the dallas cowboys and the national football league right now i just want to keep working hard so i can accomplish the goals that i have set for myself both on and off the field
8883428 we worked well as a team but we werent able to finish
8883429 they developed a passion for volleyball which will help this year
8883430 everyone wants to come off last season and blow everyone away
8883431 shes happy all the time and everyone looks to her
8883432 she definitely brings a feeling of teamsmanship to the team
8883433 if present at all was very small and statistically non significant and may simply be a healthy user artifact that they were unable to identify
8883434 while such a reduction in all cause mortality would have been impressive these mortality benefits are likely implausible previous studies were likely measuring a benefit not directly attributable to the vaccine itself but something specific to the individuals who were vaccinated a healthy user benefit or frailty bias
8883435 over the last two decades in the united sates even while vaccination rates among the elderly have increased from 15 to 65 percent there has been no commensurate decrease in hospital admissions or all cause mortality further only about 10 percent of winter time deaths in the united states are attributable to influenza thus to suggest that the vaccine can reduce 50 percent of deaths from all causes is implausible in our opinion
8883436 the healthy user effect is seen in what doctors often refer to as their good patients patients who are well informed about their health who exercise regularly do not smoke or have quit drink only in moderation watch what they eat come in regularly for health maintenance visits and disease screenings take their medications exactly as prescribed and quite religiously get vaccinated each year so as to stay healthy such attributes are almost impossible to capture in large scale studies using administrative databases
8883437 but you also need to take care of yourself everyone can reduce their risk by taking simple precautions
8883438 wash your hands avoid sick kids and hospitals during flu season consider antiviral agents for prophylaxis and tell your doctor as soon as you feel unwell because there is still a chance to decrease symptoms and prevent hospitalization if you get sick because flu vaccine is not as effective as people have been thinking it is
8883439 the healthy user effect is everywhere you dont want it to be
8883440 to our knowledge this is the first report of a direct association between childhood abuse and asthma and asthma related outcomes
8883441 we wanted to explore whether exposure to stress and violence is associated with an increased risk of asthma in urban children living in puerto rico
8883442 we already know that there is a high prevalence of asthma in puerto rican children and many studies have linked stress and exposure to violence to health problems in childhood including asthma
8883443 children with a history of abuse had higher frequencies of all outcomes of interest than those without a history of abuse
8883444 after adjusting for relevant covariates history of abuse was associated with an approximate doubling of the odds of current asthma healthcare use for asthma and allergic rhinitis
8883445 it is not simply the exposure to a particular stressor but the physiological response to that stressor that predicts physical health outcomes
8883446 latino culture places an emphasis on certain values and social supports that may buffer the effects of poverty and community violence experienced by children in puerto rico
8883447 our findings highlight the importance of both screening for illnesses such as asthma in children who are abused and of being aware of the possibility of abuse in children with asthma
8883448 smoking during pregnancy is a double edged sword with respect to sids
8883449 not only does it raise a mothers likelihood of having a preterm baby who is already among the most vulnerable to sids but it increases the infants susceptibility to sids even further
8883450 preterm babies are known to have increased breathing difficulties in proportion to their prematurity and cigarette smoke is known to increase apneas in full term babies
8883451 but until now cigarette smoke exposure and preterm birth have not been investigated together with respect to their potential effects on respiratory dysfunction
8883452 our study shows that preterm infants make incomplete and or delayed recovery from interruptions in breathing
8883453 this has clear implications for their risk of sids but there is even still another reason for concern even after the risk of sids has passed inability or delayed recovery from repeated low oxygen episodes can also be detrimental to brain development there is increasing evidence that infants exposed to prenatal cigarette smoke are at high risk for developmental and behavioral disorders
8883454 since preterm infants continue to have significant cardiorespiratory events after discharge from the hospital our study may help identify the infants at risk for attenuated recovery from hypoxemic episodes while at home
8883455 furthermore it might help distinguish the infants who will arouse in response to hypoxemia the infants identified to be at risk can subsequently be further investigated and or monitored at home
8883456 heres the snack area crunchy food magically appears at various times throughout the day moist food shows up once a day around quitting time and this is the observation portal from here you can see the land of outside but its against company policy to visit it unsupervised this is the restroom some of our less civilized employees use this instead of the restbox oh and this is the restbox i trust you know how to use that what sigh follow me

8883471 free safety gives me the ability to make some plays whereas at corner you had people throwing away from you or plays that just went away from you a lot theres going to be a lot more production for me
8883472 when youre sitting in the staff room and looking at what our defense does our free safety has got to be able to tackle aaron thomas was a two year starter at corner going into his senior year we said guys were a better team with him at free safety aaron embraced it the great thing with john is that he embraced it last spring
8883473 johns our no 1 right now it doesnt mean that terrence klein wont play there or ryan mcguinness wont play there
8883474 theres four guys for three cornerback free safety spots back there in my mind we want the best fit if we need someone who can really run and fill the alleys and do that stuff out there john clements is good because he can really cover some ground
8883475 it will be interesting to see how i fare with the bigger guys inside
8883476 he can do it all it makes our defense a lot more versatile throwing him back there
8883477 i just hope what were doing in practice defensively carries over
8883478 ive been encouraged weve been flying to the ball and getting some strips out i know were doing that better i think were tackling better
8883479 these things are good but again its going to translate to what happens next saturday

8883484 you wont hear me say dont wear a helmet it is still advised
8883485 we did really well out there but i was hoping we would be ready for the game we did enough to get through
8883486 but i believe we could improve immensely on that performance
8883487 wed like to offer you a 20 per cent revenue share

8883489 the large crowd that we expect is indicative of the campaign that senator obama has run from the beginning change happens from the bottom up

8883491 here we were eating lunch and it was like the clouds parted and the sun was shining
8883492 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations
8883493 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8883494 the real point is does this just feed into the growing perception that what we have is one big glitzy production
8883495 but really after the crowd files out after the fireworks take place the question remains what is left and is this person ready to be president of the united states

8883504 at first glance the tr os keys seem to be placed very close together and with fairly large fingers i was certain that this would be an issue for me
8883505 we were disappointed not to find a smoking gun that would explain the common association between obesity and asthma
8883506 however this research points us to other possibilities that future research should examine
8883507 we hypothesized that the low grade systemic inflammation present in obesity would augment the inflammation of asthma a synergistic effect
8883508 or alternatively that the inflammation of obesity might affect the airways independently an additive effect perhaps resulting in mixed airway inflammation
8883509 what we found was that although inflammatory cells and other biomarkers of inflammation were increased there was no significant interaction demonstrated between obesity and asthma
8883510 this does not change the fact that there is a well established link between asthma and obesity sometimes a negative result is important and the results add to our body of knowledge regarding the obesity asthma link now we need to look in other directions for the answers
8883511 we did not look at this in our patients given that asthma is immunologically driven this is a potential avenue for further research
8883512 alternatively it may be that dynamic changes in lung function that occur with episodes of asthma are different with excess body weight
8883513 obese patients with asthma are more difficult to treat because their response to bronchoconstriction is exaggerated and gives the impression that the asthma is worse
8883514 they may well have worse symptoms but not as a result of underlying airway inflammation still the typical response is often to increase their inhaled anti inflammatory therapy this is unlikely to provide the answer and may even do harm the answer lies in dealing with the obesity itself
8883515 in the face of good growth and loose fiscal policy i dont expect any relaxation in the central banks tight policy stance even though inflation has moderated slightly
8883516 this year also growth will be close to 8 percent and close to 8 percent growth is not something to be scoffed at
8883517 consumption spending is going to get a boost from an expansionary fiscal policy in the second half of the year
8883518 the prolonged slowdown in manufacturing does now finally look to be spreading to services with financial services growth showing the biggest decline from 10 5 percent to 9 3 percent
8883519 nanotechnology is new regulation needed and if so by whom
8883520 some experiments have shown that nanomaterials can cause cell damage in laboratory animals but very little is presently known about the possible toxic effects or how those materials might accumulate and interact in the atmosphere soil and water
8883521 although nanoparticles can exist naturally there are many who believe that the consequences of widespread introduction of such particles into the environment should have been more thoroughly investigated before the proliferation of products reached the market
8883522 an die sicherheit zu denken ist besonders wichtig in diesem beruf
8883523 we are trying to make strategic investments in relevant matters in todays world exploring the possibilities that nanotechnology can enable in the development of the next generation of devices is a natural corollary of that endeavour
8883524 we have promoted the building of public private partnership and encouraged entrepreneurship both in the academia and industry this fellowship attempts to spawn new relations with the next generation
8883525 what the indian scientific community needs today is human resources people driven enough to innovate
8883526 the aim is a synchronised development of devices and applications to make e commerce more accessible even to farmers who might have never seen a pc but own mobile phones
8883527 it is innovation like this that will be the main driver of the indian gdp
8883528 this coexistence is an exotic superconducting state that has not been observed in any other superconducting material
8883529 it shows a very strong link between superconductivity and magnetism
8883530 its not clear what the origin of this state is or what creates or modifies it
8883531 its really a question of the chicken and the egg
8883532 does superconductivity need magnetism in this state or does magnetism need superconductivity
8883533 this is a new paradigm for understanding the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity
8883534 it could help us find the basis for understanding unconventional high temperature superconductivity

8883541 hes quite rightly named his party new zealand first and thats how he sees it so hes hell bent on pursuing economic and safety goals for ll of new zealand and does not show any preference or priority for maori issues in that sense but his pride in being maori and enjoying life as a maori is very clear and very evident
8883542 the goal for me right now and other new zealand first mps is to take care of the business thats before the house right now firstly and foremost right through to when parliament lifts and then obviously to fight a campaign and make sure new zealand first is back there to make sure people understand whats happened to us and dont allow these people to win in the long run

8883546 we recommend dialogue between india and pakistan to promote the peace process in the region but because of the kashmir issue these dialogues have been put on ice for the peace process to take place at the peoples level both countries must allow the citizens of the other country to visit freely for which we recommend that visa requirements be lifted if not then the visa process must be easy so that people are encouraged to visit each other
8883547 the pipfpd has planned the same convention in lahore in november 2007 but it was postponed as former president pervez musharraf imposed an emergency in the country and again in may 2008 in peshawar but the current pakistani government informed us that the inter services intelligence isi had not issued clearances so these visas were not issued to the indian delegates we have now set it for november and demand that the pakistan government to issue visas to the indian delegates

8883564 c amp c expects the current difficult market conditions to continue throughout the second half of the year which notwithstanding the benefit of the roll out of draught magners in great britain will result in continued pressure on revenue and operating profit
8883565 the expected return to volume growth in great britain in quarter two did not materialise due to the worsening economic environment continuing competitive pressure and a slower realisation of the benefits from market initiatives

8883604 un certain nombre de facteurs anti croissance se sont d velopp s
8883605 scientists have identified a mutant form of a gene or allele that prohibits the growth of armour
8883606 by documenting the physical traits and genetic makeup of the offspring produced by these marine sticklebacks in freshwater we were able to track how natural selection operates on this gene
8883607 we found a significant increase in the frequency of this allele in their offspring evidence that natural selection favours reduced armour in freshwater
8883608 it leads us to believe that the genetic expression is also tied to increased growth rate
8883609 if the fish arent expending resources growing bones which may be significantly more difficult in freshwater due to its lack of ions they can devote more energy to increasing biomass
8883610 this in turn allows them to breed earlier and improves over winter survival rate

8883624 its sad to see it go but i think itll be fun to move to the new stadium
8883625 you dont ever want to get swept especially in the situation were in
8883626 we had to really fight to win that last one
8883627 he was always happy to see you to give you a nice firm handshake and a smile
8883628 if he was out flying he would come by and buzz the camp
8883629 he was definitely fun to be around a loyal and loving family member
8883630 he took me for a plane ride at littlebrook one time and when we came in for a landing he continued full speed down the runway and took off again at the last possible moment he really scared the hell out of me and my mother we will really miss him
8883631 i remember when he babysat us as children he literally went around the house with an apron on taking care of us he continued his military legacy by assigning demerits to us for bad behavior
8883632 if you want to know when we did something just go to bobbys records
8883633 he was a weird character but he was thoughtful and generous in his own way he was a good man and he will be missed
8883634 i am very grateful for this opportunity and i understand my responsibilities to the dallas cowboys and the national football league right now i just want to keep working hard so i can accomplish the goals that i have set for myself both on and off the field
8883635 obviously if you would ask me at the moment if im playing like a no 1 probably not
8883636 its very frustrating because i know i can play so much better
8883637 i was thinking am i really made to play tennis
8883638 whichever way the draw goes whichever way the matches go as long as hopefully its a win for me im pretty happy about it
8883639 oh yes i remember i wont forget but id like to have a more recent memory as of like 08
8883640 wherever one turns there is a wide and restful view one island behind the other each soft shape melting into the next until the last dim outline is lost in the distance
8883641 new japan does not like trees its totem is the bulldozer
8883642 i hear they are building a bridge to the island of tsu alas to what now shall i compare myself
8883643 the mist rose like a curtain obscured the mountain revealed the beach the pier the three girls they looked like small children small on the black pier the black mountains behind them the sun lifted itself above the mountains flying the rising mist turned gold the entire island floated large on the sea like a mirror the girls were gone swallowed into the morning
8883644 we learned a lot about how to run a full day session last year
8883645 its a new challenge and i think these kids are more prepared than we were because theyre expected to be
8883646 its wonderful to meet new kids and new families and weve had a lot sign up
8883647 as far as our son is concerned the loss is unbearable
8883648 its been a horrific two years dealing with losing our son and then having to push law enforcement to do something about it
8883649 we didnt even hear about the marijuana in nortons backpack until july of this year
8883650 just day to day were going to keep checking be smart with it
8883651 were not talking about the end of a season were talking about the end of a career when youre dealing with a pitchers arm
8883652 were just dealing with it the best way we can i dont think we can do anything different
8883653 ich kann ohne probleme meine f e hinter den kopf klemmen

8883656 people 65 and older make up 20 percent of our households
8883657 they make up 35 percent of our low income and the percentage of their energy burden is high at 13 to 15 percent of their income this year with higher electricity prices we need more liheap funding and we need to increase the eligibility rates
8883658 i believe we need to focus our discussion on a price and i believe the community is best served with a school that costs 40 million or less with a hopeful reimbursement rate of 15 million from the state
8883659 the community needs a realistic expectation of what this building will mean to their tax bill
8883660 my concern is we need to be a little careful of how small it gets we dont want it to eat into programs
8883661 im not sure its a good idea to say weve got to cut into programs over the 50 year life of the school for the sake of four of five million dollars over the course of a 20 year bond
8883662 i think the school board is doing what theyre supposed to do
8883663 our job as a council is to bring it in at a price that will work for everybody were not done yet and theres more work to do

8883674 im here to present an exciting project not only for the city as a whole but the fire department in particular
8883675 si vous affichez trop clairement lamiti de la france pour isra l me disait on nous allons perdre nos relations privil gi es avec le monde arabe
8883676 it calls for the development of nine 24 unit three story buildings and accessory community buildings and parking as homes for the elderly defined in this proposal as ages 55 and over to be located on one lot with units to be conveyed as condominium units
8883677 the proposed development owned by ciborowski realty trust is located on the westerly side of lafayette road in the single residential zoning district
8883678 they came again aug 12 to ask that the board consider rezoning the land for their project
8883679 theres some commercial areas and some residential it sounds like a great project but is it the best use for the land
8883680 at the august meeting two or three of the planning board members kept posing the question of why not a mixed use development
8883681 or why not affordable work force housing but they seemed not interested
8883682 rather than working with me with the 55 plus project planners are looking to rezone to something a developer would never do
8883683 they are suggesting an office building they talked to me about sewer my developer will bring sewer to route 1 other than the ciborowski land no one will do anything like that they are making it sound like theyre looking out for the best interest of the town but this project will bring three quarters of a million in tax dollars to the town without almost any impact
8883684 to do it though they need sewer and thats what we offered
8883685 i researched affordable housing and it cant happen without sewer the town doesnt want to float a bond and bring sewer to route 1
8883686 i wish theyd call exeter and see what they have to say
8883687 this concept has been tried and tested i wish rye was more receptive
8883688 new hampshire requirements spell it out better than our zoning and we are working to come up with a better definition
8883689 the first proposal was determined not to meet the definition their attorney malcom mcneill said to make progress would we consider rezoning we said why not look at the route 1 corridor on that side of the road

8883790 y para acabar una buen sima noticia ocurrida recientemente la creaci n de un nuevo podcast sobre c mics en espa ol historietas podcast lo cierto es que su primer programa no tiene desperdicio alguno tanto por la forma de tratar los temas elegidos como por su profesionalidad en cuanto a presentaci n y colaboradores algo que le falta a otro programa que se me viene a la cabeza la verdad es que esta bien que empiecen a despuntar podcast en espa ol peninsular dedicados ntegramente al c mic algo que creo es bastante necesario pero que hasta el momento no ha gozado de demasiada repercusi n desde aqu todo mi apoyo a juan luis y guillermo en su andadura en el podcasting

8883795 when ben bernanke gets a phone call from the head lehman he takes the call but if some poor school teacher in oklahoma calls him he doesnt take the call
8883796 hes dealing with his friends on wall street trying to save them when in fact he should let them fail that would be the better solution at least for 300 million americans

8883805 the pilgrimage is a whole parish effort groundsmen gardeners administrative staff caterers sacristans altar servers and musicians who are all busy making preparations for the big day
8883806 we expect around 800 or 900 people to attend and we pray that the sun will shine on us our annual pilgrimage is a wonderful occasion and an important part of our local christian heritage
8883807 this year fiona armstrong will be here with a border television crew to film the day
8883808 il ny a pas besoin de nouvelles discussions parce quil y a d j un accord sur la table qui attend d tre sign
8883809 children are kept healthy as the nursery has procedures to ensure their continuing good health
8883810 children enjoy outdoor play on a daily basis as the weather allows in their playground staff also take children out to the beach for walks regularly so they enjoy fresh air and exercise
8883811 healthy food choices are available to children as the nursery promotes healthy eating
8883812 in the main children are kept safe and secure in this setting and have sufficient clean age appropriate play equipment that is sufficiently accessible to children so that they make choices about their play and learning
8883813 security is particularly well addressed and there is an efficient electronic secure system to ensure that no strangers can enter the building and that children cannot leave unsupervised
8883814 childrens needs and routines are soundly met as staff talk to parents about their childrens care needs and follow childrens sleep routines staff have developed a homely atmosphere at the nursery where children are relaxed and confident
8883815 all the relevant players are here in south africa at the moment and i think the length of the discussions will be determined by what progress they make
8883816 there was no need for more talks since there was a deal already on the table that was waiting to be signed
8883817 i was talking to carl forber so i wasnt taking that much notice of who was going past there were no comments to any ladies before we set off at all
8883818 i was aware of the noise she was making coming down the aisle i made a waaay noise i dont know why it was meant as a tongue in cheek thing she turned around very aggressively and swore at me
8883819 the boyfriend leapt across the table at me and i sat back down
8883820 i didnt touch her with any part of my body at all
8883821 the lads were full of drink they were cheering and shouting things like get your breasts out love at lasses going past
8883822 then one lass she had a strapless boob tube type thing she got on and went
8883823 it is another exciting venture which shows how much progress we are making on and off the field
8883824 we would hope to double our staff from four to eight but its all down to the council backing us so that our backers can come in with the funding
8883825 wed hoped to get going a lot earlier but the environment agency wanted a flood risk assessment and we have had to lease a little bit of railway land to widen access from the cycle track but everything has been resolved
8883826 aunque actualmente parece que el papel de las mujeres es machista hay que pensar que en la poca de howard era impensable que una mujer tomase las armas y se lanzara a la aventura por lo que podr a tomarse por todo lo contrario como un alegato a que la mujer tambi n puede ser guerrera

8883908 mi pap me llam cuando aterrizaron en salta y me cont que se ven an en colectivo pobre est muerto de cansancio
8883909 yo ya estoy curado del susto es la segunda vez que me mandan a salta hace un tiempo volv a de buenos aires y en pleno vuelo nos avisaron que no funcionaban las radioayudas del aeropuerto de tucum n y nos pas lo mismo que ahora
8883910 llegamos a aeroparque y nos enteramos de que todos los vuelos de aerol neas argentinas estaban demorados cuando llev bamos una hora de vuelo el capit n nos inform que no bamos a poder aterrizar en tucum n les mand un mensaje a unos amigos que tambi n viajaban pero por austral y ellos me contestaron que el vuelo se hab a cancelado
8883911 todav a no sabemos qu pas nos contaron algo acerca de que la autobomba estaba rota lo cierto es que llegamos a destino seis horas despu s de lo previsto
8883912 mi vuelo hacia estados unidos parte a las 21 desde buenos aires y aqu me dicen que reci n a esa hora podr a salir desde santiago del estero hacia la capital federal no s qu voy a hacer
8883913 hice el check in por internet hace tan s lo una hora pero llegu aqu y me di con que el vuelo hab a sido cancelado lo peor es que en el mostrador de la empresa no hay ning n empleado que nos d una explicaci n
8883914 mi nieto tiene que estar a las 19 en ezeiza para viajar hacia canad pero por c mo van las cosas no va a llegar a tiempo es una verg enza que las cosas funcionen as no se puede planificar nada

8883916 vamos a ver los fundamentos de la sentencia pero es un fallo pol tico no estoy para nada satisfecho con la sentencia mi padre est muy mal
8883917 los jueces no pueden hacer otra cosa que esto es el nico espacio que les permitieron porque sino se quedaban sin trabajo esto lo ven amos anunciando hace tiempo los montoneros de ayer son los funcionarios de hoy y son los que est n decidiendo y manejando los hilos del pa s
8883918 no hay ning n argentino mayor de 70 a os detenido en ninguna c rcel del pa s ser a un hecho horroroso y aberrante que aqu lo hubiesen dispuesto no me imagino esa situaci n no existe en la realidad porque hay una ley que lo proh be hubiese sido el colmo burlarse tan groseramente de la ley aunque por tratarse de mi padre puedo esperar cualquier cosa es una aberraci n jur dica un papel n lo resuelto
8883919 lo tom mal pero era lo que todos sab amos que iba a ocurrir los jueces est n amenazados los jueces est n temerosos el se or n stor kirchner es el que promueve todo esto de mi padre puedo decir que est agotado cansado l gicamente agobiado por todo lo que est viviendo
8883920 veo todo esto con mucha indignaci n me da mucho miedo este pa s con instituciones tan d biles tambi n me preocupan estos hechos de violencia pero era esperable hab a bandas de montoneros a la puerta del juzgado y gente for nea que vino s lo a producir el esc ndalo con la presencia del erpiano eduardo luis duhalde secretario de derechos humanos de la naci n no me extra a el desenlace que tuvieron los hechos

8883923 es un d a con sentimientos muy contradictorios porque por un lado pensamos que se ha hecho justicia y por otro sentimos un gran dolor por haber escuchado todas las cosas por las que ha pasado guillermo que era un hombre de bien que cre a en la democracia
8883924 este es un momento de paz pero la paz total ser a que pudiera saber qu pas con guillermo eso nunca lo vamos a saber evidentemente abrigaba la esperanza de que este se or en referencia a antonio bussi alguna vez dijera lo que pas porque l sabe lo que pas en aquellos a os nadie pod a hacer nada en tucum n sin que l lo supiera pero bueno la justicia siempre reconforta en cierta forma
8883925 la palabra de bussi me ha herido profundamente ha agraviado a m y a la memoria de guillermo que no se merec a semejante cosa pero me reconcilia un poco saber que va a sufrir la c rcel que se merece
8883926 no vinimos a buscar venganza ni revancha el veredicto judicial es razonable en cuanto a la condena no queremos que bussi sufra pero tampoco nos gusta que tenga privilegios
8883927 no queremos que tenga privilegios y que siga viviendo en un country
8883928 fue una lucha larga por momentos pasamos por la desesperanza nunca creimos que este d a iba a llegar pero lleg y con toda la potencia de una justicia que cierra los caminos de la impunidad
8883929 s que esto es simb lico que hay miles de familiares de desaparecidos pero creo que esto sirve para que ellos eval en que hay una justicia
8883930 creo que una cosa es men ndez y otra es bussi en funci n de su muy precaria salud habr que evaluar mucho hablo sin rencores y sin venganzas se me ocurre que el tiempo que se tomar el juzgado para evaluar la situaci n es necesario
8883931 es muy dif cil dar piedad a quien no se la merece pero estoy diciendo que no tengo ning n sentimiento de venganza ni de rencor hacia l aunque obviamente pedimos ni olvido ni perd n
8883932 escuchamos una sentencia ejemplar y ahora s lo esperamos que se disponga la c rcel com n para los culpables
8883933 con esto se rompe con la impunidad que existi por m s de 30 a os y se hizo con respeto y emoci n por la memoria de los que hoy no est n

8883937 this is not the time to play politics on the issue i know this is the year of elections therefore people are out to make comments for political reasons
8883938 our rapid pace of growth is putting immense work pressure on current institutional structures current ways of functioning and current ways of managing information and current regulatory practices this coupled with heightened expectations of the stakeholders on account of the success of mca21 has created an urgent need to evolve further to meet the pressure and expectations
8883939 it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8883940 there have been a lot of complaints about rec procedures from researchers in recent years they often find the process onerous and bureaucratic however this study is the first time anyone has systematically analysed what recs are saying about cancer trial proposals
8883941 recs are looking for evidence that researchers are sensitive to ethical issues in particular to participants interests and that information given to potential participants explains the trial fully and truthfully researchers can improve their chances of success at ethical review by really good preparation
8883942 because the database offers highly pedigreed information users can count on what they find there its peer reviewed and they can have a high degree of certainty of it being reliable
8883943 bio response data for that material would be sent to our mpmd product developer at materials park
8883944 the information provided would be edited and peer reviewed prior to its release by our editors and the contributors name would be added to an authors table in the database
8883945 this kind of visibility is a tremendous asset in becoming better known in the medical devices community
8883946 being published in the database will be a worthy addition for established professionals and will also be valuable for younger professionals who are looking to build their list of authored papers
8883947 we are reaching out to people who have spent a lifetime studying or working exclusively in a particular area
8883948 these individuals have a wealth of knowledge that the database and the entire medical devices community can benefit from
8883949 when detailed data is entered into the database it can significantly improve the usability of the database for the end user and potentially significantly reduce the time they will need to dedicate to performing their own research

8883951 arsenic poisoning is behind many instances of ill health in southern asia including a rising number of cancer cases developing a low cost method of decontaminating ground water that is laced with high levels of arsenic is a key challenge for sustainable agriculture there
8883952 while there are some techniques available for treating relatively small quantities of water there has until now been no viable technology available for decontaminating groundwater on a large scale that can ensure safe irrigation and potable water supply
8883953 this project developed by queens is the only method which is eco friendly easy to use and deliverable to the rural community user at an affordable cost
8883954 from its inception we have had the vital support of indian based stakeholders such as village councils and local financial institutions this has been vital as they are the authorities who monitor the water supply and distribution in rural areas and provide micro credit to the local farmers
8883955 with their help we now have a solution which is transferable to many areas in need across asia
8883956 we would never claim that what we study in mice directly relates to how antidepressants work in humans but there are interesting features in parallel
8883957 the study unifies different observations that point to the brains dentate gyrus region and to creation of nerve cells as being important in depression
8883958 at least in mice this result directly links antidepressants and voluntary exercise with trkb mediated creation of nerve cells
8883959 we can get biochemical physiological behavioral and anatomical results in animal models
8883960 these all resonate with the human condition so perhaps you have a physiological relevancy
8883961 there could be a way to stimulate growth of nerve cells to fight depression for example
8883962 people dont realize how many types of algae there are from single cells to large kelp and each one develops differently

8883966 what we need is a manhattan project for fuel if we can get a manhattan project for fuel it wont take 25 years
8883967 we have observed previously that the idea of smoking a cigarette becomes increasingly attractive to smokers while they are craving
8883968 this study suggests that when smokers are not craving they fail to appreciate just how powerful their cravings will be this lack of insight while not craving may lead them to make decisions such as choosing to attend a party where there will be lots of smoking that they may come to regret
8883969 these findings suggest that smokers are likely to underpredict their own future desire to smoke when theyre not craving a cigarette
8883970 the research not only has implications for helping smokers quit but it also enlightens us on how nonsmokers may pick up the habit if smokers cant appreciate the intensity of their need to smoke when they arent currently craving whats the likelihood that people who have never smoked can do so

8883976 a common treatment performed in the past and present is surgical excision of fat to treat a herniation of fat meaning that the amount of fat in the eye socket does not change but the cover that holds the fat in place the orbital septum is weakened or broken and fat slips out
8883977 this orbital septum weakening or herniation of fat theory is what most plastic surgeons have been taught
8883978 however our study showed there is actually an increase in fat with age and it is more likely that the fat increase causes the baggy eyelids rather than a weakened ligament
8883979 there have been no studies to show that the orbital septum weakens
8883980 our findings may change the way some plastic surgeons treat baggy eyes
8883981 our study showed that a component of a patients blepharoplasty procedure should almost routinely involve fat excision rather than these procedures
8883982 although baggy lower eyelids are a significant result of aging and fat expansion there are other factors that can contribute too
8883983 we recommend that surgeons evaluate each component and address them accordingly in an individualized approach to blepharoplasty
8883984 species invasions and extinction the future of native biodiversity on islands
8883985 the presumption at the time was that we are driving biodiversity to lower levels
8883986 certainly if you think about it at the global level this is true because humans have done a lot of things that have driven species extinct
8883987 what dov and i worked on a few years ago is the fact that the vast majority of introductions of species dont have large negative effects
8883988 indeed most species that get introduced dont have much effect at all it doesnt mean that theyre not altering the ecosystem but theyre not driving things extinct like some of the big poster child stories weve been hearing about
8883989 the dramatic increase in the number of species has changed how the system functions
8883990 changing the abundance of natives versus exotics affects all of the other species that used to depend on the natives for food or shelter so its not in any way to say that increasing biodiversity is a good thing
8883991 that by going in and mucking up the system we may have already created the setting where too many species have been packed in and we just havent waited long enough to see these extinctions start to happen
8883992 the whole point of this study was to start looking down the path to see which of these wildly different scenarios might be right
8883993 we havent nailed the answer yet but weve set the stage for answering whether islands are now saturated or not
8883994 it was very surprising to find such a strong correlation between the number of native and exotic plant species on islands around the world
8883995 in ecological research a strong correlation often explains 50 percent of the variation here the correlation between native and exotics explains almost 100 percent of the variation in other words if you know how many native plants are on an oceanic island then you can predict almost perfectly how many exotic plants are there
8883996 which means islands that are far enough away from a continent that theyre not getting regular exchanges with the mainland
8883997 we never considered that interferon alpha could be a major player in early type 1 diabetes

8884166 we will be focused and ready to play the buccaneers
8884167 were planning on that game being at the superdome but the powers that be will have a clear plan in place if that should change any or if our preparation should have to be somewhere else it wont be a distraction we wont allow it to be

8884242 monday it turned wet and windy and we didnt have a lot of activity but the forecast for the coming days looks pretty promising weather in the mid 80s and mostly sunny
8884243 oh yes and then some ill definitely do it again it opens up a whole new world
8884244 i thought id be clogging up that i wouldnt get used to breathing so quickly its just like natural
8884245 you watch the video until the point where it starts telling you about the aquatic marine life youre going to see
8884246 actually there were a couple of dead bees first thing this morning
8884247 they couldnt wait to tell their friends what theyd done and they cant wait to continue with lessons it was great they were a little nervous at first but once they felt comfortable they really really enjoyed it
8884248 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8884249 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8884250 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8884251 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8884252 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8884253 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8884254 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8884255 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8884256 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8884257 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8884258 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8884259 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8884260 i am afraid i will have to agree with my people on the other side of the divide when it comes to believing that the army police and even the top echelons of the administration are unsympathetic even insensitive towards them
8884261 i say this on the basis of my own experience of the valley when i went there a couple of years ago after a gap of almost 25 years
8884262 on one of the evenings that i spent at the fortified gupkar road i had my fill of scotch with some senior administrators none of them was muslim in their utterances it was clear that they too had a clear anti muslim bias that bordered on hatred i savoured the delicious wazwan prepared for the senior members of the bureaucracy by their muslim cooks unless they were deaf the cooks must have heard all that was said in the room
8884263 i dont think its involves any deep seated policy differences
8884264 im told of around 150 changes many involve references to northern ireland being changed to the north
8884265 basically once a document is passed by the executive then thats it it should be put out in that form
8884266 ultimately it could go to the courts but i think its more a case of symbolising the bad relations there are at the moment
8884267 engaging in petty politics and get down to the business of sorting out real issues
8884268 the number of knife related offences across the london rail and underground network has fallen from a peak of 70 a month in mid 2006 to about 20 a month with more arches being deployed than ever before were hopeful we can reduce this even further
8884269 gustav is expected to be a large powerful hurricane as it approaches the northern gulf coast
8884270 the afp has concluded its active inquiries although some long standing overseas inquiries are yet to be fully resolved the afp said in a statement
8884271 at the present time there is insufficient evidence to institute proceedings against dr haneef for any criminal offence
8884272 delighted at the news but wanted an apology from the government and as yet unspecified damages
8884273 we are ready to negotiate the terms of any apology and a damages settlement with the government so as to avoid the unnecessary expense and further angst of civil litigation mr hodgson said
8884274 a matter for further down the track after a federal government inquiry into the case
8884275 he still loves australia but no decision has been made about whether hell come back to australia and if so when
8884276 it is hard to know with the afp they dont deal with things with a straight bat he told the abc
8884277 so only time will tell but it would be comforting for him to know that the afp no longer regard him as a suspect in any wrongdoing in australia or elsewhere
8884278 the continued claims by mr keelty that dr haneef was a person of interest which is the police euphemism for a suspect has continued and exacerbated the damage to dr haneefs reputation that the unreasonable and unjustified actions of july 2 2007 had already caused he said
8884279 the long delayed admission by the afp that theres no basis for suggesting that dr haneef had committed any criminal offence must surely call into question mr keeltys tenure in his present position mr hodgson said
8884280 it also heightens the need for the clarke inquiry to be given royal commission powers and widened terms of reference so that the afps continued efforts over the last 13 months to destroy dr haneefs good name and reputation can also be investigated
8884281 whatever can be done to have him come back to this country should be done greens leader bob brown said
8884282 but you couldnt blame him if he didnt want to risk it a second time
8884283 the last government owes both him and his country an apology it should come from john howard senator brown said
8884284 whatever was going to blow away has already blown away
8884285 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon
8884286 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 percent
8884287 it is simply impossible to determine exactly where and when gustav will make final landfall
8884288 the chances of hurricane force winds within the next five days are essentially the same at each individual location from the florida panhandle coast westward through the entire coastline of louisiana
8884289 i can confirm that mike carltons agreement as a contributor to saturdays sydney morning herald has been terminated after he refused to file as normal his column for saturdays morning paper

8884303 one of the best ways to gather evidence that will potentially have some impact in court is to conduct surveillance of the franchise
8884304 our organization is concerned that dunkin donuts will become as well known for its lawsuits as for its coffee and food products in light of the competition our members face for loyal customers we believe the company should be sensitive of its image related to these matters more time helping franchisees and less time investigating them would be better for all stakeholders
8884305 our record is extraordinarily successful because of the care we take in bringing cases that are investigated properly
8884306 dunkins investigations go beyond that of the franchisees business horn expressed that their lifestyles and attitudes should also be investigated
8884307 targeting franchisees because of their lifestyle is particularly troublesome no franchisee should be under suspicion or treated differently for aspiring to the american dream
8884308 we would like to see more reason and balance brought to this situation
8884309 to our knowledge the dunkin system is the most litigious major qsr system out there
8884310 we believe dunkin brands must find a way to protect brand equity while also teaching franchisees how to best to comply with their business obligations other successful qsr franchisors have figured out how to minimize litigation in their respective systems dunkin brands should aspire to join the ranks of these leading franchisors in terms of franchisee relations and using litigation against its franchisees as tactic of last resort

8884332 measles although its not transmitting in this country its just a plane ride away
8884333 there are 20 million cases in the world and any time people travel who are not protected through vaccination they can bring it back if they go to a country where measles is occurring
8884334 a high proportion of those children are home schooled in illinois pretty much all of the new cases of measles were among home schooled children and none of them were vaccinated
8884335 the measles german measles and mumps vaccine or mmr as we call it has been given in literally billions of doses worldwide with extraordinary safety
8884336 before the measles vaccine in this country there were 400 deaths of u s children each year caused by measles

8884356 the major challenges currently bedevilling the nigerian army are enormous consequent upon these realities there is a manifest decline of discipline regimentation commitment welfare and command and control
8884357 overtime some officers and soldiers have become accustomed to illegal duties care free attitude towards welfare of troops involvement in criminal activities disobedience to standing orders and so forth
8884358 this implies that commanders would be held accountable for any misdemeanour by men under command i will hold commanders and heads of unit individually responsible for the conduct of their men

8884387 the downgrade reflects the increased volatility in the domestic interest rate environment over the past two years and the resulting increase on market risk inherently borne by primary dealers

8884389 we are in the process of talking to the government theyve not indicated one way or the other how theyre dealing with us
8884390 we always worry a little bit but we think our arguments are pretty strong

8884406 right now i am working on those trophies and once i am through i am expecting to deliver them to ziff offices soon
8884407 all i can say is that i feel humbled to be selected for such an honourable job
8884408 we launched the awards trophies with the aim to promote other arts since film incorporates all arts
8884409 basically we are trying to promote each other as artistes
8884410 it is also our mandate to promote zimbabwean culture what this means is that these trophies when they are given to different winners they travel to different countries of the world thereby promoting zimbabwean culture and arts

8884419 maureen you look worried are you worried about entering the house
8884420 i wonder how they did this maybe they used different designers because the house certainly looks as if it was designed by different people
8884421 how would you say the mood in the house is
8884422 would you stay in the big brother house for 91 days
8884423 whether youre a seasoned collector interested in adding to the allure of your homes interior design or simply an art enthusiast interested in viewing the latest trends in the visual arts artexpo nigeria will have something for everyone
8884424 we are expecting new standard we have not stopped producing artists that produce old art in ife so the talent has not stopped flowing in fact we are experiencing an explosion right now
8884425 i am telling you categorically now that every drop of energy will dry up but our art is renewable it like nuclear energy in the sense that we keep producing and getting better and this can be our number one product we would take it to the world and earn a lot of money from it and basically we would have respect and identity and this is so critical
8884426 because basically as nigerians we are world class people and our arts is that specific aspect
8884427 we are quite happy that this is the first art expo and we are convinced that it is going to get better because there are few flaws we have noticed like publicity we feel we should have given it a lot more publicity than we have done but it is a great outing being the first time and i am sure that by next year it is going to be better
8884428 out ultimate goal should be to take our arts to the mainstream and when we do that then it is going to help tourism it is also going to help our artists to become a lot busier with a lot of money coming into their pockets and they would be happier than they are today
8884429 the children brought as much energy on stage as they do with rehearsals and for us this has been a good start
8884430 we hope to maintain the good work so that we win the finals
8884431 we have staged regular performances at the harare agricultural show and this year is no exception because we have been invited again for two shows one on friday and on saturday
8884432 there is so much negative stuff from mbare but we want to change that negativity into something positive
8884433 i understand the prizes are being paid out in batches and that i am one of those in the first batch that received something this week
8884434 we do not know what is the hold up really we are still waiting for communication from the people who are supposed to pay us
8884435 this matter is very big i do not want to comment for now i will say a lot on friday
8884436 it is regrettable that up to now people have not received their dues expectations were that by now the beneficiaries would have long used the money to improve their lives
8884437 no one has communicated anything to us we assume there is no problem because nobody has said anything to us i am going to ask the department of culture this week why up to now the artists have not been paid

8884460 weve re dedicated ourselves to work in this area performance in windows 7 and ie 8
8884461 this is a major initiative across each of our feature teams as well as the primary mission of one of our feature teams
8884462 im somewhat skeptical how much improvement theyre going to make at this point
8884463 anyone checking any code into windows 7 not only has to make sure its the most secure code and the most reliable code but theyd better be addressing the performance of the code as well

8884467 i figured a good first step in my preparation would be finding out what facebook is so ive started this page
8884468 actually it was started by my researcher ian reichbach because my grandmother has more internet savvy than i do and shes been dead for 33 years
8884469 its not entirely clear whether he wants to create a movie about the creators of facebook boring or the actual users of the service more boring but neither sound like a good idea

8884474 corporate cartographers are demolishing thousands of years of history not to mention britains remarkable geography at a stroke by not including them on maps which millions of us now use every day
8884475 were in real danger of losing what makes maps so unique giving us a feel for a place even if weve never been there
8884476 internet maps can now be personalised allowing people to include landmarks and information that is of interest to them anyone can create their own maps or use experiences to collaborate with others in charting their local knowledge
8884477 these traditional landmarks are still on the map but people need to search for them interactive maps will display precisely the information people want when they want it

8884484 software as a service saas typically pronounced sass is a model of software deployment where an application is hosted as a service provided to customers across the internet by eliminating the need to install and run the application on the customers own computer saas alleviates the customers burden of software maintenance ongoing operation and support conversely customers relinquish control over software versions or changing requirements moreover costs to use the service become a continuous expense rather than a single expense at time of purchase using saas also can conceivably reduce the up front expense of software purchases through less costly on demand pricing from the software vendors standpoint saas has the attraction of providing stronger protection of its intellectual property and establishing an ongoing revenue stream the saas software vendor may host the application on its own web server or this function may be handled by a third party application service provider asp this way end users may reduce their investment on server hardware too

8884489 courts have the authority and obligation to scrutinize contracts and arbitration awards for compliance with public policy
8884490 an arbitrators decision must be upheld unless the arbitrator has exceeded his authority or engaged in fraud or dishonesty
8884491 because of his association with the knights party and the ku klux klan
8884492 can be used by courts to decide whether an arbitrators ruling can be overturned
8884493 he intentionally joined an organization with ties to the ku klux klan and took the following personal pledge i pledge my loyalty i will work for the preservation and protection of the white race

8884513 the american side effectively armed and trained the georgian army
8884514 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states
8884515 needs to stop blaming others for the aggression that it carried out against a neighbor
8884516 the democrats have written a piece of history with barack obama a black person with a chance of victory is an official candidate for the white house as obama fills the slowly flagging visions with heavy political content in his speech and sows aggression in his political rivals the democratic convention fulfilled its purpose with a mixture of feeling and decisiveness whether that will suffice to mobilize enough voters for the 47 year old senator remains open until nov 4
8884517 personal aura and his political oratorios have created expectations that are weighing down on him
8884518 for a while barack obama has been nationally and globally the bearer of hope for everything and everyone he is supposed to stir american society to action and at the same time moderate compromises with bullet points and footnotes that run above party lines he is supposed to lead the super power to new heights while reconciling the country with the rest of the world no man of flesh and blood can accomplish such works of divinity back down on earth the republicans have very cleverly realized what little chances remain to them down there since everyone is staring at obama george w bush is creeping to the sidelines
8884519 look here we have done it now black people all over the country can cheer for obama this triumph is highly risky after all he eventually hopes to become president of all americans regardless of their skin color the theme of racism is already unpopular with levels of society that obama has so far hardly reached workers owners of small businesses middle class families above all they are concerned about their jobs in these areas of society a candidate cannot give the impression that he also seeks election as compensation for previous racist injustices

8884550 everything was paid even before the investigation by the senate started but the bank was bought over by spring bank spring bank entered to an agreement with the management of ptdf and agreed to be paying up 2 million every quarter so far they have paid 14 million and they have never failed every quarter they give us 2 million the bank is transnational bank we entered into an agreement with them which was approved by the former president and they pay with interest
8884551 two payments were made that became controversial one of them was a n100 million lodged with etb and the other one was the 20million so that one for etb which you mentioned about gsm no kobo was lost every kobo was paid to the fund
8884552 regarding the specific projects like you know i was not around when this thing happened i came here in the course of the investigation by the senate
8884553 for example most of the projects we adopt in good faith actually
8884554 the problem is the controversy that arose from the n250 million allegedly paid as consultancy fee otherwise most of the projects are worth the while it was not as if somebody used the money or took the money into his pocket
8884555 the ptdf overseas scholarship scheme covers payments for tuition fees accommodation and living expenses of successful scholars in top ten universities in europe and other parts of the world

8884559 the insinuations and innuendos that are wrapped around the governors tours alleging that the governor is looking for second tenure in office is just the imagination of some unserious minds
8884560 on the issue of second tenure i believe strongly in the philosophy of performance if you perform then you can have something to turn back to and say at least this is what i have done
8884561 when the time comes we will consider all those things that have been done for us to make up our decision either in favour or against the second tenure issue the issue of where one comes from should be de emphasized because what we want is good governance
8884562 however it is important for governor suswam to go round and say thank you to the people who have voted the 43 year old young man into office and this is not a joke
8884563 we took advantage of his thank you tour to also see what was on ground in the local government areas of the state especially the bogus claims that could be made by council chairmen to have done this this and that
8884564 as we went round it afforded us the opportunity to hear what the people say and we are also able to see the problems confronting them and that gave us the opportunity to evolve ways of providing solutions to them
8884565 we are a listening and sensitive government and willing at all times to take corrections but please and please help us so that we dont attract negative image for the state it is very easy to make a sweeping allegation that sam ode and the governor are siphoning local government funds but it is difficult to substantiate it and it is also difficult for us to overcome the negative publicity that would arise from such allegations though we are only pleading for understanding
8884566 it would amount to diversion of efforts in fulfilling the governors campaign promises
8884567 i also want to use this opportunity to call on our benue people to give maximum support and co operation to this administration to satisfy their yearnings and aspirations
8884568 i remember the governor himself has said time without numbers that he will focus his attention on delivering his campaign promises to benue people within the first three years of his administration and he is just a little above one year in office now they should allow this man to concentrate on what he has planned to put smiles on our faces
8884569 simon has nothing to be aggrieved about as he played a lot of games last year
8884570 his performances had dipped and i just told him the facts
8884571 he was probably man of the match in a lot of games last season but those games were always the big ones
8884572 hed be outstanding at parkhead ibrox and tynecastle but we were losing other matches and i told him he had to perform the same way in them
8884573 i left him out whether he liked it or not
8884574 he took everything on board though and cant be doing too badly because he got himself into the jamaican national squad in the summer
8884575 simons own words to me not long after i signed him were that he needed someone to be at him all the time to get the best out of him
8884576 it was an operation to wire his jaw and he remains in intensive care
8884577 the operation was a success and he is in good spirits but he is desperate to get out of hospital
8884578 were deeply shocked and saddened for the corby family tim was such a character and a real friend to us hell be sadly missed
8884579 i finished sixth which was one of my best results of the season
8884580 the important thing for the team at the moment is that weve identified where improvements can be made with the fw30 and are making the necessary adjustments to take us into the final few races
8884581 the work everyone at the factory is putting in should help us out in spa were not going to make a huge jump but well definitely be heading in the right direction
8884582 im really looking forward to the belgian grand prix because spa is an amazing race track it will be difficult to score points there but you can never predict what will happen somewhere like spa so well have to wait and see
8884583 its going to be the first time ive driven a formula 1 car around spa so my first priority will be to learn the circuit and to find out how the car behaves on this track
8884584 i have of course driven spa while racing in gp2 so know what a great racing track it is
8884585 its the horses people say im riding better than ever done but really i dont feel it its just the horses
8884586 its so exciting going to ride those horses id walk to ballydoyle if i had to
8884587 aidan knows all the teams and everyone in the team we all know about the effort he puts in so we dont mind working as hard as he does
8884588 but its not just that its the atmosphere horses pick up on atmosphere
8884589 aidan is the one who creates the atmosphere in the yard
8884590 ive worked with some great trainers and i know he obrien makes them some people are just better than other sat what they do

8884592 i didnt go to united because it was brilliant pay i went there for that great chance instead of being at home for ten weeks
8884593 i had an offer to stay on at united in 2007 but there is no talk about that now
8884594 it isnt 100 percent that henke will stay with us
8884595 we havent talked to henke about this he hasnt told us that he is looking at offers so that i do not know about that possibility
8884596 we fully appreciate henke in one respect this is football related but it is also for how much he means for the club but i neither want to nor can speculate now
8884597 pablo zabaleta and albert riera have not taken part of this mornings training session with espanyol in order to avoid any risk before completing their transfers to manchester city and liverpool respectively
8884598 whereas the four year deal between zabaleta and city is complete with the sky blues having assured espanyol they are to pay the players contract cancellation sum 8 million rieras transfer is to be resolved in the next few hours
8884599 we need someone from the highest level to clarify for all of us administrators players and referees
8884600 is striking with the open hand to the face of a player not a category 2 offence which will result in a penalty of four weeks we need that clarified at the highest level to clear up the confusion
8884601 the official guide of the gaa says that a category 2 offence which is punishable by a four week suspension includes striking or attempting to strike with the hand
8884602 now it was clear for all to see that aidan omahony was struck with the hand on sunday and the degree of force has nothing at all to do with it

8884628 it was my first world tour and hrithik and i became really became good friends during that time it was a packed house in frisco and the show went well after the show got over we were to leave in limousines backstage but when we went out to the parking lot on either side there was a huge crowd cheering and clapping and waiting to catch a glimpse of us when i saw hrithik walking towards his car i called him there and we broke out in a spontaneous jig to please the crowd after which we got into the car and left after some time we noticed three cars chasing us through the streets it was getting dangerous so we stopped when we saw a cop and asked him to help
8884629 he asked us who are you monkeys so we said we are rock stars from india and he said yeah right the moment he said those words he looked up and saw 50 screaming fans bearing down on us the cop got so pysched that he called his walkie talkie and started shouting back up back up he had the funniest expression

8884639 es ist f r mich als bildungsminister schon ein mehr als zweifelhaftes vorgehen des spd politikers pfaffmann aus parteitaktischen gr nden die leistungen unserer sch lerinnen und sch ler schlecht zu reden
8884640 ich freue mich dass der bildungsmonitor 2008 unsere anstrengungen f r eine familiengerechte politik w rdigt wir werden diesen weg in berlin fortsetzen und die angebote gleichzeitig weiter verbessern
8884641 die kritik m ssen wir ernst nehmen allerdings muss man diesen punkt differenziert betrachten so steht die betriebliche ausbildung im fokus der untersuchung und nicht der schulische teil zugleich schl gt hier die strukturelle schw che des wirtschaftsstandortes berlin durch richtig ist dass wir einen schwerpunkt auf die berufliche bildung legen zum beispiel sollen leistungsschwache auszubildende k nftig besser gef rdert werden daf r habe ich veranlasst dass mit beginn des neuen schuljahres die teilnehmer an der einstiegsqualifizierung berufsschulpflichtig werden

8884647 damals waren wir gerade ein jahr im amt wichtige reformen im bildungsbereich wie das neue schulgesetz der ausbau der ganztagsschule der hochschulpakt oder das kinderbildungsgesetz waren noch nicht umgesetzt oder gerade erst eingef hrt diese faktoren beginnen jetzt zu wirken der bildungsmonitor 2008 ist also die abschlussbilanz von rot gr n nicht die bilanz der politik der schwarz gelben landesregierung

8884670 he has been elected as the leader of the liberal party to take the liberal party to the next election and to win the next election and he will have my total and utter support in doing that
8884671 as far as im concerned the liberal party leadership is a team of dr nelson and julie bishop and im supporting them
8884672 i intend to keep on serving the people of higgins he said
8884673 peters made his decision that he did not seek the leadership of the party he told reporters
8884674 as ive said before id be very happy if he changes his mind thats his business
8884675 what dr nelson was referring to is that he would be very happy for mr costello to stay on in parliament the spokesman said
8884676 costello is undeniably the liberal partys best political asset now that howard has gone which is why so much turns on whether he recovers the will to serve which so clearly and understandably wavered in the aftermath of the election mr abbott wrote in
8884677 nobody ever objects when people say nice things about them he said
8884678 its very nice of tony to say nice things about me and i appreciate it very much hes an old friend of mine and i thank him

8884681 every year madagascar imports about 200 000 tonnes of rice for consumption this year the gap is estimated at 270 000 tonnes and that will present a challenge
8884682 importing rice at international prices means paying 70 per cent more than current local prices and that isnt expected to change
8884683 malnourishment in madagascar is aggravated by peoples dependence on just one food rice which provides calories but not many nutrients or protein

8884716 since we started hosting projects weve been petitioned by the eclipse foundation of which google is a member and its community of developers to include the epl as an option for new projects
8884717 weve resisted until now as we felt that the features of the epl were not unique enough to justify its inclusion this hasnt changed but how we think about licenses is getting a bit more nuanced
8884718 eclipse is an important lively and healthy project with an enormous plug in and developer community that uses an otherwise duplicative license they arent interested in using the bsd or other open source licenses that are readily combinable with epl code we have decided that after nearly two years of operation that it was time to add the epl and serve these open source developers

8884725 the afp has concluded its active inquiries although some long standing overseas inquiries are yet to be fully resolved the afp said in a statement
8884726 at the present time there is insufficient evidence to institute proceedings against dr haneef for any criminal offence
8884727 delighted at the news but wanted an apology from the government and as yet unspecified damages
8884728 we are ready to negotiate the terms of any apology and a damages settlement with the government so as to avoid the unnecessary expense and further angst of civil litigation mr hodgson said
8884729 a matter for further down the track after a federal government inquiry into the case
8884730 he still loves australia but no decision has been made about whether hell come back to australia and if so when
8884731 it is hard to know with the afp they dont deal with things with a straight bat he told the abc
8884732 so only time will tell but it would be comforting for him to know that the afp no longer regard him as a suspect in any wrongdoing in australia or elsewhere
8884733 the continued claims by mr keelty that dr haneef was a person of interest which is the police euphemism for a suspect has continued and exacerbated the damage to dr haneefs reputation that the unreasonable and unjustified actions of july 2 2007 had already caused he said
8884734 the long delayed admission by the afp that theres no basis for suggesting that dr haneef had committed any criminal offence must surely call into question mr keeltys tenure in his present position mr hodgson said
8884735 it also heightens the need for the clarke inquiry to be given royal commission powers and widened terms of reference so that the afps continued efforts over the last 13 months to destroy dr haneefs good name and reputation can also be investigated
8884736 whatever can be done to have him come back to this country should be done greens leader bob brown said

8884758 websites for disabled people are often too local or lack decent social networking facilities

8884760 groups in germany can share ideas with people in greece a successful initiative in norway can be spread out and adapted by people in italy or spain
8884761 often disabled people are isolated socially this site will help that situation

8884769 for indias middle class urban women the past decade has brought unprecedented opportunities to advance in a social order long dominated by men but a powerful male backlash has accompanied the womens revolution an up welling of resentment that has expressed itself in sexual violence and harassment in india today women are working in lucrative retail and technology jobs sometimes in cities far from their hometowns economic independence has in some cases allowed them to delay marriage and early childbirth social mobility among indias young is also undermining the countrys traditional joint family system in which couples are expected to move in with the husbands parents the shift has empowered the modern indian wife freeing her from the scourge of the bossy nosy mother in law at the same time however the number of reported instances of domestic violence rape and dowry killings is spiking in south asian cities according to womens groups demographers and sociologists violence against women is the fastest growing crime in india a recent study concluded every 26 minutes a woman is molested every 34 minutes a rape takes place and every 43 minutes a woman is kidnapped according to the home ministrys national crime records bureau with about 19 000 reported rapes a year india ranks fifth highest in that category out of 84 countries studied according to a 2006 report by the un office on drugs and crime but womens groups say fewer than two per cent of women who have been sexually assaulted in india report the crime to police largely because the social stigma attached to rape may undermine a womans chance for marriage the united states where the reporting of sexual attacks is more common ranks highest in the world with 95 000 reported rapes each year experts predict that the number of sexual attacks in 2008 may exceed the total in 2007 when 544 rapes were reported in the city part of the problem is also that mens expectations of women have not kept pace with the changes women are experiencing at home and at work the change in power has been too fast for some indian men whose intense curiosity about women can often be traced back to a segregated youth
8884770 kemudian mari kita tanyakan kepada mereka apakah para sahabat nabi saw ulama zaman dahulu dan sekarang pernahkah mereka berlakon dalam sandiwara dan drama tentunya tidak dan siapakah yang lebih berilmu dan lebih bertakwa kepada allah para penuding ataukah imam ibnu utsaimin
8884771 pernyataan mereka bahwasanya metode wahdah islamiyah sama dengan cara muhammad as surur ini merupakan tuduhan tanpa bukti yang jelas kenapa perlu diketahu bahwa kami tidak mengenal siapa itu muhammad as surur
8884772 kami tahu persis siapa muhammad as surur namun tidak ada kesamaan antara kami dengan mereka
8884773 justru karena kamu tidak tahu muhammad assurur maka telah terjadi kesamaan antara kamu dengannya tapi kamu tidak menyadari akibat ketidak tahuan kamu sementara kami tahu muhammad as surur dan melihat ada kesamaan dakwah kamu dengannya bukankah kaidah mengatakan orang yang tahu menjadi alasan untuk menolak perkataan orang yang tidak tahu
8884774 tidaklah kamu berbicara kepada suatu kaum tentang sesuatu yang tidak dicapai akal mereka melainkan akan timbul pada mereka fitnah
8884775 pada hadits muadz nabi shallallaahu alaihi wasallam mengajarkannya suatu ilmu tanpa sahabat lain hal ini menunjukkan boleh mengajarkan ilmu kepada sebagian orang saja atau berkelompokkelompok dan tidak mesti harus terbuka di depan umum demikian pula yang di indikasikan atsar ali dan ibnu masud radhiallaahu anhuma serta apa yang dipahami dari judul bab imam bukhari
8884776 ketahuilah sesungguhnya tidak seorang pun yang melakukan suatu bidah melainkan ia mendatangkan untuknya suatu dalil dan pegangan
8884777 apabila suatu amalan masuk cakupan umum suatu dalil namun tidak dipraktekkan para sahabat maka ketahuilah amalan itu bukan termasuk bagian daripada dalil tersebut
8884778 sesungguhnya kamu akan mendatangi suatu kaum dari ahli kitab maka hendaklah yang pertama kamu seru kepada mereka adalah syahadat bahwa tidak ada ilah yang berhak disembah kecuali allah
8884779 sungguh ini termasuk beriman kepada sebagian al kitab dan ingkar terhadap sebagian yang lain apa alasan kamu menggunakan metodenya namun tidak tunduk kepada konsekuensinya
8884780 hal ini sama keadaannya dengan seorang syaikh shufi yang banyak membuat orang meninggalkan kemaksiatan dan melakukan ibadah apakah dengan hasil ini lalu kita katakan bahwa ajaran shufi adalah haq dan bermanfaat
8884781 faktanya banyak orang yang tadinya jauh dari islam kini berubah menjadi taat karena metode tarbiyah
8884782 saudaraku apakah kamu sudah lupa atau pura pura lupa kaum khawarij yang divonis neraka 6 oleh nabi shallallaahu alaihi wasallam adalah orang orang yang taat dan bahkan sangat taat
8884783 sungguh kami telah memudahkan al quran untuk peringatan maka adakah yang mau mengambil peringatan
8884784 jika engkau melihat suatu kaum berbicara dengan suara pelan tentang urusan agama mereka tanpa menghadirkan orang banyak maka ketahuilah bahwa mereka sedang membangun kesesatan
8884785 janganlah kalian duduk dengan orang orang yang berpegang pada rasio akal mereka
8884786 orang yang mengerjakan harus mendatangkan dalil dan bukan orang yang melarang
8884787 pertanyaannya dari mana segi pembenaran atau bagaimana sampai tarbiyah ini dibenarkan bagaimana penjelasannya
8884788 syarat syarat sesuatu bisa dijadikan ashl sesuatu bisa dijadikan faraq mempunyai syarat
8884789 sebutkan antum kan yang mengatakan ini sesuai dan telah terjadi qiyas jadi antumlah yang harus menjelaskan bukan ana
8884790 syaratnya syarat qiyas itu rukun tadi sekarang syaratnya bagaimana antum bisa meng qiyas tidak tahu syarat sebutkan syarat supaya bisa kita bisa lihat oh iya terpenuhi syarat
8884791 jika engkau melihat suatu kaum yang berbicara dengan suara yang pelan akan urusan agama ini tanpa menghadirkan orang umum maka ketahuilah bahwa mereka sedang membangun kesesatan
8884792 tunggu dulu antum sudah melangkah ke illat sementara ashl dan faraq belum antum tetapkan apakah ini jamiah 13 bisa dijadikan ashl dan ini tarbiyah bisa dijadikan fara harus ditentukan dulu baru kita baru masuk illat karena untuk masuk ke illat harus ditentukan dulu ini memenuhi syarat untuk masuk ke ashl dan ini memenuhi syarat untuk masuk ke fara tidak boleh masuk illat sebelum disebutkan dulu
8884793 antum tahu tidak agak kesal kalau tahu bilang tahu dan kalau tidak bilang tidak kalau antum tidak tahu ana beritahu supaya antum tidak mutar mutar
8884794 syarat dari pada ashl itu an yakuuna tsaabitan bin nash
8884795 akhi kita harus luruskan dulu tujuan kita disini jangan sampai kita hanya mencari kemenangan tapi mencari kebenaran
8884796 iya betul itu lillaahi taala ya syekh antum mencari kebenaran dan kita juga mencari kebenaran antum ingin selamat kita juga ingin selamat
8884797 ini pertanyaan lucu jamiah islamiyah diambil dari mana ditetapkan berdasarkan ijtihad kemudian antum tanya lagi tarbiyah diambil dari mana ya belum ada sumber hukumnya antum sudah meng qiyas sementara hukum ashl belum ditetapkan belum bisa kita setujui jadi tarbiyah ini mau dilarikan kemana ini ke qiyas belum ada ashl ke nash tidak ada khan begitu kenapa antum tanya ana lagi diambil dari mana tarbiyah
8884798 antum sekarang punya ashl yaitu jamiah islamiyah tetapi jamiah islamiyah tidak ditetapkan dengan nash tetapi dengan ijtihad
8884799 thayyib kalau begitu tarbiyah juga kita sebutkan masalah ijtihad bagaimana
8884800 thayyib memang ini dia akh ruslan sudah bilang sama ana tetapi sudah disebutkan beliau murid syaikh muqbil
8884801 bagaimana mungkin dia murid syaikh muqbil sementara syaikh muqbil men tahdzir al haramain kenapa dia ada di haramain
8884802 bukan hukum ashl melalui dan sunnah al ashl ini masalah ijtihadi bagaimana ini ibadah mahdhah
8884803 ibadah mahdhah ibadah yang telah ditetapkan secara rinci tentang pelaksanaannya
8884804 thayyib al ashlu fil ibaadat haram mencakup ibadah mahdhah dan ghairu mahdhah
8884805 kesimpulannya supaya tidak panjang menurut antum bahwa diantara yang membenarkan tarbiyah bukan menetapkan tarbiyah karena kalau menetapkan antum tidak punya dalil sama sekali baik qiyas maupun ijtihad sekarang antum sedang berdalil bahwa ada yang membenarkan bahwa yang membenarkan adalah dengan kedatangan para masyayekh ketahuilah bahwa kedatangan para masyayekh bukan merupakan pembenaran dan ini sudah merupakan kaedah bahwa kedatangan seorang ulama kesuatu tempat tidak menunjukkan bahwa tempat itu bagus
8884806 shahih tapi ibadah mahdhah ibadah yang sudah ditetapkan tata caranya secara rinci
8884807 iya tapi perintahnya ini juga tidak ada masalahnya perintah ini untuk tarbiyah tidak ada mana
8884808 itu sudah ditetapkan berdasarkan ijtihad selesai para ulama sudah menetapkan berdasarkan ijtihad ulama mana yang berijtihad tentang tarbiyah
8884809 ikutilah oleh kalian dan jangan mengada ada karena sesungguhnya ajaran syariat yang ada telah mencukupi kalian hendaklah kalian berpegang pada yang ada sejak dahulu kala
8884810 sabarlah dirimu di atas sunnah berhentilah dimana kaum para sahabat berhenti berkatalah dengan apa yang mereka katakan dan tahanlah diri dari perkara yang mereka menahan diri darinya serta tempulah jalan pendahulumu yang shaleh karena sesungguhnya cukup bagimu apa yang cukup bagi mereka
8884811 wajib atasmu untuk menempuh atsar generasi salaf walaupun manusia menolakmu dan hati hatilah kamu terhadap pemikiran manusia walaupun mereka menghiasinya untukmu dengan perkataan yang indah
8884812 bidah itu lebih dicintai oleh iblis daripada maksiat adapun maksiat bisa bertobat darinya sementara bidah tidak bisa bertobat darinya
8884813 sesungguhnya ilmu hadits agama ini adalah dien maka dari itu telitilah dari siapa kalian mengambil agama kalian itu
8884814 sesungguhnya allah menutup pintu taubat dari setiap pelaku bidah hingga dia meninggalkan ke bidahannya

8884976 there is nothing absolute about my way mr of looking at phenomena k 1 outside he means us may see this entire room moving upward with an acceleration and attribute all these happenings to this motion rather than to a force of gravity as am doing his explanation and mine i are equally good from our different viewpoints
8884977 let me try to the viewpoint of my good though i neighbor k have never met him
8884978 how does this a in new law help us to derive 11 of gravitation
8884979 fictitious force due to motion is familiar to everyone in the following example any if he swings youngster knows that a pail full of water in a vertical plane fall is with sufficient speed the water will not out of the pail even when the actually upside pail down

8884981 with equal right and equal success and therefore claims he but is is that not moving at all merely in an environment 11 in which a
8884982 that is quite we say neighbor you are probably no worse than we are you dont have to use euclidean geometry it if does not work on a revolving disc for now there are non euclidean geometries which are exactly what you need just as we would not expect plane trigonometry to work on for a large portion of the earths surface which we need which spherical trigonometry in the angle sum of a triangle isnotlso 111 as we might naively demand after a high school course in euclidean plane geometry in short instead of considering the disc world as an accelerated system we by can the principle of equivalence it regard as a system in 11 which acting a
8884983 center of gravity r is then precisely the distance between these two points
8884984 gravitational field which the gravitational force at a see the diagram on page 221 is given by the above equation if we divide we get both sides by m fc m f 1 o ni2 r
8884985 gravitational potential obviously 60 is merely another way of expressing the field equation 59 obtained from newtons law of gravitation
8884986 force of gravity by the idea of the characteristic property of the space in question see ch xii it is therefore reasonable to accept 56 as the gravitational field equations which follow from the idea of the principle of equivalence how will reasonable it is be evident when we test it by experiment it has been said on page 21 5 that each g consists of four bso hence if the bs are all zero all then the gs will be zero but the converse is obviously not true all namely even it if the gs are zero does not necessarily follow that the bs are zero 925 but we know that to have the fis all zero implies that the space is euclidean see p 213 thus if the condition for euclidean space is fulfilled namely off tp ba v automatically follows then thus g would be for 6 or different lt gt or r positive or negative 2 and consequently the expression for c s if would be in different we turn opposite directions 234 which would contradict the experimental evidence that the universe is isotropic and from of course the use of 2 the same expression for c s any point homogeneity it is reflects the idea of and so we see that reasonable 2 to have in 61 b only terms involving c 0 c 2 3x2 but since x is a function of x and is therefore held constant only while the partial derivative with respect to x gt is the semi major axis of the ellipse the angle swept out by the planet t in time we notice at once the remarkable resemblance between 84 and 85 they are indeed for identical except the presence of the term and of course the use of are the slopes of the two lines we get tana from which it is 4 m 4m 2 fl2 easy to find sin a r 4m 4m2 r and a being its value in small radian measure is equal to so that sin a we now have o a 86 a r 4m 4mvr a now what in in is the actual value of the case under discussion which r and the radius of the sun m is its mass for the proof of this see any book on calculus or look up a table of trigonometric functions 285 since and m r 697 000 kilometers f 1 47 kilometers neglected by 4m 2 may be comparison with so that 86 reduces to the very simple equation 4m from which we easily get 1 a in it 75 seconds other words was predicted by the einstein theory that a ray of light passing near the sun would be bent into a curve acf as shown and that in the figure on p 280 consequently a star at a would appeartobeatb the reader will stop a a displacement of an angle of 1 75 seconds if moment to consider how small is an angle of even one degree and then consider that one sixtieth of that is an angle of one minute is and again one sixtieth of that tsee page 315 286 an angle of one second small is he a will realize how 1 displacement of 75 seconds furthermore according to the newtonian theory the displacement would be only half of that and it is this tiny difference that must distinguish between the two after all theories the trouble that the reader has been put to to find out the issue perhaps he is disappointed to learn how small is the difference between the predictions of newton and einstein and perhaps he thinks that a decision based on so small a difference can scarcely be relied upon but we wish to point out to him that far from losing his respect and faith in scientific method he should on be the contrary the all more filled with admiration and wonder to think that experimental work is that in astronomy so accurate 278 see the footnote on p 287 these small quantities are measured wifh perfect confidence and that they do distinguish between the two theories and decide in favor of the do as einstein theory is shown by the british following figures the gave expeditions in 1919 to sobral and principe for this displacement 1 98

8884989 the museums that like bees ranging over a broad field pollinate the world with the art history and culture of its constituent regions the elgin marbles were carved in athens and the rosetta stone was found in egypt but they are now displayed at the british museum in london the pergamon altar was built by the greeks removed from what is now turkey and is on view in berlin
8884990 cano has done a fine job as in many briefs cuno makes his key points more than once and perhaps too often but they are points worth making that all consequential culture becomes international and all culture should therefore be shared with the world not hoarded for reasons of skewed nationalism or out of desire for tourism revenues in the places where artifacts were made or just happened to have been dug up
8884991 the most telling part of cunos thesis is his warning that the impulse to hoard antiquity is related to the perils of excessive nationalism
8884992 although cuno is too gracious to drill his argument through the next level that the final stop on the line to nationalism is facism and that the result of ethnic and religious purity is all too often persecution and worse the implications cannot be ignored
8884993 cuno calls for an expansive view by which nations understand that all countries are built and maintained with foreign influences and that the worlds store of antiquities needs to be shared so that that process can continue it is that enduring humanist message more than the law and the politics recounted by cuno that makes his book compelling
8884994 so we have egypt a country both arab and muslim claiming national ownership of all antiquities from the age of the pharaohs and china claiming rights to works by ancient populations that werent even chinese such as the uighurs of the province of xinjiang who were a mix of mongol and indo european peoples
8884995 i used to be able to take a ten minute walk to the metropolitan museum to see the euphronios krater one of the finest surviving bowls of classical greece but i cant do that anymore because it was packed off not to greece but to italy

8885005 china greece italy syria jordan mexico sudan every country will say what are the unique pieces that have left the country and should come back and every country will list two three four pieces and we will have an international list and make a campaign to push that list
8885006 if any museum has stolen artifacts and is not willing to return them to us
8885007 i will stop them from working in egypt they dont deserve to be in egypt
8885008 people destroy and steal because they know there is a market
8885009 if museums will announce they are not buying stolen artifacts no one will go and destroy a tomb or open a magazine depot by force
8885010 pursued extensive research and made appropriate inquiries regarding provenance in advance of its 1998 acquisition of the mummy mask we are not aware of any specific or credible information suggesting that the museums ownership of the work is illegal should additional information be forthcoming the museum would evaluate it thoroughly and proceed accordingly the museum has great respect for dr hawass and the supreme council of antiquities and takes seriously any suggestion that it illegally or improperly possesses any object in its collection we will review any and all documentation provided by the ministry of culture in connection with this allegation we look forward to working with dr hawass toward a fair and amicable resolution of this matter
8885011 how can this museum bring children to visit and tell them that this mask is taken out illegally from an excavation
8885012 he has to be tough to do his job well
8885013 he will have to retire soon and he is driven to get a lot done before that happens
8885014 if 10 000 people a day went through the tomb of king tut you can imagine what would happen to the tomb
8885015 the bust has been above ground and visible in berlin for much longer than it ever was in egypt
8885016 she has become the epitome of slimly modern beauty the ideal of self confident modern womanhood
8885017 they suddenly realized that this bust which had been dismissed as un egyptian in 1913 was in fact one of the most exquisite examples of egyptian art
8885018 i have viewed it and marvelled at it many times nefertiti continually delights me the bust is a unique masterpiece an ornament a true treasure
8885019 do you know what im going to do one day im going to build a new egyptian museum in berlin
8885020 i dream of it inside i will build a chamber crowned by a large dome in the middle this wonder nefertiti will be enthroned i will never relinquish the head of the queen
8885021 to make it worse the hungarian bronze is clad only in a close fitting transparent dress depicting nefertiti as essentially a nude
8885022 to show the continued relevance of the ancient world to todays art who is he fooling if that was the case the bronze body together with the nefertiti bust must had been intended to be exhibited together at the venice niennale or at least the video of the two together so that the public could see your so called relevance
8885023 some even suggest that the nefertiti head be returned to egypt etc
8885024 ddr 21263 on page 66 of the late cyril aldreds book titled
8885025 thank you for giving me my freedom come visit me soon youll be very well received
8885026 the hell with the will of the egyptian people and perhaps he will also tell nefertiti
8885027 i will never relinquish the nefertiti bust the only thing one can think of is that the germans want to keep the nefertiti bust because its exhibition in the museum brings in a fortune not only to the museum but also to all of germany
8885028 egyptian colleagues know very well that nefertiti will never leave germany
8885029 its the money your excellency the loss would be too great we may have to close the museum if we loose her would you believe that at one time wildung said that if you ask wildung how then did borchardt manage to take her to germany and did not think she was too fragile to travel his answer would be that borchardt didnt have time to think about that time was pressing and he had to smuggle her out of egypt fast
8885030 ill let go of her i dont want to remind the german people of you
8885031 it is an enormous risk to let the nefertiti bust travel
8885032 we could never be certain that she would arrive in good health
8885033 some of the most learned most intelligent and most experienced egyptologists

8885035 they love me out in dc just like go go said go go yeah i said go go see im back with don cannon its a go go
8885036 all our questions are from our standpoint and sri bhagavans replies are from his standpoint the questions are not only answered but are also undermined
8885037 how do you say that the heart is on the right whereas the biologists have found it to be on the left
8885038 a salt doll diving into the sea will not be protected by a waterproof coat
8885039 let omnipotence iswaratva be accomplished first and then the other question may be raised
8885040 can anyone get any benefit by repeating sacred syllables mantras picked up casually
8885041 no he must be competent and initiated in such mantras
8885042 the order was the same and the executor also but the authority was different when i ordered the effect was nil whereas when you ordered there was immediate effect similarly with mantras
8885043 it is said that realisation is beyond expression and expression always fails to describe the realisation how is it
8885044 the supreme spirit is subtler than the subtlest and larger than the largest
8885045 just think of an old man of 70 not choosing to live peacefully in his own house on the income he had earned how intense has been his earnestness that he has left his native land dared a sea voyage of 6 000 miles and faced the hardships of long railway journeys in a foreign land ignorant of the language undergoing the vicissitudes of a lonely life submitting to the inclemency of a hot climate in surroundings uncongenial and unaccustomed to him he could have been happy in his own house it is his longing for internal peace that has brought him here
8885046 why do you mourn the loss of our parents i shall tell you where they are they are only within ourselves and are ourselves for the life current has passed through innumerable incarnations births and deaths pleasures and pains etc just as the water current in a river flows over rocks pits sands elevations and depressions on its way but still the current is unaffected again the pleasures and pains births and deaths are like undulations on the surface of seeming water in the mirage of the ego the only reality is the self from where the ego appears and runs through thoughts which manifest themselves as the universe and in which the mothers and 9 talks with sri ramana maharshi fathers friends and relatives appear and disappear they are nothing but manifestations of the self so that ones parents are not outside the self so there is no reason to mourn learn it realise it and be happy
8885047 he who is free from the notion of ego whose intellect is unattached though he annihilates all the worlds he slayeth not nor is he bound by the results of his actions
8885048 why is it said that the knowledge born of hearing is not firm whereas that born of contemplation is firm
8885049 maharshi does not see anyone as outside his self so there are no disciples for him his grace is all pervading and he communicates his grace to any deserving individual in silence
8885050 i feel the vibrations from him more intensely and i am able to reach the i centre more readily than before
8885051 has the discrimination between reality and unreality sat asat vicharana the efficacy in itself to lead us to the realisation of the one imperishable
8885052 divine grace is essential for realisation it leads one to god realisation but such grace is vouchsafed only to him who is a true devotee or a yogin who has striven hard and ceaselessly on the path towards freedom
8885053 are the gods iswara or vishnu and their sacred regions kailasa or vaikuntha real
8885054 i am not the body nor the agent nor the enjoyer etc
8885055 though i am worse than a dog you have graciously undertaken to protect me this delusion of birth and death is maintained by you moreover am i the person to sift and judge am i the lord here oh maheswara it is for you to roll me through bodies by births and deaths or to keep me fixed at your own feet
8885056 that which is the night of all beings for the disciplined man is the time of waking when other beings are waking then is it night for the sage who seeth
8885057 the supreme spirit brahman is real the world jagat is illusion
8885058 did we know our relatives before their birth that we should know them after their death
8885059 after the sense of doership has gone let us see what happens sri sankara advised inaction but did he not write commentaries and take part in disputation do not trouble about doing action or otherwise know thyself then let us see whose action it is whose is it let action complete itself so long as there is the doer he must reap the fruits of his action if he does not think himself the doer there is no action for him he is an ascetic who has renounced worldly life sanyasin
8885060 is the world within you or without you does it exist apart from you does the world come and tell you i exist
8885061 how do we know that action is ours or not
8885062 when you adhere to one philosophical system siddhanta you are obliged to condemn the others
8885063 kindly instruct me as to how the mind may be controlled
8885064 if the enquiry is made whether mind exists it will be found that mind does not exist that is control of mind otherwise if the mind is taken to exist and one seeks to control it it amounts to mind controlling the mind just like a thief turning out to be a policeman to catch the thief i e himself mind persists in that way alone but eludes itself
8885065 you are bhagavan so you would know when i shall get jnana tell me when i shall be a jnani
8885066 if i am bhagavan there is no one besides the self therefore no jnani or ajnani if otherwise i am as good as you are and know as much as yourself either way i cannot answer your question
8885067 who is it that says that i is not perceptible is there an i ignorant and an i elusive are there two is in the same person ask yourself these questions it is the mind which says that i is not perceptible where is that mind from know the mind you will find it a myth king janaka said i have discovered the thief who had been ruining me so long i will now deal with him summarily then i shall be happy similarly it will be with others
8885068 either give me power either give me power or or or i will
8885069 i will take refuge at the feet of my father father you are parthasarathi i am arjuna we will stamp out materialism
8885070 i will chop off the head of krishna if he should come here now he advised me to give up my job but does not protect my mother or let him chop off my head
8885071 father father i was mistaken pardon me teach me i shall abide by what you say
8885072 my mind remains clear for two or three days and turns dull for the next two or three days and so it alternates what is it due to
8885073 the buddhists say that i is unreal whereas paul brunton in the secret path tells us to get over the ithought and reach the state of i which is true
8885074 with yet further progress invisibility also may result such an one being pure consciousness only flourishes as a siddha
8885075 the glory of the siddhis is past imagination they are equal to siva yea siva himself in being able to grant boons
8885076 the greatness of the siddhas is incomprehensible they are equal to siva and can even grant boons
8885077 in practice the thoughts are found to manifest and subside alternately is this jnana
8885078 so long as you refuse to fight you have the sense of doership
8885079 rather be fixed in the self and act according to nature without the thought of doership then the results of action will not affect you that is manliness and heroism
8885080 if a man be established in the self these doubts would not arise they arise only until he is established there
8885081 it is said that the victim in the tigers mouth is gone for ever
8885082 good the dead are indeed happy they have got rid of the troublesome overgrowth the body the dead man does not grieve 72 talks with sri ramana maharshi the survivors grieve for the man who is dead do men fear sleep on the contrary sleep is courted and on waking up every man says that he slept happily one prepares the bed for sound sleep sleep is temporary death death is longer sleep if the man dies while yet alive he need not grieve over others death ones existence is evident with or without the body as in waking dream and sleep then why should one desire continuance of the bodily shackles let the man find out his undying self and die and be immortal and happy
8885083 there is a trifling halting place in my meditation when i ask myself who am i my reasoning proceeds as follows i see my hand who sees it my eye how to see the eye in a mirror similarly to see me there must be a mirror which is to supply the place of the mirror in me is my question
8885084 the upanishadic method of meditation has now disappeared there was a great sage in bengal who instructed me in it after long years of discipline and practice i am having some mystic experiences i feel sometimes that bhuma supreme consciousness is infinitude and that i am finite consciousness is that correct
8885085 think that you are always in my presence that will make you feel right
8885086 what about the despondency of not obtaining any encouragement from the master much less his grace
8885087 maharshi is with me not only when i think of him but also when i am not thinking of him otherwise how do i live
8885088 the wise mans heart is at the right hand and a fools heart is at the left
8885089 the animals seem to conform to their own natural laws in spite of their environment and changes whereas man flouts social law and is not bound by any definite system he seems to be degenerating whereas the animals are steady is it not so
8885090 training of mind helps one to bear sorrows and bereavements with courage
8885091 if a man considers he is born he cannot avoid the fear of death let him find out if he has been born or if the self has any birth he will discover that the self always exists that the body which is born resolves itself into thought and that the emergence of thought is the root of all mischief find wherefrom thoughts emerge then you will abide in the ever present inmost self and be free from the idea of birth or the fear of death
8885092 how is abhyasa to be made i am trying to find the light
8885093 yes it was the occasion of ardra and jayanti i was living up the hill in skandasramam streams of visitors were climbing up the hill from the town a mongoose larger than the ordinary size of golden hue not grey as a mongoose is with no black spot on its tail as is usual with the wild mongoose passed these crowds fearlessly people 86 talks with sri ramana maharshi took it to be a tame one belonging to someone in the crowd the animal went straight to palaniswami who was having a bath in the spring by the virupaksha cave he stroked the creature and patted it it followed him into the cave inspected every nook and corner and left the place and joined the crowd to pass up to skandasramam i noticed it everyone was struck by its attractive appearance and its fearless movements it came up to me got on my lap and rested there some time then it raised itself up looked about and moved down it went round the whole place and i followed it lest it should be harmed by the unwary visitors or by the peacocks two peacocks of the place looked at it inquisitively whereas the mongoose moved nonchalantly from place to place and finally disappeared into the rocks on the south east of the asramam
8885094 why did jesus call out my god my god while being crucified
8885095 my reward consists in your permanent unbroken bliss do not slip away from it
8885096 it is said that one should receive instruction from a guru mere reading of books is not helpful i have read many books but there is no practical help derived from 100 talks with sri ramana maharshi such learning please tell me what i should do how i should do it at what times in which places and so on
8885097 here and now be at peace and tranquil that is all
8885098 just as a doctor learns what is wrong with the patient and treats him accordingly so may sri bhagavan do with me
8885099 vang manasi sampadyate manah prane pranastejasi tejah parasyam devatayam iti
8885100 it is no use trying to keep them here they are not ripe in their minds as these dogs
8885101 ego disappearing another i i spontaneously manifests in full glory
8885102 not real nor unreal not darkness nor light it is
8885103 whomsoever one may worship the worshipper worships me only and i save him
8885104 should anyone desirous of spiritual progress take to action or renunciation pravritti marga or nivritti marga
8885105 what is the message of the east to the west
8885106 how do you say i am do you take a light to find yourself or did you come to know it on reading books how
8885107 knowledge without practice accompanying it is superior to practice without knowledge practice with knowledge is superior to knowledge without practice accompanying it karmaphala tyagah nishkama karma as of a jnani action without desire is superior to knowledge with practice
8885108 if you know your self no evil can come to you since you asked me i have taught you
8885109 is the whole scheme the plan really good or is it in the nature of an error a mistake of which we have to make the best
8885110 i have an impression that in deep sleep i have something akin to samadhi is it so
8885111 is paul bruntons secret path useful for indians as well
8885112 is it enough to introvert the mind or should we meditate on i am brahman
8885113 the mystery of the pyramid is the mystery of the self
8885114 not that these you or i were not before are not now nor will not be hereafter nothing was born nothing was dead nor will it not be so hereafter
8885115 how could it be you were born a few years ago they lived ages ago
8885116 yes there have been so many incarnations of myself and yourself i know them all but you do not know
8885117 what is real is hidden from us but what is false is revealed as true
8885118 what do you care for the body practise bhakti and dont worry about what happens to the body
8885119 there is no cause for worry subjugation of senses is a necessary preliminary for self realisation one sense is subdued for you by god himself so much the better
8885120 there are two i and god before knowing the far off god let me know the more immediate and intimate i
8885121 it is said that the non brahmins should not hear the recital of the vedas
8885122 who is that i without knowing the i you are using the word if its significance be known there will be no doubt find the i first and you may afterwards speak of other matters
8885123 the smritis say something they are not appropriate now i will reform the world rewrite the smritis
8885124 reaching me there is no rebirth all others are in bondage
8885125 suppose you dream that you are taking me to poland you wake up and ask me i dreamt so and so did you dream so or know it or how do you view it
8885126 i asked mother in sri aurobindo ashram the following question i keep my mind blank without thoughts arising so that god might show himself in his true being
8885127 the reply was to this effect the attitude is right the power will come down from above it is a direct experience
8885128 there was never a time when i and you and these kings were not nor will they not be in future that which is unreal never exists but that which is real never disappears all that ever was even now is and will ever be
8885129 i taught this truth to aditya he taught it to manu etc
8885130 how can it be you were born some years back and only recently how could you have taught aditya
8885131 yes we have had several births in the past i know mine whereas you do not know yours i tell you what happened in those past births
8885132 you are probably thirsty after your long meditation in the hot sun on the hotter rocks and you would like to drink a jug of water
8885133 quite so that happiness which is the result of enjoyment by the senses is the same as that of liberation that desire of such liberation is one of the four qualifications for attainment this is common to all so all are eligible for this knowledge self knowledge
8885134 bhagavan we have been spiritually inclined from our childhood we have read several books on philosophy and are attracted by vedanta so we read the upanishads yoga vasishtha bhagavad gita etc we try to meditate but there is no progress in our meditation we do not understand how to realise can you kindly help us towards realisation
8885135 itself is penance which is again made up of wisdom alone
8885136 there the sun shines not nor the moon nor the stars nor fire all these shine forth by its light
8885137 o arjuna i am in the expanse of the heart
8885138 he who is in the sun is also in this man
8885139 no i am not a brute i am a man
8885140 the wife is dear because of the love of the self
8885141 the unreal hath no being the real never ceaseth to be the truth about both hath been perceived by the seers of the essence of things
8885142 the real is ever real the unreal is ever unreal
8885143 he is not born nor doth he die nor having been ceaseth he anymore to be unborn perpetual eternal ancient he is not slain when the body is slaughtered
8885144 what if anyone is dead what if anyone is ruined be dead yourself be ruined yourself
8885145 who are you apart from me that presume to serve me
8885146 i o arjuna am the self seated in the heart of all beings
8885147 i was in a maze sticking to i and mine i wandered without knowing my self on realising my self i understand that i myself am you and that mine i e my possessions is only you
8885148 yoga means union i wonder union of which with which
8885149 i remain fixed whereas innumerable universes becoming concepts within my mind rotate within me this meditation is the highest circuit pradakshina
8885150 manickavasagar is one of those whose body finally resolved itself in a blazing light without leaving a corpse behind
8885151 rama is simply acting as a human being would under the circumstances he is nevertheless the incarnation of vishnu and deserves to be saluted you may test him if you choose
8885152 why parvati are you here where is sambhu why have you taken the shape of sita
8885153 we are all only aspects of siva worshipping him at sight and remembering him out of sight
8885154 dispassion cannot be acquired nor realization of the truth nor inherence in the self in the absence of gurus grace
8885155 o humming bee namely mind why do you take the pains of collecting tiny specks of honey from innumerable flowers there is one from whom you can have the whole storehouse of honey by simply thinking or seeing or speaking of him get within and hum to him hrimkara
8885156 merging the mind into the heart certainly comprises meritorious duty karma devotion bhakti yoga and supreme wisdom jnana
8885157 continuous search for what the mind is results in its disappearance that is the straight path
8885158 whoever investigates the origin of the i thought for him the ego perishes this is the true investigation
8885159 siva made over all his own possessions to vishnu and wandered away in the forests and wilderness and cemeteries and lived on food begged by him in his view non possession is higher in the scale of happiness than possession of things
8885160 being of the nature of bliss why does one continue to crave for happiness to be rid of that craving is itself salvation the scriptures say you are that the imparting of that knowledge is their purpose the realisation must be by your finding out who you are and abiding as that i e your self to be repeating i am that or not this is only a waste of time for the worthy disciple the work lies within himself and not without
8885161 if i had given you one morsel from my plate each one would ask for a morsel too what will be left for me if i distribute the whole plate to others so you see that it is not devotion there is no significance in eating a morsel from my plate be a true devotee
8885162 all wish to rush out there is no limit to going out happiness lies within and not without
8885163 whoever dies or is lost what is that to you die yourself and lose yourself becoming one with love
8885164 i have been worshipping them for the last ten years but have been rewarded only with calamities what shall i do with them when i asked others they attribute my worries to some fault in the make up of the idols for instance the difference in the metals of their make is it so
8885165 there is a state when words cease and silence prevails
8885166 soul answers soul by itself not by description or words
8885167 was i born am i reaping fruits of my past karma
8885168 i am blessed with everything that a human being would like to have
8885169 i have all that i want a human being would want but but i i do not have peace of mind something prevents it probably my destiny
8885170 all right what need be said has been said well what is destiny there is no destiny surrender and all will be well throw all the responsibility on god do not bear the burden yourself what can destiny do to you then
8885171 i understand that the self is beyond the ego my knowledge is theoretical and not practical how shall i gain practical realisation of the self
8885172 i permit him to do so i have permitted him already let him do so even more let others follow suit only let them leave me alone if because of these reports no one comes to me i shall consider it a great service done to me moreover if he cares to publish books containing scandals of me and if he makes money by their sale it is really good such books will sell even more quickly and in larger numbers than others look at miss mayos book why should he not also do it he is doing me a very good turn
8885173 even if allowed to have his own way for earning money the man gets into trouble if he availed himself of our indulgence and acted sensibly he could have got on well but what can we do
8885174 we had heard of you maharajji as the kindest and noblest soul we had long desired to have your darsan i came here once before on the 14th of last month but could not remain in your holy presence as long as i wished being a woman and also young i could not stand the people around and so broke away hurriedly after asking one or two simple questions there are no holy men like you in our part of the country i am happy as i have everything i want but i do not have that peace of mind which brings happiness i now come here seeking your blessing so that i may gain it
8885175 if you remember bhagavan you are prompted to do so by the self
8885176 the illiterates are certainly better off than the literates whose egos are not destroyed by the quest of the self
8885177 see the self in yourself like the pure ether in all beings in and out
8885178 unashamed fall prostrate before even an outcast a cow or an ass
8885179 so long as i am not perceived in all worship all with body and mind
8885180 with right knowledge see all as brahma this once clear all doubts are at an end and you will remain withdrawn in the self
8885181 you are kind to squirrels and hares you fondle them when they struggle to run away from you yet you are indifferent to human beings for instance i have left my home and am waiting here for a fortnight i have had no food some days i am struggling still you do not care for me
8885182 there is a class of people who want to know all about their future or their past they ignore the present the load from the past forms the present misery the attempt to recall the past is mere waste of time
8885183 refreshing peace within is the highest miracle maharshi possesses it
8885184 the same peace is bestowed on all visitors to be shared by them mr paul brunton has mentioned it in his book everyone feels it every day in maharshis presence
8885185 after several rebirths the seeker gains knowledge and thus knows me
8885186 i came last time with my husband and children i was thinking of their food and time was pressing so i could not stay here as long as i would have wished but i was later worried over the hurried nature of the visit i have returned now to sit quiet and imbibe sri bhagavans grace may he give me strength of mind
8885187 yes silence is perpetual speaking ordinary speech hinders that heartto heart talk
8885188 this time i shall not say is the last time i shall come as i said on former occasions
8885189 i long for bhakti i want more of this longing even realisation does not matter for me let me be strong in my longing
8885190 i was going to ask maharshi if he called me
8885191 i was very agreeably surprised and pleased i took it to be a call from maharshi
8885192 i want this kind of food and not that kind
8885193 each is great in its own way what is kambars greatness when compared with a bird which builds its nest so fine the worms which 232 talks with sri ramana maharshi give lac the honey bee which builds the comb the ants which build cities and the spider its web
8885194 see yourself first and then see the whole world as the self
8885195 the one who fascinated my heart or the captivator of my heart i sing of him in my mind
8885196 some are born immediately after others after some lapse of time a few are not reborn on this earth but eventually get salvation in some higher region and a very few get absolved here and now
8885197 i cannot imagine that we are no better than seasonal flowers fruits and leaves on trees i love flowers but still this idea has no hold on me
8885198 we have seen those places without the trouble of travel
8885199 realise the self with pure intellect and also by service to guru and by enquiry
8885200 what is the meaning of this talk of truth and falsehood in the world which is itself false
8885201 how should i meditate i do not have peace of mind
8885202 i have read it also i cannot still make my mind concentrate
8885203 people speak of memory and oblivion of the fullness of the self
8885204 ignorance never arose it has no real being that which is is only vidya knowledge
8885205 what a bhagavan is this look at the force of his words he is great he never forgets even a poor man like me he remembers my son manikkam also with kindness such are the great ones i am happy when i do any little work for him such as looking to the cows when they are in heat
8885206 why is there no meditation in dream or in sleep
8885207 i do not tell anyone to come nor ask him to go everyone pleases himself here he says he finds peace in the hall and he also wants a job evidently the job must be found in the hall itself so that his peace may not be disturbed peace is not in the hall it is in the repose of the self it can be gained anywhere
8885208 what is vairagya detachment from worldly pursuits and desire for salvation is it not so
8885209 we though familiar with our traditional teachings are unable to follow these teachings meaning sri bhagavans how can the foreigners unfamiliar with our ways follow sri bhagavans teachings so easily
8885210 visions are not external they appear only internally if external they must assert themselves without there being a seer in that case what is the warranty for their existence the seer only
8885211 even for a trice you do not leave my mind
8885212 he does not leave my mind even for a trice
8885213 glory to thee for enabling me to discuss so much and follow thy words so far
8885214 i was all along seeking thee but on realising the self i find you are the self the self is my all and so you are my all
8885215 though it is the only one yet by its wonderful power it gets reflected on the tiny dot i the ego otherwise known as ignorance or the aggregate of latent tendencies this reflected light is relative knowledge this according to ones prarabdha past karma now fructifying manifests the inner latent tendencies as the outer gross world and withdraws the gross external world as the subtle internal tendencies such power is called mind in the subtle plane and brain in the physical plane this mind or brain acts as the magnifier to that eternal one being and shows it forth as the expanded universe in the waking and dream states the mind is out ward bent and in sleep it is in ward bent with the mind as the medium the one supreme being seems diversified in the waking and dream states and remains withdrawn in the sleep state or swoon etc therefore you are only that and cannot be otherwise whatever the changes the same one being remains as yourself there is nothing besides yourself
8885216 a frog is often compared to a yogi it remains quiet for a long time the only sign of life being the rhythmic movement of the under skin below the neck
8885217 again frogs can remain for extraordinary long periods with their animation suspended they are said to swallow their tongues swallowing the tongue is a yogic practice the animation is suspended the yogi does not die but the tongue must be drawn out by someone else before life activity is resumed it is a wonder how the frog brings out the already swallowed tongue and resumes activity
8885218 it is not my fault i had it concealed in my clothes the others exposed the fish in the temple the fault lies in exposure excreta within the body are not considered filthy but when excreted they are considered filthy so also with this
8885219 i am a samsari unfit for jnana marga the affairs of the world are distracting me please instruct me what i should do
8885220 this asura being in samadhi all the asuras are in peace there is no fight no trial of strength no search for power nor the means for gaining power in the absence of such means for power yaga yajna etc i e the gods are not thriving there is no new creation nor even is any existence justified so i will wake him up then the asuras will rise up their original nature will manifest itself the gods will challenge them the asuras and others will then seek strength and adopt the means for its acquisition yajnas etc will flourish the gods will thrive there will be more and more of creation more of fight and i shall have enough to do
8885221 i was long wondering where the current starts within the body or elsewhere suddenly my body grew tenuous until it disappeared the enquiry who am i went on very clearly and forcibly the sound of i i i alone persisted there was one vast expanse and nothing more there was a hazy perception of the occurrences in the hall i knew that people stood up to salute at the end of the vedic chant i 304 talks with sri ramana maharshi wanted to stand the thought soon deserted me i was again lost in the one expanse the experience continued until i heard the voice of sri bhagavan that made me collect myself then i stood up and saluted a strange feeling continued for more than half an hour i cannot forget it it is still haunting me
8885222 before i realised my self i was wandering looking out for you having now realised my self i see that you are my self
8885223 pervading my self you remain as the antaryamin immanent being
8885224 why should individuals remain caught up in the affairs of this world and reap troubles as a result should they not be free if they are in the spiritual world they will have greater freedom
8885225 i have now found the robber namely the mind who has been robbing me of my i ness i will instantly kill this thief
8885226 your enemies are lust passion etc if you feel injured turn within and find out the cause of the injury it is not external to you the external causes are mere superimpositions if you cannot injure yourself will the all merciful god injure you in any manner
8885227 if they serve the purpose of walking what does it matter if sensation is lost
8885228 where the sun shines not etc that is my supreme abode
8885229 it is not enough that i serve sri bhagavan physically but i must unceasingly remember him
8885230 i must come into being before or after some age
8885231 when my son was in the womb my husband died the son was born posthumous he grew up all right for five years then he was attacked by infantile paralysis when nine he was bedridden nevertheless he was bright and cheerful for two years he was in that condition and now they say that he is dead i know that he is only sleeping and will awake soon when they said that he had collapsed i was shocked i saw in a vision a sadhu who appeared to pass his hands over the childs body and the child awoke refreshed i believe that sadhu is yourself please come and touch the boy so that he may get up
8885232 they say that he is dead but what do they know i have brought the boy all the way from guntur to this place
8885233 quite so the world that exists in my sleep has existed before my birth and will exist after my death do not others see it how can the world cease to be if my ego appears not
8885234 i did not know i did not remember in sleep
8885235 kasturi pill one after another every day the bottle will be empty and more is ordered i dont want it
8885236 it contains 338 talks with sri ramana maharshi lime juice lime juice is not good for this
8885237 it need not be munched it may be kept in the mouth and sucked
8885238 let him munch it or suck it i do not want it
8885239 eh eh what do you do i do not want
8885240 i shall soon be right even without it do not take it out eh eh keep it there i wont take it do what you like
8885241 whose darsan why dont you say that you gave darsan to me
8885242 it is due to weakness of mind that peace once gained is later lost
8885243 a sheep of mine has slipped into this cleft so i am crying
8885244 yes yes you do your work let me go for mine people are waiting for me let me go
8885245 whenever the turbulent mind wavers then and there pull it and bring it under control
8885246 can two of them be called widows and the third not
8885247 until you gain jnana you cannot understand the state of a jnani there is no use asking about the work of isvara and the rest some ask why siva went naked in daruka forest and spoiled the chastity of the rishis wives the puranas which record this incident have also said that siva had previously saved the devas and the universe by consuming the poison halahala at the time of churning the ocean of milk he who could save the world from the deadly poison and lead the sages to emancipation had also wandered nude amongst their women their actions are incomprehensible to ordinary intellects one must be a jnani to understand a jnani or isvara
8885248 you are said to be a saint why do you desecrate the linga
8885249 indeed i am too old and weak to do the right thing please lift my feet and place them where there is no linga
8885250 i was so worried before i am after all the self the same as before but not affected by anything where is he who was miserable he is nowhere to be seen
8885251 this man is in a fit state to receive guidance
8885252 oh lord coming with me all along the births never abandoning me and finally rescuing me
8885253 we two are not only now but have ever been so
8885254 the general idea pervading gaudapadas work that bondage and liberation the individual soul and the world are all unreal makes a caustic critic observe that the theory which has nothing better to say than that an unreal soul is trying to escape from an unreal supreme good may itself be an unreality it is one thing to say that the unchangeable reality expressing itself in the changing universe without forfeiting its nature is a mystery and another to dismiss the whole changing universe as a mere mirage if we have to play the game of life we cannot do so with the conviction that the play is a show and all the prizes in it are mere blanks no philosophy can consistently hold such a theory and be at rest with itself the greatest condemnation of such a theory is that we are obliged to occupy ourselves with objects the existence and value of which we are continually denying in theory it only shows that there is something else which includes and transcends the world but it does not imply the world is a dream
8885255 o stomach how difficult it is to get on with you you cannot starve when no food is available nor can you take more and keep it in reserve when food is plenty you will take only what you want and when you want thus you are troublesome to me allowing me no rest
8885256 o prana how troublesome you are to me you never allow me to rest but continue loading me with food off and on it is so difficult to get on with you
8885257 quite no wonder that one destined for this high state could not do such humble work in those days
8885258 if i refused to wear koupina once i am now made to pay the penalty by wearing it always
8885259 neither the sun shines there nor the moon nor the stars nor lightning how can fire shine there all these luminaries shine in his light only with his light all these shine forth
8885260 i wanted to test you to see if you had completely surrendered yourself or retained your individuality it is now clear what it is
8885261 o guru you have been always with me watching me through several reincarnations and ordaining my course until i was liberated
8885262 the numerous incarnations yours and mine have taken place i know them but you do not
8885263 brahman being pure how can maya arise from him and veil him also
8885264 are all of them the same are they not separate
8885265 god proves the devotee by means of severe ordeals a washerman beats the cloth on a slab not to tear it but only to remove the dirt
8885266 find the source of the sound which is transcendental mooladhara sabda by diving deep like a pearl diver diving for pearls
8885267 for a man who has controlled his mind where is the use of tapasya give up i am the body idea and realise i am not thou art all
8885268 by complete surrender realise that i am not and that all is he
8885269 some sakti draws people from all parts of the globe to this centre
8885270 what sakti drew me here originally the same sakti draws all others as well
8885271 how disgusting is my life that i soil my body and mind every day this mans life is most desirable
8885272 how do you know his mind maybe he is not as good as he appears to be the bodily functions may be forcibly controlled and the mind may be revelling in riotous thoughts one cannot control ones vasanas as easily as the physical frame
8885273 the actions are only the indices of the mind his life shows his mind to be pure
8885274 not necessarily his mind has not been proved as yet
8885275 for victory let go my anger i release my mind when it rushes away if it is true that i sleep day and night quite aware of my self may this stone burst into twain and become the wide expanse
8885276 if the child be touched by one eternally celibate nityabrahmachari the child would be brought to life
8885277 if i am eternally celibate nityabrahmachari may the child be brought to life
8885278 this cannot be siva for it is within the compass of my vision i am greater than this light
8885279 to remove my darkness and give me light thy grace must work through me only
8885280 we do bhajana and the rest but we have not seen nor heard of those who had seen thee
8885281 become independent and solve the riddle yourself it is for you to do it
8885282 well thinking like this keeps her always in the presence this is better than remaining in the hall and thinking of something else
8885283 seek the company of saints by all means but do not remain indefinitely with them the adage familiarity breeds contempt applies even to their case
8885284 spiritual growth is no doubt largely dependent on suitable association
8885285 he may for a brief period remain in their contact and thereby drawing inspiration and guidance get himself thoroughly awakened to the consciousness of the indwelling reality
8885286 there are many cases known to the writer and many others of which he has heard and read in which such continued dwelling in the company of saints has not only cooled down the ardour and aspiration of the seekers but also turned them into scoffers and sceptics
8885287 a young plant growing beneath the shade of a full grown giant tree does not develop strength and stature
8885288 this analogy of the plant aptly illustrates the stunted life of a seeker who is attached merely to the outward personality of a saint and spends all his days in close association with him
8885289 from what has been said above it must not be construed that reflection is cast upon the greatness and efficacy of the company of 449 talks with sri ramana maharshi god realised souls such a contact is the most effective means for a rapid spiritual evolution of the soul in fact the grace of saints is an invaluable aid for sadhana and without it the condition of the aspirant is like a bird beating in vain its wings against the bars of the cage for freedom saints are the saviours and liberators the hindu conception of a saint is that he is the very embodiment of god himself so honour him derive the rare benefit of his society serve him with a frank and pure heart listen intently to his words of advice and strive to act up to them and achieve the fullest knowledge of the truth you are in quest of but seek not to remain attached to his person and lose the spiritual gifts you obtained from him by first contacts
8885290 o master who has been within me in all my past incarnations and who manifested as a human being only to speak the language understood by me and lead me
8885291 this man should be brought here at 2 oclock tomorrow
8885292 get up and walk why do you move on your buttocks
8885293 i am not the doer and yet actions go on
8885294 your reputation has spread in the punjab we have travelled a long distance to have your darsan kindly tell us something by way of instruction
8885295 which is the best the yoga the bhakti or the jnana path
8885296 although all actions take place i am not the doer
8885297 to see chidambaram to be born in tiruvarur to die in benares or merely to think of arunachala is to be assured of liberation
8885298 gods and saints are eager to see my cosmic form i have not fulfilled their desire yet i endow divine sight by which you can see that form
8885299 the heart is like a lotus turned down or a plantain bud
8885300 there is a bright spot atom like like the end of a grain of paddy
8885301 that spot is like a flame and in its centre transcendental brahman is seated
8885302 i am 472 talks with sri ramana maharshi the body there is something in me
8885303 show me the mind and then you will know what to do
8885304 it is said that healthy mind can be only in a healthy body should we not attempt to keep the body always strong and healthy
8885305 holding the mind and investigating it is advised for a beginner but what is mind after all it is a projection of the self see for whom it appears and from where it rises the i thought will be found to be the root cause go deeper the i thought disappears and there is an infinitely expanded i consciousness that is otherwise called hiranyagarbha when it puts on limitations it appears as individuals
8885306 i am returning to england i leave this place this evening i want to have the happiness of self realisation in my home of course it is not easy in the west but i shall strive for it what is the way to do it
8885307 how is brahmacharya to be practised in order that it may be successfully lived up to
8885308 in ignorance i took the ego to be myself however with right knowledge the ego is nowhere and only you remain as the self
8885309 one must become satiate with the fulfilment of desires before they are renounced
8885310 fire might as well be put out by pouring spirit over the flames
8885311 it does not matter even if i do not get mukti or let me be the last man to get it so that i shall help all others to be muktas before i am one
8885312 o guru always abiding within me but manifesting now in human form only to guide and protect me
8885313 i do not desire kingdoms etc only let me serve thee for ever and there lies my highest pleasure
8885314 can ahimsa put an end to wars in the world
8885315 diksha is of various kinds by word by sight by touch and so forth
8885316 o sages eager to get over all misery worry not about inferences and examples our light is ever shining forth from within with mind clear live in god
8885317 four of us have come from coorg and we had gone to delhi to wait as a deputation on the working committee of the indian national congress and we are now going back we are sent from the coorg congress committee and so kindly give us some message to the coorg district congress committee and the people of coorg in general
8885318 is thought of god necessary for fixing ones sight or making the mind one pointed
8885319 the one with ear rings the robber who robbed me of my mind
8885320 you are a dense mass of jnana capable of removing the i am thebody idea from your devotees herds of gazelles of boars and of bears come down your slopes in the night to search for food on the plains herds of elephants go from the plains to your slopes where they may rest so different herds of animals meet on your slopes
8885321 mahatma is now fasting for twenty one days we want permission from sri bhagavan to run up to yerwada so that we may also fast as long as he does please permit us we are in a haste to go
8885322 it is a good sign that you have such feelings but what can you do now get the strength which gandhiji has already got by his tapasya you will afterwards succeed
8885323 mowna is the utmost eloquence peace is utmost activity how because the person remains in his essential nature and so he permeates all the recesses of the self thus he can call up any power into play whenever or wherever it is necessary that is the highest siddhi
8885324 we will churn the milk without losing thought of krishna
8885325 this namaskar was originally meant by the ancient sages to serve as a means of surrender to god the act still prevails but not the spirit behind it the doer of namaskar intends to deceive the object of worship by his act it is mostly insincere and deceitful it is meant to cover up innumerable sins can god be deceived the man thinks that god accepts his namaskar and that he himself is free to continue his old life they need not come to me i am not pleased with these namaskars the people should keep their minds clean instead of that they bend themselves or lie prostrate before me i am not deceived by such acts
8885326 all finished heart talk is all talk all talk must end in silence only
8885327 how is it that atma vidya is said to be the easiest
8885328 which of the buildings was according to a plan made by these people here god has his own plans and all these go on according to that no one need worry as to what happens
8885329 how were we all in our previous births why do we not know our own past
8885330 we are advised to concentrate on the spot in the forehead between the eyebrows is it right
8885331 sri bhagavan when i heard of you a strong desire arose in me to see you why should it be so
8885332 sri bhagavan can know when i shall become a jnani please tell me when it will be
8885333 oh ganja the users feel immensely happy when they are under its influence how shall i describe their happiness they simply shout ananda ananda
8885334 now that i have had the darshan of sri bhagavan and it is enough for me may i throw away all the charms tantras and pujas into the river
8885335 here i am here he is there is another and so on
8885336 i am sleeping here how many are there who are awake
8885337 dog seen stone is not seen stone seen dog is not seen
8885338 i must create the universe but i want to go to do tapas for realising the self you are brought forth in order that you may create the universe that will be by multiplying yourselves
8885339 if the self is single if one man is liberated that means that all souls are liberated in practice it is not so therefore advaita is not correct
8885340 i am the body the body requires a seat it is the earth
8885341 does the sage liberated while alive jivanmukta see the world is he affected by karma what is liberation after being disembodied is one liberated only after being disembodied or even while alive in the body should the body of the sage resolve itself in light or disappear from view in any other manner can he be liberated though the body is left behind as a corpse
8885342 leave liberation alone is there bondage know this see yourself first and foremost
8885343 the boy has left his parents to come here this is also an instance of tyaga
8885344 see the trouble to so many because i am here
8885345 because it is cold they have placed fire by my side why should the pankah be pulled
8885346 on a cold morning when i was in virupaksha cave i was sitting in the open i was feeling cold people used to come see me and go back a group of andhra visitors had come i did not notice what they were doing they were behind me suddenly a noise tak and water over my head i shivered with cold i looked back they had broken a coconut and poured the water on me they thought that it was worship they took me for a stone image
8885347 being the eye of the mental eye the ether of the mental ether
8885348 brahman is the same as jiva if the jiva be under illusion it amounts to saying that brahman is under illusion how is that possible
8885349 restrictions are only for the common people and not for saints like you
8885350 i had previously heard of this bhramarakita nyaya after i came to tiruvannamalai when i was staying in gurumoortham i noticed a red wasp construct a hive in which it placed five or six grubs and then flew away my curiosity was roused and i wanted to test the truth of the oftquoted nyaya i waited some days maybe ten days i then tapped the hive it broke and there i found that all the five or six grubs had united together and taken the shape of a wasp but it was white 2 later when i was in virupaksha cave i saw a red wasp construct five or six hives in each of which it placed five or six grubs and flew away after about ten days a black beetle smaller than the wasp buzzed round the hives and closed each of then with a little black mud and flew away i was wondering at the intrusion of the beetle on the hive of the wasp i waited a few days and then gently opened one of the hives five or six black bodies came out and each of them was a black beetle i thought it strange 3 again when i was in pachyamman temple i saw a red wasp constructing five or six hives on a pillar in the temple it placed five or six grubs in each of them and buzzed away i watched it for several days the wasp did not return there was no black beetle also after about fifteen days i opened one of the hives all the grubs had united into a white mass of wasp like form it dropped down and was stunned by the fall after a few minutes it began to crawl its colour was gradually changing in a short time there were two little specks on its sides which grew into wings as i watched and the full grown wasp flew away from the ground 4 when i was in the mango tree cave i noticed a caterpillar like worm crawl up a wall it stopped in one place and fixed two spots which it later connected up with a thin filament from its body it held the filament with its mouth and rested its tail end on the wall it remained so several days i was watching it it shrivelled up in course of time i wondered if 564 talks with sri ramana maharshi there was life in it so i gently tickled it with a thin stalk there was no life within i left it there but in a few days more i found that there was only a thin dry skin left behind and the inner thing had flown away 5 i had also seen the flies carrying tiny grubs on their legs which they deposited on offal the grubs later flew away as flies
8885351 when i was a boy i had seen the fishermen divert water from its main course and keep a pot through which the diverted water flowed the artificial way was spread with tobacco stems strangely enough the larger fishes always took the new way and fell into the pot the fishermen who were simply sitting quiet used to take the fish out from the pot and throw them into their baskets i thought at the time it was strange later when i was staying here i heard some man recite a piece from thayumanavar which mentioned the same trick of the fishermen
8885352 if the individual self merges into the universal self how can one pray to god for the uplift of humanity
8885353 is the experience of the highest state the same to all or is there any difference
8885354 who is god what is his nature where is he how can he be realised
8885355 i am a man i am a man i am a man
8885356 siva himself was waylaid in tiruvudal utsava and he practised the same trick on his devotees can it be so
8885357 can you kindly give me a summary of your teachings
8885358 two years have come and gone since last i crossed the threshold of thy ashram and yet in spirit i have ever remained there
8885359 though illusion still often veils the vision of reality revealed in the blessed silence of thy presence
8885360 though the silver thread of self awareness be often lost midst changing light and shadows still the inner urge to realise the self remains and stronger grows and more insistent as grace and search go hand in hand
8885361 at times yet rare with no apparent cause spontaneous awareness of the i springs up and bliss fills the heart with glowing warmth
8885362 yet what the soul has experienced and knows repeatedly as truth can neither be denied nor ever forgotten and that which is gives constant strength to persevere
8885363 i pray to thee as to my self for light and guidance that i know are ever there and at thy feet lay offerings of unchanging love
8885364 thou art my father thou art my mother thou art my relations my possessions and all
8885365 yes yes thou art this that and everything except i why not say i am thou and finish it
8885366 all these questions arise so long as there is one who can ask questions if the questioner is sought and found the questions will end of their own accord
8885367 i have passed one station now another yet another and so on
8885368 the sleep state is really dull whereas the waking state is full of beautiful and interesting things
8885369 we have had many rebirths i am aware of them but you are not
8885370 how can it be you sri krishna were born of devaki some years before aditya was among those who started creation how could you have taught this truth to aditya
8885371 many rebirths we have had i know them all but you do not
8885372 if we could see the self within ourselves why should we have come all the way to see him we had been thinking of him so long and it is only right that we came here is it then unnecessary to do so
8885373 what a wonder that i did not know my very self all these years i suffered long and you so graciously helped me to realise the self how shall i repay your grace it is not in my power to do it
8885374 well well your repayment consists in not lapsing into ignorance over again but in continuing in the state of your real self
8885375 when the vasanas are projected from the heart they are associated with the light of the self and the person is said to think the 596 talks with sri ramana maharshi vasanas which lie imbedded in an atomic condition grow in size in their passage from the heart to the brain the brain is the screen on which the images of the vasanas are thrown and it is also the place of their functional distribution the brain is the seat of the mind and the mind works through it
8885376 the entire universe is condensed in the body and the entire 597 talks with sri ramana maharshi body in the heart thus the heart is the nucleus of the whole universe
8885377 the world is not other than the mind the mind is not other than the heart that is the whole truth
8885378 i was not aware of anything i slept soundly and happily
8885379 even if i cannot realise in my life let me at least not forget it on my death bed let me have a glimpse at least at the moment of death so that it may stand me in good stead in the future
8885380 there is a girl of eleven in lahore she is very remarkable she says she can call upon krishna twice and remain conscious but if she calls the third time she becomes unconscious and remains in trance for ten hours continuously
8885381 oh help of the helpless how i have troubled thee what return can i make for this kindness
8885382 sri bhagavan appears so unconcerned under all circumstances but he is all along so loving and gracious
8885383 i have been doing omkara upasana for long in the left ear i am always hearing a sound it is like the piping of a nadasvaram pipe even now i hear it some luminous visions are also seen i do not know what i should do
8885384 where one sees none other hears none other knows none other that is perfection
8885385 to go to kailas and return is just a new birth for there the body idea drops off
8885386 i removed the nests as often as they were built i removed the last one this very afternoon
8885387 if indeed real they must remain even unrelated to time space and differentiation are they so
8885388 are the two methods karma marga and jnana marga separate and independent of each other or is the karma marga only a preliminary which after successful practice should be followed by jnana marga for the consummation of the aim the karma advocates non attachment to action and yet an active life whereas the jnana means renunciation what is the true meaning of renunciation subjugation of lust passion greed etc is common to all and forms the essential preliminary step for any course does not freedom from passions indicate renunciation or is renunciation different meaning cessation of the active life these questions are troubling me and i beg lights to be thrown on those doubts
8885389 you have said all your question contains the answer also freedom from passions is the essential requisite when that is accomplished all else is accomplished
8885390 to say i i cannot help anyone to reach the goal how can i be pointed out
8885391 my attitude was not properly understood i want to know the i it must be pointed out to me
8885392 go back the way you came do it externally or internally as it suits you
8885393 the fact is it takes no effort to stop thinking the thoughts do not come indeed there is no vacuum but i mean to say that there is no thought about the mission
8885394 although i had often heard that all the srutis declare the state of stillness to be one of bliss all bliss yet i continued to be ignorant again i did not follow the advice of my lord the silent master because of my folly i wandered in the forest of illusion alas it was my fate
8885395 bliss will reveal itself if one is still why then is this illusory yoga practice can it i e bliss be revealed by directing the intellect in a particular way do not say so you who are given to the practice and are therefore an innocent babe
8885396 the eternal being is that state where you have disappeared are you not in it too you who cannot speak of it do not be perplexed although you do not manifest yet you are not lost for you are eternal and also still do not be in pain here is bliss come on
8885397 you have this dispassion in your youth it is admirable
8885398 all the beings form his one foot padosya viswa bhutani does not mean that brahman is in four parts
8885399 those portions deal with theories of creation they are not material because the srutis do not mean to set forth such theories they mention the theories casually so that the enquirer may please himself if he be so inclined the truth is that the world appears as a passing shadow in a flood of light light is necessary to see that shadow also the shadow does not deserve any special notice analysis or discussion the book deals with the self and that is its purpose the discussions on creation may be omitted for the present
8885400 the vedanta says that the cosmos springs into view simultaneously with the seer there is no detailed process of creation this is said to be yugapat srshti instantaneous creation it is quite similar to the creations in dream where the experiencer springs up simultaneously with the objects of experience when this is told some people are not satisfied for they are so rooted in objective knowledge they seek to find out how there can be sudden creation they argue that an effect must be preceded by a cause in short they desire an explanation for the existence of the world which 631 talks with sri ramana maharshi they see around them then the srutis try to satisfy their curiosity by such theories of creation this method of dealing with the subject of creation is called krama srshti gradual creation but the true seeker can be content with yugapat srshti instantaneous creation

8885404 nefertiti continually delights me the bust is a unique masterpiece an ornament a true treasure i will never relinquish the head of the queen
8885405 if germany refuses the loan request we will never again organise exhibitions of antiquities in germany it will be a scientific war
8885406 they think we will be like the raiders of the lost ark that we will take it and not return it
8885407 nefertiti is not a pop star that can simply go on tour
8885408 people are opposed to the loan saying the bust might not return but thats nonsense
8885409 some people say if we give this bust to egypt for three months they will not return it
8885410 i say we are not the pirates of the caribbean we are in the 21st century we have co operation with all the countries and who respect our work
8885411 our egyptian colleagues know very well that nefertiti will never leave berlin for two reasons firstly due to reasons of conservation
8885412 secondly for security reasons given the current international political situation it would be completely irresponsible to allow such a piece of art to travel such a far distance
8885413 if berlin will not agree to give us the loan we will fight back to bring this bust for good
8885414 we have received the letter and will consider it at the appropriate moment
8885415 we will treat it as well as any other loan request
8885416 some people say if we give this bust to egypt for three months they will not return it
8885417 i say we are not the pirates of the caribbean we are in the 21st century we have cooperation with all the countries and who respect our work
8885418 we would like these 10 pieces to be at the opening of the grand museum in the year 2012 to invite everyone to show the whole world the cooperation between all of us
8885419 if berlin will not agree to give us the loan we will fight back to bring this bust for good
8885420 the structure of nefertitis material plaster over limestone is very sensitive
8885421 our egyptian colleagues know very well that nefertiti will never leave berlin for two reasons firstly due to reasons of conservation secondly for security reasons given the current international political situation it would be completely irresponsible to allow such a piece of art to travel such a far distance
8885422 im going to give them all the guarantees insurance transportation guarantee completely that the bust will come safe
8885423 we have received the letter and will consider it at the appropriate moment
8885424 we will treat it as well as any other loan request
8885425 we want to tell the whole world about this crime that the museum of st louis is doing and even wrote the children in st louis to tell them dont go to this museum because it has a stolen artifact
8885426 everyone will remember the splendid bust of this queen that is in the berlin museum but this representation the nefertiti head offered to the pope by the mansoors excels the famous masterpiece not for the colors which are completely lacking here but because of the intensity of the expression and the interiority of sentiments conveyed by this head bare of all ornaments but pulsating with exceptional vitality
8885427 because even in her old age she looked beautiful he had grabbed the spirit of the sculpture the head had been withdrawn from public viewing in the vatican egyptian museum after the advice of an inexperienced and or jealous egyptologist
8885428 weve made much much more than that just by selling nefertitis post cards and posters
8885429 in 1933 egypt began what would be a long campaign to bring the nefertiti back home but its request was quashed by der fuhrer
8885430 to make it worse the hungarian bronze is clad only in a close fitting transparent dress depicting nefertiti as essentially a nude
8885431 to show the continued relevance of the ancient world to todays art
8885432 some even suggest that the nefertiti head be returned to egypt etc
8885433 come visit me in egypt and see where ive lived
8885434 the time has come now to make loans not war
8885435 as you know my house is is on a car line and besides the cars there carriage traffic on much automobile and my street for a large part of the night nothing of this breaks my rest i sleep so soundly that a thunderstorm does not arouse me ring yet let the telephone bell begin to and i am out of bed and have the receiver at my i ear before the bell has ceased ringing

8885456 listen attentively to she was then in told with much emphasis
8885457 that her says tonsils describing the treatment were perfectly healthy that no cutting or burning ever was or ever would be required that the tickling sensation in her throat arose from the constant part fixation of attention upon this that she would feel no more desire to hack because her supposed reason for hacking had ceased to exist and finally that when she should than she had open her eyes she would in a good many years
8885458 feel better much emphasis was placed upon this feeling because it of health was desired to leave her which of on the itself crest of a pleasurable emotion has a very great suggestive value in what had been predicted her regard actually oc 256 dissociation curred and disease when she sat up her tic had disappeared and she expressed herself as feehng quite grateful and happy the treatment lasted an hour and except for two slight recurrences easily removed this patient by waking suggestion further difficulty

8885468 this went on for many months then there came a period enough to it of temporary recovery strangely followed an occurrence that brought me suddenly a realization that my position in life was entirely changed that i was quite alone desolate and helpless for a few minutes these ideas flashed through all my mind and then seemed changed i no longer minded what a moment before had caused me so much distress and what is more i immediately began to im prove in health until i was able to mingle with my friends take long walks go driving and alas had formerly done there soon was a relapse and now i am really enjoy life as i feeling worse than ever
8885469 the ordinary picture of so called neurasthenia characterized by persistent fatigue and the usual somatic symptoms and by moral doubts and scruples

8885483 the conviction which every man has of his to identity needs no aid of philosophy strengthen it without first and no philosophy can weaken it producing some degree of insanity is the identity of a person it is a perfect identity wherever real it admits of no degrees and 291 adventurings in the psychical it is impossible that a person should be in part the same and in part different because a person is a monad and is not divisible into parts
8885484 far you are wrong my friend your sek is very from being the simple stable unity that you imagine it to be in reality it is most complex easily breaking up it and most unstable and some times breaking up so completely that be replaced by an entirely new believe this i can prove it self may even you do not but also to you from the facts not only of scientific experiment of everyday observation

8885633 the most impressive campaign speech from an american presidential candidate i can recall in my lifetime
8885634 when was the last time we saw a speech like tonights a full throated defence of progressive principles devoid of mushy centrist crap
8885635 it didnt avoid the tough social issues like abortion guns or gay marriage it wasnt apologetic unlike bill clintons and bidens it didnt unnecessarily praise john mccain it drew sharp distinctions between democrats and republicans
8885636 obama has put a serious dent in mccains ability to continue campaigning with dumb soundbites and too cute by half innuendo
8885637 this isnt a teenagers campaign for junior high student council he was saying its a campaign for president of the united states and youre old enough to know that you should damn well treat it that way
8885638 it was a typical democrat speech an act of attack to disguise a record thinner than that of any president
8885639 for all his fancy promises of hope and change at his core he is just like every leftist messiah we have seen before a man wandering the world convinced of his rightness and purity with no answers to offer but the collapsed policies of the past there was nothing new there other than a new face
8885640 it was basically standard democratic convention boilerplate nothing we havent seen before from obama or for that matter every democratic presidential candidate in living memory
8885641 would have needed to channel martin luther king jr on steroids to knock our socks off
8885642 the tone tonight was very effective focusing on the specific ways that change will make people better off and more secure both economically and in terms of national security

8885645 of je ze nu sociaal gehandicapt of anders wil noemen de groep die antwerps ocmw voorzitter monica de coninck deze week trachtte te beschrijven bestaat onmiskenbaar volgens haar berekeningen telt antwerpen alleen bijna drieduizend mannen en vrouwen die ondanks jarenlange intensieve begeleiding niet aan werk geraken een aantal onder hen ken ik alvast als bezoekers van het thuislozenrestaurant kamiano zonder dat ze daarom aan een aantoonbare fysieke of psychische ziekte lijden slagen ze er niet in hun leven georganiseerd te krijgen of in handen te nemen ze missen de attitude die nodig is om zich aan tijdstippen of afspraken te houden of om zich voor langere tijd op eenzelfde taak te concentreren met wat slechte wil of luiheid kun je dat slechte wil of luiheid noemen maar dat is het gewoonlijk niet sinds enige jaren wordt de actieve welvaartsstaat met de daarbijhorende activering van werklozen als een soort dogma opgevoerd het uitgangspunt is niet fout deelnemen aan het arbeidsproces is een uitstekende manier om armoede en sociale uitsluiting te vermijden dat beleid leverde ook zijn vruchten op gelukkig heb ook ik bezoekers van kamiano gekend die na een dip in hun leven toch uit de put zijn geklauterd en sowieso schenkt werk een ongelooflijke waardigheid alleen er bestaan nu eenmaal mensen waar geen twintig banenplannen vat op hebben de coninck heeft de moed gehad die terechte b mol te plaatsen bovendien lijkt vlaanderen al in grote mate geactiveerd soms zou je haast denken dat banenplannen maar dienen om het vdab personeel zelf geactiveerd te houden tegelijk is sneller sterker en hoger niet alleen een olympisch ideaal het is de dagelijkse realiteit van de ratrace die we collectief hebben georganiseerd dat ten gevolge van onze veeleisende levensstijl sommigen noodgedwongen de rol moeten lossen is ontegensprekelijk zelfs in projecten van sociale economie of in het vrijwilligerswerk kan niet iedereen terecht al kunnen creativiteit geduld en fijn maatwerk hier nog wel meer individuele oplossingen cre ren voor individuele gevallen is het staken van de poging om die groep volgens de gangbare patronen te activeren nu een sociale abdicatie rik daems een vorm van uitrangeren guy tegenbos of integendeel een vorm van pragmatisme karl van den broeck of realisme yves desmet voor mij gaat het er vooral om dat we ophouden werk te verabsoluteren als de enig zaligmakende factor in een mensenleven trouwens van renteniers die in belgi ook niet zo dun gezaaid zijn hoor je zelden klagen dat ze geen klap uitrichten als consument zijn die immers wel belangrijk die vaststelling is niet onschuldig een puur economische benadering van het leven leidt er inderdaad vaak toe dat we de arme met de vinger wijzen natuurlijk moet de overheid blijven streven naar een effici nte en fijnmazige hulpverlening de ervaring in kamiano is evenwel dat er altijd mensen zullen zijn die door de mazen van het net vallen een al te perfectionistisch idee van hulpverlening sterkt vaak de illusie van een irre le zuiverheid na de ontnuchtering worden mensen met een echt complexe problematiek dan aan hun lot overgelaten ook met hen respectvol en menselijk omgaan is een uitdaging naast de professionele hulpverlening blijven daarom netwerken waar gewone intermenselijke solidariteit wordt beleefd onontbeerlijk om de samenleving leefbaar te houden zwakkeren herinneren ons door hun bestaan alleen al dat we finaal allemaal zwak zijn dat we zonder de zorg om elkaar niet kunnen dat zal wat wollig klinken het is er niet minder waar om respect kun je op vele manier uiten het optrekken van het leefloon tot een leefbaar minimum zoals de coninck voorstelt is n facet een ander facet is mensen niet alleen taxeren op wat ze produceren of consumeren in die zin is iedere zwakkere of hij nu kind is bejaard ziek of sociaal gehandicapt waardevol voor een menselijke ecologie die meer wil zijn dan de survival of the fittest tot slot ironisch genoeg ontvangt kamiano ook een groep die het spiegelbeeld is van de hierboven beschreven groep gedreven en deskundige mannen en vrouwen die staan te popelen om deel te nemen aan het arbeidsproces maar die niet mogen omdat hun verblijfssituatie maar niet geregulariseerd geraakt maar dat is een ander verhaal

8885659 what you are what you want what you love doesnt matter its all about how you sell it
8885660 i represent the new breed of christians baby that are gettin ready to kick ass in the name of the kingdom
8885661 i believe in an america where religious intolerance will someday end where all men and all churches are treated as equal where every man has the same right to attend or not attend the church of his choice emphasis added
8885662 freedom requires religion just as religion requires freedom freedom opens the windows of the soul so that man can discover his most profound beliefs and commune with god freedom and religion endure together or perish alone
8885663 i believe in an america that is officially neither catholic protestant nor jewish where no public official either requests or accepts instructions on public policy from the pope the national council of churches or any other ecclesiastical source where no religious body seeks to impose its will directly or indirectly upon the general populace or the public acts of its officials and where religious liberty is so indivisible that an act against one church is treated as an act against all
8885664 almost 50 years ago another candidate from massachusetts explained that he was an american running for president not a catholic running for president like him i am an american running for president i do not define my candidacy by my religion a person should not be elected because of his faith nor should he be rejected because of his faith
8885665 but i do not intend to apologize for these views to my critics of either catholic or protestant faith nor do i intend to disavow either my views or my church in order to win this election
8885666 there are some for whom these commitments are not enough they would prefer it if i would simply distance myself from my religion say that it is more a tradition than my personal conviction or disavow one or another of its precepts that i will not do i believe in my mormon faith and i endeavor to live by it my faith is the faith of my fathers i will be true to them and to my beliefs
8885667 this is the kind of america i believe in and this is the kind i fought for in the south pacific and the kind my brother died for in europe
8885668 and in fact this is the kind of america for which our forefathers died when they fled here to escape religious test oaths that denied office to members of less favored churches when they fought for the constitution the bill of rights and the virginia statute of religious freedom
8885669 there are some who may feel that religion is not a matter to be seriously considered in the context of the weighty threats that face us if so they are at odds with the nations founders for they when our nation faced its greatest peril sought the blessings of the creator and further they discovered the essential connection between the survival of a free land and the protection of religious freedom
8885670 religion is not a matter to be seriously considered in the context of weighty threats
8885671 i believe in a president whose religious views are his own private affair neither imposed by him upon the nation or imposed by the nation upon him as a condition to holding that office
8885672 i think that his representatives are advising him very badly and i have a lot of faith in the lad i believe he has a lot of quality and could be successful here but i say it again that i have to defend the interests of this club in the best manner possible
8885673 the truth is i dont know the player continues having a contract with his club and as such we cannot do anything
8885674 i cant say anything about the coming year either because i dont know what is going to happen we dont even know if we are going to be here we hope that he comes touch wood but in a years time many things can happen
8885675 all the fans want to see a player like cristiano ronaldo here but i am convinced that in the same manner that manchester would love to see all our players in their team
8885676 cristiano is not going to come now as for the coming year only god knows
8885677 it did not seem that kakas position needed to be covered according to the coaching team
8885678 my moral views on this come from the you know from the catholic church
8885679 too many bishops are not taking this seriously and are not delegating their priests in the fight against the devil you have to hunt high and low for a properly trained exorcist
8885680 we believe that it is not the form of religious practice that is important but the spiritual intent that underlies it we recognize that god is in all things and in all people
8885681 it is no irreverence or betrayal to participate fully in the rituals and sacraments of faith traditions different than ones own
8885682 a full 72 percent of the people interviewed said they think the church is full of hypocrites
8885683 at the same time however 71 percent of the respondents said they believe jesus makes a positive difference in a persons life and 78 percent said they would be willing to listen to someone who wanted to share what they believed about christianity
8885684 what is it about the faith we live that causes our culture to like jesus but reject the church
8885685 you shall love the lord your god with all your heart with all your soul and with all your mind this is the greatest and the first commandment the second is like it you shall love your neighbor as yourself the whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments
8885686 the conquest of the earth which mostly means the taking it away from those who have a different complexion or slightly flatter noses than ourselves is not a pretty thing when you look into it too much
8885687 its the lie of evolution that all man are just evolved and that theyre all equal and that all creatures are equal
8885688 people recognize somethings going to happen and theyd better get ready
8885689 based on the numbers of american muslims as a percentage in our population i cannot see that a cabinet position would be justified
8885690 whoever wishes to come after me must deny himself take up his cross and follow me
8885691 the first question which the priest and the levite asked was if i stop to help this man what will happen to me
8885692 but this being now decided by the voice of the nation announced according to the rules of the constitution all will of course arrange themselves under the will of the law and unite in common efforts for the common good emphasis added
8885693 there is a belief now that individuals especially young people should essentially devote themselves to something greater than themselves sacrifice their own wants their own interests to serve the common good whatever they happen to believe it is at the time to me thats very un american i just dont think its the role of the government to have me tutoring young kids if i dont want to or digging latrines if i dont want to or cleaning up trash at housing projects people who serve in the military do so voluntarily and i think they do so out of their own self interest they do so because they want to attack and kill a militant islam sic they do it very selfishly
8885694 every man woman and child for him or her self
8885695 not long after the 2004 election a congressional aide identified himself as an evangelical during a public q amp a he told me afterward that it was the first time hed outed himself in front of fellow democrats how did it feel i asked he paused a little scary he said but good now hes one of a growing class of consultants who advise democratic candidates about how to court religious voters
8885696 it depends on how its done it depends on the circumstances it depends on who does it
8885697 we give some of the worst people in our society presumption of innocence and the benefit of the doubt
8885698 neocon catholic leaders nurtured by gop and conservative philanthropy on their heels
8885699 of course race is only one issue on which wright has stepped beyond the bounds of civil discourse hes frequently made statements regarding israel and the jewish community that i find troubling but to limit our understanding of obama to the ill conceived comments of the man who once led his church is dishonest and self defeating
8885700 the point is if you look at my writings and my history my commitment to israel and the jewish people is more than skin deep and its more than political expediency
8885701 how jews are cursed collectively because the ancient hebrews once worshiped idols
8885702 there is nothing unusual about a rabbi using guilt and fear to promote attendance at services and classes clerics do this sort of thing all the time and so have i but when a rabbi invokes the holocaust that is pulling out the heavy artillery here in my office was the same pattern i have seen in almost everything i have read in english about the jewish religion we were talking about judaism in terms of continuity authenticity and survival as i looked at the faces and postures of this couple as i listened to the intonations of their voices i instinctively knew that something is amiss with how my colleagues and i go about our jobs as religious leaders how can a community thrive based upon a discourse of anxiety and guilt and on members who feel defeated and hopeless
8885703 the myth that judaism and jewish identity are endangered in america was born from the trauma of cultural dislocation a century ago the myth lives on in part because jewish institutions believe they are essential to the preservation of judaism in america and the greater the peril the more important their role
8885704 jewishness is happening in new places that do not fit the old categories
8885705 my little child close your eyes if god will youll be a rabbi
8885706 writers who idealize the shtetl are highly selective in what they talk about their descriptions of the devout husbands and their devoted long suffering wives are amplified by intense nostalgia in contrast to their silence about the other jews who lived in the shtetl p 83
8885707 today every jewish denomination assumes that each of its member congregations is led by one of the denominations rabbis and conversely americans assume that every rabbi has a congregation
8885708 this is a radical departure from old world jewish practice where the rabbi was not necessarily associated with a congregation and not every synagogue had a rabbi the functions of the synagogue and the duties of the rabbi were independent of each other communities had their rabbis and communities had their synagogues
8885709 the harm is that when rabbis whether by intention or by instinct make inaccurate claims about the historical facts of jewish civilization we undermine our own position in the community our ability to serve new generations of american jews requires us to give up our claims to ancient authority and to accept the fact that our professional role is a modern american creation
8885710 it is no irreverence or betrayal to participate fully in the rituals and sacraments of faith traditions different than ones own quite to the contrary buddhist monk and peace activist thich nhat hanh sees this as a means to deepening and strengthening ones own spirituality exploring the truths taught by many faiths and partaking of the rituals and teachings of other faith traditions s a way of honoring the best values of ones own faith tradition
8885711 disassembling myths removes their power to generate apprehension and despair at the same time myths endow life with meaning i believe that recognizing myths for what they are does not diminish their power to capture the imagination or enliven the soul rather it provides a way forward i have written this book with the firm conviction that clearing away myths will reveal a new american jewish religion whose vitality and diversity far exceed the ability of any institution to contain or any rabbi to define i offer these pages in the hope they will serve as the beginning of a conversation
8885712 the church finds you guilty of providing sanctuary for the ordination of this womanpriest you are hereby excommunicated from the catholic church and separated forever from the earthly body of christ
8885713 as a punishment for your actions the church will cease all interfaith dialogue and ecumenical outreach with the jews of the world until you have apologized
8885714 the church has already declared that it alone is the one true faith effectively eliminating any common ground for engagement and dialogue with non catholics are you proposing that the church will do this once more simply in order to spite me
8885715 is there no punishment the church can mete out that will adequately permit her to express her displeasure with you
8885716 there certainly is monsignor you could ordain her as a priest that has to work within an organization as crazy as the church
8885717 it cannot be forgotten that the church teaches as an absolutely fundamental truth of christian anthropology the equal personal dignity of men and women and the necessity of overcoming and doing away with every type of discrimination regarding fundamental rights gaudium et spes 29 it is in the light of this truth that one can seek to understand better the teaching that women cannot receive priestly ordination a correct theology can prescind neither from one nor from the other of these doctrines but must hold the two together only thus will it be able to deepen our comprehension of gods plan regarding woman and regarding the priesthood and hence regarding the mission of woman in the church if however perhaps by allowing oneself to be conditioned too much by the ways and spirit of the age one should assert that a contradiction exists between these two truths the way of progress in the intelligence of the faith would be lost
8885718 i declare that the church has no authority emphasis added whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women and that this judgment is to be definitively held by all the churchs faithful
8885719 cubani che sono nella maggior parte dei casi frustrati alienati e senza speranze mentre le nuove generazioni demotivate non sentono lo stesso impegno delle precedenti con questo socialismo povero e senza prospettive molto lontano dalle loro attese
8885720 weve been analysing their financial statements and business environment to find out whether there will be any synergy
8885721 the value of a possible deal will not be greater than two billion dollars
8885722 teacher this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery now in the law moses commanded us to stone such women so what do you say
8885723 let the one among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her
8885724 neither do i condemn you go and from now on do not sin any more
8885725 es como si te dan un caramelo y luego te lo quitan
8885726 nos reconocieron que hace un a o s nos la habr an dado
8885727 5 avisa a pocas personas de que te has vuelto as tendr s tiempo de ponerte al d a
8885728 driving the r8 is like smearing honey into keira knightly
8885729 in principle this car is too fast for my thoughts
8885730 america our work will not be easy the challenges we face require tough choices and democrats as well as republicans will need to cast off the worn out ideas and politics of the past
8885731 you think about everything from campaign finance to immigration and on and theres john mccain working across party lines senator obama doesnt have a record now he can make the claim and he can hold himself up as pure and trying to reach to a new generation of post partisan politics but he has to do so largely based on rhetoric and wishful thinking because he doesnt have the record
8885732 there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically
8885733 obama might have a similar bottom line core principles for which in some sense he is willing to die if so we dont know what they are nothing so far in his life approaches mccains decision to refuse repatriation as a pow so as to deny his jailors a propaganda coup in fact there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically thats why his reversal on campaign financing and his transparently false justification of it matter more than similar acts by mccain
8885734 hes pretty much a conventional liberal on the issues and has few examples of breaking with his own party so how does obama try to pull off being post partisan
8885735 his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
8885736 boren the lone democrat in oklahomas congressional delegate said that while obama has talked about working with republicans unfortunately his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
8885737 the record shows obama to be a fairly doctrinaire liberal democrat
8885738 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8885739 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8885740 for a couple of days theyve been saying you voted to raise taxes something like 94 times that seems to be the drumbeat thats going to happen during this campaign are you going to raise taxes in a big way for average americans
8885741 i mean this is the standard fare of politics and the truth of the matter is that the only bills that i voted for for the most part since ive been in the senate were introduced by republicans with george bush you know they were the majority for a big chunk of the time i was there
8885742 finally the obama people are too convinced that they can define mccain as bush iii the case is just factually inaccurate mccain will be able to pull out dozens of instances from torture to global warming to spending in which he broke with his party as rush limbaugh will tell you
8885743 as we now know nearly four years later mccain was dead on in his analysis of what went wrong in iraq
8885744 in early november 2003 at a time when fred dalton thompson was playing a tough d a on law and order john mccain was cross examining donald rumsfeld for real on capitol hill it was still very early into the u s occupation of iraq but the as yet unacknowledged by rummy that is insurgency was already out of control alone among his fellow gop senators mccain blasted rumsfeld for not putting enough u s troops on the ground and for resorting too soon to iraqification that is transferring security to ill prepared iraqi forces in an extraordinarily blunt speech at the council on foreign relations that grim autumn mccain warned that ultimately iraq could become another vietnam if we lose popular support in the united states the next day the secretary of defense asked mccain to breakfast i read y our speech harrumphed rumsfeld that must have been an enjoyable experience for him mccain later joked to me then rummy patiently explained to his fellow republican why he and his top civilian brass paul wolfowitz doug feith and the usual crowd of incompetents would continue to do things the same way they believed there was no need for additional troops mccain later related mccain had already realized that rumsfeld was a lost cause the real question the senator suggested to me back then was whether george w bush himself would push rummy to make changes id like to see the president fully engaged mccain said bush needed to be on top of more details of whats going on as we now know nearly four years later mccain was dead on in his analysis of what went wrong in iraq right down to the need for bush to get engaged and fire rumsfeld mccain was so right that among military experts today the emerging conventional wisdom about bushs current surg e is that if it had occurred back then when mccain wanted it and the political will existed in this country to support it for the necessary number of years it might well have succeeded
8885745 widely acknowledged to have charted a course independent of bush
8885746 on global warming mccain is widely acknowledged to have charted a course independent of bush immediately after the 2004 election in which he stumped for bushs re election he sharply distanced himself from bush on climate change calling the administrations stance terribly disappointing mccain had co sponsored a bill with sen joe lieberman to curb greenhouse gases in 2003 bush had opposed any such move citing possible harm to the economy and doubts over global warming
8885747 he said that our economy has made great progress under this president he said that the fundamentals of the e conomy are strong
8885748 the second and third quotes the obama campaign uses from mccain are more misleading the ad shows mccain saying t heres been great progress economically the quote comes from an interview mccain did with peter cook at bloomberg television in april mccain was making a case for what he believed were positive economic developments during bushs time in office however the fuller quote shows mccain was saying that whatever progress had been made it wouldnt be enough to comfort families facing these tremendous economic challenges his comments overall are pessimistic he cites challenging times and enormous difficulties the obama campaign distorts his views by using just a snippet of his remarks
8885749 im going to ask you a version of the ronald reagan question you think if americans were asked are you better off today than you were before george bush took office more than seven years ago what answer would they give
8885750 certainly in this time we are in very challenging times
8885751 i think if you look at the overall record and millions of jobs have been created et cetera et cetera yo u could make an argument that theres been great progress economically over that period of time but thats no comfort thats no comfort to families now that are facing these tremendous economic challenges but let me just add peter the fundamentals of americas economy are strong were the greatest exporter the greatest importer the greatest innovator the greatest producer still the greatest economic engine in the world and by the way exports and free trade are a key element in economic recovery but these are tough times tough times and nobody knows that more than american families including in small towns of pennsylvania they havent lost their fundamental religious beliefs their respect for the constitution their right to bear arms they are still keep america as a beacon of hope and freedom throughout the world
8885752 he knows how to twist with the best of them
8885753 although obama gets substantial mileage out of running against politics as usual he provided a reminder on friday that he knows how to twist with the best of them
8885754 now many of these plans will cost money which is why ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow but i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet twenty first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy
8885755 i do not make a promise that we can reduce the budget deficit by 2013
8885756 i do not make a promise that we can reduce it by 2013 because i think it is important for us to make some critical investments right now in americas families obama told reporters this week when asked if hed match mccains pledge
8885757 since winning the nomination obama reportedly has been moving toward the middle of the political spectrum but on the budget he still sounds left of center with no interest in eliminating deficit spending
8885758 frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years
8885759 barack obama says john mccains plan to balance the budget doesnt add up easy for him to say its not a goal hes even trying to reach not only does obama say he wont eliminate the deficit in his first term as mccain aims to do he frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years considering his own spending plans
8885760 obama has rhetorically committed to a pay as you go approach by offsetting new spending and tax cuts with new taxes or spending cuts but his proposals do not come close to meeting this standard
8885761 has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of
8885762 the obama campaign responds that tax cuts once enacted are usually renewed and do not expire therefore they say obama can legitimately claim to be recouping money for other purposes by scaling back the tax cuts obama has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of what he wants to do
8885763 both obama and clinton promised to not raise taxes on those making less than 200 000 or 250 000 a year
8885764 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8885765 the latest additions to sen barack obamas energy plan outlined during an appearance in lansing monday may win the democratic presidential candidate some votes from disgruntled consumers in november but theyll do nothing to answer the nations long term needs
8885766 when his presumptive republican opponent sen john mccain r ariz proposed a gas tax holiday as a way to reduce the high cost of driving mr obama showed political courage and intellectual honesty by refusing to sign on to that obvious gimmick its an idea to get them through an election mr obama said now he has two such gimmicks of his own
8885767 the politics may have changed but the facts havent the accuracy of sen mccains original position has not changed offshore drilling would not lower gas prices today it would not lower gas prices next year and it would not lower gas prices five years from now
8885768 i think john mccains proposal for a three month tax holiday is a bad idea
8885769 in this campaign john mccain is offering the same old gimmicks that will provide almost no short term relief to folks who are struggling with high gas prices gimmicks that will only increase our addiction for another four years
8885770 that might make sense in washington but it doesnt make sense for america in fact it makes about as much sense as his proposal to build 45 new nuclear reactors without a plan to store the waste some place other than guess where right here in nevada at yucca mountain
8885771 democratic presidential candidate barack obamas proposal for a windfall profits tax on oil companies could cost 15 billion a year at last years profit levels a campaign adviser said
8885772 obama may levy 15 billion tax on oil company profit
8885773 but to add a five year tax increase on top of that to pay for a one year gift to voters would indeed increase the cost of doing business that cost would be passed along in forgone investment in new production lower dividends for pension funds and other shareholders and higher prices at the pump thus socking it to the consumers whom the plan is supposed to help if oil prices fall there might be no windfall profits to tax then the obama rebate would have to be paid for through spending cuts taxes on something else or borrowing
8885774 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families
8885775 what obama voted for was a budget resolution that would have allowed most of the provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts to expire in particular the resolution would allow the 25 percent tax bracket to return to its pre 2001 level of 28 percent that bracket kicks in at 32 550 for an individual or 65 100 for a married couple but as those of you who have filled out a 1040 know thats not actually how income taxes work we dont pay taxes on our total earnings we pay them based on our taxable income the urban brookings tax policy centers eric toder told factcheck org that people with taxable income of 32 000 would have a total income greater than that in 2008 anyone filing taxes with single status would be entitled to a standar d deduction of 5 450 as well as a personal exemption of 3 500 so to have a taxable income high enough to reach the 25 percent bracket an individual would need to earn at least 41 500 in total income while a married couple would need a combined income of at least 83 000
8885776 certainly obamas votes indicate a willingness to raise taxes and obama has not been shy about saying explicitly that he will raise some taxes
8885777 campaign aides to senator obama today called the charge that he voted for tax hikes on people making only 32 000 a year quote bogus they circulated an analysis stating that the resolution that obama had voted for would not have increase taxes on single taxpayer making less than 41 500 a year in total income
8885778 vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year
8885779 det er noget rod det kom meget bag p os vi er i gang med at finde alternativer l sninger
8885780 man kan ikke tale om at kun marketing folk kan marketing carlsbergs tidligere topchef poul svanholm var jurist og han traf beslutninger om nogle af de bedste brand kampagner vi har set herhjemme men der er selvf lgelig nogle faremomenter den kreative evne til at se hollistisk p udviklingen blandt forbrugere og p markedet er vigtig n r det drejer sig om marketing desuden er udvikling af brands en meget langsigtet proces mens salg typisk bygger p mere kortsigtede taktiske indsatser derfor er det centralt at en salgs og marketingdirekt r har forst elsen for at balancere disse ting rigtigt ellers kan man f et problem som brand drevet organisation
8885781 jeg vil bestemt ikke blive overrasket hvis vi sr flere danske banker komme i problemer ligesom roskilde bank og banktrelleborg
8885782 efter g ldseftergivelserne samt opdateringen af strategien og under hensyntagen til perioden med svigtende salg
8885783 driving the r8 is like smearing honey into keira knightly
8885784 in principle this car is too fast for my thoughts
8885785 passing of the budget will mean that all developments which were waiting for funding including the popular fertilizer subsidy program and procurement of the much needed drugs for the countrys state hospitals will now start
8885786 we are supporting a plan where the idea is to increase the number of israelis in the workforce
8885787 we want to create a situation where there is no interest in hiring palestinian workers instead of israeli ones
8885788 in my opinion this will likely extend to other sectors as well not just construction
8885789 es war toll hier neben tony kanaan auf dem podium ganz oben zu stehen hoffentlich gelingt uns diesmal was hnliches
8885790 berholen ist hier sehr schwierig auf jedem stra enkurs ist berholen nicht einfach aber hier ist es nicht so dass man mit einem rad in den kies kommt und weiterfahren kann oder einfach in die wiese abfliegt wenn man zu weit raus ger t hier wartet die wand auf dich es gibt keine auslaufzonen viele unf lle resultieren daraus indem man hier zu viel versucht
8885791 die einzige m glichkeit wo man abgesehen von berholman vern positionen gutmachen kann ist die boxenstrategie indem man treibstoff spart oder bei den boxenstopps selbst ich denke dass viele von uns sich auf die strategie als die sauberste form der berholman ver verlassen werden
8885792 schon vor meinem ersten rennen hier ein lauf der formel renault 2002 fuhr ich auf diesem kurs am computer eau rouge ist wahrscheinlich die tollste kurve der formel 1
8885793 spa francorchamps ist eine der wenigen strecken auf denen du etwas sp rst wenn du mit vollgas den berg hinauf jagst und in den wald hinein dann f hlst du die strecke unter dir das ist eine der sch nsten herausforderungen in der formel 1
8885794 ich vermisse sie nicht aber es ist schade dass es sie nicht mehr gibt
8885795 ich mag die historischen rennstrecken wie monza silverstone und monaco
8885796 immer wenn ich auf diesen kursen fahre sp re ich die geschichte und genie e den charakter dieser strecken
8885797 immer wenn ich auf diesen kursen fahre sp re ich die geschichte und genie e den charakter dieser strecken mit jeder modernisierung verlieren sie ein kleines st ck ihrer eigenheiten aber dadurch werden sie sicherer und wir k nnen weiter auf diesen strecken fahren es ist also ein guter kompromiss
8885798 wenn es um spa geht spricht jeder ber eau rouge doch noch schwieriger ist pouhon eine bergab f hrende linkskurve die wir mit rund 260 km h durchfahren
8885799 wir fahren hier fast vollgas und es ist nicht einfach die richtige balance zu finden mit der du attackieren kannst ohne abzufliegen wir fahrer m gen das hochgeschwindigkeitskurven in denen man fast vollgas f hrt hier wird es wirklich spannend denn hier kommt es ganz auf fahrerisches k nnen an
8885800 spa ist sehr lang hat eine hohe durchschnittsgeschwindigkeit und ist nicht ganz ungef hrlich
8885801 spa ist sehr lang hat eine hohe durchschnittsgeschwindigkeit und ist nicht ganz ungef hrlich f r uns fahrer bedeutet das zus tzlichen nervenkitzel du f hrst mit hohem tempo auf einer eher schmalen strecke das ist fast wie ein stadtkurs zwischen b umen da die strecke so lang ist wird es schwierig eine gute runde zusammen zu bekommen
8885802 das wichtigste hier ist mut du musst in den kurven schneller fahren als es dein kopf dir sagt du musst das gaspedal durchtreten auch wenn es dir unm glich erscheint du musst deinen instinkten vertrauen und keinen gedanken an m gliche gefahren verschwenden das nenne ich eine echte fahrerstrecke
8885803 wir werden nichts auslassen um unsere leistungsf higkeit und zuverl ssigkeit weiter zu steigern
8885804 es gab ein paar kleinere modifikationen an der aerodynamik viele kleine details aber nichts das sofort ins auge f llt au erdem berarbeiten wir unsere systeme um fehlerquellen auszuschlie en beide weltmeisterschaften bleiben bis zum saisonende hart umk mpft und wir werden nichts auslassen um unsere leistungsf higkeit und zuverl ssigkeit weiter zu steigern
8885805 auch physisch werden die beiden n chsten rennen ausschlaggebend jeder im team muss alles daf r geben dass es keine unliebsamen zwischenf lle gibt und wir f r die darauf folgenden berseerennen eine gute ausgangsbasis haben
8885806 die ber sieben kilometer lange strecke von spa francorchamps ist die l ngste im formel 1 kalender und nach monza wo wir eine woche sp ter antreten werden die mit der zweith chsten durchschnittsgeschwindigkeit aller grand prix kurse
8885807 die motoren werden auf diesen beiden strecken der h chsten belastung in der saison ausgesetzt
8885808 die motoren werden auf diesen beiden strecken der h chsten belastung in der saison ausgesetzt die l ngste vollgaspassage f hrt von eau rouge bergauf bis les combes ist rund 1 900 meter lang und dauert knapp 24 sekunden zus tzlich gibt es einen zweiten langen volllastabschnitt von 1 600 metern zwischen den kurven 14 und 18 wo 21 sekunden mit vollgas gefahren wird
8885809 neben den langen geraden auf denen h chstgeschwindigkeiten bis zu etwa 320 km h erzielt werden hat spa alles was einen kurs interessant und anspruchsvoll macht von lang gezogenen anspruchsvollen kurven wie pouhon und stavelot bis hin zur engen haarnadel la source die mit nur 70 km h durchfahren wird
8885810 bei der abstimmung m ssen fahrer und ingenieure diese ganz unterschiedlichen abschnitte ber cksichtigen das wetter spielt hier den teams oft streiche und wenn es regnet dann nicht unbedingt berall auf der langen strecke spa ist w rde es eine abstimmung unter den fahrern geben bestimmt die strecke die am meisten zuspruch f nde
8885811 vom nachwuchskader ist s bastien buemi der einzige der sich berechtigte hoffnungen auf ein formel 1 cockpit machen darf der rest des kaders ist von der formel 1 noch zu weit weg
8885812 vom speed und der einstellung her gibt es an buemi nichts auszusetzen
8885813 after a few days the village chief afukaka kuikuro took me out to the remains of an earthen wall
8885814 what we find is that what we think of as the primitive amazon forest is not so primitive after all
8885815 european colonialism wasted huge numbers of native peoples and cleared them off the land so that the forest returned
8885816 we were disappointed not to find a smoking gun that would explain the common association between obesity and asthma
8885817 however this research points us to other possibilities that future research should examine
8885818 we hypothesized that the low grade systemic inflammation present in obesity would augment the inflammation of asthma a synergistic effect
8885819 or alternatively that the inflammation of obesity might affect the airways independently an additive effect perhaps resulting in mixed airway inflammation
8885820 what we found was that although inflammatory cells and other biomarkers of inflammation were increased there was no significant interaction demonstrated between obesity and asthma
8885821 this does not change the fact that there is a well established link between asthma and obesity sometimes a negative result is important and the results add to our body of knowledge regarding the obesity asthma link now we need to look in other directions for the answers
8885822 we did not look at this in our patients given that asthma is immunologically driven this is a potential avenue for further research
8885823 alternatively it may be that dynamic changes in lung function that occur with episodes of asthma are different with excess body weight
8885824 to our knowledge this is the first report of a direct association between childhood abuse and asthma and asthma related outcomes
8885825 we wanted to explore whether exposure to stress and violence is associated with an increased risk of asthma in urban children living in puerto rico
8885826 we already know that there is a high prevalence of asthma in puerto rican children and many studies have linked stress and exposure to violence to health problems in childhood including asthma
8885827 children with a history of abuse had higher frequencies of all outcomes of interest than those without a history of abuse
8885828 after adjusting for relevant covariates history of abuse was associated with an approximate doubling of the odds of current asthma healthcare use for asthma and allergic rhinitis
8885829 it is not simply the exposure to a particular stressor but the physiological response to that stressor that predicts physical health outcomes
8885830 latino culture places an emphasis on certain values and social supports that may buffer the effects of poverty and community violence experienced by children in puerto rico
8885831 smoking during pregnancy is a double edged sword with respect to sids
8885832 not only does it raise a mothers likelihood of having a preterm baby who is already among the most vulnerable to sids but it increases the infants susceptibility to sids even further
8885833 preterm babies are known to have increased breathing difficulties in proportion to their prematurity and cigarette smoke is known to increase apneas in full term babies
8885834 but until now cigarette smoke exposure and preterm birth have not been investigated together with respect to their potential effects on respiratory dysfunction
8885835 our study shows that preterm infants make incomplete and or delayed recovery from interruptions in breathing
8885836 this has clear implications for their risk of sids but there is even still another reason for concern even after the risk of sids has passed inability or delayed recovery from repeated low oxygen episodes can also be detrimental to brain development there is increasing evidence that infants exposed to prenatal cigarette smoke are at high risk for developmental and behavioral disorders
8885837 if present at all was very small and statistically non significant and may simply be a healthy user artifact that they were unable to identify
8885838 while such a reduction in all cause mortality would have been impressive these mortality benefits are likely implausible previous studies were likely measuring a benefit not directly attributable to the vaccine itself but something specific to the individuals who were vaccinated a healthy user benefit or frailty bias
8885839 over the last two decades in the united sates even while vaccination rates among the elderly have increased from 15 to 65 percent there has been no commensurate decrease in hospital admissions or all cause mortality further only about 10 percent of winter time deaths in the united states are attributable to influenza thus to suggest that the vaccine can reduce 50 percent of deaths from all causes is implausible in our opinion
8885840 the healthy user effect is seen in what doctors often refer to as their good patients patients who are well informed about their health who exercise regularly do not smoke or have quit drink only in moderation watch what they eat come in regularly for health maintenance visits and disease screenings take their medications exactly as prescribed and quite religiously get vaccinated each year so as to stay healthy such attributes are almost impossible to capture in large scale studies using administrative databases
8885841 but you also need to take care of yourself everyone can reduce their risk by taking simple precautions
8885842 wash your hands avoid sick kids and hospitals during flu season consider antiviral agents for prophylaxis and tell your doctor as soon as you feel unwell because there is still a chance to decrease symptoms and prevent hospitalization if you get sick because flu vaccine is not as effective as people have been thinking it is

8885845 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point

8885848 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting his fellow worldwide celebrities refused to consider any smear or attack off limits
8885849 these comparisons are outrageous and offensive and have no place in the political process we hope that will offer a similar condemnation as his allies increasingly practice sleazy
8885850 better yet put me in office make me your vice president hillary hated on you so that b is irrelevant
8885851 yeah i said it cause bush is mentally handicapped ball up all of his speeches and just throw em like candy wrap
8885852 as rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear
8885853 it would be nice if i could have my daughters listen to their music without me worrying they were getting bad images of themselves

8885858 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves

8885871 the notable fuel efficiency of boeings 777 combined with the airplanes extensive range and large cargo capacity is something egyptair values highly in this competitive environment
8885872 as a new member of the star alliance we look forward to increasing our connectivity across the globe and bringing our passengers the utmost in cabin comfort and service with a dynamic new business class layout that will debut on the 777 300er
8885873 wed like to congratulate egyptair on its order and acquisition of boeing 777 300ers and on the airlines induction into the star alliance
8885874 the 777s operational performance with its significant savings in fuel and maintenance costs will have a positive impact on egyptairs growth plans and help the airline achieve greater profitability
8885875 theyre pretty angry because they really feel theyve been left in the lurch by a government thats stopped communicating
8885876 theres no cause for them to be opposing it because this was part of propositions they put to us
8885877 the issue of generation is always the one that has attracted the most heat within the labor party
8885878 we are in the process of talking to the government theyve not indicated one way or the other how theyre dealing with us
8885879 we always worry a little bit but we think our arguments are pretty strong
8885880 the following problem is a quite fundamental problem in robotics
8885881 we think that if we can embed these cues in control systems we can make following more reliable
8885882 historically it has been uneconomical for companies to transport bulky waste plastic to a recycling company but shredded plastic is easier to deal with and so is more valuable thats why our investment in the shredder means it now makes economic as well as environmental sense to recycle all types of plastic
8885883 we are thrilled with the purchase of this new plant we have become renowned for our expertise with electronic waste and increasingly companies are asking us about tackling other materials rather than sending it to increasingly clogged landfill sites

8885885 but what got thrown out of the slink helicopter this week
8885886 i only knew jim for the time he worked with us but found him to be a man of utmost integrity and honour which is rare these days
8885887 he was a lovely person who led the airline in a calm unassuming and considered way i know jim thoroughly enjoyed the job the company and in particular the people he worked with he will be sorely missed and our thoughts and best wishes are with his family at this difficult time
8885888 for me i feel kiss is the perfect band as a musician a performer and an entertainer
8885889 it allows you to let loose and be whoever you want to be
8885890 its almost like when superman would put on the cape or batman would put on the mask in some ways it gives you the ability to take on a character or a persona of whatever you have inside of you or how you want to perform
8885891 we had our show we had our levitating platform we had our bombs we had our costumes and we had our kiss logo
8885892 kiss would always perform on time period and would always deliver the goods
8885893 its always supposed to be the greatest show on earth and an over the top presentation i get it because i was a fan once you saw them you were hooked because they really gave you a visual presentation not just the music
8885894 it was a really awkward time for me it was mixed emotions i was really excited but i also felt really bad
8885895 kiss in my opinion took it to the next level
8885896 when i was a kid i would run home from school put on kiss alive and think to myself one day one day ill rock the world with one of the best drummers in rock n roll from one on the hottest bands in the land kiss
8885897 like in all things in life never say never and anythings possible
8885898 but i think it would be really hard to replace gene or paul nobody can forget nor will we forget the original four guys its because of them that i am talking about kiss to you today but bands change and bands evolve
8885899 i dont say this to kiss anyones ass but to me theres only one paul stanley you could never find somebody who can do what paul does not only is he the voice of kiss and as a frontman pauls going to go down in history as one of the best frontmen of all time of rock hes one of the few guys whose done it with a guitar strapped around his neck the whole time
8885900 im sure there will be more kiss touring in the future
8885901 after the success we had this year it makes perfect sense to keep going out and do this again
8885902 its a chance for me to play some cool songs with my friends i played in my fathers band which was american songbook like cole porter and gershwin and all those standards as well as big band and swing id never played in a cover band we play songs by deep purple zeppelin sabbath kiss and queen i like having chuck because he can sing he likes to do the m torhead and i dont have to tell you what a great guy he is hes a bandmate and a real friend
8885903 i dont think its involves any deep seated policy differences
8885904 im told of around 150 changes many involve references to northern ireland being changed to the north
8885905 basically once a document is passed by the executive then thats it it should be put out in that form
8885906 ultimately it could go to the courts but i think its more a case of symbolising the bad relations there are at the moment

8885911 i am going to explain our position not to the opposition parties since they know it very well but for the listeners of darik radio bulgaria is going to aim for the following at the european council on monday first the eu must have a very clear common stand we must show russia that such behavior is completely unacceptable for the dialogue between the european countries and russia third it is very important that the eu and the us categorically show physical presence in georgia and support for the country by sending a special envoy which is the bulgarian initiative in the eu it must become evident that the eu and georgias partners are present we need to display strong and real support the eu must also create mechanisms to prevent the expansion of the conflict and the spread out of similar situations in the other former soviet union republics and we must find as quickly as possible ways to conduct negotiations to reestablish georgias sovereignty
8885912 this cannot happen but something else might no one including russia should believe that they can make decisions for other countries georgia is a sovereign independent country and their desire to become a nato member must be fully supported by bulgaria as we are doing right now

8885924 prayer is the contemplation of the facts of life from the highest point of view it is the soliloquy of a beholding and jubilant soul it is the spirit of god pronouncing his works good but prayer as a means to effect a private end is meanness and theft it supposes dualism and not unity in nature and consciousness as soon as the man is at one with god he will not beg he will then see prayer in all action
8885925 everything else being equal if you are happy and satisfied with your life now you are more likely to be healthy in the future

8885930 there is also a possibility that karadzic will plead not guilty to all 11 counts as well as say that he is proud of what he did

8885937 and if thats so if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
8885938 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8885939 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
8885940 it seems like an easy solution in reality it turns out that its not always so
8885941 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president
8885942 it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8885943 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8885944 we try and keep our industry out of politics and into marketing opportunities but sometimes its very difficult to separate the two

8886014 costello is undeniably the liberal partys best political asset now that howard has gone which is why so much turns on whether he recovers the will to serve which so clearly and understandably wavered in the aftermath of the election mr abbott wrote in

8886018 uit eigen ervaring weet ik hoe belangrijk de steun van de 12de man kan zijn mijn mooiste moment op het wk 1986 was ongetwijfeld de winnende penalty in de kwartfinale tegen spanje maar qua kippenvel scoorde de legendarische ontvangst door tienduizenden supporters op de grote markt van brussel even hoog toen geert smets begin dit jaar onder de noemer the legends zeven oud strijders van het wk 86 samenbracht voor de tofste ploeg voelde ik direct aan dat we met dat legends concept iets moesten doen voor de rode duivels christian reniers en ikzelf zaten snel op dezelfde golflengte en begin april stapten we met het we believe concept naar de kbvb
8886019 ook de kbvb en de main sponsors waren meteen mee met het concept
8886020 zij beseffen beter dan wie ook dat de steun van de 12de man cruciaal is om de rode duivels mee op weg te zetten voor een geslaagde wk campagne belgi estland op zaterdag 6 september wordt een eerste testcase we believe lanceert een hele serie initiatieven om die avond een helse sfeer te cre ren in sclessin een eerste initiatief is area12 onder die noemer verzamelen we in een voorbehouden supportersvak alle fans die door dik en dun achter de rode duivels staan area 12 moet de kern worden van de red devils fan club deels ge nspireerd door het succes van supportersclub oranje opgericht in 1995 en vandaag 60 000 oranjeleden sterk toots aan de aftrap en omdat voetbal anno 2008 een totaalspektakel is zocht en vond we believe een kippenvelmoment nog voor het eerste fluitsignaal believer toots thielemans d belgische legend par excellence componeerde voor de wk 2010 campagne een heel persoonlijke versie van de braban onne authentiek en pakkend

8886022 de start van de wk 2010 campagne is h t moment voor iedereen om onze rode duivels steun en vertrouwen te geven alle beschikbare mediamiddelen worden ingezet om dit project te lanceren dankzij de spontane steun van het communicatie en pr bureau de fotograaf de legends toots hebben we deze unieke campagne die meteen ook onze main sponsors een extra return oplevert kunnen realiseren we hebben er alle vertrouwen in we believe

8886226 we expect to see this kind of behavior in myanmar not in denver colorado at a national political convention where a reporter is trying to videotape big money donors trying to meet with elected officials
8886227 it was worth taking the time to go through the pilot process to really do it right
8886228 the movie tries to cover every side and cater to just about every possible ideological objection an effort at comprehensiveness that seems noble and a little nutty
8886229 this movie tries to blur the line between action thriller and a probing drama the result is a confused and unsatisfying experience with some nice moments that dont amount to much
8886230 tells a good snakelike story slithering in some unpredictable directions
8886231 its sharply funny moments make its lack of consistency all the more evident the movie ends up feeling like a collection of moments rather than a coherent quirky comedy
8886232 it all adds up to the kind of bad family entertainment likely to raise only a few eyebrows
8886233 theres a long long sequence in which a chorus of gay men sings
8886234 having a facility where larger and more expensive projects can be produced
8886235 the use of such a derogatory term by a major film studio will serve to increase its acceptability in public discourse
8886236 could it be that one of the movies messages is that slurs like that are unacceptable
8886237 bd live is not a niche product we see mass adoption of the technology
8886238 wearing an ipod a simple yet powerful symbol of personal freedom provides olympic athletes with an acceptable way to make a statement about the repressive atmosphere of the games and express support for free expression
8886239 these appointments represent a major step in creating and expanding universals on the ground presence in france
8886240 we are disappointed about yis absence more so because he is from guangzhou
8886241 but as only one nba china games are held per year in china i do not think it will affect the passion of the audience or broadcasters
8886242 no negative impact has been seen yet from yus absence
8886243 the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third and we are
8886244 is that because of the writers strike a lot of high profile american films that might have been available just arent going to be ready in time
8886245 jason is a massive muppets fan and is seen as the man to finally bring the muppet show back to tv
8886246 it will obviously have all its old fans but jasons comedy is hugely popular with youngsters so it will open it up to a whole new audience
8886247 if the movie script is popular jason will write the tv series too
8886248 i dont mind it ageing a bit i love my gray hair i love the fact that my face has more of an edge and more character than it did when i was in my 20s or 30s no botox for me

8886252 im planning to run for governor of alabama i have to live there for seven years i bought my house there last year i have homes in arizona and pennsylvania but alabama needs more help
8886253 i figured a good first step in my preparation would be finding out what facebook is so ive started this page if anyone has any questions id be happy to answer them as best i can if anyone has any comments im glad to listen
8886254 i have a fairly specific idea of what the first 15 pages of the screenplay will be and no idea what will happen on pages 16 through 130 i have very strong feelings about the internet and its effect on our national culture but frankly those feelings are being countered by the sophistication kindness curiosity and wit of the posts in this site
8886255 a balloon and a plastic bag containing a small amount of heroin and cocaine
8886256 i was told initially she was a little uncooperative but then she was fine
8886257 it the criticism just doesnt make sense to me either the moment i read the screenplay i knew it was an important story and as its a true tale of heroic resistance to one of the great villains of history i cant imagine that people wont want to see it
8886258 you dont wait around in a hot rental market like this as ghoulish as it sounds people will rent that place in a heartbeat
8886259 they went so the kids could be together theyre all really close friends and once a year a big group of them go to hawaii
8886260 hit me harder if you hit me in the liver ill actually vomit right in the nose right in the nose oh man im getting my ass kicked
8886261 i want to amp this up a little bit lets hook a car battery up to my nipples
8886262 im not the one that is so lost that i need to use my relationship with lindsay to earn a living
8886263 shes lohan gone from making 7 million to less than a million a movie
8886264 whos out of control i go to church i go and help people in rehab thats control how can she say im out of control
8886265 i want lindsay to be in a good place when i started looking at what samantha was doing dragging lindsay to clubs drinking around lindsay samantha is one of the biggest problems in her life
8886266 thats what dina told me im reacting on what dina said but then dina steps out of the picture because she wants to look like the good guy
8886267 dinas a two face she wants to try to look good and stay on lindsays good side instead of being a good parent i dont give two hoots about my relationship with lindsay as a friend one day shes going to turn around to me and tell me daddy you were right
8886268 owen likes it so much there that he made an offer on a home
8886269 i m really so happy for deanna and jesse i am really honoured that they ve asked me and i can t wait to be a part of their big day
8886270 they were devastated so we closed the set immediately as people were trying to come to terms with the tragedy
8886271 im so thankful that my midwife and doctor paid such wonderful attention to me and the little ladies and im really glad that i got to 36 weeks with multiples
8886272 i thought the next thing to do would be to make a sculpture of the person who is the ideal beauty of the moment but even kate moss doesnt live up to the image
8886273 he is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible
8886274 i am not the reason that he has no contact with his daughter i feel no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him
8886275 im not the one that is so lost that i need to use my relationship with lindsay to earn a living i am always will and always have been here for her for her not for anything else so i think its safe to say that there is not now and never will be a tell all written by me when does your book come out mr lohan
8886276 i couldnt do what brad and angie are doing i wouldnt have the patience or dedication you need to take care of a family i admire those qualities in other people but its not for me
8886277 im doing exactly what i want to i hang out with the same friends i spend time in italy and then i go back to work i try not to worry about anything else
8886278 even though ive been married for eight years i do separate my food in the refrigerator from my wifes
8886279 i put labels on it that say this is wills leftover chicken or whatever and if you touch it yeah i get livid
8886280 one of the big misconceptions about me is that i walk around in miniskirts and high heels 24 seven and go to the gym in heels
8886281 when people see me dressed normally they cant believe it its really weird
8886282 shes that side of me that was afraid of rejection that was afraid to take a chance and step up and have someone say no you dont get the role
8886283 i do still have that side of me that soft sensitive side and i think that carmen is the more aggressive part of me there are moments when i am so that little girl from cincinnati ohio and i cry and im just like everybody else
8886284 it makes me more proud im sure if it was for some kind of independent brand that wasnt as iconic as calvin klein i dont think i would have done it because thats too much of a risk
8886285 but when its calvin klein and its fashion photographer steve meisel shooting you and you get to be a part of this amazing iconic brand and their legacy you just kind of go for it
8886286 ive shut up about this long enough shes using my daughter people never even knew who samantha ronson was until she met lindsay she was just some los angeles dj and now shes writing a book i am at my wits end with this stuff this is not in lindsays best interest
8886287 i want him to stop hurting and talking to the media about the people i love
8886288 madonna sets very high standards for herself and for those working around her so when things go wrong she gets annoyed
8886289 with so many friends in the audience it was doubly annoying for her
8886290 its called vacanze di natale which means christmas vacation its not in english so they dubbed my lines into italian
8886291 it was great i didnt have to like talk to anybody on the set i was just in my own little world and i had a great time by myself
8886292 lowther castle uninhabited since 1935 became the centre for weapon development
8886293 i regard the failure to use this tank as the greatest blunder of the whole war the course of history might have been changed immeasurably for the better had it been properly employed
8886294 we had a weapon which could have been employed we had a weapon which would enabled us to occupy the whole of germany before the russians got there we did not use it and you can see the result today
8886295 while a marked slowdown in activity is likely over the next 18 months even if interest rates are cut the correct policy decisions are still needed to ward off the threat of a serious and prolonged recession

8886341 the initial week would be full of motivational speakers and the last week would be exams and presentations on the work theyd been doing in the term that is where wed hope to get parents more involved too
8886342 also starting in june youd get that double whammy effect with effectively two starts

8886348 the issue of lost delayed or damaged luggage is a regular feature of the work of holidaytravelwatch the manner in which this client was treated was shoddy to say the least regretably delay fudge and frustration is all the consumer can look forward to on this important issue the international rules that govern these problems are complex and have practical difficulties of implementation given that luggage is an integral part of the package holiday arrangement the eu commission and uk government must review these rules and determine a clearer route for consumers through any amended package travel directive or international treaty

8886359 the year 1996 represented the tenth year of our study of the heterosexual transmission of hiv in which he enrolled individuals infected with hiv or who had aids along with their opposite
8886360 a prospective phase of the study began in 1990 after entry serodiscordant couples who remained together were seen every 6 months for an interview covering the interval since the last visit and a physical examination with the same laboratory tests described above we followed 175 hiv discordant couples over time for a total of approximately 282 couple years of follow up table 3 we observed no sero conversions after entry into the study
8886361 we followed up 175 hiv discordant couples one partner tests positive one negative over time for a total of approximately 282 couple years of follow up
8886362 no transmission of hiv occurred among the 25 of couples who did not use their condoms consistently nor among the 47 couples who intermittently practiced unsafe
8886363 we observed no seroconversions after entry into the study nobody became hiv positive this evidence argues for low infectivity in the absence of either needle sharing and or other cofactors
8886364 at present there is no recognized standard for establishing the presence or absence of antibodies to hiv 1 and hiv 2 in human blood
8886365 the risk of an asymptomatic not chronically ill person with a repeatedly reactive positive serum sample developing aids or an aids related condition is not known
8886366 first it was in the interests of aids researchers in developed countries where hiv seemed stubbornly confined to msms idus and their partners to present aids in africa as a heterosexual epidemic
8886367 second there may have been an inclination to emphasize sexual transmission as an argument for condom promotion coinciding with pre existing programmes and efforts to curb africas rapid population growth
8886368 third the role of sexual promiscuity in the spread of aids in africa appears to have evolved in part out of prior assumptions about the sexuality of africans
8886369 i am not responsible for the actions of your reps who go around lying in the country side
8886370 its pointless arguing with idiots because they drag you down to their level and then beat you with experience
8886371 arvs have been indisputably proven to reduce the hiv viral load and boost the immune function cd4 count
8886372 a paper published in 2006 in the lancet reported the results of a large study that tracked 22 000 hiv positive people between 1995 and 2003
8886373 the whole dianialist movement is based on stompies of information taken out of context and extrapolated into self serving extravagant lies
8886374 primary infection was defined as a confirmed positive virologic test result with either a negative hiv antibody assay result or an indeterminate western blot because there is no virologic gold standard we assumed that levels of plasma hiv rna had a sensitivity of 100 for diagnosing primary infection
8886375 at present there is no recognized standard for establishing the presence and absence of hiv 1 antibody in human blood
8886376 the evaluation of the sensitivity and specificity of pcr for the diagnosis of hiv infection in infants is particularly difficult because there is no reference or gold standard test that determines unequivocally the true infection status of the patient
8886377 a meta analytic evaluation of the polymerase chain reaction for the diagnosis of hiv infection in infants
8886378 whenever possible studies of the performance of a diagnostic test should use reference tests that unequivocally establish the true state of disease or health the lack of an appropriate reference test substantially complicates evaluation
8886379 before 2000 is of course still true today and the epidemiology supports it
8886380 there is no single scientific paper that proves hiv causes aids instead there are tens of thousands of papers containing a wide range of evidence that taken together make the case overwhelming
8886381 assuming your stories are true you have to bear in mind that the meds are designed around surrogate markers and treat them which does not mean that theyre holding off a virus
8886382 since in the usa 75 of these individuals are thriving without the meds and since population figures in africa belie the claim that there is a population depleting epidemic there and since 75 million americans did not contract the disease by 1995 as predicted on oprah and since there are no studies that have directly observed a significant level of sexual transmissibility of the purported virus
8886383 duesberg would argue that the virus is present but is harmless montagnier
8886384 dodgy procedures and toxic drugs are identified and removed from the system as speedily as possible
8886385 you dont believe hiv causes aids cmon over here you
8886386 hey that guy willingly shot a load of hiv into his veins that means he has clearly shown hiv is harmless how fantastic the nightmares over yeah
8886387 that guy is a dangerous psychopath and even if hes not hes at best a duuuuuuuuuuuuumb motherfucker
8886388 that guy has proved nothing many doctors and nurses never became hiv after an accident with an infected needle
8886389 the mortality rate was 56 3 deaths per 1000 patient years for hiv positive men and 6 1 deaths per 1000 patient years for hiv negative men
8886390 43 196 21 9 people that were hiv positive at the time of entering the study died median cd4 count at last sampling prior to death 90 cells
8886391 i invited zoe to discuss how the specificity and or sensitivity of the studies was established
8886392 a few hints about the problem with the thailand numbers the demographics of the positives and the negatives were different the positives coming from the much poorer north there was a high rate of seroreversion which is supposed to be impossible for hiv and mortality among the positives was comparable to others from the same demographic group
8886393 primary infection was defined as a confirmed positive virologic test result with either a negative hiv antibody assay result or an indeterminate western blot because there is no virologic gold standard we assumed that levels of plasma hiv rna had a sensitivity of 100 for diagnosing primary infection
8886394 at present there is no recognized standard for establishing the presence and absence of hiv 1 antibody in human blood
8886395 the evaluation of the sensitivity and specificity of pcr for the diagnosis of hiv infection in infants is particularly difficult because there is no reference or gold standard test that determines unequivocally the true infection status of the patient
8886396 a meta analytic evaluation of the polymerase chain reaction for the diagnosis of hiv infection in infants
8886397 whenever possible studies of the performance of a diagnostic test should use reference tests that unequivocally establish the true state of disease or health the lack of an appropriate reference test substantially complicates evaluation
8886398 polymerase chain reaction for the diagnosis of hiv infection in adults a meta analysis with recommendations for clinical practice and study design
8886399 moreover the sensitivities and specificities of pcr and culture for the detection of hiv 1 appear to be equivalent and both methods are superior to testing for hiv 1 antigen in serum for the direct detection of hiv 1
8886400 can i scream censorship like deniers do on the aetiology blog
8886401 counseling people at low risk wealthy white well fed non drug abusing heterosexual requires paying particular attention to false positives that is to the possibility that the client has a positive hiv test even though he or she is not infected with the virus if clients are not informed about this fact they tend to believe that a positive test means that they are infected with absolute certainty emotional pain and lives can be saved if counselors inform the clients about the possibility of false positives
8886402 a gold standard is 100 sensitive and specific as a matter of definition
8886403 hundreds of thousands of papers published on hiv in the past 20 years establishing hiv as the cause of aids
8886404 there are three kinds of lies lies damned lies and statistics
8886405 a gold standard is 100 sensitive and specific as a matter of definition
8886406 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 detected in all of 409 seropositive symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals and none of the 131 seronegatives
8886407 never been purified using a particular technique from 1973 no you are not allowed to use any modern techniques in virology or biochemistry and ill decide what is pure enough

8886464 at vauxhall motors and workington we should have won in addition to the games we have won against farsley and solihull if justice had been done we would have 13 points as well
8886465 the worst thing is the players know that if we can cut out the silly errors then we can do something about it

8886467 from what i have heard of southport every one of their games has been a hard fought battle with them getting a win or a draw out of it

8886499 vor vier jahren stand ich vor euch und habe euch meine geschichte erz hlt von der kurzen verbindung zwischen einem jungen mann aus kenia und einer jungen frau aus kansas die nicht wohlhabend oder bekannt waren aber den glauben teilten dass ihr sohn in amerika alles erreichen kann was immer er auch vorhat es ist diese verhei ung die dieses land immer zu einem besonderen gemacht hat dass durch harte arbeit und opfer jeder von uns seine pers nlichen tr ume wahr machen kann dass wir aber dabei immer noch als eine amerikanische familie zusammenkommen um sicherzustellen dass die n chste generation ihre tr ume ebenfalls verfolgen kann das ist der grund warum ich heute abend hier stehe weil 232 jahre lang gew hnliche m nner und frauen studenten und soldaten bauern und lehrer krankenschwestern und hausmeister immer den mut gefunden haben die verhei ung am leben zu erhalten wann immer sie gef hrdet war wir sind in einem dieser entscheidenden momente zusammengekommen einem moment in dem unsere nation im krieg ist unsere wirtschaft in aufruhr und in dem die amerikanische verhei ung einmal mehr bedroht ist heute abend sind mehr amerikaner ohne arbeit und mehr arbeiten h rter f r weniger lohn mehr von euch haben ihr haus verloren und mehr beobachten wie der wert ihres hauses abst rzt mehr von euch haben autos die ihr euch nicht mehr leisten k nnt kreditkartenabrechnungen die ihr nicht mehr bezahlen k nnt und schulgeld das nicht mehr in eurer reichweite liegt diese herausforderungen sind nicht alle auf die regierung zur ckzuf hren aber das versagen darauf zu antworten ist ein direktes ergebnis der kaputten politik in washington und der gescheiterten pr sidentschaft von george w bush amerika wir sind besser als diese letzten acht jahre wir sind ein besseres land als das
8886500 dieser moment diese wahl ist unsere chance um die amerikanische verhei ung im 21 jahrhundert lebendig zu halten n chste woche in minnesota wird die gleiche partei die euch zwei amtszeiten von george bush und dick cheney gebracht hat dieses land um eine dritte amtszeit bitten und wir sind hier weil wir dieses land zu sehr lieben um zuzulassen dass die n chsten vier jahren genauso aussehen wie die letzten acht am 4 november m ssen wir aufstehen und sagen acht sind genug lasst uns an einer sache nicht zweifeln der nominierte republikaner john mccain hat die uniform unseres landes mit tapferkeit und auszeichnung getragen und deswegen schulden wir ihm unsere dankbarkeit und respekt und n chste woche werden wir auch von anl ssen h ren bei denen er mit seiner partei gebrochen hat als beweis dass er f r den wechsel sorgen kann den wir brauchen aber die bilanz ist deutlich john mccain hat zu 90 prozent der zeit mit george bush gestimmt senator mccain spricht gern ber urteilskraft aber was sagt dies wirklich ber urteilskraft aus wenn man glaubt dass george bush zu mehr als 90 prozent der zeit richtig lag ich wei nicht wie es euch geht aber ich bin nicht bereit mich auf eine zehnprozentige chance f r den wechsel einzulassen
8886501 wir messen die st rke unserer wirtschaft nicht an der zahl der milliard re
8886502 ihr seht wir demokraten haben einen ganz anderen ma stab f r fortschritt in diesem land wir messen fortschritt daran wie viele leute einen job finden k nnen mit dem sie ihre hypotheken zahlen k nnen ob man am ende des monats ein bisschen geld zur seite legen kann damit man eines tages erleben kann dass das eigene kind sein diplom macht wir messen fortschritt an den 23 millionen neuen jobs die geschaffen wurden als bill clinton pr sident war als die amerikanische durchschnittsfamilie erlebte wie ihr einkommen um 7 500 dollar gestiegen ist anstatt um 2 000 dollar zu sinken wie es unter george bush gewesen ist wir messen die st rke unserer wirtschaft nicht an der zahl der milliard re die wir haben oder an den gewinnen im fortune 500 sondern daran ob jemand mit einer guten idee das wagnis aufnehmen und eine firma gr nden kann oder ob die kellnerin die von trinkgeldern lebt einen tag frei nehmen kann um nach einem kranken kind zu sehen ohne ihren arbeitsplatz zu verlieren eine gleichberechtigung schwarz und wei wechsel bedeutet ein steuerrecht das nicht die lobbyisten belohnt die es geschrieben haben sondern die amerikanischen arbeiter und kleinen unternehmen die es verdienen anders als john mccain will ich die steuerk rzungen f r konzerne beenden die unsere arbeitspl tze nach bersee auslagern und ich werde damit anfangen sie an firmen zu geben die hier in amerika gute jobs schaffen ich werde die kapitalertragssteuern f r kleinunternehmen und startups abschaffen welche die gut bezahlten high tech jobs von morgen schaffen ich werde die steuern k rzen f r 95 prozent aller arbeiterfamilien weil es in einer wirtschaft wie dieser das letzte sein sollte die steuern f r die mittelschicht zu erh hen und um unserer wirtschaft und unserer sicherheit und der zukunft unseres planeten willen will ich ein klares ziel als pr sident setzen in zehn jahren werden wir endlich unsere abh ngigkeit von l aus dem nahen osten beenden washington spricht seit 30 jahren von unserer abh ngigkeit vom l und john mccain ist 26 jahre davon da gewesen in dieser zeit hat er nein gesagt zu h heren standards f r die kraftstoffeffizienz von autos nein zu investitionen in erneuerbare energien nein zu erneuerbaren kraftstoffen und heute importieren wir dreimal so viel l wie an dem tag als senator mccain ins amt gekommen ist nun ist es an der zeit diese abh ngigkeit zu beenden und einzusehen dass lbohrungen eine notl sung sind keine langfristige l sung weit gefehlt als pr sident werde ich unsere erdgasreserven anzapfen in saubere kohlentechnik investieren und wege finden um die atomkraft sicher zu nutzen ich werde unseren automobilfirmen bei der umr stung helfen damit die kraftstoffeffizienten autos der zukunft hier in amerika gebaut werden ich werde es f r die amerikaner einfacher machen sich diese neuen autos leisten zu k nnen und ich werde im n chsten jahrzehnt 150 milliarden dollar in erschwingliche erneuerbare energiequellen investieren windenergie und solarenergie und die n chste generation von biokraftstoffen eine investition die zu neuen branchen und f nf millionen neuen arbeitspl tzen f hrt welche gut bezahlt sind nie ausgelagert werden k nnen

8886504 do you think its a valid argument that a john mccain administration would be a four year extension of the bush administration
8886505 sure but i think thats whats going to happen with obama too
8886506 they want more troops in afghanistan they want to send more support to georgia to protect the oil line there neither one says bring home the troops from iraq from the bases you know the bases are going to stay there the embassy as big as the vatican thats going to remain so their foreign policies are exactly the same theyre both very very aggressive with iran so i would say theres no difference
8886507 how would you handle these global threats then if its not to send our troops there and make sure that were protected
8886508 why are we on the borders of russia provoking the russians i mean the georgians initiated the military attack against these enclaves where there were mostly russians its the fact that were over there that we create these crises
8886509 isnt it part of our duty though to support these fledgling democracies that ask for our help
8886510 we should endorse the principle but not send troops and money once we get over there we just aggravate the situation
8886511 we bombed serbia in order for kosovo to become independent
8886512 now the russians are doing the same thing its this total inconsistency
8886513 bitte erkl ren sie mir warum die csu diesen volkswirtschaftlichen betriebswirtschaftlichen kologischen und sozialen widersinn mit betrieben hat

8886515 aus ihren polemisch formulierten formulierungen die allesamt von der linkspartei stammen k nnten entnehme ich dass sie sich bisher wenig mit der sozialdemokratischen politik der bayern spd besch ftigt haben
8886516 leider ist es mir nicht m glich die vielzahl von fragen pers nlich zu beantworten da nur mandatstr gern ein eigenes b ro f r ffentlichkeitsarbeit zur verf gung steht
8886517 warum lassen sie sich berhaupt als kandidatin f r die landtagswahl nominieren wenn ihnen der w hler v llig egal ist wie sie hier deutlich zum ausdruck gebracht haben
8886518 mit verlaub diese begr ndung kann mich in keinster weise berzeugen und l sst mich an ihrer glaubw rdigkeit zweifeln
8886519 i dont think theres anything to announce yet but i know that that is under discussion
8886520 there is a building in zemonekozi a settlement to the south of tskhinval that was fiercely defended by a georgian special operations squad upon clearing the building russian peacekeepers recovered among other documents an american passport in the name of michael lee white of texas
8886521 i do not know why he was there but it is a fact that he was in the building among georgian special forces troops
8886522 we have serious reasons to believe that american citizens were right at the heart of the military action

8886526 a convoy of russian tanks left gori but is not heading to tbilisi
8886527 id like to calm everybody down the russian military is not advancing towards the capital

8886535 peters made his decision that he did not seek the leadership of the party he told reporters
8886536 as ive said before id be very happy if he changes his mind thats his business
8886537 what dr nelson was referring to is that he would be very happy for mr costello to stay on in parliament the spokesman said
8886538 costello is undeniably the liberal partys best political asset now that howard has gone which is why so much turns on whether he recovers the will to serve which so clearly and understandably wavered in the aftermath of the election mr abbott wrote in
8886539 nobody ever objects when people say nice things about them he said
8886540 its very nice of tony to say nice things about me and i appreciate it very much hes an old friend of mine and i thank him

8886557 the market is currently going through a difficult time there does appear to be a link to the credit crunch making the consumer feel poorer
8886558 however as we all know eggs is a cyclical market and it wouldnt surprise me if we see the sector pick up again as we move forward
8886559 we investigated opportunities that would allow us to make best use of our farms resources as well as our proximity to consumers
8886560 we spent more than a year carrying out extensive market research to confirm our targeted customers were interested in a branded organic milk with provenance
8886561 we invested significant time understanding and money in branding its development was supported by mdc now dairyco trademark registering the brand and images and installing our own modern processing unit
8886562 strong brand identity quality and consistency of taste are the key selling points on which were building reputation
8886563 we decided we would restock but to be more precise we planned to swap our black and whites for jerseys to provide an opportunity for an added value enterprise we were tired of supplying the mild cheddar and skimmed milk powder market
8886564 we sensed there were opportunities for real dairy ice cream the uk is awash with inferior commodity product made from vegetable oils so we went out to do our own market research visiting farmhouse ice cream parlours in different parts of the country
8886565 after finding support from our bank we agreed to go ahead and commit a budget towards processing and freezing equipment from rss hereford the investment was eligible for a 33 res grant we also set about converting a former forge into a parlour and developing a short farm walk to provide visitors with an additional attraction
8886566 we believe our success is based on providing a high quality product at a reasonable price which fits with what local customers believe to be an interesting and cost effective day out
8886567 we are seeing benefits on the same scale as those obtained by hospital programmes with good patient compliance

8886570 this research found that lymphoma families perceived that treatment experiences as far more arduous than that of other childhood haematological groups such as acute lymphatic leukaemia all
8886571 children diagnosed with all endure several years of treatment whilst the treatment protocol for the lymphoma population in comparatively short lasting about 6 to 9 months
8886572 the stress of treatment is further exacerbated when families have been relocated from rural areas to the metropolitan treatment centre there is simply no time to return home to reconnect with family and to relax in the comfort and privacy of their own home
8886573 in this largely unexplored area of paediatric oncology these findings underscore the need for diagnostic specific support services for patients and their families
8886574 the dramatic clinical results from this study of gleevec in the adjuvant gist setting are especially encouraging when we consider the incremental benefit we typically see with other adjuvant therapies for solid tumors

8886630 would be how can we disrupt the enemys motivation to fight other questions raised by controlling the mind how can we make people trust us more what if we could help the brain to remove fear or pain is there a way to make the enemy obey our commands as cognitive neuroscience and related technologies become more pervasive using technology for nefarious purposes becomes easier
8886631 the potential impact of neuroscience research is greater than previously thought
8886632 battlefield commanders of all nations hold sacrosanct the right to determine the applications
8886633 if governments or scientists were to try to develop a system to pre screen neuroscientific cognitive manipulators which would be hipaa approved and tested and robust in its core science success would be as likely as it was with mines and cluster bombs meaning not likely
8886634 the concept of torture could also be altered by products in this market it is possible that someday there could be a technique developed to extract information from a prisoner that does not have any lasting side effects
8886635 this kind of stuff is very important folks we need to become as informed about mind control projects as we are about 911 truth why because if they can manipulate your moods with rf frequencies then we could have already be suppressed heavily through its means right now
8886636 its a revolution of the mind of how people think and how machines can help people work better

8886640 its a synthesis of ideas now our intent is to home in on a few areas in which the labs can make a unique and profound contribution
8886641 what makes most sense is for sandia to select areas where we have unique collective technical strengths areas that few others in the world can do as well
8886642 these include such capabilities as high performance computing nanotech physics based modeling and simulation and surety
8886643 cs amp ts ambitious direction may not be realized for many decades but the information required for progress is emerging today
8886644 it is reasonable to expect future discoveries will become the nobel class achievements for the cognitive and neuroscience communities at large in the years to come
8886645 cognitive systems consist of technologies that utilize as an essential component one or more computational models of human cognitive processes or the knowledge of specific experts users or other individuals
8886646 once that happens the best of both worlds can happen
8886647 if we understand human cognition better we can work together as a nation to reduce tension find problems before they turn into armed conflict and to work toward actions that establish and maintain peace worldwide

8886652 it would be a remarkable achievement if we could get through to the last 16 three years in a row we feel we have a realistic chance
8886653 we cant spend 20m on our team let alone on one player as the man uniteds and chelseas do but we have proved in the past that we can match anyone in europe

8886672 its perfect matt puts in most of the money and andy can dj there and manage it when matt is off touring all the boys can relax their and bring their friends to jam
8886673 i think were just going to start by doing a couple of tracks no pressure the goal is to make something that they dig so much that everyone else can too

8886701 were travelling from edinburgh to ottawa via new york it was around 1 000 for the flights plus we had to pay for a night in a hotel
8886702 we tried to get a flight until 11pm last night then realised wed have to come back this morning
8886703 the other airlines are quoting 2 500 and we just cant do it
8886704 well have to cancel our trip but the canadians need to get home they are just going to have to pay out
8886705 we appreciate that airlines go bust but what i object to is that the authorities at the airport made no attempt to communicate with passengers
8886706 baa would have known about this in good time and they didnt let us know
8886707 we were here for 7am yesterday and were told at 5 30pm that zoom had gone under
8886708 we booked into a hotel and we were on the internet until 11 30pm trying to find flights
8886709 today ba are quoting 2 500 and bmi only have business class seats left
8886710 it seems that weve been left with no help from anybody
8886711 its a desperate situation it was to be a holiday of a lifetime
8886712 we would remind passengers intending due to travel with zoom airlines in the coming days that all of the airlines flights have now been cancelled
8886713 anyone planning to fly from glasgow with zoom should not travel to the airport unless they have made alternative travel arrangements
8886714 nhs lothian indicated that there is clinical evidence in the form of better clinical outcomes for patients for retaining the integrated colorectal surgery service at the western general hospital rather than moving it as planned to the royal infirmary of edinburgh
8886715 i understand that the boards decision was based on clinical advice that it would be beneficial to retain cancer related services together at the western general and also on the conclusion that medical staff rotas could be made compliant with the european working time directive
8886716 since it appears that retaining the integrated colorectal surgery service at the western general has no negative impact on patients and is justified by the clinical evidence i support the boards decision
8886717 i congratulate the health minister for putting clinical analysis before party political agendas retaining this service at the western will mean better patient care more lives saved and better use of nhs resources
8886718 to say we are disappointed at the decision is an understatement
8886719 the clinical delivery of this service is primary and we believe st johns should have been considered for that
8886720 this takes no account of the residents wishes there are no good reasons for any trees to be removed in the grassmarket
8886721 poplars are not considered the tree of choice by many arboricultural experts but the people who live here like these trees and want to keep them they give the grassmarket character and should be left alone
8886722 there is a very vocal minority of people who do not want to see the trees replaced it can be a very emotive issue and people do get very attached to the trees
8886723 the problem is no one can say how much life the trees have in them they could go tomorrow or they could last another 20 years the expert opinion is they probably dont have a long time left
8886724 its a very hard decision there are potential safety issues there is money in the kitty at the moment to pay for the project but there may not be in a few years time
8886725 most of us are quite happy about it we realise its better to replace the trees now this way it will cost 6000 a piece whereas it could cost 18 000 if we wait for ten years
8886726 the trees put in in april have already grown several feet now
8886727 our biologists and independent tree surgeons have looked at the trees and found that internally they are in a state of decay theyre not going to last more than a few years and will need to be replaced anyway
8886728 the new ones will be mature trees although they will not be exactly the same
8886729 if someone is queuing up at the post office every week to get their benefits it implies they dont have a bank account and the same goes for bill payments
8886730 when you are going to cause a great deal of inconvenience and difficulty to the people who are the most vulnerable in society you need to think again
8886731 the very least they should do is organise some alternative facility even once a week would help
8886732 ive got emphysema and spondilitis and i have to use a walking frame
8886733 all these people are going to be descending on bonnyrigg is it going to be like wimbledon with us having to camp out in tents in the queue
8886734 further cuts to the network risk leaving many vulnerable older people socially isolated and struggling to access essential services
8886735 a lot of people use the post office to get their pension and benefits not just because its close but because its a social hub and they meet a lot of friends there
8886736 the uk government has made it quite clear we need to return the post office network back into profit and they have already made the decision that 2500 post offices across the uk have to close
8886737 post office ltd is following strict access criteria laid down by the uk government where in urban areas 99 per cent of the population should be within a mile of a post office
8886738 part of the consultation which is currently running for six weeks is to hear from customers on any issues they may have on how they will be disadvantaged in accessing alternative services
8886739 we are committed to a greater visible police presence deterring crime and reassuring our citizens this welcome increase in the number of officers is in part the result of our direct recruitment of new officers over and above the recruitment plans of our police forces
8886740 we have set out plans to deliver a more visible policing presence on scotlands streets and make an additional 1000 officers available in our communities
8886741 we are not just delivering on this but going substantially beyond by also looking at recruitment retention and redeployment
8886742 last year as we promised 150 officers were recruited and paid for by the scottish government and are currently working in scotlands communities
8886743 this year we are directly funding the recruitment of another 450 over and above forces previous plans
8886744 we inherited the lowest recruitment since devolution with many officers due to retire weve tackled that challenge head on and although these latest figures are reassuring there remains much work to be done but we are confident the resources and policies now in place will deliver improved policing for scotland
8886745 although the proposal contains some technical shortfalls these are acceptable in the context of maintaining and rebuilding the historic urban grain and finding a new use for the building
8886746 this is a missed opportunity as far as im concerned
8886747 what we need in leith are things to keep people here and make them want to come in the first place
8886748 the main source of income in future years for this area will be tourism with all the big liners coming in but this building is the golden egg and we risk throwing that away
8886749 last time it was a bit of a response to a financial crisis but this time they have looked at it very strongly in terms of educational benefit and good rationale
8886750 the reality is that pupil population moves around and we are often left with schools that are basically in the wrong place
8886751 if a school becomes too old fashioned and there are small pupil numbers then the youngsters in that school will not be getting as good an education provision as youngsters elsewhere
8886752 the council has looked at this very carefully and identified the schools against a set of criteria
8886753 once it was closed we went back and asked those who fiercely opposed closure and they said that in fact it was the right thing to do
8886754 i think theyre using sneaky tactics because they are clearly going to close more schools
8886755 i believe theyre doing it in phases so they dont cause a big outcry
8886756 they are doing a small amount at a time so were not going to get a united front like we did last year
8886757 they do seem to be trying to listen to local people probably trying to persuade people that this is in their interest which is something they should have done all along in some cases theres not many people left to fight for the schools
8886758 schools with very small rolls struggle to provide the kind of extracurricular activities that children need to help them flourish as they develop during these crucial early years
8886759 i understand the real attachment that parents feel towards a school that has been part of a community for a long time but the painful truth is that there has been a fall of nearly 6000 primary aged children over the last ten years in edinburgh
8886760 we also have the issue that within certain areas of the city the school rolls are very variable as parents vote with their feet when they choose a school for their child
8886761 you dont really direct the fringe you just cling on to it and hope to be there at the end
8886762 i dont think we can afford to wait for a new director to be in place i would ideally like to see decisions being made about the box office before christmas and i would be surprised if we had a new director in place by then
8886763 everyone is agreed that this is one of the top priorities for the fringe we have to run a central box office and we have to get it right
8886764 the fringe office has been very self serving in recent years and i do not think it has engaged with the venues in the way it needs to
8886765 there are serious issues that need to be addressed chiefly financial the cost to the performer is going up the cost to the public is going up and yet these costs are not been met with increased revenue
8886766 from my perspective the main problem was the lack of communication the fringe is all about collaboration and open discussion but jon chose to be a more distant figure than his predecessors not returning calls and refusing to engage
8886767 the new director will have to be a real leader in order to take it forward
8886768 the cost of putting a show into the programme is one area they could look at bringing down
8886769 the council needs to start putting proper funding into the fringe in order to make this happen it brings in 75 million a year to the local economy and investing in it would make sound business sense as it could enable it to grow and bring in 80m or 90m a year
8886770 the role of director is not a creative role and they do not need a creative person they need to be a brilliant administrator and someone who can engage with the local council
8886771 like most of the festival it could no doubt make a case for more funding
8886772 all of the cities festivals have an international reputation that is the envy of the world and we want to help them go from strength to strength if that means we need review our funding then there is nothing to stop us doing that
8886773 there have been a lot of issues for the fringe to deal with this year not just the box office there has also been the impact of the weather and the olympic games and all of that needs to be taken into account
8886774 given all that i dont think it has been too bad a year for the fringe and i dont think it needs to change too much the fringe itself needs to beware of becoming too bureaucratic what makes it so special is that anarchic quality which means you are never sure what you are going to get
8886775 when it came to boston one year we went to dinner and dancing however most years are simple hopefully like this year we will start with mass i am taking the day off from work even though the fall garden tilling is calling so who knows what may happen
8886776 and you my child shall be called the prophet of the most high for you will go before the lord to prepare his way
8886777 thats not our business its not our business to build a cpu were a visual computing company and i think the reason weve survived the other 35 companies who were making graphics at the start is that weve stayed focused
8886778 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8886779 we were contacted by the radisson when he turned up there and we advised them to give him the rooms
8886780 it was then just a matter of picking him at the hotel because we had been alerted so early
8886781 checkin is proving a big success since it was launched in april as an early warning system
8886782 ich kann diese negativ berichterstattung in der krone nicht mehr lesen manchmal glaub ich fast hinter der krone stecken die amis die unbedingt europa schw chen wollen
8886783 subtile und kritische hinterfragung der zeitung aber warum soll sich die krone selbst beschimpfen lassen
8886784 the problem is if they are not returned its not really working as an exchange and they end up in our streets and parks and if someone comes into contact with them they dont know what they could catch
8886785 it is a double edged sword because it is important that clean needles are being used but there has to be something in place to say to them if you dont give back all the needles we will only give you half as many next time
8886786 its important to protect both the drug user and the general public who shouldnt have to come across used needles
8886787 our needle exchange initiatives are provided by spittal street clinic community pharmacies and the needle exchange outreach network neon
8886788 neon has been extremely successful particularly in musselburgh where it has a 100 per cent return rate we actively encourage all patients to return needles in the boxes which we provide
8886789 there is an incredible warmth for the building and what it has delivered for generations of people
8886790 there is a genuine will to see the kings restored to its former glory

8886799 it is the lower end that is seeing the biggest drop the tourists that visit a place and stay in a limited service hotel are probably the first to be affected by the credit crunch the business traveller or those staying in a higher standard of hotel will tend to have the money to do so
8886800 guys coming for a stag weekend will probably think about staying at home
8886801 weve obviously had a miserable period of weather and there appears to be a decline in ticket volumes at the fringe so it seems likely there will be a continuation it is turning out to be the more difficult year we expected when the first effects of the credit crunch were being seen
8886802 edinburgh has a higher base to fall so that can make the drop sharper it also has more of a reliance on the corporate and banking sectors and people are drawing costs in
8886803 some holiday business from the united states and japan in particular is down but there are big companies here like rbs and hbos and both have been hit by the credit crunch and they will both be cutting costs

8886818 it is a great honour to be awarded a benefit season to play at a club like this for fifteen years to be capped and now to get a benefit is fantastic
8886819 i grew up watching all of the famous capped yorkshire players on television and i played with a lot of famous players when i started at the club so to get a benefit now myself and follow in their footsteps is a really great feeling
8886820 anthony has been an outstanding servant to the club and fully deserves to be recognised with a benefit season next year
8886821 he is a tremendous player and popular with members supporters and his fellow professionals i wish him every success in his benefit season which i am sure will be extremely well supported

8886871 a person can be a drug and sam is a drug shes very controlling and manipulative and its not a healthy relationship for lindsay its not about sam giving lindsay drugs or alcohol or anything there are prescription drugs from doctors that have a serious effect on a person and i would like to put that out there these things can mess with a persons mind
8886872 i would sacrifice my own life to get sam out of lindsays
8886873 i told lindsay after she left the cirque lodge clinic that she needed to surround herself with good people when she got out and sam is definitely not that good person lindsay is fragile and sam takes advantage of her and the relationship is too intense and too dramatic
8886874 i see some parallels between britney and lindsay the instability the domineering companion lindsays not in the state that britney was or is but there are minor similarities just because a persons not abusing drugs or alcohol doesnt mean theyre healthy and lindsay being with sam is making matters worse

8886894 there are guys that people dont know that ive been in love with ive had secret lovers
8886895 i dont want to talk about it but i have definitely experienced abuse in a way that i would tell people to take their heart and run
8886896 i would walk down the school halls and hear people talking about me some of them would throw toilet paper at my house or throw eggs at my door
8886897 they would also write things on the sidewalk in permanent marker they really hated me
8886898 this is an incredibly significant motion when it is implemented alongside other motions we have passed on public transport systems it will make preston one of the greenest cities in britain
8886899 but the motion also puts us in line to be the first significant employer to recognise trade union environmental reps the unions will be important players if we are to tackle climate change it is only right that they and their members are given a recognised role in setting and implementing carbon emission targets
8886900 setting up a local power company is a realistic possibility it allows us to deal with issues associated with climate change and carbon emissions and at the same time allows us to provide cheap fuel for the people of preston some of whom are amongst the poorest in the country

8886925 we were educated by customers by what they wanted and we were educated by customers by what they used
8886926 while the majority of our voters like barack obama many are also supporting john mccain and the republicans
8886927 obamas record on reaching out to muslim community is actually not that impressive
8886928 but because he is committed to change the muslim american and south asian american communities as a whole are now beginning to believe that he is the person who could stand up for us
8886929 i dont think chinese voters are ready for a black president
8886930 i even talked to a chinese american delegate here at the democratic convention and she admitted that if she had a choice she wouldnt be here in the end she will vote for mccain
8886931 while it is partially true that many chinese voters dont like obama because he is black the young chinese voters like him a lot
8886932 they support him and they will surely vote for him
8886933 but what really opens the door for barack is michelle
8886934 but he needed to win the presumptive nomination and thats not happening in the south because most of blacks in the south are still leaning towards hillary clinton
8886935 making strong gains and people are going to vote for him

8886954 they were an excellent partner if zoom do not recover from this we will look for a replacement
8886955 it is a successful route we dont want to lose this route the priority is to get a replacement for toronto

8886963 im not seeking massive monetary benefits and i do not have grievances against the whole of the met an organisation that i dearly love and admire
8886964 my current case is essentially to do with my treatment at the highest levels of the met in particular the discrimination i have been subject to over a long period of time by the present commissioner sir ian blair
8886965 it is to do with the continuation of that treatment into the very important job i was doing as the co ordinator of the security and safety of the 2012 olympics
8886966 finally it is to do with the victimisation i have suffered since my grievances leaked to the media
8886967 the metropolitan police service will not at this time be commenting publicly in detail on the content of the assistant commissioners claims other than to say we do not accept the charges of discrimination against us and robustly challenge his allegations
8886968 we have only received them in the last few hours and i consider that if these proceedings have to go ahead there is a proper place for airing these matters and that is within the tribunal itself
8886969 we deeply regret that we have been forced to cease all zoom operations
8886970 it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff
8886971 we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a re financing package that would have kept our aircraft flying
8886972 only last year zoom airlines made profit but that turned into a loss in the last year due to the unprecedented increase in the price of aviation fuel and the economic climate
8886973 it takes nearly a year to send about 300 quintals of rice by road to humla
8886974 we do have a plan of action to tackle this scarcity in remote districts but it all depends on road conditions as supplying these stuffs by air is just too expensive
8886975 there is this misconception among the people that rice is the standard food compared to other food grains
8886976 they regard millet and barley as low quality food and prefer rice instead
8886977 there is an urgent need for investment in production seed and agriculture research promotion and commercialisation
8886978 for food security there is a need of crop diversification
8886979 fao aims to support the governments seed production system in the districts instead of transporting seeds there
8886980 while psp has been crying out for dual analogue stick support
8886981 the separation distance between the dualshock and psp is deceptively large requiring some kind of rigid usb connection ladder to hold things in place well that or a flexible cable creating a new problem youd need to mount the psp screen to keep it stable it would make sense for playing psp 3000 games on tv mind not through the lcd screen officially weve heard nothing so best to file this under the same category as the break apart wii style dualshock pad rumoured to appear at e3

8886996 if one of my daughters boyfriends turns out to be vegetarian i swear to god id never forgive them
8886997 my biggest nightmare would be if the kids ever came up to me and said dad im a vegetarian then i would sit them on the fence and electrocute them
8886998 i think its a case of live and let live i will talk to people about the advantages of vegetarianism and it will upset me if weve had a good conversation and they turn around and say something stupid
8886999 i just read a quote from gordon ramsay if my daughter ever grew up and married a vegetarian id never forgive her but even that i would forgive because its not my affair its not up to me if he talks stupid or not
8887000 id be happier if everyone was vegetarian the planet would be better off for it
8887001 although sales in russia are growing significantly russians are in fact only now starting to discover chrysler vehicles let me remind you that dodge brand was officially introduced in russia as recently as two years ago here at the moscow motor show
8887002 now every second car sold by us in russia is a dodge and i am sure that the new cars presented here in moscow will contribute even further to russians interest in our brands
8887003 we are becoming increasingly active outside north america in the past chrysler used to aim at niche segments offering cars that had been originally created for the american market
8887004 today outside of the u s we offer vehicles that were designed with consideration for varied market requirements around the world and that policy is paying dividends in terms of sales with russia in particular driving our international sales growth

8887009 wed no sooner started up in business than we realised we were going to need a lot more space we had people wanting to buy chocolates locally and the on line side of the business was just taking off but without working 24 hours a day we just couldnt produce enough to meet the demand
8887010 the bulk of our customers are in the uk but we are also sending out chocolates to customers in the united states germany and central europe and even as far as new zealand were becoming a global business largely because the visitors who come through our front door during the summer hail from all over the world they then go back home and tell others about our chocolates it emphasises how tourism can really help indigenous businesses
8887011 we have nothing but praise for hie and completely support their vision for a modern scotland
8887012 the move into our new building gives us the chance to show prospective franchisees the cocoa mountain concept we have had a number of requests to open a cocoa mountain that we havent followed up because we saw our previous premises as a pilot that preceded the real thing

8887040 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8887041 but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 per cent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
8887042 if john mccain wants a debate about who has the judgment and the temperament to be commander in chief then thats a debate im willing to have
8887043 john mccain likes to say he will follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8887044 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8887045 but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8887046 despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman
8887047 exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8887048 washingtons been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain took office
8887049 i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8887050 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day
8887051 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done

8887061 the afp has concluded its active inquiries although some long standing overseas inquiries are yet to be fully resolved the afp said in a statement
8887062 at the present time there is insufficient evidence to institute proceedings against dr haneef for any criminal offence
8887063 delighted at the news but wanted an apology from the government and as yet unspecified damages
8887064 we are ready to negotiate the terms of any apology and a damages settlement with the government so as to avoid the unnecessary expense and further angst of civil litigation mr hodgson said
8887065 a matter for further down the track after a federal government inquiry into the case
8887066 he still loves australia but no decision has been made about whether hell come back to australia and if so when
8887067 it is hard to know with the afp they dont deal with things with a straight bat he told the abc
8887068 so only time will tell but it would be comforting for him to know that the afp no longer regard him as a suspect in any wrongdoing in australia or elsewhere
8887069 the continued claims by mr keelty that dr haneef was a person of interest which is the police euphemism for a suspect has continued and exacerbated the damage to dr haneefs reputation that the unreasonable and unjustified actions of july 2 2007 had already caused he said
8887070 the long delayed admission by the afp that theres no basis for suggesting that dr haneef had committed any criminal offence must surely call into question mr keeltys tenure in his present position mr hodgson said
8887071 it also heightens the need for the clarke inquiry to be given royal commission powers and widened terms of reference so that the afps continued efforts over the last 13 months to destroy dr haneefs good name and reputation can also be investigated
8887072 whatever can be done to have him come back to this country should be done greens leader bob brown said
8887073 but you couldnt blame him if he didnt want to risk it a second time
8887074 the last government owes both him and his country an apology it should come from john howard senator brown said

8887145 innenministerin maria fekter hat nachgegeben und erf llt meine forderungen im asylbereich
8887146 deshalb werde ich mich daf r einsetzen dass hink nftig bereits nach anzeige durch die sicherheitsbeh rde an die staatsanwaltschaft und nicht erst nach anklageerhebung das asylverfahren beschleunigt durchgef hrt und ein ausweisungsverfahren eingeleitet wird
8887147 im bestehenden v lkerrechtlichen rahmen sind bestimmungen vorzusehen die die wiederaufnahme des asylverfahrens auch bei qualifizierten straftaten wie k rperverletzung diebstahl oder einbruch von amts wegen erfolgen es muss hier die m glichkeit geschaffen werden den asylberechtigtenstatus wieder abzuerkennen die legistische pr fung dieser notwendigkeit wurde von mir bereits in auftrag gegeben
8887148 die m glichkeit quartiere im jeweiligen bundesland f r asylwerber mit besonderem betreuungsbedarf zu schaffen liegt in der verantwortung des landes
8887149 vor dem hintergrund der geltenden rechtslage welche bereits ma gebliche sonderbestimmungen f r straff llige asylwerber vorsieht m chte ich nochmals betonen dass es nicht zu akzeptieren ist dass asylwerber die schutz vor verfolgung suchen gegen strafrechtliche bestimmung in sterreich versto en ich werde daher zus tzlich die oben angef hrten versch rfungen im asylrecht fordern und bin berzeugt damit auch im sinne der l nder zu handeln
8887150 fekter erf llt damit genau meine forderungen die abschiebung straff lliger asylwerber aus k rnten hat ihre wirkung gehabt
8887151 fekter muss nun wort halten und gemeinsam mit uns die versch rfungen im asylrecht umsetzen

8887154 k rnten und slowenien leben in frieden und freundschaft daran kann auch ein unverantwortlicher z ndler wie vouk nichts ndern
8887155 wer wie schmidt und vouk behaupten dass k rnten im rest von sterreich nicht ernst genommen wird dem kann ich nur sagen dass die einzigen die niemand ernst nimmt schmidt und vouk selber sind schmidt kommt gn digerhalber auf ein glas prosecco nach k rnten beschimpft das land und seine menschen fordert eine ortstafelschwemme und steigt dann wieder gl cklich und zufrieden in den flieger nach wien k rnten hat dem lif bereits dreimal eine klare abfuhr an der wahlurne gegeben frau schmidt bel stigen sie k rnten und seine menschen nicht noch einmal mit ihrer anwesenheit wenn es ihr ziel ist nur unfrieden zu stiften und das land schlecht zu machen

8887173 we hope to develop these techniques further and apply them to more volcanoes worldwide
8887174 potentially these techniques could extend our knowledge of volcanic recharge considerably as they can be applied to material erupted before volcanic monitoring was commonplace

8887176 scientists have identified a mutant form of a gene or allele that prohibits the growth of armour
8887177 by documenting the physical traits and genetic makeup of the offspring produced by these marine sticklebacks in freshwater we were able to track how natural selection operates on this gene
8887178 we found a significant increase in the frequency of this allele in their offspring evidence that natural selection favours reduced armour in freshwater
8887179 it leads us to believe that the genetic expression is also tied to increased growth rate
8887180 if the fish arent expending resources growing bones which may be significantly more difficult in freshwater due to its lack of ions they can devote more energy to increasing biomass
8887181 this in turn allows them to breed earlier and improves over winter survival rate

8887218 das monatelange njet der vp innenminister ist v llig unverst ndlich und unmenschlich
8887219 es braucht endlich ein rechtsstaatliches verfahren f r das bleiberecht in sterreich ich verstehe nicht warum sich die regierung weigert wenn es schlicht darum geht menschen die seit jahren in sterreich wohnen hier in die schule gehen und hier arbeiten in die sterreichische gesellschaft zu integrieren

8887232 ive always said that the greatest thing you can do with your life is to tell people about jesus and invite them to come to know him i was wrong there is one thing you can do greater than sharing jesus christ with somebody it is to help start a church because a church will outlast you and everyone else
8887233 when you plant a church you help to permanently solve the greatest global giant plaguing the world the giant of spiritual emptiness
8887234 this spiritual emptiness is the worlds number one problem i believe its the reason why the purpose driven life was the best selling book in the world for three years in a row people want to know the meaning of life they want to know the answer to lifes biggest questions like what am i here for why do i exist
8887235 just imagine you were one of those who had never heard the name of jesus wouldnt you want somebody to come tell you about our savior the bible says in romans 10 14 b

8887237 twenty seven years ago kay and i gathered five other people and we started saddleback church at the time none of us knew anything about planting a church some of the group members werent even christians when we started the church but just imagine all the lives that wouldnt be blessed if wed said no lets forget it let somebody else do it we started it and it grew in unbelievable ways saddleback church has helped start dozens of other churches here in southern california we start at least one a year god has used ordinary people to start these churches not pastors or missionaries just ordinary people

8887366 the separatist regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia and the russian authorities are cut off from reality
8887367 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory
8887368 the regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of russia they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear
8887369 soon there will be no north or south ossetia there will be a united alania as part of russia
8887370 this proposal will certainly win dalton mcguinty some green points but it also represents a hefty new energy tax
8887371 if renewable energy was affordable and efficient a government mandate to force people to buy it wouldnt be necessary
8887372 resource planning in the case of electricity generation ordinarily requires analyses of the benefits and costs of all available sources of electricity supply
8887373 yet the governments proposed power supply mix is largely based upon its fixation with abolishing coal fired power plants placing a ceiling on the amount of nuclear capacity and courting the green vote consumers would be far better served if market forces not government fiat were allowed to determine the best mix of electric generation capacity
8887374 government is ill equipped to micro manage the energy sectors
8887375 experience elsewhere has shown that deregulated markets yield a more affordable and reliable supply of energy

8887379 we have a few young players we just want to gel together and be happy here were focused on that for now
8887380 it was a good all round performance from us against a good doncasterside so were very happy with that
8887381 at sheffield united we got caught cold and conceded two early goals this time that happened to doncaster and they couldnt get back into the game which was exactly what happened to us at bramall lane
8887382 the rangers fans arent stupid they know a good player when they see one so its no surprise the fans have taken to them
8887383 it could have taken time for them to settle in a foreign country but theyve come in the boys here have helped them along the way played well and theyre going to be a great asset for us this season
8887384 its a hard shift on your own up front everyone knows that but if i can do the job of two people up there it allows people from midfield to get on the ball more and dictate the game
8887385 its for the team if we can win games with me playing up front on my own then so be it
8887386 its a tough position but i got great support from dani parejo emmanuel ledesma and lee cook so at times it was like we had three or four up front it wasnt like i was isolated
8887387 everyones in the team for their attributes some might be more creative than others and some might just be destroyers it all combines for the team performance

8887408 but rightly so because he can be like that if he wants to be hopefully hell go on and be a superstar hes got the potential to be one
8887409 i thought he was magnificent tonight and so exciting to watch players like that put bums on seats they fill a stadium
8887410 hes the type of player you do love to play with because you know theres going to be an end product from him
8887411 and you know when you give him the ball that hes going to do something special
8887412 the thing for him now is to keep his feet on the ground because hes still very young
8887413 but hopefully he can keep progressing the way he is
8887414 the skys the limit for him if he keeps going the way he is
8887415 its up to us older heads to keep his feet on the ground and to not let the praise and furore around him get to his head but hes not the kind of kid that will
8887416 hes the kind of kid that will want to keep improving
8887417 weve got a team set up to do what he wants basically but hes got to do his job coming back and to be fair he does
8887418 he got a bit of criticism recently after the defeat at sheffield united but hes taken that on board and hes produced the goods
8887419 i think the fans who came to watch us will have been very very pleased with his performance tonight
8887420 hes got no restraint on him at all hes just a young man who wants to go out and play football
8887421 hes a very gifted kid he pops up on places that hurt people he plays wide right but turns up in pockets where defenders dont want to go and pick him up and hes got a decent left peg his dead ball deliveries and shooting are very very good
8887422 there might be times this year when he starts to feel the pace but hes doing great and hes a lovely kid
8887423 it is a surprise how quickly he has settled in but from minute one hes let it be known that he wants to take corners penalties throw ins everything hes a very confident kid but hes lovable with it so you dont mind
8887424 weve had to tell him to calm down at times but he listens to you and i think hell be a very very good footballer

8887470 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day
8887471 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8887472 it wont make a lick of difference to struggling american families who john mccain chooses to be the next dick cheney if he continues to insist on being the next george bush
8887473 were pretty excited weve gotten off to a pretty good start
8887474 the biggest thing is impacting the health of the students we hear about the obesity epidemic so much in the news and perry county is number one in the state for the rate of diabetes so any impact that schools can have on that
8887475 they teachers see those children many more hours than what parents might actually see them being a role model teaching physical health and activity is very important
8887476 for our little district a very poor district were doing a lot to try and improve the health and wellness of not only kids but the community
8887477 kids today dont eat healthy enough and we arent active enough the schools are able to be a role model and provide healthy cafeteria choices and teachers are being more aware of the need for more physical activity
8887478 shes been so focused for a lot of her life and has known from a young age she wanted to do dentistry and focus on oral surgery
8887479 now im in the position where people come to me for advice and it is intimidating
8887480 it has been a time for a little growth and a confidence check but ive had that every step of the way
8887481 its something i was always interested in and i was working so hard that i didnt have time to think about it but now looking back it is kind of cool
8887482 ive had several women come to me and say they would never go into oral surgery before but saw me and thought they could ive had some people tell me i shouldnt be doing this because im a girl i never did this because i was a girl but because i liked it
8887483 when she said this is what she wanted to do we sat down and talked with her because we knew it would be a long up hill slope because shes a woman
8887484 some didnt like her and she was scrutinized very closely as a female
8887485 the ability that she has that is unique is that she can be so nice to the patients and professional at the same time she has excellent people skills
8887486 shes the kind of person that whatever she wants to do she will do it to the best of her ability
8887487 ive had the advantage that i knew this is what i wanted to do
8887488 you can look at my senior volleyball picture in the yearbook and underneath it it says i want to go into dentistry and be an oral surgeon not a lot of 18 year olds have that decided
8887489 it was great to have 200 to 300 people listen to me talk about this new technique and ask questions it was kind of unique to ohio state so im glad i could represent the university in that way
8887490 there is an unbelievable difference in health care between the two
8887491 theres just a difference in the way of thinking and experiences but the patients i think are also more appreciative
8887492 with economic times as they are all the private schools have been hit pretty hard attendance is down and with gas about 4 a gallon if you have to pay tuition thats the first thing to go when you can send your kid for free somewhere else
8887493 were trying to cut the fat from the budget so we dont have to close and we can keep things the way they are
8887494 quite honestly its costing them more money which doesnt make any sense in this economy thats a money drain
8887495 its an absolute auction theres no reserve meaning the highest bidder gets the property so that means you could get a really good deal
8887496 its a good opportunity for somebody looking for investment property its a great location close to 60 south interstate 70 and the downtown area theres so much potential in the area for anyone looking for a commercial location there could be apartment buildings or something with the art community
8887497 and secondly wed also like people to know about it because our local christian academy needs our help we want to keep them going
8887498 as long as we can cut some of the fat from the budget were in great shape other schools arent so lucky
8887499 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8887500 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8887501 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8887502 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8887503 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8887504 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8887505 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8887506 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8887507 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8887508 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
8887509 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8887510 they are really moving the dirt and have changed the landscape out there in the last few weeks
8887511 mark schaffer excavating of norwalk theyve got all of the grass and top soil removed
8887512 its a dramatic project for muskingum county and well get it done
8887513 there is a lot of dust a lot of activity out there right now but we still have to have the sanitary sewer capacity and the rail spur by the end of next year
8887514 were filling them with age appropriate items to make them feel more comfortable
8887515 i know about fear and grief and i just wanted to help them and hope that this project will continue
8887516 we were delighted to have such a young man show so much concern for the children of this county
8887517 we have some kits that we give the children when they first enter foster care that we receive through generous donations but these are very appreciated
8887518 john loves art and hes made sure thats all included
8887519 this is something thats never been done in this area
8887520 i know what loss is about after my grandfather died
8887521 i wanted to do something that he would have been proud of too
8887522 we found a company in newark that is making these dolls stuffed with rice that you put in a microwave heat and then give to a baby
8887523 it just shows that the people in this community are eager to come together and help each other
8887524 being in scouting has taught me life learning lessons like how to cook camp fish and first aid but i guess the best its taught me is that people out there really care and want to help
8887525 it really means that i have to get my troop together and we have to fill these bags
8887526 id also love it if my troop can keep this going
8887527 a little higher than we thought prices are definitely going up not going down

8887529 were inviting the public to come to the dillon falls bridge at 9 a m monday morning for the family fun kayak paddle down the licking and muskingum rivers
8887530 its a fun family thing and it will be a good opportunity to see the unique art when its done and view it from a different perspective
8887531 people can gather at the dillon falls bridge with canoes rowboats kayaks and anything that moves with green power
8887532 it should take about half an hour for them to arrive at the bridge then and at putnam landing around 9 30 a m or even before anybody can come out to help decorate the bridge ill be starting at the crack of dawn
8887533 the licking river can be low during the summer and the rain weve had should help too
8887534 i hope we have nice weather and the army corps of engineers releases enough water its an open invite and its not a race or a contest we invite everyone to join and enjoy nature
8887535 i look forward to the completion of the art installation and seeing the bridge decorated with red white and blue
8887536 its just for one day so people should come out to see it were not closing down the bridge its going to be along the sidewalk and its free the fun part is well be videoing taking photos and documenting it well fly over the bridge in the afternoon to take photos it will be interesting to talk to people about art labor and the y bridge
8887537 well have ballet dancers from the richard earley dance studio the girl scouts and anyone with a musical instrument is invited to come out and play

8887568 however it is our experience that individuals can have their lives wrecked by the publicity that follows on being outed to the public no matter how innocent they subsequently turn out to be
8887569 for now our focus is on the arrest process and who is likely to be arrested to be honest we are shocked that nearly four months after the passage of this new law the police are still claiming to have no view on what will get you arrested
8887570 they are trying to dismantle our basic human rights we cannot just sit here and take this we cannot just lie back and watch this ludicrous act slip in the back door
8887571 the compromised log in id permitted access to reservations data for that property only the log in id was immediately terminated and the computer in question has been removed from use
8887572 as a former it employee for best western who left recently on good terms i can confirm that everything best western is saying about this incident is true
8887573 memberweb system is what allows front desk staff to check on incoming reservations and adjust rates and availability among many other things
8887574 the account that was compromised had very limited access to the memberweb system so at most the hacker was able to glean a handful of records from the transaction log feature looking into the accounts access history is what showed that it was only 10 records that were actually accessed by the attacker
8887575 i have watched as a hotel in leicester canceled a guests stay at a hotel in linz and rebooked him in a hotel in vienna at no point was the hotel in linz informed of this other than via memberweb this was done with a standard memberweb login and no reservation numbers a simple search for the guests name sufficed this would seem to contradict bws statement that the compromised user id permitted access only to the reservations at a single hotel

8887736 i dont know if theres a higher ranking person at freddie mac that has the trust of the people and the street
8887737 are these problems that freddie mac is creating daily or are these problems because the housing market stinks
8887738 the loan portfolio they went into this year with is the loan portfolio they are going to have to deal with throughout this cycle so whether richard syron or michael phelps is the head of freddie mac it is the same issue

8887790 one thing we do have to keep in mind is when one is looking at equities as an asset class that you want to invest in one would have to look at it from a long term perspective we have to keep india in mind from that perspective very clearly our view is that the long term india story is still intact but given this environment of high inflation high interest rates and slowing earnings one has got to look at sectors where there is visibility of growth we believe that if one takes a look at the services sector look at it and it if we look back from april last year when the rupee started to appreciate the sector took an exceedingly hard hit now you are looking at the rupee having depreciated again and starting to stabilise around these levels which is going to be beneficial for it the sector is slowing but from exceedingly high growth rates we are still looking at 15 20 growth for at least the largecap it companies thats one sector we like a lot of these companies are cash rich they are not interest rate sensitives
8887791 capital goods have again visibility of growth with regards to order books and some of these companies have order books that are full for 12 to 24 months the important thing is to look for companies that are not too highly leveraged so one has to look at sectors that are not interest rate sensitive to a large extent it is one and capital goods is the other telecom is another sector that we are overweight on
8887792 defensives is a good place to be we are neutral on defensives given that consumption might also come off but fmcg with regards to the possibility of downgrades in earnings we feel the least risk is probably going to come from that sector so fmcg pharma those are the sectors that one should be looking at but most importantly the one thing that one does need to keep in mind is to select quality companies quality management and with not too much leverage on their books thats whats going to hold a portfolio on good stead going forward there are lots of opportunities in many spaces in companies with those parameters

8887801 i have the feeling that more and more talented artists try to go for the labels with physical releases right from the start now simply because it has been proven that they will get you some gigs a lot faster
8887802 the netlabel scene has seen quite some development over the last decade but with its lacking barriers for production and publication it will probably never achieve working mechanisms for quality self selection

8887810 we will make sure we apply ourselves in the right way then we will have a chance
8887811 we deserved to go through and we are delighted especially as we had rested some players for the real game
8887812 the squad is stronger than last year when they finished fifth we arent favourites for the league but we could certainly spring a surprise

8887875 the communication of scientific information for evidence based policymaking is poorly institutionalised in developing country contexts
8887876 policymakers and development practitioners would be able to make greater use of scientific research findings if scientists would engage more openly with the resulting policy implications and present a range of possible policy options
8887877 these systemic problems will require coordinated and holistic efforts by national governments international actors and nongovernmental actors alike
8887878 this represents a call for greater engagement and applicability of research findings to policy concerns
8887879 the will to engage the desire for deliberation participation opinion and advice and the demand for locally differentiated information all mark out promising avenues
8887880 although engagement deliberation participation and advice represent important opportunities they must be approached strategically and with realism regarding the power and politics involved in a specific context

8887885 questa previsione ci preoccupa dice il direttore generale di aeroporti di puglia marco franchini ci preoccupa perch laereo soprattutto per una regione del sud come la puglia resta il mezzo di trasporto pi veloce per raggiungere il mondo speriamo che qualunque sia la riorganizzazione degli scali milanesi si tenga conto delle esigenze e dei diritti dei pugliesi e che queste scelti non rappresentino un danno non solo dal punto di vista economico per il territorio e occupazionale per gli addetti ma per la stessa crescita della puglia una regione che si sta sviluppando e che sta investendo sul turismo ha assoluta necessit del mezzo areo se la tragegia della nuova alitalia dovesse effettivamente privilegiare alcune destinazioni al posto di altre ci rappresenterebbe una evidente distorsione del mercato che dovrebbe preoccupare a questo punto soprattutto la politica
8887886 noi in questi anni aggiunge franchini siamo cresciuti senza lalitalia attraendo altre compagnie non sempre con successo cercheremo di continuare su questa rotta individuando sempre nuovi vettori per scongiurare una crisi tra le pi gravi a livello mondiale
8887887 ancora una volta aggiunge boccia questo paese dimostra un cattivo rapporto con il mercato e i problemi di una azienda pubblica saccheggiata dal pubblico vengono spalmati sugli italiani questo il modo per berlusconi di concepire il mercato
8887888 e una storia che si ripete probabilmente la cosa pi grave di questa vicenda che questa volta sono saliti proprio tutti imprenditori di destra di centro di centrosinistra ho sempre sperato che la politica in italia prima o poi riuscisse a dimostrare la sua autonomia e quindi la sua supremazia rispetto alleconomia e al capitalismo invece dalla vicenda alitalia abbiamo probabilmente lultima conferma della debolezza della politica italiana rispetto agli interessi economici di pochi e alle regole di un capitalismo chiaramente malato lunica via di uscita la speranza nei tanti piccoli e medi imprenditori sparsi in ogni provincia ditalia che vanno avanti con le proprie forze senza aiuti di stato e con una idea giovane e nuova del paese e quindi del rapporto con la politica
8887889 chiedo formalmente conclude boccia ai parlamentari di centrodestra e ai pricipali esponenti di governo di prendere posizione su questa vicenda che penalizza il sud e taglia fuori la puglia
8887890 nonostante tutto questo alla puglia anche la beffa di vedere limprenditore dellacciaio emilio riva tra i finanziatori di questa operazione proprio negli stessi giorni nei quali a taranto si sta discutendo degli investimenti sugli impianti per la riduzione della diossina soldi che non arrivano e che forse erano un po pi importanti della speculazione alitalia
8887891 per come si annuncia il piano industriale vedo una penalizzazione fortissima della puglia e del mezzogiorno che avr come effetti primo la riduzione dei collegamenti sulle pricipali rotte dalla puglia su milano e roma secondo un aumento delle tariffe che la concorrenza aveva ridotto infine per quanto riguarda la bud compani dove scaricheranno tuitti i debiti adp rischia di non incassare circa quattro milioni di euro fino a questo momento non sappiamo come lazienda in liquidazione far fronte ai debiti vantati nei nostri confronti per noi significherebbe un rischio dimpresa altissimo alla fine di tutto questo in puglia avremo anche degli efftti occupazionali sui due aeroporti che si dice sono gi tagliati fuori dal piano fatto apposta per salvare malpensa significa che nella operazione degli esuberi gli scali pugliesi avranno delle ricadute occupazionali pesanti senza dire che lisolamento della puglia e gli effetti sul turismo e sulla economia in generale altro che federalismo

8887941 they cut off food and supplies to more than two million germans in an effort to extinguish the last flame of freedom in berlin the size of our forces was no match for the much larger soviet army and yet retreat would have allowed communism to march across europe where the last war had ended another world war could have easily begun all that stood in the way was berlin and thats when the airlift began when the largest and most unlikely rescue in history brought food and hope to the people of this city

8887944 we have warned that america must be defended not by involvement in this war or by steps toward dictatorship or by pursuing a course of imperialist expansion but by preserving peace and expanding democracy on the economic political and cultural levels today we must ask whether the present policy of the administration and the program of big business are not leading us toward war and fascism in the name of resistance to war and fascism
8887945 how best as writers can we resist the drive toward war and reaction which threatens our democratic culture
8887946 this is clear support of the soviet nazi pact by davis a short time before june 22 1941 when germany attacked the soviet union and the communist party line changed from peace to war

8887948 of say a john mccain mentor who had toed the line for hitler i can tell you that i as a conservative republican would be pretty darned disappointed and would demand some answers i would not turn it into a joke and if mccain did not absolutely convincingly repudiate it i absolutely would not vote for him
8887949 the end result is that the bad guys on the communist far left such as the likes of frank marshall davis continue to get a pass long after theyve departed this world as will those who consider them mentors these were extreme leftists who hurt liberalism who hurt some of the dearest liberal causes davis in death is protected his dirty work covered up by a press who must now protect their anointed one
8887950 the idea that reporters are trying to help obama win in november has grown by five percentage points over the past month the latest rasmussen reports telephone survey taken just before the new controversy involving the new york times erupted found that 49 of voters believe most reporters will try to help the democrat with their coverage up from 44 a month ago just 14 believe most reporters will try to help mccain win little changed from 13 a month ago just one voter in four 24 believes that most reporters will try to offer unbiased coverage

8887995 wie gut die l sung mit der commerzbank ist muss sich allerdings noch zeigen
8887996 als entlastung k nnte auch die tochter cominvest mit einem wert von rund 1 5 milliarden euro der allianz als asset tausch angeboten werden
8887997 die allianz ist ihr sorgenkind dresdner bank zwar los m sste zun chst aber einen hohen buchverlust ausweisen eine denkbare l sung w re auch gewesen dass die allianz anteilig an dem konstrukt beteiligt bleibt dann w rde es keinen buchverlust geben
8887998 f r die allianz w re es allerdings nur die zweitbeste l sung da die commerzbank den n tigen kaufpreis wohl nicht alleine stemmen kann und der versicherer daher wahrscheinlich mit 20 bis 30 prozent beteiligt bleiben k nnte die allianz h tte mit sicherheit das geld lieber bar in der hand
8887999 neben dem preis wird auch spannend wie viele der altlasten der dresdner bank die allianz noch tr gt

8888045 the truth is that this caught everyone by surprise because we didnt expect it at all were a little bit sad because we know what aduriz meant to this team and what he could have done

8888053 sedici anni fa mi avete dato lonore di guidare il nostro partito alla vittoria e guidare la nazione in una nuova era di pace e prosperit insieme abbiamo battuto i repubblicani in una campagna dura nella quale venivo attaccato perch troppo giovane e inesperto per essere il comandante supremo delle forze armate vi ricorda qualcosa nel 1992 non ha funzionato perch noi eravamo dalla parte giusta della storia e non funzioner neppure nel 2008 perch anche obama dalla parte giusta della storia
8888054 quello di sapere ispirare la gente infondere la speranza guidarla verso un orizzonte pi alto ha lintelligenza e la curiosit che non possono mancare in un presidente ha mostrato di avere una chiara comprensione della politica estera delle sfide sul fronte della sicurezza nazionale e una ferma determinazione a rimettere in sesto le nostre forze armate

8888060 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
8888061 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
8888062 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
8888063 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
8888064 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza

8888111 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8888112 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8888113 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8888114 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8888115 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8888116 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8888117 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8888118 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8888119 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8888120 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8888121 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

8888123 we are pleased to deliver additional value to our stockholders through this superior offer from microsoft we are excited about working with one of the worlds leading corporations to effectuate a smooth transition in both our comparison shopping and global iss businesses
8888124 we believe that the transition will have a positive outcome for our customers and employees
8888125 acquiring one of europes leading price comparison shopping and consumer reviews sites will further extend microsofts search and ecommerce services in europe
8888126 the team at ciao has built a passionate consumer community based on intuitive technology and extensive merchant relationships that we believe will deliver incremental benefit to the microsoft live search platform greenfield onlines iss business has been a cornerstone of the companys growth and market value we are pleased we could find the right strategic partner for iss to continue its growth
8888127 as a fsa 1 regulated business were ultimately responsible for the advice given to clients and this is documented in paperwork which has historically all been paper based while it has never happened this leaves the business vulnerable to claims if files were damaged lost or stolen and we couldnt prove what advice was given equally while the fsa has a series of principals about file storage these are open to interpretation and we wanted to move from a position of hopeful control to something more concrete
8888128 ifas produce tons of documents from the first fact finding stage where clients personal financial circumstances are assessed and recorded to applications ongoing evaluations and then management of commission statements the business was swamped with paper and deploying scanners and in future a group wide electronic document management system will allow us to streamline this
8888129 kodaks reliability is second to none and the throughput of the i1120 scanners is more than enough to cope with ifs workload theyre duplex have a small footprint and come with the most comprehensive warranty in the industry a unique three year next business day exchange warranty for free
8888130 over and above the obvious benefits the real value for us of scanning and electronic document management is the protection it provides in terms of proving what advice was given to clients if ever there were a query it is this safeguard which makes the investment in the hardware and software totally worthwhile
8888131 the new scanmate i1120s are proving a real hit with small to medium sized business who want a comprehensive package to realise the benefits of electronic document storage while they may be our entry level product they offer high performance and have all the features kodak has become well known for such as perfect page

8888144 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8888145 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8888146 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8888147 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

8888165 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze
8888166 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale
8888167 a questo punto prosegue carraresi un intervento della regione toscana attraverso i propri uffici e il pieno e tempestivo coinvolgimento di altri soggetti regionali quali lazienda sanitaria e larpat divengono veramente urgenti

8888170 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8888171 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8888172 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8888173 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8888174 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8888175 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8888176 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8888177 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8888178 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8888179 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8888180 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8888181 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8888182 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8888183 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8888184 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8888185 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8888186 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8888187 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8888188 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8888189 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8888190 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8888191 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8888192 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8888193 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8888194 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8888195 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8888196 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8888197 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8888198 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8888199 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8888200 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8888201 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8888202 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8888203 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8888204 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8888205 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8888206 who are open to doing something on the production side
8888207 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8888208 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8888209 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

8888219 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8888220 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8888221 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8888222 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8888223 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

8888286 venta de viviendas en espa a cae la concesi n de hipotecas
8888287 bajada de categor a de los t tulos hipotecarios en espa a
8888288 espa a seriamente afectada si el bce endurece las condiciones para conceder cr dito
8888289 espa a la crisis ha vac ado playas y hoteles de la costa del sol
8888290 ventas de viviendas en espa a cae la concesi n de hipotecas
8888291 la venta de viviendas en espa a y la concesi n de nuevas hipotecas volvieron a descender abruptamente durante el mes de junio indicando que contin a la presi n sobre la anta o floreciente industria de la construcci n espa ola que aliment la econom a durante un boom que se prolong una d cada la quiebra del sector inmobiliario tambi n acarre malas noticias para los bancos espa oles especialmente para las cajas de ahorros generadores de aproximadamente la mitad de los pr stamos del pa s y de los dep sitos moody s investors service a comienzos de mes rebaj la categor a a cinco cajas de ahorros espa olas de medio y gran tama o recalcando el r pido deterioro en los indicadores de sus activos
8888292 a n son muchos los analistas que opinan que los bancos en ltima instancia capear n el temporal los dos bancos espa oles m s importantes el santander y el bilbao vizcaya argentaria se encuentran en un posici n relativamente buena gracias principalmente a las ganancias obtenidas por sus operaciones en latinoam rica y otros lugares la ca da en inversi n inmobiliaria est dificultando el crecimiento econ mico en espa a cuarta econom a en importancia de la zona euro con un pib que creci un 0 1 durante el segundo trimestre del a o las previsiones del gobierno de crecimiento para el pib del presente a o se fijan en un 1 6 muy por debajo del 3 7 de la tasa de crecimiento registrada en el a o 2007
8888293 el fuerte crecimiento econ mico espa ol de la pasada d cada se vio respaldado por el sector inmobiliario y el aumento en la demanda de viviendas aunque ahora muchos expertos esperan que el pa s entre en recesi n la segunda mitad del a o debido al colapso en la demanda
8888294 bajada de categor a de los t tulos hipotecarios en espa a
8888295 fitch rating ha bajado en seis puestos los valores hipotecarios espa oles emitidos por el banco de santander aumentando la preocupaci n por que el da o del crack inmobiliario llegue a alcanzar a los prestamistas m s importantes del pa s los pr stamos fueron cortados y recortados y presentados de manera id ntica a los bonos de las hipotecas subprime estadounidenses desdiciendo las alegaciones del gobierno espa ol de que el pa s hab a evitado las pr cticas crediticias que se hab an observado en las econom as anglosajonas
8888296 el patr n que est saliendo a la luz es inquietantemente similar al del estadio final de la debacle de las subprime estadounidenses la gran diferencia es que el banco de espa a prohibi la utilizaci n de veh culos estructurados de inversi n un tercio de la ca da de los precios inmobiliarios en espa a es mucho m s que la correcci n que esperaban muchos economistas en espa a y causar a estragos en el sistema bancario los datos oficiales ponen de manifiesto que los precios en la vivienda han descendido un 3 9 el a o pasado aunque los promotores inmobiliarios dicen que el descenso actual ha sido mucho m s agudo
8888297 pueden los bancos espa oles liderar la acusaci n de supervivencia
8888298 la relaci n de espa a con el toro no puede ser infravalorada
8888299 la t pica imagen del toro negro se encuentra en todos los sitios desde las botellas de whisky hasta la cima de las monta as pero mientras que los toros suscitan siempre pasi n y controversia hay algo que por ahora no da lugar a ning n debate la direcci n de la econom a espa ola y los expertos coinciden en que en lo que ata e a los mercados los toros han desaparecido r pidamente
8888300 mientras que la mayor parte de las aflicciones son resultado de la ca da de la industria de la construcci n e inmobiliaria hay un rea econ mica que hasta ahora ha seguido fuertemente adelante los bancos una de las razones es que los bancos del pa s no han estado relativamente expuestos al mercado hipotecario de las subprime estadounidenses y en lugar de ello canalizaron sus energ as en el mercado espa ol e invirtieron en econom as de r pido crecimiento como las latinoamericanas el banco de espa a aprendi algunas lecciones durante la crisis de los a os 80 cuando alrededor de 50 bancos del pa s que detentaban el 20 de los dep sitos nacionales se declararon en bancarrota el banco de espa a ha vigilado de cerca las pr cticas crediticias incluyendo la advertencia a los bancos de la utilizaci n de veh culos estructurados de inversi n que fueron los causantes de la crisis de las subprime
8888301 un reciente informe realizado por morgan stanley advirti que una aguda ca da en el sector inmobiliario podr a desencadenar el desastre para los bancos espa oles que han invertido fuertemente en el sector pero por el momento el director del mayor banco de espa a est tranquilo los economistas observar n cuidadosamente los bancos espa oles en los pr ximos meses y a medida que la econom a vaya cayendo solamente entonces sabr n si los bancos espa oles han tenido en cuenta el consejo de bot n y pueden evitar las dificultades que sus colegas brit nicos y estadounidenses han experimentado
8888302 espa a seriamente afectada si el bce endurece las condiciones para conceder un cr dito
8888303 espa a podr a verse muy afectada si el banco central europeo endurece las condiciones para conceder cr ditos bancarios a los bancos comerciales los bancos comerciales espa oles han obtenido cr ditos del bce por cantidades relativamente elevadas estas cantidades alcanzan los 89 mil millones de euros espa a est extra sensibilizada por las consecuencias de la crisis crediticia porque el pa s vive desde hace a os de fiado de esta manera el sector de la construcci n ha hecho buenos negocios el mercado de la vivienda ya est bastante paralizado y sufre la bajada de los precios las familias espa olas cargan adem s con fuertes deudas hipotecarias y de consumici n seg n datos del banco central espa ol una familia media tiene una deuda de un 130 de sus ingresos anuales
8888304 el banco central europeo bce se prepara para aumentar la exigencia que coloca a las garant as que exige en los prestamos que concede a los bancos de la zona euro una medida que tendr especial impacto en espa a cuyas entidades financieras han sido de las que m s han recurrido al bce en busca de dinero
8888305 la crisis econ mica ha vaciado por completo las reservas presupuestarias de espa a durante los siete primeros meses del a o el d ficit del estado se eleva a cerca de 10 mil millones de euros contra un excedente de siete mil seiscientos millones del a o anterior tras meses de bonanza el estado ha pasado a los n meros rojos entre los meses de junio y julio el retroceso de los beneficios de las empresas la subida del paro y la bajada del consumo han hecho que los ingresos fiscales hayan bajado un 4 2 igualmente han subido los gastos bajo el efecto de los diferentes planes de relanzamiento econ mico decididos por el gobierno
8888306 el sector tur stico espa ol tambi n est en crisis
8888307 espa a se va hundiendo cada vez m s en la crisis
8888308 anteriormente el turismo extranjero compensaba la disminuci n de los ingresos generados por el turismo nacional pero ahora tampoco se da esa circunstancia la baja cotizaci n del d lar hace que las playas caribe as resultan m s atractivas y accesibles que nunca en el ltimo a o hasta julio el n mero de turistas extranjeros ha ido disminuyendo en unas 623 000 unidades siendo ste el mayor retroceso desde 1996 a pesar de la crisis el gobierno espa ol sigue mostr ndose moderadamente optimista y desmiente las previsiones de algunos analistas que anuncian un crecimiento negativo en el tercer trimestre
8888309 espa a la crisis ha vaciado playas y hoteles de la costa del sol
8888310 segundo destino tur stico de europa espa a ha sufrido un descenso del 8 en su n mero de visitantes durante el mes de julio los espa oles han reducido sus gastos
8888311 durante todo el verano las playas espa olas han ofrecido id ntico paisaje desolador hamacas y sombrillas sin utilizar bares de tapas desiertos
8888312 el avi n accidentado espa ol hab a tenido problemas anteriores
8888313 los mec nicos detectaron un fallo en el avi n siniestrado tres d as antes del accidente pero el avi n no fue estudiado en lugar de ello el sistema de reversa fue desactivado en uno de los motores y le fue permitido continuar volando se supon a que la aver a ten a que ser reparada un d a despu s ya que el funcionamiento manual de los dos motores del md 82 permit a que el aparato volara temporalmente con s lo uno de los mecanismos de seguridad de la reversa
8888314 miles de sin papeles han llegado a espa a en barcos desde principios de a o pero madrid ha endurecido su pol tica de expulsi n
8888315 en contra de lo estipulado en todas las nuevas restricciones para inmigrantes ilegales el gobierno espa ol hab a vuelto a otorgar este verano unos permisos extraordinarios de residencia para los supervivientes de barcos siniestrados como cualquier otro cambio en este mbito de la pol tica en las leyes o en la pr ctica com n en madrid tambi n en este caso se corri r pidamente la voz entre los vecinos africanos
8888316 desde que hace cuatro a os se produjera una avalancha de miles de emigrantes sobre las alambradas fronterizas de los enclaves de ceuta y melilla y las bandas de tr fico de personas entendieran que la organizaci n de costosas traves as mar timas hacia las islas canarias a las costas andaluzas o incluso hacia las islas baleares puede convertirse en un negocio lucrativo el gobierno del presidente socialista jos luis rodr guez zapatero ha cambiado paso a paso el rumbo de una pol tica de inmigraci n de un liberalismo en aquel momento nico en europa
8888317 iberdrola y endesa acusadas de anteponer el beneficio a la seguridad
8888318 el gobierno aut nomo catal n declar que la falta de inversiones era la causante de los incidentes acaecidos en las dos centrales nucleares incluyendo la fuga que hizo que miles de personas tuvieran que pasar por controles de radiaci n estas acusaciones llegan en un momento en el que el gobierno socialista apost por el cierre gradual de las seis plantas nucleares del pa s y por la obtenci n de energ a mediante fuentes renovables
8888319 le ha llegado el turno a los europeos ahora tendr n que poner en pr ctica su mente fr a como gestores de crisis en un conflicto que desde la ca da del muro resultaba inimaginable est claro que europa no deber someterse al kremlin tiene que responder con un claro no a la acci n unilateral de mosc pero unas sanciones al modo en que por lo general suele hacerse entrar en raz n a dictadores del tercer mundo tal y como las desean polonia y los pa ses b lticos ya resultan absurdas por el mero hecho de que nicamente despertar an en mosc una vaga sonrisa a la ue no le servir de nada una tormenta teatral sino nicamente un g lido no ste deber ir ligado a un pero que no d un portazo al di logo
8888320 inaceptable ste parece ser el concepto que podr desempe ar el papel de denominador com n para los pa ses miembros de la ue frente a la actuaci n de rusia cuando se re nan el lunes para celebrar una cumbre extraordinaria sobre la crisis en georgia llama la atenci n que por el momento las reacciones verbales demuestren una comprensible gradaci n la indignaci n ante la entrada de tropas rusas en georgia tiene mayor fuerza entre los pa ses del este de europa francia que como presidencia desempe a una funci n destacada y r pidamente adopt el papel de gestor de crisis tendr que cumplir la tarea de conducir a la ue hacia una l nea com n en nombre de alemania con sus relaciones real o supuestamente especiales con rusia la se ora merkel se ha encargado ya de tomar una posici n clara en el b ltico los brit nicos se han apresurado en respaldar a los europeos del este pero ahora aparentemente se encuentran a la espera de ver c mo va a proceder washington
8888321 en los grandes pa ses europeos del sur italia y espa a se percibe una desaprobaci n mascullada no vinculante o nada en absoluto la pregunta es si la uni n europea quiere y es capaz de llevar a cabo algo m s que una declaraci n conjunta de rechazo en efecto probablemente a n sea demasiado pronto como para pronunciar la palabra sanciones una posible medida que se quedar a por debajo de este list n ser a degradar las negociaciones protocolariamente o congelarlas durante un tiempo como por ejemplo en lo referente al acuerdo entre la ue y rusia en todo caso los despachos occidentales no desean romper el hilo de di logo con mosc por meros motivos de dominio sobre una crisis esto resultar a poco inteligente
8888322 ayer bernard kouchner se al por primera vez que se examinan sanciones por parte de la uni n europea contra rusia si sta no se conforma al acuerdo en seis puntos del 13 de agosto redactado para acabar con la crisis de georgia la eventualidad de sanciones contra mosc ya ha sido evocada por los europeos partidarios del lenguaje m s firme respecto de rusia pa ses b lticos polonia gran breta a en el fondo la eventualidad de las sanciones no aparece como la m s probable de lo divididos que aparecen los veintisiete sobre el tema conciente de estar frente a una crisis que se jugar a largo plazo se nota preocupaci n en par s sobre todo por no aumentar las crispaciones parece ser sin embargo que las relaciones ue rusia no evitar n una especie de revisi n la pr xima ronda de negociaciones sobre un nuevo acuerdo de asociaci n estrat gica entre los veintisiete y rusia podr a ser suspendida se est tambi n examinando una congelaci n de las discusiones iniciadas con mosc sobre la supresi n de los visados para los rusos que viajan en la ue pero muchos europeos apuestan por los efectos del apoyo que podr an manifestar a los pa ses de la ex urss sobre los cuales mosc podr a querer acentuar la presi n como ucrania
8888323 hay razones para que los pa ses europeos encuentren dif cil unirse contra rusia
8888324 rusia s lo oir a la uni n europea cuando hable con una sola voz ese era el grito de batalla en bruselas mientras los funcionarios y diplom ticos preparaban la cumbre de emergencia sobre la crisis de georgia convocada por la presidencia francesa sin embargo la ret rica parece en gran parte vac a cuando se llegue al verdadero prop sito de la cumbre reexaminar las relaciones ue rusia los 27 l deres seguir n divididos en varios campos superpuestos incluyendo a los que piensan que se debe contener a rusia un amplio grupo de fatalistas piensa que rusia nos tiene entre la espada y la pared no se espera que la cumbre llegue a un acuerdo para hacer grandes cambios en el status quo por la simple raz n de que varios l deres no se ponen de acuerdo sobre si ser a una buena idea o contraproducente
8888325 la uni n europea debe dar a kiev la esperanza de la adhesi n
8888326 ofrecer la adhesi n para contener la presi n de rusia
8888327 las promesas de apoyo dadas esta semana a ucrania por el ministro de exteriores david miliband y otros ministros de la ue deben continuarse con acciones concretas no es suficiente que la ue trata de advertir que rusia va a tratar de aprovechar su victoria militar en georgia para amenazar a ucrania y a otras vulnerables rep blicas ex sovi ticas occidente debe responder y la ue debe jugar un papel importante en esa respuesta la crisis de georgia muestra que los vulnerables vecinos de rusia necesitan respaldo para resistir la agresi n aunque ser miembro de la ue no garantiza la seguridad le da el apoyo pol tico de los 27 adem s la promesa de convertirse en miembro ayudar a a los reformadores pro occidentales ucranianos en su lucha contra sus oponentes
8888328 la uni n europea estudiar la adopci n de sanciones contra mosc en la cumbre extraordinaria que se celebrar el pr ximo lunes en bruselas se al ayer francia pero la ue se muestra dividida sobre este tema y las opciones parecen limitadas b lgica aboga por la desescalada la evocaci n por el ministro franc s bernard kouchner de posibles sanciones ha cogido por sorpresa a algunos diplom ticos europeos b lgica no tomar a la iniciativa de convocar una reuni n con la intenci n de dictar sanciones resumi el portavoz belga de exteriores formulando as una cr tica velada contra la presidencia francesa de la ue
8888329 los europeos podr an adoptar sanciones contra rusia en la reuni n de jefes de gobierno de la uni n europea del lunes en bruselas la idea fue sugerida por el ministro franc s de exteriores bernard kouchner y recibida por el hom logo ruso serguei lavrov con iron a suscitando una reacci n en el l mite de la diplomacia vladimir putin acus a los estados unidos de orquestar el conflicto de osetia del sur
8888330 el presidente georgiano saakashvili ha acogido positivamente la propuesta de nuestro ministro de exteriores de una conferencia sobre el c ucaso en roma el pr ximo noviembre si esta conferencia tambi n fuera aceptada por los rusos se tratar a de un xito de la diplomacia italiana un xito sin embargo que ser a posible gracias a una cierta actitud de ambig edad
8888331 para italia estar aqu y al mismo tiempo un poco tambi n all es una vocaci n
8888332 los cambios de gobierno no parecen haber alterado esta vocaci n en la que como se al no faltan algunos argumentos realistas para sostenerla pero que a menudo tambi n han servido para ponernos en dificultad con los aliados nuestra verdadera pareja de baile y puede contribuir a dar alas a ciertas potencias como por ejemplo ahora rusia o ir n para intentar alterar el status quo es decir para creer que es f cil lograr la divisi n en europa el exceso de prudencia es un arma de doble filo puede mantener abiertos canales de comunicaci n que de otro modo se cerrar an pero tambi n puede transformarse en debilidad y en no fiabilidad nuestro fuerte sentido de la vulnerabilidad evidencia lo dif cil y penoso que es asumir posiciones netas pero hay circunstancias que las exigen
8888333 la organizaci n de cooperaci n de shangai tiene un papel cada vez m s importante
8888334 la organizaci n de cooperaci n de shanghai ocs ha crecido r pidamente en los ltimos a os y se ha convertido en un importante v nculo en las relaciones internacionales contempor neas afirm el presidente de tayikist n emomali rakhmon en una reciente entrevista con un medio de comunicaci n chino
8888335 la ocs que engloba a china kazajist n kirguist n rusia tayikist n y uzbekist n se cre el 15 de junio de 2001 en shanghai en los ltimos siete a os se ha convertido gradualmente en un mecanismo eficaz para mantener el beneficio com n de los pa ses miembro y para promover una cooperaci n mutuamente beneficiosa
8888336 tambi n se ha convertido en un importante motor para posibilitar la realizaci n de la paz duradera el progreso com n y ha aportado adem s cruciales contribuciones al establecimiento de un orden internacional m s justo y racional
8888337 medvedev agradece a los pa ses de la organizaci n de cooperaci n de shangai su comprensi n por las posiciones de rusia
8888338 en la declaraci n los miembros expresan su preocupaci n por el desarrollo del conflicto en torno a osetia del sur y se exhorta a las partes a solucionar el problema a base de un di ologo de paz altos funcionarios de la delegaci n rusa aseguraron que en las conversaciones a puerta cerrada sus colegas de la ocsh expresaron una comprensi n total con la posici n rusa y sus acciones aunque no lo pudieron reconocer abiertamente debido a sus convicciones pero lo principal subrayan en la delegaci n rusa es que la ocsh constata el papel dominante de rusia como pacificador en el c ucaso
8888339 ahora se est poniendo de manifiesto que rusia ha cometido un error t ctico reconociendo los territorios separatistas de georgia la organizaci n de cooperaci n de shangai sco en la que rusia colabora ente todo con china se ha negado a dar su benepl cito a la actuaci n rusa en su lugar china ha expresado su preocupaci n ante los recientes cambios en osetia del sur y abjazia esto supone una g lida negativa para rusia aunque en un primer momento la guerra en s misma no hab a despertado una gran oposici n fuera de eeuu y de la ue pero cuando se produce un reconocimiento formal de separatistas para los gobiernos en todo el mundo tiene el mismo efecto que aguarles una fiesta muchos estados re nen en su territorio a pueblos que sue an con la independencia quien aliente este tipo de aspiraciones mediante actuaciones diplom ticas unilaterales no lograr hacerse muchos amigos en el panorama internacional
8888340 putin busca dibujar las fronteras de una rusia m s grande
8888341 debemos tenerlo claro la rusia de vladimir putin ha invadido a un vecino se ha anexionado territorios y ha llevado a cabo una ocupaci n militar busca derrocar al presidente de georgia y modificar el orden geopol tico global ha repudiado la firma del alto el fuego negociado por la francia de nicolas sarkozy y no ha sido fiel a sus frecuentes afirmaciones sobre la integridad territorial de georgia lo m s importante todo es culpa nuestra el nosotros en este contexto se refiere a los estados unidos y los m s testarudos de sus aliados europeos como gran breta a si washington hubiera sido m s amable con los rusos despu s de la ca da del muro de berl n si occidente no hubiera humillado a mosc despu s de la ca da de la uni n sovi tica putin ha dicho que el colapso de la uni n sovi tica fue la mayor cat strofe geopol tica del siglo xx ahora quiere subyugar a los vecinos de su pa s en beneficio de una rusia m s grande
8888342 si se lee y escucha entre l neas la convenci n nacional dem crata que termina en denver esta noche podr a despejar la inc gnita sobre si el pa s girar a o no hacia la izquierda con un gobierno de barack obama antes de que se iniciara el encuentro muchos daban por descontado que el candidato y sus asesores les estaban proponiendo a los norteamericanos un desplazamiento hacia un mayor liberalismo que es lo que en estados unidos implica cualquier giro izquierdista pero el new york times en un agudo reportaje publicado el pasado lunes pon a en solfa ese criterio al subrayar el pragmatismo de obama y lo dif cil que es encasillarlo ideol gicamente
8888343 en el mbito dom stico obama contemplar a un vuelco izquierdista si se propusiera fortalecer el diezmado movimiento laboral tambi n definir a a obama como candidato de izquierda una propuesta para redistribuir la riqueza nacional ser an se ales de izquierdismo en obama un programa nacional de salud p blica que ofrezca atenci n m dica gratuita o a bajo costo a los millones de norteamericanos que hoy d a carecen de ella y ser a una meta izquierdista el incorporar al tejido pol tico y social a los inmigrantes inclusive a los indocumentados a quienes se les deber a facilitar el camino hacia la legalizaci n
8888344 un borrador de la plataforma dem crata contiene algunos de estos principios pero excluye otros este podr a ser un indicio de que ya sea por convicci n o por razones estrat gicas obama har campa a durante el resto de la contienda desde una posici n centrista
8888345 el candidato republicano est luchando con fuerza pero necesita hacer m s para separarse de george bush
8888346 aunque los votantes proclaman que prefieren a los dem cratas que a los representantes del viejo gran partido por un s lido margen de m s de 10 puntos y aunque parece que no hay casi nadie en la naci n que piense que las cosas van por el buen camino al principio de las convenciones john mccain estaba m s o menos al mismo nivel que barack obama en las encuestas de opini n hay una oportunidad real incluso despu s de ocho a os de la calamitosa presidencia de george bush de que los votantes opten por otro per odo de administraci n republicana esto refleja en parte la debilidad que acompa a las carism ticas habilidades desplegadas por obama en denver esta semana su inexperiencia sobre todo en pol tica internacional y cierto distanciamiento que parece que le dificulta para conectar con la clase media americana pero una gran parte de la raz n es que con mccain los republicanos se han unido alrededor del nico candidato que puede salvarles pero si sorprende y gana contra todo pron stico mccain tiene que superar algunos obst culos importantes uno es algo contra lo que no puede hacer nada su edad otro es su temperamento explosivo un tercer obst culo es que muchos americanos le ven como un belicista otra preocupaci n es que en su deseo de ser elegido mccain ha estado dispuesto a abandonar algunas de las creencias que le han hecho tan atractivo
8888347 joe biden aporta tanto fuerza como debilidad a la candidatura dem crata
8888348 la elecci n de biden por parte de obama como su compa ero de candidatura a las elecciones norteamericanas ha conseguido mucha aceptaci n no s lo por parte de los dem cratas leales el experimentado senador por delaware no s lo aporta cabello blanco a la candidatura dem crata tambi n aporta una historia personal que complementa la biograf a de obama biden es uno de los m s experimentados expertos en pol tica exterior de washington lo que es un perfecto complemento a la mayor debilidad de obama su escaso curr culo en asuntos internacionales el hecho de que es buen amigo de john mccain tambi n puede ayudar a los dem cratas a ganar a sus oponentes pero con 65 a os no tiene m s remedio que supeditar sus aspiraciones pol ticas personales a las de su jefe el mayor problema de biden sin embargo es que no es hillary clinton
8888349 ante todo el congreso de los dem cratas en denver le ha conferido al partido nuevo aplomo con una realizaci n de rigor casi estalinista y gran astucia medi tica la national convention ha convertido a su candidato l der en la encarnaci n del cambio en un estadio de f tbol pero por el momento el candidato obama a n no ha logrado darle a su campa a un objetivo claro su f rmula del cambio a todos los niveles resulta arrebatadora pero a n as permanece como algo vago por ahora el proyecto obama sigue siendo l mismo obama brilla como personalidad mientras que su programa palidece
8888350 mc cain consigui por ahora algo muy dif cil aliarse a las ideas m s conservadoras de george w para seducir a los duros de su partido conservando a la vez una imagen de agitador independiente y de buen sentido tranquilizador los sondeos le recompensan hasta tal punto que supera a su rival dem crata en cinco puntos en una encuesta de opini n reciente del instituto zogby barack obama chantre carism tico del cambio en el que se puede creer podr a tomar distancia despu s de su gran show en la convenci n dem crata de denver pero todo est por jugar si barack obama puede esperar gracias a la movilizaci n masiva de los negros sacudir los bastiones republicanos blancos del sur y quitarle el estado de virgina a mc cain sabe que en los dos tercios del pa s ya est decidido treinta estados siguen en el mismo campo desde 1980 el sistema electoral est concebido para dar ventaja compensatoria a los estados menos poblados muchas veces rurales y conservadores donde se multiplican los suburbios republicanos en este paisaje sin movimiento tanto obama como mc cain concentran sus esfuerzos sobre los muy pocos swing states estados indecisos michigan ohio iowa as como colorado podr an elegir a obama mc cain est interesado por minnesota new hampshire y los hispanos conservadores de nuevo m jico
8888351 tras escribir historia y haber sido coronado como primer candidato negro para las presidenciales americanas empezamos a ser conscientes del profundo cambio que barack obama ya ha provocado en la pol tica estadounidense por primera vez un hombre de color se encuentra en el umbral de la casa blanca en esta ocasi n el calificativo de hist rico est sobradamente justificado pero una vez acabadas las ceremonias y los discursos queda por contestar a la pregunta fundamental ser capaz de convertirse en presidente
8888352 there is information that the sources of such funds may create problems for the party and the quantum of money expended clearly indicates efforts to corrupt the electoral process within the party
8888353 some aspirants have created a political block calling itself the most western rhodesia group which has the effect of undermining article 2 of our constitution that abhors all forms of discriminatory tendencies including regionalism and tribalism
8888354 in this respect i do not believe as national secretary that president mwanawasa who was a strong believer in democracy would have left a political will on succession in the party
8888355 if we can develop some stars for the future through this programme then that can only be a good thing
8888356 redcoats are renowned for going through tough training and by joining forces with the university we are showing our commitment to providing top quality entertainment
8888357 we are confident that the peak in euro area inflation took place in june july at 4 0 percent
8888358 the syndicates are depriving the country of billions in foreign currency
8888359 i have met with the officials of the nde so they want to help us train over 40 prison inmates what we are waiting for now is for them to give us the roster for the training schedule
8888360 we want nde officials to train the inmates so that after their jail terms we just give them after care equipment
8888361 the prison fundamentally is not meant for people awaiting trial but because of the large number of such people in the prisons the category of inmates we have are those awaiting trial
8888362 they put too much pressure on the infrastructures he said
8888363 because the percentage of the convicted ones we have is low
8888364 we have carpentry workshop tailoring bricklaying and photography among other vocations to ensure that the inmates are trained at different vocation centres in various prisons across the state
8888365 when they are discharged they are given after care equipment and with this they can continue with life
8888366 during this the accident i pulled the trigger and the bullet came out
8888367 even during the struggle i did not know that it was loaded
8888368 we have adopted a proactive approach to rid the city of beggars because early morning raid on friday august 22 2008 alone resulted in the arrest of 120 beggars and impounding of eight vehicles used in transporting them
8888369 we have since launched investigations into the matter and hope to catch up with the suspects very soon at the same time we urge members of the community to be wary of strangers as most of them turn out to be dangerous criminals
8888370 they drove us down to ikotun area two streets after a filling station and kept us in separate rooms in a house
8888371 due process of surveillance was carried out but the boy could not be declared missing until after 24 hours
8888372 i had to be sewn in each time i put a costume on and carefully unstitched when i took it off
8888373 once you were dressed that was it no chance of a toilet break because there were too many layers of clothing and i was too wide to fit into a loo cubicle
8888374 the urgency and the lust would have evaporated long before id got round to unlacing my final layer
8888375 le situazioni adesso sono irrilevanti lei ama il modo in cui io la eccito io amo il modo in cui lei respira
8888376 pi che altro sogno di restare con te per sempre
8888377 stammi a sentire ti amo pi di qualsiasi altra cosa al mondo senza eccezioni non ti basta
8888378 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno
8888379 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno
8888380 trowbridge is a growing town and thousands of people use the health services provided from the hospital every year
8888381 however the hospital building is very old and we want to build a new primary care centre to give local people the best health services in a modern building fit for the 21st century
8888382 but this vision for more and better health services will only become a reality if the community backs it and we are appealing to the people of trowbridge and surrounding towns to give us their support

8888409 he has been elected as the leader of the liberal party to take the liberal party to the next election and to win the next election and he will have my total and utter support in doing that

8888413 as ive said before id be very happy if he changes his mind thats his business
8888414 what dr nelson was referring to is that he would be very happy for mr costello to stay on in parliament the spokesman said
8888415 costello is undeniably the liberal partys best political asset now that howard has gone which is why so much turns on whether he recovers the will to serve which so clearly and understandably wavered in the aftermath of the election mr abbott wrote in
8888416 nobody ever objects when people say nice things about them he said
8888417 its very nice of tony to say nice things about me and i appreciate it very much hes an old friend of mine and i thank him

8888466 the taliban and the insurgents in general are getting closer to kabul there are some outlying districts of kabul where the government is reluctant to go
8888467 and certainly wardak province which is right to the west of kabul is largely under the control of the insurgents logar which is another province very close to kabul is also very heavily populated by the taliban and by insurgents so we are seeing very heavy activity in places that were previously considered fairly stable or safe right around kabul
8888468 we have to take a closer look at what we mean by taliban western media have put the label taliban on anyone with a grievance against the central government or the foreign forces and that group of people is growing day by day
8888469 there have been attacks on government forces and on coalition forces that we assume or are saying come from the taliban that does not necessarily mean that it is it could be militants linked to other political groups such as renegade commander gulbuddin hekmatyars hezb i islami it could be ad hoc or an independent insurgency if you will
8888470 they are actively carrying out a policy which will eventually lead them to lose their monopoly over the insurgency in fact it is already happening
8888471 the taliban are the predominant group in the insurgency but decreasingly so and there might be political consequences for them in the long run many insurgent groups would prioritize the consolidation of the insurgency under their leadership rather than have a diversified insurgency the fact that they go the other way i think is very significant why they do so is not totally clear except that of course the advantage is that it facilitates their geographical expansion
8888472 i believe that they probably tried very hard over the last few years to expand their own organization eastward and northward and they found that there are big difficulties because they didnt have much of a base in these areas they never had
8888473 and after trying and trying they decided that probably they didnt have the potential to do much military action and therefore resorted to alliances with other groups in order to transform their jihad movement into a national movement
8888474 in a recent report we did we were looking at taliban propaganda and one of the interesting findings there was that in fact there wasnt the kind of coordination between the different groups the antigovernment forces whether it was haqanni or the taliban or those that are more closely associated with al qaeda
8888475 there wasnt a strong degree of cooperation that we could identify at least from their writings in fact often they were blaming each other or criticizing people who were claiming to speak for the taliban saying they do not represent the taliban but what you are seeing is that they are all more successfully pursuing their objectives
8888476 there has been a growing body of people who are opposed to the central government and are opposed to the presence of foreign forces here
8888477 some are ready to make alliances among themselves at least in the short term that does not mean that they are all taliban and i think that should they prevail and the foreign forces were to leave there would be a lot of political fallout i do not think that these diverse groups share a common vision of what afghanistan could or should be minus the central government or the international presence
8888478 that component of the pakistani state that supports the insurgency does not necessarily want an outright victory by the taliban nor does not necessarily believe that such a victory is possible or even positive
8888479 there are people i think who would like that in pakistans intelligence and military
8888480 at the current stage we do not expect any sanctions to be decided by the european council

8888487 militants engaged coalition forces during their search of the compounds the forces responded with small arms fire killing the militants
8888488 almost a dozen militants were killed and two were detained
8888489 we believe that the 12 executions were an isolated incident and not part of a strategy to destabilize the state

8888497 it is concentrated in a capsule form in one particular area
8888498 there is also a possibility that karadzic will plead not guilty to all 11 counts as well as say that he is proud of what he did

8888502 accra has the potential to improve how we end this scandal of poverty but only if it helps poor people become the authors of their development
8888503 if we come to the irrevocable conclusion that we should have an election its not because we have polls that are any different than anybody else
8888504 its because that while weve had 2 1 2 years of government all the signs indicate that this parliament is at the end of its usefulness

8888513 there are a lot of things that are different between now and what we faced in 2005 when katrina came ashore
8888514 weve had three years to put together a plan that never existed before
8888515 its very very important that we play the way we practiced and trained over the last year and a half
8888516 theres a way that we operate theres a chain of command theres a way that we interact with each other and we cant afford to be in a disorganized way as we confront the challenges that were going to see here
8888517 we plan to sit in a bar and watch the whole thing
8888518 la situazione fortemente sconfortante commenta il segretario della cgia di mestre giuseppe bortolussi perch dimostra ancora una volta come pur in presenza di un peso tributario tanto elevato in italia non vengano destinate risorse adeguate per la casa per aiutare le famiglie indigenti i giovani i disabili e chi vive ai margini della societ
8888519 e evidente a tutti che le tasse cos elevate nel nostro paese sono la conseguenza di una spesa pubblica eccessiva
8888520 e innegabile che il problema degli evasori pesi sullitalia ma allora sarebbe anche opportuno studiare una strategia efficace affinch venga fatta emergere leconomica sommersa e si faccia pagare chi completamente sconosciuto al fisco
8888521 non c giustizia ed equit nel continuare a pagare pi degli altri avendo in cambio servizi pi scadenti in qualit e quantit dice ancora bortolussi e giunto ormai da tempo il momento di voltare pagina bisogna tagliare le intollerabili inefficienze della pubblica amministrazione per ridurre le imposte razionalizzando cos la spesa pubblica come avviene in tutti gli altri paesi europei
8888522 i wouldnt assume anything certainly thats our hope starcraft ii is ahead of diablo iii in the development cycle
8888523 it depends on whether you have a development team thats really committed to that idea if they were developing it from the ground up with that in mind then its certainly a possibility were developing starcraft ii for the ground up on the pc in mind and we dont have any intentions for taking it over to the console but you know it just depends on the development team their ambitions and their thoughts about it
8888524 one of our policies is to make investments in the blizzard brand and not take withdrawals we make investments in the brand by taking a long term view of the world and recognising that more damage is done by releasing a game thats not ready than the damage thats done by holding it for a little bit extra to make sure that its right

8888542 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8888543 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8888544 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8888545 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8888546 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8888547 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful

8888551 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8888552 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8888553 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8888554 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8888555 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8888556 im very proud to have been able to put this project together
8888557 i believe this new enterprise will bring a lot of excitement and glory to our country
8888558 its a unique situation to be able to take on two roles but i believe its a great asset for me not just to be the driver but to have a real involvement with the team structure
8888559 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8888560 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8888561 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8888562 i am confident that this year too we will be more or less correct on our assessment of gdp growth and the economy will grow close to eight per cent
8888563 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8888564 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8888565 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8888566 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8888567 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8888568 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8888569 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8888570 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8888571 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8888572 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8888573 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8888574 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
8888575 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
8888576 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
8888577 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8888578 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8888579 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8888580 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8888581 no one works for someone we all just work together
8888582 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8888583 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8888584 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8888585 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8888586 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8888587 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8888588 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8888589 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8888590 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8888591 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8888592 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8888593 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8888594 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8888595 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8888596 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8888597 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8888598 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8888599 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8888600 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8888601 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8888602 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8888603 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8888604 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8888605 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8888606 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8888607 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8888608 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
8888609 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8888610 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8888611 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8888612 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8888613 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8888614 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8888615 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8888616 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8888617 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8888618 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8888619 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8888620 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8888621 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8888622 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8888623 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8888624 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8888625 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8888626 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8888627 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8888628 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8888629 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8888630 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8888631 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8888632 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8888633 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8888634 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8888635 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8888636 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8888637 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8888638 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8888639 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8888640 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8888641 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8888642 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8888643 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8888644 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8888645 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8888646 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8888647 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8888648 gustav you are making the waiter uncomfortable im sure they will get the order right the third time ok natural selection what do you mean watch out hes got a spoon

8888744 i think its normal that a player says that he wants to leave and in the case of robinho i accept that as being totally normal it seems to me that its a mistake but its his problem
8888745 i think that his representatives are advising him very badly and i have a lot of faith in the lad i believe he has a lot of quality and could be successful here but i say it again that i have to defend the interests of this club in the best manner possible
8888746 the truth is i dont know the player continues having a contract with his club and as such we cannot do anything
8888747 i cant say anything about the coming year either because i dont know what is going to happen we dont even know if we are going to be here we hope that he comes touch wood but in a years time many things can happen
8888748 all the fans want to see a player like cristiano ronaldo here but i am convinced that in the same manner that manchester would love to see all our players in their team

8888760 there is a very real danger that this could lead to over salination the lower red line indicates the level at which the sustainability of the lake is threatened we are certainly very alarmed by the authorities willingness to go to the black line this development could well be irreversible
8888761 our cousins i say that because the bible says we are cousins have been drilling in areas they should not and this is diverting the water this is the politics of the middle east
8888762 they should be setting up manydesalination plants to get water from other sources theyre using israeli expertise in these matters all over the world but this is the one country which isnt using it enough i dont think it would be possible to deprive the farmers of their water so what is needed is alternative sources its that simple
8888763 quite big cracks are now appearing on the walls of our home that is due to the heat caused by the drought this is the hottest i can remember we desperately need some rain pretty soon maybe this is global warming

8888765 we used to say even a few years ago that one place where you couldnt go wrong fishing was kinneret hebrew name for the sea of galilee but now it is getting very very hard because the stocks are so low many fishermen fear for their livelihood and so do i but it seems no one really cares about us
8888766 of course many of the disciples of jesus were fishermen at galilee if you recall he said he would make them fishers of men well that wouldnt be possible now there are hardly any fish left around here

8888776 we in government have a responsibility to recognise the commitment and sacrifice our armed forces make for our country and in return we must look after them and their families to do this we need the entire government working together in a comprehensive and co ordinated way we also need to look at how we can make the best of the support offered by other organisations and charities who make an important and much appreciated contribution
8888777 iip recognition across the whole department is a fantastic achievement particularly as it has been attained against a backdrop of change programmes and intense operational demands the iip process is in effect an audit of what we are doing to improve our management of people and although there is much still to do recognition confirms that we are on the right track the mod recognises the importance of training and developing staff and is working hard to be an even better employer
8888778 with so many facets to the department communicating our overall goal was a true challenge investors in people is making an ongoing contribution to continuous improvements in our performance

8888784 anak2ku jikalau perkawinan amp hidup di dunia ini hanya untuk nafsu mungkin bapak akan menikah tapi ketahuilah dengan adanya ibu kalian disampingku itu sudah lebih dari cukup dia telah melahirkan kalian sejenak kerongkongannya tersekat kalian yg selalu kurindukan hadir didunia ini dengan penuh cinta yg tidak satupun dapat dihargai dengan apapun coba kalian tanya ibumu apakah dia menginginkan keadaannya seperti ini kalian menginginkan bapak bahagia apakah batin bapak bisa bahagia meninggalkan ibumu dengan keadaanya sekarang kalian menginginkan bapak yg masih diberi tuhan kesehatan dirawat oleh orang lain bagaimana dengan ibumu yg masih sakit

8888794 the new data confirm that the world will likely reach the first millennium development goal mdg of halving the 1990 level of poverty by 2015 and that poverty has fallen by about one percentage point a year since 1981
8888795 however the sobering news that poverty is more pervasive than we thought means we must redouble our efforts especially in sub saharan africa
8888796 the new estimates are a major advance in poverty measurement because they are based on far better price data for assuring that the poverty lines are comparable across countries

8888801 on our part as a church i urge all agents to allow officials of the electoral commission ec to come into the sunday worship meetings and to educate our members on the electoral processes especially how to use the ballot papers so that the spoilt votes will be reduced to the barest minimum this year
8888802 above all let us pray for gods guidance as we use our thumbprints to decide who the lord will choose to rule the nation for the next four years
8888803 i urge all our members to cast their votes on sunday the 7th of december for us to elect credible people to represent us as our leaders
8888804 it is in the light of this that we appeal to all the parties and their members to exercise restraint in the event of any extreme provocations before during and after the electioneering
8888805 so we dont need any human sacrifice to atone for our sins
8888806 this is our belief and this is what we must proclaim loud and clear as we put on the whole armour of god
8888807 we told the ec to ensure that there was adequate funds released for the programmes that they had lined up to avoid any mishaps
8888808 it has behaved irresponsibly by creating al those problems and called for the resignation of the chairman of the commission
8888809 he was bent on getting the register bloated from day one and because we detected it and had it corrected he has managed to use another means to get the number of voters in the register increased
8888810 this should not be an issue for one political party alone to address but i believe we all in the game should work at ensuring that the register is clean before the december polls
8888811 it will create chaotic scenes in many parts of the country which could trigger something nasty for the country
8888812 can you imagine what will happen when people with multiple names in the register are being prevented from voting within their party strongholds

8888844 as far as im concerned the liberal party leadership is a team of dr nelson and julie bishop and im supporting them
8888845 i intend to keep on serving the people of higgins he said
8888846 peters made his decision that he did not seek the leadership of the party he told reporters
8888847 as ive said before id be very happy if he changes his mind thats his business
8888848 what dr nelson was referring to is that he would be very happy for mr costello to stay on in parliament the spokesman said
8888849 costello is undeniably the liberal partys best political asset now that howard has gone which is why so much turns on whether he recovers the will to serve which so clearly and understandably wavered in the aftermath of the election mr abbott wrote in
8888850 nobody ever objects when people say nice things about them he said

8888859 anees bhai is keeping tight lipped about the entire offer since he would rather sign on the dotted line before making any declaration of sorts however the fact is that the day singh is kinng was released and declared a success on the basis of sheer opening he has been inundated with offers by one and all so many producers out there just want him to take up their projects and are not even worried about the figure he may quote however one such offer that seems to be in serious contention has come from a top corporate house
8888860 not just that anees bhai has been offered 51 crores to direct three films and given full freedom to pick subjects and actors of his choice over a period of time he has also been extended flat 21 crores as a signing amount it is an unheard of money and quite unprecedented something of this scale has never happened before for a bollywood director but anees bhais track record has forced producers to talk big money
8888861 it wont be fair on my part to comment on the number part since it is best left to be announced by the people who are making an offer in any case temptations like these arent new to me because ever since

8888882 he was daft as a brush and was always the centre of attention he came across as if he were confident he loved a party and if there was karaoke on he would always be up even though he couldnt sing at all he loved to entertain everyone
8888883 i will think about showing his pictures in an exhibition in the future she said
8888884 he had thousands of pictures filed he wanted to show mainly of our two dogs thomas and simon and landscapes
8888885 we would go out walking on holidays to isle of skye and he would take pictures of landscapes
8888886 he was a happy go lucky guy he liked the simple things in life he wasnt interested in material things
8888887 ki tu tan mlanm olmakla birlikte iki tu tan fazlas da kontrol sinyali retmek i in kullan labilir
8888888 we are still in a turnaround period and our costs have continued to outpace our income as we vigorously invest in the future of this global brand
8888889 the first half of 2008 has been a significant period for imperial operationally we have addressed our earlier production issues and with oil now flowing through our third new pipeline we are rapidly increasing production with funding now in place and encouraging new results from kiev eganskoye we are confident of delivering on our objectives
8888890 weve got a lot of young players in the squad who havent won many trophies and this club is all about winning thats a good mentality to have
8888891 it applies to every game and it keeps the appetite in the squad were all looking forward to fridays game and were desperate to win it
8888892 theres a little bit of a fun celebratory element involved because its not the be all and end all but its a match between the european and uefa cup champions so its certainly a big game
8888893 i watched them in the uefa cup a lot last season and actually went to the final ive played against a couple of their players before in international games so i know what theyre about
8888894 im going to be the new boy and i aint got a fucking clue how things work there

8888898 one things for sure its not going to be easy this season
8888899 i fly constantly to gigs i usually fly about 150 000 to 200 000 miles a year i dont think id be able to continue my career as a freelance theatrical designer if i just worked in los angeles
8888900 i know that goes against our national values which puts the specialist ahead of the generalist i would argue that given the economics of theatre the generalist is vastly more valuable than the specialist and that theatre history bears this out moliere was a great playwright and the leading actor for his company and the head of the company shakespeare was a great playwright and an actor in his company and one of the owners of the company the specialist is a symptom of our industrial approach to the creation of theatre art a model that is fast becoming economical unworkable
8888901 the donmar is not just thinking outside the box but producing outside of it now too and it could have a galvanising effect on the way the west end works
8888902 yet again demonstrates that if you want some sustained public thinking about art blogs are the place to go
8888903 i had been obsessed with him since he was 19 and already a fixture in leicester citys first team
8888904 in english football only peter taylor has had a keener eye for a player in the last 50 years

8888918 we have completed a cursory search of the annexe part of the main building which is relatively intact following the fire
8888919 officers have completed a search of the outbuildings and are now in the process of removing vehicles from the site we will enter the main part of the house today and forensic specialists will begin the lengthy painstaking process of sifting and examining all the contents
8888920 there is extensive debris at the site and it will take some days possibly several weeks to complete this part of the investigation we will be seeking to build up a picture of the circumstances leading up to the fire
8888921 im aware there is a lot of speculation concerning this incident and we are anxious to clarify the exact circumstances as soon as possible
8888922 hindu and christian peace committees have been meeting and the leaders have appealed for calm
8888923 my elbow hurts like hell i guess id better see a doctor
8888924 listen you dont have to spend that kind of money
8888925 theres a diagnostic computer down at wal mart just give it a urine sample and the computer will tell you whats wrong and what to do about it it takes ten seconds and costs 10 a lot cheap er than a doctor
8888926 we need to be better its as simple as that
8888927 thats a game we should have won again thats the last two games we should have won and we all know it
8888928 this action presents a dramatic story of intrigue car bombing conspiracy video technology and murder in short plaintiffs allege that hundreds of defendants engaged in a massive conspiracy to violate their civil rights and in the process contributed to the enron bankruptcy and the presidency of george w bush in plaintiffs words plaintiffs depict a conspiratorial pattern of fraud deceit and misrepresentation that runs so wide and so deep that it tears at the very fabric and becomes the litmus test of what has come to be known as free commerce through inventors rights and due process in this country and in that the circumstances involve inventors rights tears at the very fabric of the democracy protected under the constitution of the united states
8888929 if you think the stupid things that people say are important then you value yourself based on that women walk around with this weight in their heads that prevents them from doing things
8888930 science is not difficult because people think it is they dont end up doing it you dont have to be exceptional to be a scientist people like us are normal weve just worked hard im not marie curie i am just a microbiologist
8888931 perhaps it is ingrained into our dna to be so submissive because weve been that way for so long
8888932 we all talk about politics and different crises at home we dont talk about science if we did it will help to encourage more people to get involved
8888933 le bugie stanno alla base di tutti i gruppi sociali tanto che non solo gli uomini ma anche gli animali ne fanno uso
8888934 le femmine di scimmia per esempio approfittano dellassenza del loro compagno
8888935 i tripped and rolled down two flights of stairs in the subway nearly killed myself
8888936 95 of them reported their tattoo having either completely disappeared or barely visible
8888937 after two months of using the cream you could barely see it and now im just finishing the final tube of cream which is my fifth month and it has nearly gone
8888938 i am just totally shocked by it i definitely recommend it
8888939 we have a really high success rate unlike other treatments which can burn you skin ours doesnt and well give a full refund after six months if customers arent happy with the results
8888940 theres no scientific evidence that these things work i think theyre really expensive and theres no given of any outcome my advice would be to avoid them
8888941 i cannot understand what cream could safely dissolve the tattoo i would urge people to speak to their doctor before putting anything on their skin
8888942 its a bit like deciding to have a facelift you need to give good thought to it and remember theyre permanent

8888949 hes really clever because every interview ive done in the last week has mentioned oasis
8888950 rain rain go a way come back a no ther day
8888951 weve re dedicated ourselves to work in this area performance in windows 7 and ie 8
8888952 this is a major initiative across each of our feature teams as well as the primary mission of one of our feature teams
8888953 im somewhat sceptical how much improvement theyre going to make at this point
8888954 anyone checking any code into windows 7 not only has to make sure its the most secure code and the most reliable code but theyd better be addressing the performance of the code as well
8888955 keep the cpu utilization low as that improves multi user scenarios as well as reduces power consumption
8888956 chris should be okay for hull he had a spasm while we were away in pre season and it tightens up and stiffens up a bit but we dont think it is anything too serious
8888957 he has been to see specialists and were okay with him hes comfortable with the whole situation at the moment so we dont think there is really anything to unduly worry us
8888958 he wants to work from seven oclock in the morning through until midnight if you would allow him to so we are going to have to pull in the reins a bit
8888959 nikola is a player we have looked at and spoken too but we will not be taking it any further
8888960 we have already identified other targets and are working tirelessly trying to get a couple of players in before the deadline on monday
8888961 he has been elected as the leader of the liberal party to take the liberal party to the next election and to win the next election and he will have my total and utter support in doing that
8888962 as far as im concerned the liberal party leadership is a team of dr nelson and julie bishop and im supporting them
8888963 i intend to keep on serving the people of higgins
8888964 peters made his decision that he did not seek the leadership of the party
8888965 as ive said before id be very happy if he changes his mind thats his business
8888966 what dr nelson was referring to is that he would be very happy for mr costello to stay on in parliament
8888967 costello is undeniably the liberal partys best political asset now that howard has gone which is why so much turns on whether he recovers the will to serve which so clearly and understandably wavered in the aftermath of the election
8888968 nobody ever objects when people say nice things about them
8888969 as an industry we need to begin setting some basic common sense standards that reward pc gamers for purchasing our games
8888970 the console market effectively already has something like this in that its games have to go through the platform maker such as nintendo microsoft or sony but on the pc publishers can release games that are scarcely completed poorly supported and full of intrusive copy protection and then be stuck on it
8888971 this is an awesome framework for the industry to aspire to and ultimately so that we can provide our customers with the gaming experience that they have wanted for years and really deserve
8888972 the pc market loses out on a lot of sales because a significant percentage of our market has pcs that may or may not be adequate to run our games without the ability to return games to the publisher for a refund many potential buyers simply pass on games they might otherwise have bought due to the risk of not being certain a game will work on their pc the average consumer doesnt know what pixel shader 2 0 support means for instance
8888973 i finished sixth which was one of my best results of the season
8888974 the important thing for the team at the moment is that weve identified where improvements can be made with the fw30 and are making the necessary adjustments to take us into the final few races
8888975 the work everyone at the factory is putting in should help us out in spa were not going to make a huge jump but well definitely be heading in the right direction
8888976 im really looking forward to the belgian grand prix because spa is an amazing race track it will be difficult to score points there but you can never predict what will happen somewhere like spa so well have to wait and see
8888977 its going to be the first time ive driven a formula 1 car around spa so my first priority will be to learn the circuit and to find out how the car behaves on this track
8888978 i have of course driven spa while racing in gp2 so know what a great racing track it is
8888979 it was an operation to wire his jaw and he remains in intensive care

8889004 one of the key components of axials future success will be achieving appropriate levels of insurance coverage for our products and ms wolfs vast experience in this area is second to none in addition she brings to our company an unparalleled level of understanding of the complex and rapidly evolving regulatory landscape around molecular diagnostics
8889005 i am extremely excited to serve in this new capacity and for a company that has the potential to do so much to improve the quality of health care
8889006 i believe axial biotech will provide the opportunity to assist in the fulfillment of the promise of molecular diagnostics and personalized medicine in the orthopedic spine arena i am looking forward to putting the knowledge that i have accumulated to work to lessen reimbursement barriers for the innovative molecular diagnostic assays that the company is in the process of developing

8889009 the soul mate myth is destructive because it will keep you from forming authentic relationships that have a chance to thrive instead of fail
8889010 dont marry because you think you have found your soul mate it is bound to buckle under the unbearable weight of expected perfection
8889011 it seems to me that people are looking for a clone
8889012 he supports me he believes in me marriage cant be me me me what does he get out of it
8889013 nowadays it doesnt have to be that women want to marry a doctor because she is the doctor
8889014 have fun in your 20s get a good job get married have a family that path will make some women happy but for others it wont
8889015 some people get married too quickly without really knowing each other well enough some people get married because of tax es or health insurance and other financial benefits
8889016 some people get married because they feel like its the expected thing to do or they dont want to be alone or because theyre ready to start a family
8889017 getting married is not the only life choice available for a happy life
8889018 the most important thing is that i continue to grow as a person i want to be the happiest person i can possibly be
8889019 if that means i end up staying single for the rest of my life because i havent found the right mate thats perfectly all right with me im fine with taking on the role of the hip spinster aunt to my siblings kids

8889032 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory
8889033 the regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of russia they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear

8889087 it was not quite dawn yet paris was waking in the distance anatole could hear the sounds of delivery carts wooden traps over the cobbles delivering milk and freshly baked bread to the cafes and bars of the faubourg montmartre he stopped to put on his shoes the rue feydeau was deserted there was no sound except the clip of his heels on the pavement deep in thought anatole walked quickly to the junction with the rue saint marc intending to cut through the arcade of the passage des panoramas he saw no one heard no one
8889088 by the time a smoggy and hesitant dawn broke over the offices of the commissariat of police of the eighth arrondissement in the rue de lisbonne tempers were already frayed the body of a woman identified as madame marguerite vernier has been discovered shortly after eight oclock on the evening of sunday september 20 the news had been telephoned in from one of the new public booths on the corner of the rue de berlin and the rue damsterdam by a reporter from le petit journal
8889089 in the next stack she discovered a first edition of maistres voyage autour de ma chambre it was battered and dog eared unlike anatoles pristine copy at home in another alcove she found a collection of both religious and fervently antireligious texts grouped together as if to cancel one another out in the section devoted to contemporary french literature there was a set of zolas rougon macquart novels as well as flaubert maupassant and huysmans indeed many of the intellectually improving texts anatole tried in vain to press upon her even a first edition of stendhals le rouge et le noir there were a few works in translation but nothing entirely to her taste except for baudelaires translations of monsieur poe nothing by madame radcliffe or monsieur le fanu the first was dogme et rituel de la haute magie by liphaas l vi next to it was a volume titled trait m thodique de science occulte on the shelf above several other writings by papus court de g belin etteilla and macgregor mathers she had never read such authors but knew they were occultist writers and considered subversive their names appeared regularly in the columns of newspapers and periodicals

8889135 desde el gobierno de navarra se ha hecho una apuesta muy importante por la expo del agua y sobre todo por el tema que nos ocupa el agua y el desarrollo sostenible de ah que todas las actividades que estamos llevando a cabo a trav s de nuestro pabell n independientemente de la parte m s art stica o l dica con la actuaci n de grupos musicales tanto en la expo como en la plaza del pilar quieren demostrar lo que se est haciendo en navarra en el tema del agua y el desarrollo sostenible
8889136 por un lado todo nuestro respeto medioambiental y nuestra apuesta por las energ as renovables y el tratamiento del agua como un elemento esencial para el desarrollo humano
8889137 por eso estamos explicando la situaci n de la comunidad foral en temas como la reforestaci n por ejemplo tambi n en depuraci n de aguas residuales en que el 97 de la poblaci n depura sus aguas residuales o incluso cuestiones relacionadas con el desarrollo sostenible y el compromiso humano
8889138 if you want change it is time for latinos and for immigrants to rally behind the next president of the united states barack obama tonight i ask my friends in the latino community in the immigrant community please join me because barack obama is the change we need
8889139 w hen barack obama occupies the white house that is the community our president will defend and respect by fighting for comprehensive immigration reform reform that keeps mothers and children and families together reform that brings hard working people out of the shadows of disgrace and into the sunlight of dignity that enforces our laws keeps our borders secure and our nation safe
8889140 you know who is in charge now the gestapo agents at homeland security they are in charge
8889141 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
8889142 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
8889143 before the tournament i was not imagining it this way like it happened today
8889144 so i guess maybe now im going to think about like keep playing
8889145 i thought she was maybe nervous more than i was
8889146 you would not believe the number of calls we get from people who dont know were open
8889147 todd would like to make the greens here something to brag about
8889148 as much for his peace of mind as anything hes going to go see dr andrews this morning
8889149 while its something we could have done without in the long term it wont cause a big issue
8889150 we are anxious to see delivery of the regeneration of the whole city centre and this is an important scheme within that
8889151 the april date was probably a little artificial but i think we should look forward and this is an excellent scheme now that will bring lots of lots of people down to the river
8889152 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8889153 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8889154 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8889155 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8889156 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8889157 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8889158 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
8889159 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
8889160 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
8889161 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
8889162 we are talking about a transfer that will be valid from january 5 we had an offer we could not refuse
8889163 the offer is only comparable with karel poborskys transfer to manchester united
8889164 everton have agreed a deal to sign louis saha from manchester united
8889165 the frenchman is set to sign a two year deal with the option for a third year with the blues for an undisclosed fee the move will be completed subject to a medical

8889167 major was affable and had a booming economy in 97
8889168 its only a year since party members trade unions and mps unanimously voted for gordon to become our leader
8889169 let me make this very clear party members and the public will never forgive mps and others who force labour to go through another leadership election in less than two years
8889170 we need a keynesian we have been in a similar crisis before and only keynesian regulation dug us out of it
8889171 its our nations backs against the wall and lets start competing our way out of this
8889172 we need a keynesian we have been in a similar crisis before and only keynesian regulation dug us out of it
8889173 party members and the public will never forgive mps and others who force labour to go through another leadership election in less than two years
8889174 vote tory get thatcher she shall rise from the grave to consume you
8889175 looking for work is deemed to be paid employment because it has the prospect of being paid if you find work
8889176 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8889177 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8889178 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8889179 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8889180 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8889181 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8889182 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8889183 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8889184 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8889185 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8889186 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8889187 we have projected to have a revenue of us 4 5 mn within next 12 months and majority of it will be coming from advertisements
8889188 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8889189 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8889190 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8889191 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8889192 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8889193 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8889194 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8889195 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8889196 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8889197 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8889198 we are extremely grateful to the chancellor for welcoming us
8889199 it is a great honour to have the opportunity to make what is a very important announcement for the whole country in a building that is filled with history this symbolic gesture also underlines the chancellors enormous interest in womens football from the very outset the federal government has spared no effort to ensure that this womens world cup is an outstanding success as was the case with the world cup in 2006
8889200 the interest being shown by the national media is a good indicator of the enthusiasm being generated by the womens world cup around the country
8889201 we are very happy to produce this broadcast in conjunction with radio berlin brandenburg it is our aim to offer ards viewers a quality programme that is both entertaining and enlightening
8889202 the chance to host matches at the womens world cup could have a considerable impact on some regions and help raise their profile we will be taking all the documents presented by each candidate into consideration as well as the conclusions reached on our visits to the different venues
8889203 the selection of the host cities represents the first step on the road leading to the womens world cup in germany
8889204 thanks to this tour of inspection we have seen for ourselves that the country boasts a number of magnificent sites work has already begun in cities such as augsburg sinsheim and dresden and in a few short months the fans will be able to see some fantastic stadiums where it will be a pleasure to go and watch games
8889205 we are faced with a dilemma each venue must stage enough matches to make the venture a profitable one on the other hand we would also like to see as many cities as possible come and join the party
8889206 all the representatives have impressed us with their utter dedication and their abilities some have also been very pleasant and some have even moved us above all we have felt a great sense of motivation and on almost every occasion leading local dignitaries have taken the time to come and meet us
8889207 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8889208 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8889209 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8889210 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8889211 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8889212 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8889213 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8889214 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8889215 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8889216 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8889217 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8889218 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8889219 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8889220 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8889221 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8889222 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8889223 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8889224 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8889225 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8889226 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8889227 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8889228 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8889229 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8889230 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8889231 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8889232 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8889233 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8889234 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8889235 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8889236 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8889237 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8889238 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8889239 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8889240 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8889241 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8889242 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8889243 que tienen los estudiantes en este apartado y a juicio de la responsable de educaci n
8889244 last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom
8889245 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8889246 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you its about you
8889247 what happens from here on in wont matter i just had to be here
8889248 obama represents a down payment on the fulfillment of martins dream
8889249 youre going to have a whole hell of a lot of me because im coming home
8889250 theres a lot of people i should recognize because as they say you brung me up
8889251 if i hear by the way if i hear one more time that he was 11 years old when i went to the senate im going to smack somebody
8889252 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8889253 our whole goal is to turn the 75 000 people here in this stadium into grassroots volunteers
8889254 this is all about neighbors talking to neighbors family members talking to family members
8889255 this all started because we asked our customers what they liked about our stores and what they didnt like
8889256 more cosmetic changes like changing signs and names are creative but dont address that more fundamental problem of competitive pricing
8889257 it is just not like the state stores when i grew up they are very well run well prepared
8889258 senator mccain likes to talks about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8889259 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families
8889260 but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8889261 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8889262 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8889263 fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8889264 philadelphia is a good city in which to write american history
8889265 this is fitting ground on which to reaffirm the faith of our fathers to pledge ourselves to restore to the people a wider freedom to give to 1936 as the founders gave to 1776 an american way of life
8889266 clouds of suspicion tides of ill will and intolerance gather darkly in many places
8889267 a mysterious cycle in human events to some generations much is given of other generations much is expected this generation of americans has a rendezvous with destiny
8889268 we dont have the same kind of economic crisis as in the great depression
8889269 but we have a serious banking and financial crisis we have a war whether youre for it or against it that has gone on for five years longer than the second world war and you have a hunger for leadership
8889270 senator obama this is truly a good day for america too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations
8889271 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8889272 this is sen mccains decision and his announcement and we all want to be respectful of his desire to have the chance to announce it himself
8889273 said leslie pierce and catching her husbands eye began to laugh as he chimed in
8889274 they taught me how to carry myself the value of a firm handshake how to look someone in the eye when you speak to them
8889275 we had a roof over our head we each had a bed and we had clothes to wear to church every sunday
8889276 i remember white people standing on the corners spitting and foaming at the mouth
8889277 but most things that influenced you as a child you carry through life
8889278 we had just brought in groceries from the pantry pride on stenton avenue my mother was putting the bags on the counter when i heard the news
8889279 and i remember the skies lighting up on columbia avenue during the riots
8889280 and the day after he was shot i huddled in a corner at school i was afraid that something might happen to us
8889281 every single day ive always had to work at this level
8889282 ninety nine percent of the time i feel im guarding my color now this man this black man is getting ready to accept the nomination to be president of the united states if he coughs wrong theyre going to scrutinize every thing he does
8889283 you sit in class and hear about the ways blacks were treated you read about it and watch documentaries like eyes on the prize then you fast forward 45 years to today with a black man running for president and wonder is this the same country with the fire hoses and dogs attacking blacks who were taking a nonviolent approach to civil rights
8889284 but seeing where obama is shows that america has grown peoples minds are open to something new
8889285 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8889286 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time
8889287 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8889288 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8889289 thats not the judgment we need that wont keep america safe
8889290 we need a president who can face the threats of the future not keep grasping at the ideas of the past
8889291 well i know something about close elections so let me offer you my opinion i believe this election is close today mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8889292 they claim that our insistence on something larger something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a trojan horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values
8889293 and thats to be expected because if you dont have any fresh ideas then you use stale tactics to scare the voters if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from
8889294 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8889295 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8889296 critical information about the quality of peoples drinking water they should be warning the public
8889297 if your well does not meet standards you should have to put treatment on it
8889298 internal scientific interest a statistical presentation for the counties we havent had people asking for this type of stuff
8889299 its up to them to decide what level of activity to take
8889300 lets put it this way when people buy homes and you decide youre going to have your own well at home you ought to pay some attention to that
8889301 i dont believe any state in the nation makes individual domestic well compliance with contaminant levels part of state compliance
8889302 if there are more than 50 000 homes with problem wells they could all theoretically get on the phone today real estate deals could go down this could create problems and headaches
8889303 you would expect more from a state agency that is supposed to be protecting peoples health
8889304 may literally have no training this is not something you dump on the local level
8889305 if one guys well is contaminated its probable that another guys is
8889306 at a minimum written notice telling neighbors to sample their wells warning of a problem
8889307 now the beauty of it is coming out this is what the founding fathers wanted to come about
8889308 since she didnt win my second vote is for obama
8889309 we all have dreams i wanted to be here to join in its about unity
8889310 theres a lot of excitement throughout pennsylvania about this campaign our supporters are excited that barack obama is finally officially our nominee for president they want to get together to celebrate this
8889311 the supporters across the state did say lets get together there are more than 200 locations across the state ranging from a few people in somebodys home to lots of students on a college campus somewhere its definitely a historic speech
8889312 i think its everyones obligation to make the effort to come out
8889313 these are the worst conditions that the country has seen for a long time and together we can make it different
8889314 bin ich mir absolut sicher dass ich in diesem peisbereich noch nie einen so guten wein getrunken habe in der regel liegen weine auf diesem niveau zwischen 15 und 30 euro
8889315 big red demon brought to earth by the nazis with a great big stone hand
8889316 i never would have been born if my dad hadnt have dropped out of university and met my mum at work
8889317 my mum and i would never have been born if my nana had moved to canada as planned because she wouldnt have met my taid
8889318 i never would have been born if my dad hadnt have dropped out of university and met my mum at work
8889319 my mum and i would never have been born if my nana had moved to canada as planned because she wouldnt have met my taid

8889330 it is one of the more unusual things we had had to rescue an animal from
8889331 young cows are quite curious and she probably thought there was some food inside the drum
8889332 most people hate to see fly tipping as it is an ugly blight on the landscape but incidents like these highlight that as well as the visual impact the rubbish can also endanger animals
8889333 the heifer was probably curious to see a new item dumped in the field and curiosity would have turned to panic once she got her head stuck in the drum and was unable to get it out
8889334 if people disposed of their rubbish properly many animals would be saved from injury and death
8889335 a large proportion of the injuries the societys inspectors animal collection officers vets and wildlife hospitals deal with are caused by carelessly discarded rubbish and fishing litter
8889336 it is requested that members do not partake of any refreshment until after the iftar refreshments are served
8889337 at no stage have we imposed ramadan arrangements on all staff and to say we have stopped staff having tea and biscuits is wrong
8889338 a memo was sent and we acknowledge it may have been worded slightly better
8889339 whatever is normally provided during meetings before ramadan will still be there during it
8889340 it seems that the council are backpedalling they should be a bit more careful about what they say
8889341 i am more than happy for the requirements to be put in place for muslim staff observing ramadan but i was unhappy about these provisions being extended to all staff
8889342 i took the memo to mean that no food or water could be consumed during daylight hours while at the council
8889343 there is absolutely no suggestion that during ramadan non muslim councillors have been asked to refrain from eating or drinking when muslims are observing the fast
8889344 as normal water will be provided at council meetings taking place during ramadan
8889345 tea coffee iftar packs and non iftar snacks will be available in a separate room
8889346 all thats being asked for is courtesy to be shown to the sensitivities around some councillors eating during the council meetings while others in the room are fasting
8889347 non muslim councillors have simply been asked to ensure that there is iftar food available for muslim councillors because in previous years muslim councillors wanting to break their fast following prayers had found that iftar packs had been eaten
8889348 we think it will be a deterrent it is not a fine but we hope it will deter people by giving them a choice
8889349 99 9 of exeter residents are excellent the city has doubled its recycling rate of 35 over the last four years
8889350 it says it all that under this government hardworking households who put their bins out on the wrong day get clobbered with larger fines than shoplifters
8889351 if labour is not imposing bin fines its forcing bin cuts and introducing bin taxes this will be hard for the public to stomach who are already struggling with the spiralling cost of living
8889352 people genuinely want to improve recycling and go green but labours bin policies will harm the environment by causing a surge in fly tipping and fuelling public resentment at town hall bin bullies
8889353 council tax has doubled under labour and all the public have got in return are cutbacks to local services
8889354 receiving investors in people status is a fantastic achievement for an organisation of our age and size
8889355 we recognise that our employees are the heart of the organisation by investing in our people we have created a strong team of ambassadors for our work within the social housing sector
8889356 being encouraged to apply for champion status is a great reward for the trust too our application for iips premier status will be progressed in the coming months
8889357 we need to concentrate efforts to slash carbon emissions and become more energy efficient in order to prevent dangerous climate change but we also need to prepare for how our climate is expected to change in the future
8889358 the strategy i am launching today outlines in detail the range of weather conditions facing london which could both seriously threaten our quality of life particularly that of the most vulnerable people and endanger our pre eminence as one of the worlds leading cities
8889359 if you look at the stern report and you look at the risks that are involved in catastrophic climate change we have got to guard against it
8889360 this is a structure thats built to guard against a catastrophic event that has not yet happened but weve got to be ready to cope with it
8889361 we have to be realistic about the risks posed by climate change and make sure the city is in a position to cope

8889440 our proposals for getting to grips with alcohol misuse have sparked a lively debate across scottish society
8889441 this government has taken the bull by the horns and put forward radical measures to re balance scotlands relationship with alcohol because we dont want to see future generations suffer
8889442 we believe its time for action but we want the scottish people to understand where were coming from and tell us what they think thats why i want to encourage people in edinburgh and the lothians to respond to the consultation before it closes on september 9
8889443 if someone is queuing up at the post office every week to get their benefits it implies they dont have a bank account and the same goes for bill payments
8889444 when you are going to cause a great deal of inconvenience and difficulty to the people who are the most vulnerable in society you need to think again
8889445 the very least they should do is organise some alternative facility even once a week would help
8889446 ive got emphysema and spondilitis and i have to use a walking frame
8889447 all these people are going to be descending on bonnyrigg is it going to be like wimbledon with us having to camp out in tents in the queue
8889448 further cuts to the network risk leaving many vulnerable older people socially isolated and struggling to access essential services
8889449 a lot of people use the post office to get their pension and benefits not just because its close but because its a social hub and they meet a lot of friends there
8889450 the uk government has made it quite clear we need to return the post office network back into profit and they have already made the decision that 2500 post offices across the uk have to close
8889451 post office ltd is following strict access criteria laid down by the uk government where in urban areas 99 per cent of the population should be within a mile of a post office
8889452 part of the consultation which is currently running for six weeks is to hear from customers on any issues they may have on how they will be disadvantaged in accessing alternative services
8889453 once you have decided to cross the river and you get half way across to turn back is a stupid thing to do we are more than half way across and we have got to get to the other side
8889454 please try and get behind the new body and make it work better
8889455 we are committed to a greater visible police presence deterring crime and reassuring our citizens this welcome increase in the number of officers is in part the result of our direct recruitment of new officers over and above the recruitment plans of our police forces
8889456 we have set out plans to deliver a more visible policing presence on scotlands streets and make an additional 1000 officers available in our communities
8889457 we are not just delivering on this but going substantially beyond by also looking at recruitment retention and redeployment
8889458 last year as we promised 150 officers were recruited and paid for by the scottish government and are currently working in scotlands communities
8889459 this year we are directly funding the recruitment of another 450 over and above forces previous plans
8889460 we inherited the lowest recruitment since devolution with many officers due to retire weve tackled that challenge head on and although these latest figures are reassuring there remains much work to be done but we are confident the resources and policies now in place will deliver improved policing for scotland
8889461 if this money is to be used effectively it needs to be spent in the areas of the country that have the most acute shortage of affordable homes
8889462 this money could allow us to build some of the 12 000 new affordable homes which are badly needed in the city
8889463 but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8889464 the truth is on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives on health care and education and the economy senator mccain has been anything but independent
8889465 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know why else would he define middle class as someone making under five million dollars a year how else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million americans how else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax peoples benefits or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college or a plan that would privatize social security and gamble your retirement its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8889466 that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
8889467 to own their failure its time for us to change america and thats why im running for president of the united states
8889468 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8889469 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8889470 if john mccain wants to follow george bush with more tough talk and bad strategy that is his choice but it is not the change that america needs
8889471 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8889472 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
8889473 you can learn little from victory you can learn everything from defeat

8889477 we are an export nation if you stop people exporting to us they will stop us exporting to them
8889478 the quarantine protocols we howard government put in place are the toughest they have ever been

8889480 the symptoms of fire blight need to be assessed in all of chinas provinces not just the four provinces that export pears
8889481 there is a number of staff that have indicated to us they would like to take voluntary redundancies

8889537 two payments were made that became controversial one of them was a n100 million lodged with etb and the other one was the 20 million so that one for etb which you mentioned about gsm no kobo was lost every kobo was paid by to the fund
8889538 the bank tib was bought over by spring bank spring bank entered an agreement with the management of ptdf and agreed to be paying up 2 million every quarter so far they have paid 14 million and they have never failed every quarter they give us 2 million we entered into an agreement with them which was approved by the former president and they pay with interest
8889539 for example most of the projects we adopt in good faith actually for example the bulk of projects we are used to financing are science activities being initiated by the ministry of science and technology

8889552 in the last 15 months or so the entire people of the south west have had the undeserved course to contend with a vicious opposition to their quest for development and indeed their resolve to remain in the mainstream of the nations politics
8889553 it is therefore another development worth celebrating not only by members of the peoples democratic party but the entire people of the south west in general
8889554 onis victory is the beginning of the eventual triumph of voice of reason over greed inconsistence and selfishness

8889556 in unequivocal terms the judiciary has once again displayed its readiness to protect the nations democracy against political hawks and brigands
8889557 a particular aspect worth commending is the painstaking and elaborate manner in which the verdict was delivered by the revered tribunal
8889558 the usual live coverage of proceedings at the tribunal goes a long way to show that the members had nothing to hide against this background the judiciary has avoided unnecessary controversies and suspicion arising from similar situations

8889598 although the behaviour of individuals is often simple the collective patterns to which it leads can be counter intuitive making common sense a faulty guide to what might happen for example it is generally true that traffic jams become more likely as traffic density increases its not always the case though as helbings group has shown consider a two lane road carrying both cars and trucks where the cars are moving faster on average at low traffic densities the cars have plenty of space to overtake and can easily pass the trucks as the traffic density increases drivers find it more difficult to overtake because other vehicles are in the way however evidence from simulations and real traffic flows shows that at a critical density of traffic the obstruction to lane changing begins to have a beneficial effect because drivers tend to stay in one lane they disturb the flow of traffic less leading to a higher total throughput of vehicles

8889682 the soul mate myth is destructive because it will keep you from forming authentic relationships that have a chance to thrive instead of fail
8889683 dont marry because you think you have found your soul mate it is bound to buckle under the unbearable weight of expected perfection
8889684 it seems to me that people are looking for a clone
8889685 he supports me he believes in me marriage cant be me me me what does he get out of it
8889686 nowadays it doesnt have to be that women want to marry a doctor because she is the doctor
8889687 have fun in your 20s get a good job get married have a family that path will make some women happy but for others it wont
8889688 some people get married too quickly without really knowing each other well enough some people get married because of tax es or health insurance and other financial benefits
8889689 some people get married because they feel like its the expected thing to do or they dont want to be alone or because theyre ready to start a family
8889690 getting married is not the only life choice available for a happy life
8889691 the most important thing is that i continue to grow as a person i want to be the happiest person i can possibly be
8889692 if that means i end up staying single for the rest of my life because i havent found the right mate thats perfectly all right with me im fine with taking on the role of the hip spinster aunt to my siblings kids

8889698 people still are used to deflation and now theyre starting to see the prices of their daily necessities going up sharply
8889699 the package may be able to put out some of the sparks caused by rising prices but it is unlikely to extinguish the origins of the flame
8889700 what the japanese economy needs are not makeshift measures but action to drastically change the economic structure so that japan can survive the rapidly changing circumstances in the global economy
8889701 signs that economic activity is proving fairly resilient as well as growing hope that inflation is close to a peak means there is little sense of desperation among policy makers
8889702 i think he is feeling sorry for himself because with a bit of luck he will never get out
8889703 but at least he is alive and can do things like watch tv and eat food none of the girls can do that
8889704 if we still had the death penalty like we did years ago he would not be alive and he would not have a chance to say what he said in the letter
8889705 how can he say that he is innocent when there is so much evidence against him it was not just chance evidence it was calculated and done well by the police for him to say he can prove his innocence how can he

8889718 the nis is an authoritarian imposition on this country and places the desires of the state above the rights of the people it will entail threatening the public and extorting money from them until they comply the biggest effect it will have on my life is to completely redefine my relationship with the state now ill have to tell them everything about myself and will be forced to keep it up to date and will be responsible for its accuracy while having no power to control how its used stored accessed the state has all of the rights and i have all of the responsibility political language is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind
8889719 i played a correct match and am happy to be in the third round i played well and hit some good backhands he started to get into the match in the second set and started to play much better in the third but the important thing is that i was able to react in time after going down 0 3 to win the set
8889720 hes playing really well and after reaching a final in washington recently arrived here brimming with confidence hes a player who serves well and has strong aggressive ground strokes
8889721 de outlook wijst op verdere druk op de omzet en marge
8889722 in de topjaren 2005 en 2006 steeg het aantal uitzenduren nog met bijna 20 in 2007 halveerde de groei
8889723 people in jamestown have a choice if you want them they have to come out and hook you up

8889725 kan positief worden uitgelegd omdat ict doorgaans conservatief is in zijn verwachtingen
8889726 de aankoop van de aandelen was op eigen initiatief van de heer lippens
8889727 niettemin zijn de marges uitstekend de outlook voor de tweede helft van dit jaar ligt boven mijn verwachting
8889728 we moeten investeren in groei en dat kost geld ik verwacht dat dit voorlopig ook zo blijft
8889729 onze klanten betalen 7 dagen sneller dan een jaar geleden gemiddeld zit brunel met zijn debiteurendagen op 71 dagen tegen 78 een jaar geleden
8889730 we hebben eind vorig jaar en begin dit jaar flink geinvesteerd in onze salesforce je moet dan denken aan circa 40 man en dat betaalt zich hier uit
8889731 ik maak mij over dit en volgend jaar geen zorgen uiteraard hebben we last van de vertraging in de wereldeconomie we moeten harder werken voor ons geld maar brunel zal goed door deze periode heen komen maar de vraag naar gespecialiseerd personeel blijft zeer groot
8889732 we hebben daar euro 9 mln omzet van airbus geschrapt omdat dat contract veel te lage marges kende bovendien hebben we onze competence centers gereorganiseerd hetgeen de marges aanzienlijk verbeterde
8889733 vooral ook omdat het bedrijf doorgaans een sterkere tweede jaarhelft beleeft
8889734 de groei van ict duitsland over de eerste helft van 2008 was zeer positief en werkte duidelijk door in de resultaten van ict geheel gegeven de groei in de omzet en het bedrijfsresultaat
8889735 rabobank ondermijnt het financiele stelsel door te suggereren dat het stallen van geld bij andere banken niet veilig is
8889736 we merken dat klanten hun geld niet alleen graag bij een bank zetten waar het veilig staat maar er ook van op aan kunnen dat ze het er ook weer vanaf kunnen halen
8889737 voor de tweede helft van 2008 zien we weinig reden tot optimisme
8889738 wat zelfs een versnelling betekent ten opzichte van de 7 in het eerste kwartaal
8889739 they are both in high spirits and happy to be back

8889753 my parents and everybody was telling me enjoy the moment enjoy the moment
8889754 i thought she was maybe more nervous than i was
8889755 the separatist regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia and the russian authorities are cut off from reality
8889756 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory
8889757 the regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of russia they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear
8889758 soon there will be no north or south ossetia there will be a united alania as part of russia
8889759 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8889760 whatever was going to blow away has already blown away
8889761 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon

8889768 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain
8889769 what i will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes
8889770 because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
8889771 i was shocked to hear that 60 per cent of young people have experienced some form of bullying1 and through my role in joseph i can understand the huge impact both emotional and physical bullying can have on peoples lives during anti bullying week i will be wearing a different technicolour dream coat each night to raise awareness of bullying in society and hopefully help stamp it out
8889772 we are committed to raising awareness of the impact of bullying and we are delighted to partner with one of the most successful musicals of all time which continues to be extremely popular within schools this campaign is designed to reach teenagers but also teachers and parents who are looking for advice in providing support to those being bullied
8889773 funny how everybody was talking about weak draft and trading this pick no matter what it was but it was still disappointing when we didnt get 1 the most telling moment was when 11 of 14 nba executives groaned in sympathy when portlands name was announced at the 4 spot we can still get a good player from this position though and come on now really had we gotten the 1 selection would we have been happy or just talking about how our cursed luck continues because this is the first year that high schoolers and thus greg oden arent allowed in the draft save it for next year guys save it for next year

8889807 we had very high unauthorised absence during the summer term
8889808 many pupils missed teaching towards their targets in language and maths because of their absences in the summer term and consequently will not be ready to sit a national assessment when we had predicted
8889809 unfortunately we already have pupils who are missing the start of the new session because they are on holiday or have holidays planned for september
8889810 attainment is closely linked to school attendance and it is important that pupils miss as little time at school as possible
8889811 mrs gordon was trying to emphasise to parents that children should not be taken out of school during term time

8889834 the barisan nasional government will continue to manage the economy responsibly

8889893 if the united states had genuine broadband competition internet providers would not be able to profit from artificial scarcity they would invest in their networks to keep pace with consumer demand
8889894 unfortunately americans will continue to face the consequences of this lack of competition until policymakers get serious about policies that deliver the world class networks consumers deserve

8889908 mein vater und ich brachen zusammen mit suhaib al chair im monat
8889909 es ist so dass die berechnung absolut sicher und das bezeugen und das benachrichtigen mit zweifel behaftet sind und das zweifelhafte widerspricht nicht dem absolut sicheren abgesehen davon dass es ihm vorangeht zur voraussetzung einer beweisf hrung geh rt dass die durch sie bezeugten dinge von den sinnen dem verstand und der scharia her m glich sind wenn die beweisf hrung mit einer absolut sicheren berechnung dem nicht m glichen auferlegt w re w re die schariatische akzeptanz undenkbar und zwar weil das bezeugte undenkbar ist wobei in der scharia nichts undenkbares vorkommt es liegt uns ferner kein text aus der scharia vor dass die zeugenaussage von irgend zwei zeugen akzeptiert wird egal ob das bezeugte richtig oder falsch ist
8889910 es kann geschehen dass einige einf ltige und unwissende hinsichtlich dessen was wir sagten innehalten und das zur ckf hren auf das berechnen in toto und im detail verwerfen und darauf beharren dass alles was zwei zeugen bezeugt haben als erwiesen feststeht wer sich derartig verh lt mit dem gibt es kein reden wir sprechen also mit niemandem weiter als mit dem der ein mindestma an tiefblick besitzt wohingegen wir mit einem unwissenden nicht sprechen
8889911 beweist die absolut sichere berechnung das nicht sichtbarsein der mondsichel wird die aussage zweier unbescholtener menschen zu gunsten des sehens der sichel nicht akzeptiert und deren zeugenaussage abgewiesen
8889912 das ist also offensichtlich und deutlich und man darf dann nicht fasten wer dem widerspricht ist trotzig und halsstarrig
8889913 der prophet allah segne ihn und seine familie und schenke ihnen wohlergehen
8889914 f rwahr allah machte die mondsichel zu einer genauen zeitangabe seht ihr sie also dann fastet seht ihr sie wieder brecht das fasten ab wenn es euch im dunkeln bleibt so bemesset sie und wisset dass die monate nicht mehr als 30 tage haben
8889915 was aber die aussage des propheten allah segne ihn und seine familie und schenke ihnen wohlergehen arafat tag ist der tag der den leuten bekanntgegeben wurde euer fest des fastenbrechens ist an dem tag an dem ihr das fasten brecht und euer opferfest ist an dem tag an dem ihr eure opfertiere darbietet betrifft so ist damit gemeint dass die muslime darin bereinstimmen die muslime einigen sich aber nicht ber einen irrtum wobei der konsensus einen beweis darstellt

8889918 s gli uomini sono qualcosa che devo conquistare che non mi deve essere dato cos facilmente no non sapevo che farmene di un padre che fosse solo mio e che mi vivesse accanto il padre che mi era stato consegnato era parziale metafisico quasi era unentit per me un modello un esempio un dio personale che per restare tale doveva essere distante una presenza che cera quando poteva esserci non cera quando doveva esserci e forse solo di questo alcune volte me ne sono dispiaciuta ma i dispiaceri di certe mancanze non sono cos forti da restarti dentro
8889919 questa cosa delle vittime e dei carnefici mi ha sempre affascinato chi chi un giorno credevo di essere una carnefice di aver fatto del male di aver ucciso una cosa bella ma quando mi accorsi che il morto non mai morto se non puoi portare a casa la sua testa ma ti devi accontentare solo di qualche goccia del suo sangue capii che la vera vittima ero io
