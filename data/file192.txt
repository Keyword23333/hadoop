1920113 i dont want my taxes used to fund campaigns especially those of candidates i dont support
1920114 it never ceases to amaze me the amount of energy that can go into a project just to avoid doing the right thing the best simplest least costly most effective thing we could do is expand what has been working so well for years medicare you get sick you get care and the caregiver gets paid nothing could be simpler but follow the money and youll find why the politicians dont like it a bit they get their money from insurance interests
1920115 america will always do the right thing but only after everything else fails
1920116 as a business owner if i had an employee giving company assets to outsiders in exchange for money on the side id fire him perhaps even have him jailed in any other venue we call it bribery payola and theft but in the american political system we call it freedom of speech we dont jail them we re elect them
1920117 since the arabic opec conspiracy has eliminated all pretense of a capitalistic free market the u s should create its own energy supply with a taxpayer funded exploration division contract it to the lowest private bidder if need be but introduce some real competition into the system
1920118 unfortunately our political system has fallen not to the republicans or democrats but to the corporate interests that fund their elections and that is not going to change in november the only real solution is a complete turnover at the state and national level we need voter initiated term limits
1920119 privatization is the political preference because private corporations can give campaign contributions and government entities cant we are paying ten times the dollars for blackwater bechtel and halliburton to perform the same functions our troops could be performing in iraq why because the us army cannot give campaign contributions get the political money out of the system and if privatization continues because it makes more sense than creating another government bureaucracy then fine but if it continues because political cash is flowing then it likely wasnt needed in the first place

1920123 one night i went to see a bar band in houston where the blues singer was on fire and held the audience in the palm of her hand it was hot and humid and the drinks were free flowing and that night i realized what i wanted to do i started my first band in houston in 1989 and moved to central texas in 1992 after i discovered austins great music community
1920124 being based in austin has given me the opportunity to learn from some of the best
1920125 i have had the opportunity to work in different situations with various legendary people like billy joe shaver ray benson and marcia ball

1920171 kami melakukan seks ekspres dua kali seminggu atau setiap pagi sebelum kami berdua berangkat kerja kami berdua sama sama tak punya waktu dan takut terlambat kerja akan tetapi saya melihat binar bahagia di matanya dan saya berpikir bagaimana kalau tujuh menit lagi memang saya tidak mendapat orgasme tapi saya menikmati pengalaman tersebut saya merasakan ia begitu dalamnya berada di tubuh saya saya juga tahu kalau saya menyenangkan dirinya nah karena hal itulah yang memberikan saya kekuatan erotik
1920172 seks yang cepat sangat menggairahkan sekali terlepas dari anda orgasme atau tidak saya sangat menyukainya dan berhari hari setelahnya saya dan isteri saya selalu mendapatkan seks yang hebat
1920173 setiap pria yang mengatakan bahwa dirinya tak menyukai dan tak pernah menginginkan seks ekspres adalah pembohong kadang kadang bila anda ingin meraihnya anda hanya perlu melakukannya saja seorang wanita yang dapat masuk ke dalamnya adalah wanita yang sangat bahagia
1920174 dan bahwa yang kami perintahkan ini adalah jalan ku yang lurus maka ikutilah dia dan janganlah kami mengikuti jalan jalan yang lain karna jalan jalan itu mencerai beraikan kamu dari jalan nya yang demikian itu diperintahkan allah kepadamu agar kamu bertakwa
1920175 ikutilah apa yang diturunkan kepadamu dari tuhanmu dan janganlah kamu mengikuti pemimpin pemimpin selain nya
1920176 maka apakah kamu mengira bahwa sesungguhnya kami menciptakan kamu secara main main saja
1920177 barang siapa yang allah menghendaki akan memberikan kepadanya petunjuk niscaya dia melapangkan dadanya untuk memeluk dien islam dan barang siapa yang dikehendaki allah kesesatannya niscaya allah menjadikan dadanya sesak lagi sempit seolah olah dia sedang mendaki pelangi begitulah allah menimpakan siksa kepada orang orang yang tidak beriman
1920178 sesungguhnya kami berlepas diri dari kamu dan dari apa yang kamu sembah selain allah kami ingkari kekafiran mu dan telah nyata antara kami dan kamu permusuhan dan kebencian buat selama lamanya sampai kamu beriman kepad allah saja
1920179 sesungguhnya telah ada suri tauladan bagimu pada niccola dan orang orang yang sejalan dia dalam ucapan mereka tujuan itu melegalkan segala macam cara
1920180 karena sesungguh bukanlah mata itu yang buta tetapi yang buta ialah hati yang ada didalam dada
1920181 dan ini adalah pasal yang agung yang mesti diperhatikan karena sesungguhnya dari arahnyalah terjadi dalam dien ini kerancuan yang besar dan banyak dari para pemimpin para ulama dan para ahli ibadah memandang mashlahat terus mereka menggunakannnya dengan berpijak diatas landasan ini sedangkan bisa saja diantara hal itu ada suatu yang dilarang dalam syariat
1920182 bahwa istihsan yang di pengang oleh pengikut malik adalah pengalaman dalil yang paling kuat di antara dua dalil
1920183 dan inilah dalil bila mereka menamakannya istihsan maka tidak ada masalah dengan penamaan
1920184 bila istihsan itu ada pernyataan berdasarkan apa yang di anggapnya baik dan yang dia ingginkan tanpa landasan dalil maka ia adalah batil dan tidak seorang pun berpendapat dengannya
1920185 maka engkau telah mengetahui dengan seluruh apa yang telah kami utarakan bahwa penuturan istihsan dalam bahasan tersendiri 3 adalah tidak ada faidah sama sekali dai dalamnya karena bila ia adalah kembali kepada dalil dalil yang lalu maka ia adalah pengulangan dan bila ia adalah di luar dalil maka ia sama sekali bukan termaksud syariat akan tetapi dia termasuk berdusta atas nama syariat kadang dengan apa yang tidak ada di dalamnya dan kadang dengan apa yang menyebranginya
1920186 allah telah menurukan yang paling baik yaitu al quran nya serupa mutu ayat ayatnya lagi berulang ulang gemetar karenanya kulit orang orang yang takut kepada tuhanya kemudian menjadi tenang kulit dan hati mereka di waktu mengingat allah itulah petunjuk allah dengan kitab itu dia menunjukan siapa yang di kehendaki nya dan barang siapa yang disesakan allah maka tidak seorang pun pemberi petunjuk baginya
1920187 dan hujjah ini adalah terhadap mereka bukan bagi mereka karena allah taala tidak mengatakan
1920188 kemudian bila kamu berlainan pendapat tentang sesuatu maka kembalikanlah ia kepada allah dan rasul sunnahnya jika kamu benar benar beriman kepada allah dan hari kemudian
1920189 apa yang dipandang kaum muslimin baik maka ia adalah disisi allah baik
1920190 tetapi orang orang zalim mengikuti hawa nafsunya tanpa ilmu pengetahuan
1920191 dan siapakan yang lebih sesat dari pada orang yang mengikuti hawa nafsunya dengan tidak mendapatkan petunjuk dari allah
1920192 maka demi tuhamu mereka pada hakikatnya tidak beriman hingga mereka menjadikan kamu hakim dalam perkara yang mereka perselisihkan kemudian mereka tidak merasakan keberatan dalam hati mereka terhadap putusan yang kamu berikan dan mereka menerima dengan sepenuhnya
1920193 pada hari ini telah ku sempurnakan untuk kamu agamamu dan telah ku cukupkan kepadamu nikmat ku
1920194 pada hari ini telah kusempurnakan untuk kamu agamamu dan telah ku cukupkan kepadamu nikmat ku
1920195 apakah mereka memiliki sembahan sembahan yang mensyariatkan bagi mereka bagi dien ini apa yang tidak allah izinkan
1920196 pada keduanya itu terdapat dosa besar dan beberapa manfaat bagi manusia tetapi dosa keduanya lebih besar dari manfaatnya
1920197 mereka jika melihat tiap tiap ayat ku mereka tidak beriman kepadanya dan jika mereka melihat jalan yang membawa mereka melihat jalan kesesatan mereka terus menempuhnya yang demikian itu adalah karena mereka mendustakan ayat ayat kami dan mereka selalu lalai dari padanya
1920198 sesungguhnya orang yang mempersekutukan sesuatu dengan allah maka pasti allah mengharamkan kepadanya surga
1920199 barang siapa mati sedang dia menyeru tandingan bagi allah maka dia pasti masuk neraka
1920200 kecelakaan besarlah bagi orang orang yang curang yaitu orang orang yang apabila mereka menerima takaran dari orang lain mereka minta di penuhi dan apabila mereka menakar atau menimbang untuk orang lain mereka mengurangi tidaklah orang orang itu yakin bahwa sesungguhnya mereka akan di bangkitkan pada suatu hari yang besar yaitu hari ketika manusia berdiri menghadap tuhan semesta alam
1920201 kalau kiranya itu bukan dari sisi allah tentulah mereka mendapat pertentangan yang banyak didalamnya
1920202 apakah mereka saling berpesan dari apa yang mereka itu sebenarnya mereka adalah kaum yang melampau batas
1920203 jika kami memaafkan segolongan daripada kamu lantaran mereka taubat niscaya kami akan mengadzah golongan yang lain disebabkan mereka adalah orang orang yang selalu berbuat dosa
1920204 kelak mereka akan bersumpah kepadamu dengan nama allah apabila kamu kembali kepada mereka supaya kamu berpaling dari mereka
1920205 saya tidak melihat pemimpin dan orang kaya lebih hina darinya di majelis sufyan

1920416 its an office management system that manages contacts leads listings closings and its a file server that allows contact materials to be sent by e mail instead of having to be faxed and its also a document storage system
1920417 the agents were doing it all with pen and paper and werent doing a particularly good job of follow up
1920418 it takes longer and longer for people to buy now and you have to stay in touch it markler reminds you to follow up
1920419 weve stayed no 1 in our marketplace in residential sales even in a declining market follow up helps a great deal agents dont lose customers
1920420 agents are able to retrieve information easily and send things easily all of the information is right in front of you

1920432 the secretary of state should designate the iranian revolutionary guards as a foreign terrorist organization and the secretary of the treasury should place the iranian revolutionary guards on the list of specially designated global terrorists under executive order 13224
1920433 senator obama clearly recognizes the serious threat posed by iran however he does not think that now is the time for saber rattling towards iran
1920434 the manner in which the united states transitions and structures its military presence in iraq in particular with regard to the capability of the government of the islamic republic of iran to pose a threat to the security of the region
1920435 i have consistently opposed this administrations efforts to use debates about our national security to expand its own power whether that was on the iraq war or on its power grab to curb our civil liberties through domestic surveillance programs it is time to restore oversight and accountability in the fisa program and this proposal with an unprecedented grant of retroactive immunity is not the place to start
1920436 under this compromise legislation an important tool in the fight against terrorism will continue but the presidents illegal program of warrantless surveillance will be over it is not all that i would want but given the legitimate threats we face providing effective intelligence collection tools with appropriate safeguards is too important to delay so i support the compromise
1920437 jerusalem will remain the capital of israel and it must remain undivided

1920442 several factors contributed to the softening in housing markets this spring

1920459 kami mengharapkan mereka pbb akan membuka kembali kantor mereka di sejumlah bagian yang berbeda di irak

1920465 mr speaker i have as much respect for the memory of the deceased and as much sympathy for the suffering of the living as any man in this house but we must not permit our respect for the dead or our sympathy for a part of the living to lead us into an act of injustice to the balance of the living i will not go into an argument to prove that congress has no power to appropriate this money as an act of charity every member upon this floor knows it we have the right as individuals to give away as much of our own money as we please in charity but as members of congress we have no right to so appropriate a dollar of the public money some eloquent appeals have been made to us upon the ground that it is a debt due the deceased sir this is no debt we cannot without the grossest corruption appropriate this money as the payment of a debt we have not the semblance of authority to appropriate it as a charity i cannot vote for this bill but i will give one weeks pay and if every member of congress will do the same it will amount to more than the bill asks
1920466 i voted for you the last time i shall not vote for you again
1920467 you gave a vote last winter which shows that either you have not capacity to understand the constitution or that you are wanting in the honesty and firmness to be guided by it the constitution to be worth anything must be held sacred and rigidly observed in all its provisions
1920468 the people have delegated to congress by the constitution the power to do certain things to do these it is authorized to collect and pay moneys and for nothing else everything beyond this is usurpation and a violation of the constitution you have violated the constitution in what i consider to be a vital point it is a precedent fraught with danger to the country for when congress once begins to stretch its power beyond the limits of the constitution there is no limit to it and no security for the people
1920469 well my friend you hit the nail upon the head when you said i had not sense enough to understand the constitution if you will forgive me and vote for me again if i ever vote for another non constitutional law i wish i may be shot
1920470 if you believe what you like in the gospels and reject what you dont like it is not the gospel you believe but yourself

1920472 and let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle
1920473 the ultimate determinant in the struggle now going on for the world will not be bombs and rockets but a test of wills and ideas a trial of spiritual resolve the values we hold the beliefs we cherish and the ideals to which we are dedicated

1920493 sistem kepemimpinan seperti ini tidak ada dalam sejarah islam dalam islam hanya mengenal sistem berorganisasi yang di sebut dengan jamaah wal imamah yaitu pemimpin mempunyai otoritas penuh untuk mengambil keputusan setelah bermusyawarah dengan majelis syuro lalu amir lah yang mengambil keputusan akhir walaupun keputusan itu tidak populer dalam majelis syuro
1920494 jelas baasyir dalam sebuah kesempatan menerangkan sistem yang benar dalam berorganisasi dalam islam
1920495 tetapi sistem keorganisasiannya inilah yang masih perlu di perbaiki dan saya sebagai pemimpin merasa bertanggung jawab untuk meluruskan jika ada yang masih kurang tepat dalam organisasi yang saya pimpin itu konsekwensi seorang pemimpin

1920499 bagi saya keberadaan sumur bor umum ini sangat membantu selama ini saya harus menjunjung ember berisi air atau cucian sejauh hampir 1 km dari rumah ke sungai sambil menggendong anak
1920500 selain mendapat air bersih rumah kami juga terang karena simpanan rp1 500 itu sudah termasuk biaya listrik bahkan simpanan itu menjadi tabungan yang dapat dipinjam anggota
1920501 selain menjalankan koperasi simpan pinjam untuk anggota cu ini kami jadikan wadah untuk memasilitasi kebutuhan kebutuhan dasar yang tahap awal ini kami membangun sumur bor dan listrik bantuan lsm paras untuk pengelolaannya kami lakukan dengan swadaya dengan mengikat anggota cu menyimpan rp1 500 per hari ke cu
1920502 bunga yang dikenakan untuk pinjaman anggota cu hanya 3 menurun jauh lebih murah ketimbang rentenir yang mencapai 20 bunganya
1920503 simpanan rp9 ribu per bulan itu digunakan untuk biaya operasional sumur bor umum sisanya digulirkan dalam bentuk pinjaman kepada anggota cu yang saat ini sekitar rp4 juta yang bergulir setiap bulan dari total aset sekitar rp11 juta dana tersebut disalurkan untuk warung dengan bunga 3 menurun dan biaya gaji pengurus 5
1920504 tiga unsur itu dalam bentuk ion pada air begitu air keluar dari pipa masuk ke bak penampungan maka akan terjadi oksidasi sehingga air akan keruh kalau air itu mengandung amonium maka air itu akan tercium bau untuk memperkecil kandungan unsur unsur itu perlu dilakukan filter agar kandungan unsur unsur itu di bawah 0 5 ppm bagian per sejuta
1920505 kami sudah melakukan penelitian laboratorium untuk mengetahui kandungan unsur unsur yang berbahaya
1920506 dengan sistem pengelolaan air seperti sekarang ini kami berkeyakinan ini bisa bertahan lama

1920550 saya tidak fikir anwar akan menghilangkan diri jadi saya akan membenarkan anda dibebaskan dengan bon peribadi rm20 000 tanpa penjamin
1920551 patutkah kita mendakwa orang yang membuat laporan polis mendakwa kejadian itu berlaku kita mesti ingat juga bahawa anwar tidak bersalah sehingga dibuktikan sebaliknya oleh mahkamah
1920552 kami yakin kerana pada tarikh kejadian anwar punya alibi yang kukuh dan beliau sedang bermesyuarat di tempat kejadian
1920553 hakim s m komathy suppiah telah menggunakan budi bicara secara adil dan tanpa gentar dengan membenarkan anwar dibebaskan dengan ikat jamin
1920554 kami bersetuju dengan hakim dan telah meminta mahkamah tidak menahan pasport kerana anwar telah memberikan kerjasama yang sepenuhnya kepada polis
1920555 saya gembira dibebaskan cuma apa yang dikesalkan adalah pendakwaan diteruskan walaupun saya yakin pendakwa pun nampak dipaksa untuk meneruskan kes ini
1920556 ia tidak libatkan sumber kewangan dana dan pasport saya juga masih kekal dengan saya
1920557 ingin saya tegaskan pendakwaan ke atas saya hari ini berniat jahat dan dirancang oleh abdullah
1920558 dulu dari awal dihebahkan kepada media ada penderaan dan liwat secara paksa
1920559 jika suka sama suka kenapa hanya saya sahaja kena dakwa kenapa tak panggil dua dua
1920560 ini juga satu petanda baik apabila pihak pendakwa tidak menentang permohonan anwar untuk diikat jamin

1920639 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
1920640 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
1920641 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
1920642 the new organization capabilities in vmware lab manager 3 will help us better enforce role based access rights to system configurations in the lab according to our it policy says tony anastasio technology architect for cerner the leading u
1920643 we have development teams working on trading gateways for virtually every major futures exchange around the world
1920644 vmware lab manager 3 gives us much more flexibility in the way we deal with a global lab environment it simplifies administration supports multiple networks and lets us assign resource pools and manage user access rights for all of our teams from a central location vmware lab manager has quickly become the industry standard virtual lab automation solution used by software development and testing teams worldwide said raghu raghuram vice president of products and solutions vmware this new release expands the appeal of vmware lab manager to more groups of people at our customers by promoting effective self service combined with centralized it control

1920647 i would have thought rugby league has a good track record in looking after players and the responsibility that goes with nurturing young talent
1920648 i dont believe williams is in any position to cast the first stone isnt he the one who walked out on his mates at the bulldogs
1920649 i find it offensive coming from a player who was at a club which prides itself and is renowned as a family friendly organisation
1920650 he made the decision to walk out on his team and his club i dont think he can blame other people for that
1920651 im one of those young kids that used to love watching everything about rugby league but i see that it is just a business
1920652 they dont care about me they treat us like cattle it is about the boys just getting a fair go you know its about them standing up and having the balls to get what they should be getting because if were going to be getting treated like that why cant we treat the clubs like that
1920653 i just want to see the game and the players looked after the way they should be because the crowds dont turn up to watch david gallop play they turn up to watch the players play
1920654 like i said 10 years ago the game was on top of afl but now its like that points down
1920655 so like i said theres a lot of things that need to be worked on over there and hopefully some good can come out of what ive done and it wakes everyone up and they realise something has to be done
1920656 the salary cap is fundamental in making sure fans of our clubs have a realistic hope about their team every year
1920657 again its very disappointing thats the way he sees things
1920658 i stood up for myself and i stood up for player rights what i took its not a coward act its a ballsy act you know what i mean
1920659 for those people or that person or whoever people that called me a dog dogs take orders i dont take orders

1920669 as indicated previously westpacs conservative risk profile has meant it is not at risk from the types of significant write downs in securities portfolios that have impacted some other financial institutions
1920670 robust revenue growth of 8 per cent to 9 per cent is anticipated despite more difficult economic conditions
1920671 will yield valuable data and a greater appreciation of the practicality of an all electric vehicle in california
1920672 partnering with automakers like mitsubishi is vital to developing compatible infrastructures to support electric vehicles in the marketplace and ensure responsible integration with the grid
1920673 by working with mitsubishi we will both benefit from a free exchange of electric vehicle information that includes charging infrastructure availability vehicle data vehicle commercialization expectations and public feedback
1920674 in any large scale screening for abuse of opiate drugs the possibility of urinary alkaloids arising from consuming food containing poppy seeds must be considered and if possible eliminated
1920675 so through the rest of the afternoon my reporter friends women and men alike said they were going to storm the barricades and visit the bathroom without an escort
1920676 one said she made it back without the escort and a man said he told the escort he was going on the floor unless he could go on his own

1920697 do you have any advice for those of us just starting out
1920698 i love hanging out with you guys you two are so fun you can tell there is something so amazing about you two together and you can tell that you two are so in love and that feeling itself is the best thing to be around
1920699 only love can be divided endlessly and still not diminish
1920700 it takes courage to love but pain through love is the purifying fire which those who love generously know we all know people who are so much afraid of pain that they shut themselves up like clams in a shell and giving out nothing receive nothing and therefore shrink until life is a mere living death
1920701 let those that love us love us and those that dont may god turn their hearts and if he cannot turn their hearts may he turn their ankles so we may know them by their limping

1920708 he was drunk there were three people in the car with him giving him instructions
1920709 indeed the sort of crimes and even the amount of delinquency that fill the prophets of israel with dismay do not go beyond that which is regarded as normal as typical ingredients of social dynamics to us a single act of injustice cheating in business exploitation of the poor is slight to the prophets a disaster to us injustice is injurious to the welfare of the people to the prophets it is a deathblow to existence to us an episode to them a catastrophe a threat to the world
1920710 their breathless impatience with injustice may strike us as hysteria we ourselves witness continually acts of injustice manifestations of hypocrisy falsehood outrage misery but we rarely grow indignant or overly excited to the prophet even a minor injustice assumes cosmic proportions
1920711 if such deep sensitivity to evil is to be called hysterical what name should be given to the abysmal indifference to evil which the prophet bewails

1920843 cukup ya rasulallah tenanglah allah tidak akan menyalahi apa yang telah ia janjikan kepadamu
1920844 dan allah telah berjanji kepada orang orang yang beriman di antara kalian dan mengerjakan amal amal shalih bahwa dia sungguh sungguh akan menjadikan mereka berkuasa di bumi sebagaimana dia telah menjadikan orang orang sebelumnya berkuasa dan sungguh dia akan meneguhkan bagi mereka agama yang telah diridhainya untuk mereka dan dia benar benar akan mengganti kondisi mereka sesudah mereka dalam ketakutan menjadi aman sentosa mereka tetap menyembahku tanpa mempersekutukan apa pun denganku

1920850 kami telah merasakan betapa kerasnya dia bagaimana nanti kalau kau sudah menghadap allah apa jawabmu padanya ketika tergugat telah meninggalkan kaum muslimin pada seorang yang berperangai keras
1920851 aku bersumpah demi allah jika aku menghadap rabbku akan kukatakan padanya bahwa aku telah menetapkan atas makhluqnya seorang yang paling kuanggap baik di antara mereka
1920852 apakah kalian akan menerima dengan lapang dada seorang yang telah kupilih sebagai penggantiku
1920853 jika prosedur telah ditunaikan dan masih ada yang belum mau menerima keputusan syuraa di antara mereka maka diijinkan untuk memenggal lehernya

1921034 never mind the absence of marian hossa ryan malone jarkko ruutu and georges laraque
1921035 the penguins still have the most formidable lineup down the middle of any team in the nhl with marc andre fleury
1921036 to find the secret word look near a lively game pointing to the path with a rabbit in its name
1921037 pointing to the path with a rabbit in its name
1921038 being so close and not winning is still hard to digest
1921039 not closing the deal its hard not to think about it
1921040 everybody i see brings it up im reminded by it everywhere you always see things on tv where guys had the cup in their hometown its a constant reminder the memory of losing is not something that just goes away
1921041 i thought i was motivated before its definitely more now being that close and not being able to do it its just hard the quicker you can get back to win it the better
1921042 someone called and said they were gonna come up here and kick the living shit out of the guy driving the work truck
1921043 you are the quarterback let the daddys make the big decisions heres your ball go play
1921044 so now you answer the question did they have deflation or inflation
1921045 a paper money would not be a bad idea at condition that you have a god ruling the printer
1921046 if all those derivatives go bad and houses deflate in price and stocks deflate in price and bonds deflate in price and debts are bankrupted then money will simply disappear
1921047 if i bankrupt out of the debt doesnt the money disappear too
1921048 the debt as a synthetic short position against the dollar
1921049 in 2005 and 2006 zero fdic insured banks failed in 2007 three failed including netbank the largest failure in 14 years indymac wasnt even on the fdics list of troubled banks so how many other depository institutions would succumb to a run on deposits well i hate to sound absurd but the honest answer is all of them virtually all of the couple hundred banks ive looked at over the past few months have liquid assets amounting to less than 40 of deposits most have around 30
1921050 one thing for sure after a few years youll need 1 6 usd to buy 1 euro
1921051 we are creating money on whether there is a limit as to how much we can create in central banking there is no limit as to how much domestic currency you can create now the domestic balance is a little over hk 3 billion it can be hk 4 billion it can be hk 30 billion if there were a need there is no limit at all
1921052 the aim of monetary policy is higher inflation it is appropriate to be particularly vigilant in monetary policy when inflation does not increase as projected
1921053 all action is either consumption or production and exchange is but a form of production consequently all goods are consumers goods or producers goods there is no third possibility and among these two money is a producers good not a consumers good
1921054 are to be refuted but this does not undermine the legitimacy of my assumptions in the matter i shall then try and explain my own reasons
1921055 from this point of view the goods used as money are none others than the same ones that adam smith called
1921056 the sources of the economic profit of the goldmines owners are the economic losses suffered by last buyers of the newly obtained gold
1921057 if you want to know a mans mind ask him questions
1921058 nothing goes just up and in 1975 76 gold had a 45 correction
1921059 since 1986 when the first claim was filed weve had 82 dogs killed by wolves and 27 injured that we know of
1921060 we paid for most of those claims but there were a few cases when people did not request payment
1921061 it seems some packs are more prone to attacking dogs
1921062 i think were starting to see some of that here too
1921063 in the last few years wolf territories have been averaging about 40 square miles it used to be 50 to 60 square miles still some territories are as small as 20 square miles and others are as large as 80 to 100 square miles
1921064 were starting to see wolves moving into more developed areas

1921352 this stuff just takes a knife to a large part of the security mesh microsoft built into vista

1921355 i think oil companies are amoral they want to make as much money as they can for their shareholders which is what corporations do
1921356 the difference is the nature of the kind of outsized profits they make that may have no relationship to their investments or their production the fact for example that the shortage of refinery capacity could actually increase their profits so the less they invest the more they make indicates that you are not dealing with someone making widgets out there

1921360 we need to realign the definition of arts to our society
1921361 think of nike or coca cola what do these companies actually do they dont make shoes or drinks they get other companies to do that their whole manufacturing process is outsourced its appropriate for them to do this because the shoe and the drink are incidental to the real sales offer which is a lifestyle companies like nike and coca cola do not manage factories they manage narratives and the language that they use is not analytic and impersonal but intuitive and aesthetic it is the language of the storyteller the entertainer the artist
1921362 as emerging markets generate greater shares of global supply and demand companies need better methods to weigh political risk against financial reward one of those methods is narrative most companies are already navigating the choppy waters of globalization and none presumably are sailing blind but corporate leaders may lack the sophisticated understanding this very complex subject requires political risk analysis is more subjective than its economic counterpart and demands that leaders grapple not just with broad easily observable trends but also with nuances of society and even quirks of personality and those hard to quantify factors must constantly be pieced into an ongoing narrative within historical and regional contexts

1921404 by 66 ce jewish discontent with rome had escalated at first the priests tried to suppress rebellion even calling upon the pharisees for help after the roman garrison failed to stop hellenists from desecrating a synagogue in caesarea however the high priest suspended payment of tribute inaugurating the great jewish revolt the destruction of the second temple by the romans in 70 ce not only put an end to the revolt it was a profoundly traumatic experience for the jews that marked the end of an era
1921405 the herodians were not of jewish stock herod the great encouraged the circulation of the legend of the family descent from an illustrious babylonian jew ant xiv i 3 but it has no historic basis it is true the idumeans were at that time nominal jews since they were subdued by john hyrcanus in 125 bc and embodied in the asmonean kingdom through an enforced circumcision but the old national antagonism remained gen 27 41 the herodian family sprang from antipas died 78 bc who was appointed governor of idumaea by alexander janneus
1921406 the herodian dynasty was a jewish dynasty of idumean descent who ruled iudaea province between 37 bc ad 92 during the time of the hasmonean ruler john hyrcanus judea conquered edom which the romans called idumea and forced the edomites to convert to judaism the edomites were integrated into the jewish people in the days of alexander jannaeus one of them antipas was appointed governor of edom his son antipater was the head adviser of hyrcanus ii and managed to establish a good relationship with the romans who at that time 63 bc had conquered judea julius caesar appointed antipater to be procurator of judea in 47 bc and he appointed his sons phasael and herod to be governors of jerusalem and galilee respectively antipater was murdered in 43 bc however his sons managed to hold the reins of powers and were elevated to the rank of tetrarch in 41 bc by mark anthony

1921410 proponents of the rapture insist that the doctrine of amillennialism originated with alexandrian scholars such as clement and origen and was later brought wholly into roman catholic dogma by augustine hence the church up until then held to premillennial views which see an impending apocalypse from which the church will be rescued after being raptured by the lord this is even extrapolated by some to mean that the early church espoused pretribulationism
1921411 t wo advents of christ have been announced the one in which he is set forth as suffering inglorious dishonored and crucified but the other in which he shall come from heaven with glory when the man of apostasy who speaks strange things against the most high shall venture to do unlawful deeds on the earth against us the christians
1921412 and its ten horns are ten kings which shall arise and after them shall arise another who shall surpass in evil deeds all that were before him and shall overthrow three kings and he shall speak words against the most high god and wear out the saints of the most high god and shall purpose to change times and laws and everything shall be given into his hand until a time of times and a half time that is for three years and six months during which time when he comes he shall reign over the earth
1921413 and then he points out the time that his tyranny shall last during which the saints shall be put to flight they who offer a pure sacrifice unto god and in the midst of the week he says the sacrifice and the libation shall be taken away and the abomination of desolation shall be brought into the temple even unto the consummation of the time shall the desolation be complete now three years and six months constitute the half week
1921414 in the revelation of john again the order of these times is spread out to view which the souls of the martyrs are taught to wait for beneath the altar whilst they earnestly pray to be avenged and judged taught i say to wait in order that the world may first drink to the dregs the plagues that await it out of the vials of the angels and that the city of fornication may receive from the ten kings its deserved doom and that the beast antichrist with his false prophet may wage war on the church of god and that after the casting of the devil into the bottomless pit for a while the blessed prerogative of the first resurrection may be ordained from the thrones and then again after the consignment of him to the fire that the judgment of the final and universal resurrection may be determined out of the books since then the scriptures both indicate the stages of the last times and concentrate the harvest of the christian hope in the very end of the world
1921415 for this is meant by the little horn that grows up
1921416 that refers to the one thousand two hundred and threescore days the half of the week during which the tyrant is to reign and persecute the church which flees from city to city and seeks conceal meat in the wilderness among the mountains
1921417 for when daniel said i shall make my covenant for one week he indicated seven years and the one half of the week is for the preaching of the prophets and for the other half of the week that is to say for three years and a half antichrist will reign upon the earth and after this his kingdom and his glory shall be taken away behold ye who love god what manner of tribulation there shall rise in those days such as has not been from the foundation of the world no nor ever shall be except in those days alone then the lawless one being lifted up in heart will gather together his demons in mans form and will abominate those who call him to the kingdom and will pollute many souls
1921418 the little season signifies three years and six months in which with all his power the devil will avenge himself trader antichrist against the church
1921419 for in the last days false prophets shall be multiplied and such as corrupt the word and the sheep shall be changed into wolves and love into hatred for through the abounding of iniquity the love of many shall wax cold for men shall hate and persecute and betray one another and then shall appear the deceiver of the world the enemy of the truth the prince of lies whom the lord jesus shall destroy with the spirit of his mouth who takes away the wicked with his lips and many shall be offended at him but they that endure to the end the same shall be saved and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and afterwards shall be the voice of a trumpet by the archangel and in that interval shall be the revival of those that were asleep and then shall the lord come and all his saints with him with a great concussion above the clouds with the angels of his power in the throne of his kingdom to condemn the devil the deceiver of the world and to render to every one according to his deeds then shall the wicked go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous shall go into life eternal to inherit those things which eye hath not seen nor ear heard nor have entered into the heart of man such things as god hath prepared for them that love him and they shall rejoice in the kingdom of god which is in christ jesus
1921420 during and after the protestant reformation 16th century protestant christians held to what is called
1921421 morgan edwards was a baptist minister in pennsylvania in the mid late 1700s as a teenager and seminary student morgan wrote a hypothetical essay as part of his seminary training morgan was assigned the task by his tutor to write an essay on the millennium using literal interpretation in morgans hypothetical scenario he separated the rapture from the second coming by at least 3 5 years
1921422 while some might conclude that morgan edwards was the first to proclaim a pre trib rapture depending on how one defines the terminology his view was a far cry from modern pre trib
1921423 in the 1820s edward irving pastored a church of scotland presbyterian congregation in london
1921424 irving had been preaching that god would restore apostles and prophets to the church and a great pentecostal outpouring would come just before the soon return of jesus christ
1921425 the substance of mary campbells and margaret macdonalds visions or revelations given in their papers carry to me a spiritual conviction and a spiritual reproof which i cannot express
1921426 out of the spectacle of alleged latter day holy spirit outpouring in scotland and england and the eschatological influence of de lacunzas futurist dispensationalism emerged the very first documented evidence of a pre tribulation rapture
1921427 the substance of mary campbells and margaret macdonalds visions or revelations given in their papers carry to me a spiritual conviction and a spiritual reproof which i cannot express
1921428 the outstanding feature of margarets visions was an outpouring of the holy spirit on a elite group within the church combined with a secret rapture before the revealing of the antichrist
1921429 this was the oil the wise virgins took in their vessels this is the light to be kept burning the light of god that we may discern that which cometh not with observation to the natural eye only those who have the light of god within them will see the sign of his appearance no need to follow them who say see here or see there for his day shall be as the lightning to those in whom the living christ is tis christ in us that will lift us up he is the light tis only those that are alive in him that will be caught up to meet him in the air i saw that we must be in the spirit that we might see spiritual things margaret macdonald
1921430 some pre trib authors have tried to debunk margarets contribution to pre tribulationism by claiming she was actually post trib they point to the statements where she speaks of christians being tried in the tribulation however they fail to recognize that she was only speaking of a secret rapture of an elite group of saints and not the whole church therefore she spoke of both a secret pre trib rapture and christians being tried in the tribulation
1921431 this is the fiery trial which is to try us it will be for the purging and purifying of the real members of the body of jesus but oh it will be a fiery trial every soul will be shaken to the very centre the enemy will try to shake in every thing we have believed but the trial of real faith will be found to honour and praise and glory nothing but what is of god will stand
1921432 6 the philadelphian church expresses the period of that preparation until the lord come to the air and be met by his saints changed and risen 7 the laodicean church the only one yet entirely future is our sad monitor concerning the history of the church on earth during that period of great tribulation which shall intervene between the coming of the lord to the air and the establishment of his throne and rest in zion
1921433 while he may have hinted at some dispensational ideas such ideas were already fully developed in irvings 1826
1921434 commenced also speaking gave testimony to the judgments coming on the earth but also directed the church to the coming of the lord as her hope of deliverance
1921435 in 1908 the doctrine of the rapture was further popularized by an evangelist named william eugene blackstone whose book jesus is coming sold more than one million copies

1921437 once again the litigants are rejecting fair reaching science based benefits for salmon in the columbia snake river system
1921438 unfortunately this continuing campaign to remove the dams has diverted significant time and resources from further salmon recovery efforts that our region has agreed to implement
1921439 this plan addresses all of the issues judge jim redden has raised in the courtroom it includes an unprecedented rigorous science analyses has strong support in the region and major funding commitments
1921440 in the midst of the world seeking remedies for climate change they persist in demanding removal of the lower snake rivers dams a renewable source of clean electric power
1921441 it makes no sense to remove renewable non polluting power generation from the snake river and replace it with fossil fired power plants that accelerate global climate change flores said
1921442 this is great news for the american people and for the scientists who devote their lives to the study of fish populations
1921443 ending overfishing on these stocks and preventing overfishing from occurring on others is critical to maintaining and rebuilding our valuable fisheries resources and this year we took a giant step forward in this regard
1921444 no new stocks were subject to overfishing in 2007 which is very good news as well
1921445 the economic recreational and ecological stakes for sustaining these resources are incredibly high
1921446 noaa fisheries scientists are learning more all the time about how to help fish populations
1921447 our agency is working hard to end overfishing by 2010 as required by the magnuson stevens act continued and new sustainable management practices such as annual catch limits are one of the tools we are using
1921448 after having met with the parties and touring the colf familys property i am confident that giving them more time for negotiations will result in a successful agreement for everyone
1921449 these are very high numbers of juvenile salmon some of the highest numbers weve ever seen
1921450 this summer tribal fishery couldnt come at a better time since the public has been inundated with the unfortunate news of salmon fishery closures in other parts of the west
1921451 but the columbias summer run is in good shape and our tribes are committed to providing public access to this unique resource
1921452 oxycontin is very hard to kick a friend of mine is thirty thousand dollars in debt trying to kick it
1921453 we have a cooler pool at dworshak than weve had in previous years
1921454 we have a good opportunity no matter what we do
1921455 theres a 100 percent chance that were going to refill its just when and we dont want to overfill
1921456 you should not pass any more than is necessary knowing were going to have a declining hydrograph
1921457 they are catching sockeye like crazy phenomenal numbers of sockeye
1921458 families and businesses in the northwest are already paying 20 to 30 percent a month on their electricity bills for fish and wildlife programs
1921459 this latest salmon plan could add considerably more to customer bills in these difficult times with families struggling to put increasingly expensive food on the table and pay rapidly escalating costs for gasoline and energy
1921460 the answer to salmon recovery is not to throw more money at it but to ensure that the dollars are well spent and delivers results
1921461 to accomplish that the customers making the investment must have a place at the implementation table along with the states and tribes
1921462 yet the direct killing or harvesting of salmon under the protection of the endangered species act continues to be neglected
1921463 the biological opinion released today on lower columbia commercial sport and tribal harvest allows the continued taking of listed fish instead of conserving them
1921464 we went through a pretty rigorous numerical analysis of that
1921465 shingles can seriously degrade the quality of life for those who suffer from this disease
1921466 offering this vaccine to our patients is further evidence of vas commitment to provide world class health care to americas veterans
1921467 va will continue research that leads to real life solutions like the distribution of this shingles vaccine for patients at va facilities across the country
1921468 if i could have 50 percent of our student body be veterans i would
1921469 maybe they didnt shine in high school but they have that experience
1921470 i have my civilian friends and its good but you still need your veteran friends because they know what youve been through
1921471 offer a real rubber meets the road approach that is unique in higher education
1921472 many professors have a lot of theory and these students bring a wealth of experience to test that theory in really unique ways
1921473 then you have a student come in and talk about how he was responsible for trying to co opt a sunni tribe to help the coalition
1921474 have been to the bad side of the world you have kids coming out of their parents house and theyre talking about paris hilton
1921475 people to know what the soldiers go through because no matter how much you watch the news you could never know the full experience
1921476 to the extent they want to share their experiences to that extent they become teachers and part of the learning environment there theyve got a lot to contribute
1921477 and youre so turned on by that evil that you almost jumped me in the limo
1921478 do you really care if im evil if no one finds out

1921618 before telling me anything id like you to pass a little test its called the triple filter test
1921619 before you talk to me about my friend it might be a good idea to take a moment and filter what youre going to say the first filter is truth have you made absolutely sure that what you are about to tell me is true
1921620 so you dont really know if its true or not now lets try the second filter the filter of goodness is what you are about to tell me about my friend something good
1921621 you want to tell me something bad about him but youre not certain its true you may still pass the test though because theres one filter left the filter of usefulness is what you want to tell me about my friend going to be useful to me
1921622 if what you want to tell me is neither true nor good nor even useful why tell it to me at all

1921676 this is the first time in my 16 years in this union that we were organized and worked together to fight for a contract that we can be proud of
1921677 we put in a lot of weekends nights it was a lot of meetings and preparation but it feels really really good that it has paid off it gives us the encouragement we need to keep moving forward and take on new challenges
1921678 local 814 teamsters at sothebys are celebrating a strong contract that puts an end to more than a decade of givebacks we could not have done it without teamsters for a democratic union
1921679 local 814 members made this victory happen by getting informed and involved tdu gave us the tools we put them into action
1921680 thats how we won big wage increases closed the pay gap and got new language that will limit outsourcing and build our unions power for the future
1921681 organization and communication were key to winning a good contract we showed management that we were united and capable of taking coordinated action
1921682 as negotiations came to a head we used text messages to give members the signal to meet outside for a bargaining update management would see almost the entire workforce meeting outside on our break
1921683 instead of taking the elevator we would march down the escalators in the middle of the building all the way down from the seventh floor when 50 teamsters do that together wearing t shirts that say strong today stronger tomorrow that gets managements attention
1921684 they knew we werent going to settle for a weak contract like in the past
1921685 last time management had a comprehensive plan for how to weaken the union by changing contract language section by section this time it was the rank and file members of the bargaining committee who had systematically gone through the contract and made changes that would strengthen the union
1921686 we started nine months in advance at the tdu convention and then attended contract trainings here in new york without that preparation and the training we got from tdu management would have set the agenda for the negotiations and we would have been on the defensive
1921687 thats what happened in the past we let management create tiers that trapped members at the bottom of the pay scale and divided the workforce this time we went on the offensive and won pay increases that closed the pay gap

1921962 what should be news is the rank hypocrisy of williamss willingness to lay at the feet of canadian and american anglicans the blame for divisions in the communion when the only difference between whats happening in our churches and in his is that were telling the truth about it
1921963 i know dr williams thinks the church is important but this is almost saying the church is more important than belief we had a reformation to change that view
1921964 the communion deserves nothing less than the truth and so does the gospel the times online
1921965 this is more evidence of the unravelling of anglicanism without a clearly agreed biblical foundation all the goodwill in the world cannot stop the inevitable break up unity without truth is disunity
1921966 for many people in the communion what this reveals calls into question the ability of dr williams to lead the communion out of the crisis it is in despite his considerable personal qualities he is so obviously torn in his very person he is bound to give encouragement to one side of the controversy this leaves a vacuum of leadership and that is why the global anglican future conference emerged
1921967 that archbishop rowan williamss theology is identical to that held by canadian and american anglican churches currently blessing same sex unions is not news
1921968 what should be news is the rank hypocrisy of williamss willingness to lay at the feet of canadian and american anglicans the blame for divisions in the communion when the only difference between whats happening in our churches and in his is that were telling the truth about it

1921970 not really a surprise obama kills mccain on google trends
1921971 today i want to commend the legislature in particular senator roy ashburn and assemblywoman cathleen galgiani for their efforts to amend and improve proposition 1 the high speed rail bond on novembers ballot
1921972 i find it difficult to believe that in this day and age we still have educated people defending this dictator dog especially after all that he has done to this country and its people
1921973 look musharraf doesnt have much powers any more and wow just look at how amazing our country is doing we are going down fast the new govt is squeezing out what was left in our country

1921977 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1921978 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1921979 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people

1921982 senator kerry talked of reducing terrorism to quote nuisance end quote and compared it to prostitution and illegal gambling
1921983 see i couldnt disagree more our goal is not to reduce terror to some acceptable level of nuisance our goal is to defeat terror by staying on the offensive destroying terrorists and spreading freedom and liberty around the world
1921984 nor can we think of our goal in this war in the way senator kerry described it yesterday in the new york times
1921985 quote we have to get back to the place he said where terrorism is a nuisance sort of like and these are his comparisons sort of like gambling and prostitution this is naive and dangerous
1921986 the struggle against violent extremists will not end with a single battle or campaign rather we will defeat them through the patient accumulation of quiet successes and the orchestration of all elements of national and international power we will succeed by eliminating the ability of extremists to strike globally and catastrophically while also building the capacity and resolve of local governments to defeat them regionally victory will include discrediting extremist ideology creating fissures between and among extremist groups and reducing them to the level of nuisance groups that can be tracked and handled by law enforcement capabilities
1921987 victory will include discrediting extremist ideology creating fissures between and among extremist groups and reducing them to the level of nuisance groups that can be tracked and handled by law enforcement capabilities
1921988 our goal is not to reduce terror to some acceptable level of nuisance
1921989 i think where the facility or the infrastructure is not urgent where we can afford to delay we will delay
1921990 i mean the sports hub is not so critical that it has to be finished by this particular date so if we can delay one or two years why not we can save some money and also help the construction industry to cool down a bit

1922058 what kind of pressure have you put on police department to get this resolved
1922059 ive been on top of them every single day i have been in constant communication i am meeting daily with the police chief
1922060 oakland does not stand out here in a vacuum oakland is not an isolated island and the fact that we keep talking about oakland as if its some kind of crime capitol of america that is hogwash
1922061 you got to take time to try to figure out what it is were trying to do you dont just call a press conference to call a press conference you call a press conference if you have something to say
1922062 based on the evidence and the witness statements we have at this time the incident appears to be a murder suicide the investigation is on going we are canvassing the neighborhood obviously talking to all family members involved to try to confirm identities motive and any other information that will sustain the investigation
1922063 at which point i was yelling that nyendak was being supported only her lines and that cutting the lines would mean that she would die
1922064 i didnt want to think that somebody was trying to cut my rope so i closed my eyes until i fell down im just lucky to be alive right now
1922065 there is no media freedom there so theres no way of telling whats happening and its up to the tibetans and their supporters living outside of tibet to stand up for the people that are struggling in tibet
1922066 they are taking this on par with two burglars being in their actual home and thats some of the analogies that theyve used so from that perspective i anticipate they are not looking at this as a very simple matter
1922067 fortunately we had the umbrella of the olympic spotlight and they did not want to show a bad face to the international media and the press which i think is a lot different than other situations
1922068 i think for us they were on their best behavior
1922069 especially being a focal point of the media and the world fortunately we had the umbrella of the olympic spotlight they didnt want to show a bad face to the international media and press
1922070 we got taken to a police setup and were questioned for eight hours
1922071 then they deported us back to the u s it was either be deported or spend five days in detention they forced us to buy with our own money tickets back to the us we had no real choice in the matter
1922072 they said we had broken their law and that we had hurt the feelings of the chinese people
1922073 the reason we did all this was not to hurt the chinese people or hurt the olympics we respect the olympics we wanted to shed light on the situation in tibet
1922074 in terms of assembly and demonstrations china has related laws and regulations we hope that foreigners will respect the related chinese laws and regulations
1922075 we firmly oppose any words or acts that interfere in other countries internal affairs using human rights and religion and other issues
1922076 chinese citizens have freedom of religion these are indisputable facts
1922077 the reason im going to the olympics is twofold one to show my respect for the people of china and two to cheer on the u s team
1922078 its not accurate to compare just because of the size of the markets
1922079 proportionately speaking i think greece is the size of beijing population wise
1922080 weve done research in 10 cities throughout china and weve found most consumers have no idea who the actual official sponsors are
1922081 we found 40 percent of consumers thought coke was the sponsor versus 60 percent for pepsi
1922082 the governments going out and saying stop spitting on the street because of the olympics
1922083 theyre using the olympics really as a trigger to reform china chinese consumers have been hit regularly for a decade with olympic themed messages which makes it very difficult for the official sponsors to get their messages above the din
1922084 the one thing were not seeing is what were used to seeing
1922085 thats billboards and advertising all around us theyve just gone theyve been beamed up to planet olympics
1922086 li ning is still a small company and also a fast growing company
1922087 so its only logical that we spend money where we can get the best return
1922088 to an extent yes this is the high water mark
1922089 china is the great game china is where everybody wants to be and so much of the reason people are sponsoring these games is to make a lasting impression on the chinese government and the chinese people

1922112 all of that was speculation from the beginning i think it was clear it was a bad situation in green bay and they had to deal with it any way they could
1922113 green bay never told us what they were interested in trading him for said allen who also insisted talks did not progress to the point that tampa bay ever tried to sell favre himself on the idea of playing for the bucs
1922114 really it never got to any of that he wasnt a free agent we never believed they were going to release him that wasnt their intention it wasnt that type of process
1922115 i said we never believed they were going to trade him to the buccaneers the gm said
1922116 were going to listen to peoples thoughts if theres a way itll benefit the buccaneers allen said
1922117 coach gruden and jeffs relationship goes back a long way the american way is competition i dont think any outside forces are going to affect this football team the gm said
1922118 i want to see the shop see whats going on
1922119 i could write a book on the month of may alone
1922120 hes looking at 2009 hes asking questions and thats a start
1922121 but you cant just expect them to jump on board and expect them to sign up because we had a good race
1922122 at the beginning of the year i didnt realize how deep and how organized that i needed to be
1922123 i run all of the financial side of it if they need something they come to me whether its accounting managing payroll everything a young businessperson goes through
1922124 i dont think its totally from our ontrack performance but who we are how we represent ourselves on and off the track its not just going around in circles theres pressure as a team owner to make sure all the ducks are in a row
1922125 i have a goal in mind and this is what i want to do with my life my family and my team
1922126 its a full time job and its hard but i love it
1922127 people expect more from me after my great last five years but i hope i can still save this season with either this or the u s open
1922128 right now the focus is on the olympic games not the rankings
1922129 winning wimbledon i was only a few points from that that hurt but im over that and looking forward now anything that comes now the olympic games or the u s open would help my confidence a lot
1922130 rafa has done very well in the last year or so to become the no 1 in the world but thats not my focus right now
1922131 before the u s open maybe there will be more talk but were a few days ahead of the olympic games where i hope i can do well
1922132 until the rankings change on the computer i do yeah
1922133 i go down once in a while to see the other swiss athletes and get the olympic feel i was there the other day and its not possible really theres so many athletes who want pictures i dont mind it but every day for i dont know how long its not the ideal preparation to try and win the gold medal
1922134 i went through it in sydney and athens i had those great experiences and i know what the olympic games are all about
1922135 i dont think it really matters were all chasing the same thing an olympic gold and not money
1922136 its one of my dreams to do very well in the olympic games
1922137 carrying the flag is one of those moments you only dream about walking into the stadium with the swiss flag the stadium the biggest ive ever been in i enjoyed it a lot
1922138 this will probably be my most unique unless i have a baby on my birthday but thats not planned yet
1922139 itll be very special im thrilled its on the opening ceremony that i get to carry the flag for switzerland the whole combination is really really nice
1922140 it probably wouldnt have happened had we lost those two games just lost them
1922141 but the way we lost them and the way we didnt compete was very much a part of the decision
1922142 whenever you are going through a bad stretch sometimes you can keep everybody together on the same page and continue to work toward a common goal i dont think i really felt the connectiveness with our team and tree for a while i think we won some games in spite of maybe not having a real together feeling with everybody
1922143 some people have been telling me that me and you should go out
1922144 i wanted us to go out during 9th grade so we dont break up over the summer
1922145 could you give me and jeff a second to talk
1922146 okay the rules are that you can only ask one question
1922147 when was the last time you told him you love him

1922351 in my opinion every latvian would be happy if there werent a need for this show and all latvians lived in their homeland
1922352 besides lr2 is not just the only latvian music radio station in the world but also a public broadcaster with a mission
1922353 to me that means that if just one of those living in ireland after hearing a greeting decides to return to latvia and their loved ones then the show will have fulfilled its charge
1922354 estimated 20 000 to 30 000 latvian citizens now in ireland added to the tens of thousands of post world war ii latvian emigr s and their descendants scattered across the continents not to mention the descendants of all those who left latvia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries
1922355 simply cracking down on use of new web tools like facebook is not a sensible solution to a problem which is only going to get bigger
1922356 its unreasonable for employers to try to stop their staff from having a life outside work just because they cant get their heads around the technology
1922357 better to invest a little time in working out sensible conduct guidelines so that there dont need to be any nasty surprises for staff or employers
1922358 it is then down to individual employers how they tackle the increasing use of popular social networking sites employers do not want to police the private lives of staff or monitor private conversations
1922359 why should employers pay for the privilege of allowing their employees to access facebook myspace or bebo from work computers whether in an employees lunchtime or not
1922360 as we all know lunchtime spreads into work time so where do you draw the line employers do not prevent employees from having a life outside work which means after work when employees are quite free to access all the websites they wish from their own computers
1922361 access to the internet at work should be for legitimate business purposes only on behalf of the employer not an extension of playtime

1922389 i dont want to die ive lived my whole life thinking something special would happen to me that i would eventually find a greater purpose to my own life and that i would die enlightened and now i find that i have some weird asian std that will not only make my orgasms awesome but i could die if i have too many
1922390 the point is to not give up the point is to show life that it can try to take you out and strong arm you into submission but the human spirit will never erode under the weathering of adversity

1922400 im going to issue a strategic challenge that the united states of america set a goal of getting 100 percent of our electricity from renewable resources and carbon constrained fuels within 10 years we need to make a big massive one off investment to transform our energy infrastructure from one that relies on a dirty expensive fuel to fuel that is free
1922401 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
1922402 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
1922403 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
1922404 has developed software that purports to make it easier and cheaper to find and extract oil and natural gas
1922405 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
1922406 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
1922407 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
1922408 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1922409 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
1922410 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
1922411 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
1922412 recent media reports of an unprecedented expansion of access to imagery from united states satellites for domestic surveillance purposes raise significant questions about the scope of this new program its legal basis the privacy safeguards in place to prevent abuse and related issues

1922415 did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us on the road and while he opened the scriptures to us
1922416 we ought to obey god rather than men the god of our fathers raised up jesus whom you murdered by hanging on a tree him god has exalted to his right hand to be prince and savior to give repentance to israel and forgiveness of sins and we are his witnesses to these things and so also is the holy spirit whom god has given to those who obey him
1922417 false brethren unawares brought in who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in christ jesus that they might bring us into bondage
1922418 but of these who seemed to be somewhat whatsoever they were it maketh no matter to me god accepts no mans person
1922419 i will pray the father and he will give you another helper that he may abide with you forever
1922420 there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit there are differences of ministries but the same lord and there are diversities of activities but it is the same god who works all in all
1922421 yet it shall not be so among you but whoever desires to become great among you shall be your servant
1922422 and whoever of you desires to be first shall be slave of all
1922423 for even the son of man did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life a ransom for many
1922424 there is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in christ jesus who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit

1922600 you might want to ask yourself why the entire culture is utterly saturated with mass media entertainment from all sides while the education system in america continues its stupifying downward slide since the us government decided to take over and subsidize the public school system
1922601 what you government pays for it gets when we understand that then we look at government financed institustions of education and see the kind of students and kind of education thats being turned out by these government financed schools logic will tell you that if what is being turned out in those schools is not in accord with what the state and federal government wanted then it would change it the bottom line is the governemt is getting what they have ordered they do not want your children to be educated they do not want you to think to much that is why our country and our world has become so polferated with entertainments mass media television shows amusment parks drugs alcohol and every kind of entertainment that keep the human mind entertained so that you dont get in the way of important people by doing to much thinking you had better wake up and understand that there are people guiding your life and you dont even know it

1922708 willows going crazy trying to figure it out every slayer in south america is having these dreams one of the girls is so uptight about it that were taking her off duty for a month
1922709 willow doesnt have any way of identifying her shes from north america obviously im guessing western us send a team up there
1922710 assuming we can get them across the us border and into california anyway where your big stupid ex refuses to deal with us because its his war
1922711 shes making people crazy we kind of sort of have to find her or itll be worse than being stuck in a terror war zone
1922712 theyre freaking me out im scared something bad is happening to her
1922713 if id known getting hurt meant i had to be poked and prodded by you every morning annie i wouldnt have gone and done it
1922714 i dont know what else to do you know angel always was the guy he had the mojo he knew what to do
1922715 we got obsessed with big pictures and big symbols and it was a mistake and i swear annie if id known well if id known a lot of things i wouldnt have joined in dont think angel would have either
1922716 have you ever heard of calamity supposed to undo all things starting with her destiny its not much of a lead but its what ive got
1922717 we need you back at the dorms danas had another seizure and shes babbling about hell and night and youre the best at getting her to explain things
1922718 are you going to recall andrew buffy seems a little pissed with him hogging the couch she and her boyfriend cant do so much making out with him around
1922719 which is precisely why but yes andrew will be back in london this evening and tomorrow willow and faith will be coming in
1922720 if youve found a lead in this calamity person its better than weve done lately see you in about twenty minutes
1922721 dont think i dont know what youre trying to do
1922722 this is all a construction based on my pathological fears
1922723 now i know you know how to open those legs and arent you ready to be a mommy
1922724 the sooner you give up the easier it will be youll just be one of them and it wont hurt so much
1922725 but you wont remember that you were ever anyone that there was ever anything except the pain you so richly and fully deserve
1922726 and for you selfish opportunistic individualist you are to know that once you might have had a name will keep you awake those two minutes you could sleep in a month
1922727 you ought to sleep and then youll have a perfect little baby waiting when you wake up
1922728 his head is big big like big head angel she cant scream they took away her vocal cords
1922729 i just know and she knows you useless watchers worse than fucking angel the babys coming the babys coming its not real wesley dont watch
1922730 who else do i know any other wesleys i wasnt going to have a baby i was bleeding to death it was a hallucination wesley please dont cry
1922731 please help me i can stop them please please please
1922732 dont you ever get annoyed by this its like totally unfair
1922733 id always found it superfluous myself but thats the rules for you
1922734 its important that someone helps lilah for example and while thats a phrase i never expected to hear myself say its important fate of the universe important and what do we have between ourselves and darkness
1922735 a crazy girl the slayers younger sister and a couple thats not yet a couple
1922736 theres the problem what are we going to do about angel
1922737 any defense he dare offer this court would you care to make complaint against the champion angel
1922738 yet i will trade my servitude for lilah morgans contract
1922739 you accept angels authority still so his contract binds you unless you choose to denounce angels authority and renounce him as champion and employer you have nothing to trade for the morgan woman and you assume that your soul would requite hers
1922740 your destiny is useless to us now your life is ended and it is fulfilled
1922741 give us a champion and well give you calamity those are the terms
1922742 you have to know who she is you know you know
1922743 if your theory is correct young lady it is entirely probably that i do not
1922744 look august 13 and 14th 1983 femi abdullah died on the 13th in zaire apparently the next slayer was supposed to be in california and it looks like her watcher might have made preliminary contact with the mother
1922745 femi abdullah died on the 15th there was no slayer in 1983 from california
1922746 roger had me doing much of the scutwork those days as penance i do not remember this girl
1922747 you wish me to remember an incident twenty one years past and remember what rupert does not that no living man has any recollection of i fear miss summers that youre chasing a phantom in a desperate attempt to prove your own worth
1922748 miss summers has no need to prove herself to you nor to anyone
1922749 shes provided us invaluable information which you with all your vaunted experience have not
1922750 it was to be rogers first active slayer you see the fulfillment of several prophecies instead we found ourselves entangled with a vicious little strumpet whod accidentally killed her own father in a temper and all of our timelines wrong by a dozen years it nearly killed him it was the end of his leadership of the council
1922751 roger wouldnt tell me he gave her over to wolfram and hart who promised to clear up the mess without a word to the council
1922752 the girls uncle worked for them and roger made a fool of himself insisted that she was indeed the slayer and nearly got himself arrested wolfram and hart graciously offered to protect him that poor child you think they tricked her
1922753 i think she traded her destiny for her fathers life
1922754 and i think when she lost that destiny she gained a worse one one that might be tied to your son
1922755 and honestly rupert what do you think it matters if the girls dead shes got no more destiny to speak of and for all you know she died years ago
1922756 i know i think at best shes been dead twenty years and this is her warning to the slayers
1922757 but i suspect its quite a bit more than that whoever she was she changed reality and lost her birthright in fact she never had it in this timeline she changed destiny but she didnt evade it
1922758 but i wonder how exactly you propose to save a damned soul from a destiny that no one knows or understands
1922759 authority be damned its not like i dont know how stupid the powers can be remember ive done this before
1922760 it would undo reality we cant wing down like avenging angels we cant enter the wolfram and hart controlled areas of hell and we cant communicate directly with the sane
1922761 we help dana help lilah its not substantial we help them hold on wolfram and hart is cheating so were not were merely proving that one cannot be tested beyond what she can bear
1922762 if were going to cheat lets also give up the stupid rule that angels are all anonymous and equal in the sight of the powers
1922763 some animals are more equal than others so its rebellion then
1922764 to quote a dreadful blind puritan i knew in times past all is not lost
1922765 the unconquerable will and courage never to submit or yield that glory never shall his wrath or might extort from me
1922766 a report on the new front of the war against angel im on it
1922767 let me get a coffee and thisll be the best recommendation i ever made
1922768 if youre woozy go see the nurse she gives out the stabilizers
1922769 wolfram and hart uses them to keep us from falling apart
1922770 angels having an enormous row with rupes and the bit cuz theyre claiming that wesleys last dead girlfriends got a big time destiny and weve got to help her
1922771 lilah used to run wolfram and hart slept with wes helped take connor the first time lilah
1922772 apparently she maintains some power which angel claims is good for only death and sorrow they were very interested in her every quirk
1922773 they thinkin this has anything to do with wesley no more ex so bye bye planet
1922774 yo angel whats up anne wants me to help out with the neighborhood today if i can shes worried about some of the orphans
1922775 ill need you in a couple of days dawn and faith are coming here to make their problems my problem and i want you to keep an eye on them
1922776 and if theyre right that the evil deads important what then
1922777 is it just me or has he been crazy lately
1922778 we didnt exactly do our mamas proud when we took out the black thorn yo and maybe just me but if the slayers are trying to find a way to help ease the apocalypse i say go slayers
1922779 thought it was his destiny to show he believed in good and freedom and all the things wolfram and hart stood against turns out it wasnt that simple
1922780 for this one is correct angel has been erratic since the loss of his loved ones and the failure of our assault against wolfram and hart we may have to consider him an unreliable warrior if it continues
1922781 love once we find another enemy to attack hell snap out of it
1922782 angel likes to be certain thats all not a crime
1922783 i just need to know where he is and i will be done playing ball and you fucking idiots can go back to being controlled by it
1922784 heh thats funny i remember those books they were good books i liked charles wallace a lot what about you who was your favorite
1922785 stop distracting us unless you have something useful to say or do maybe you can whip up a spell to get me through to wes and out of the hive mind
1922786 there was the cool part of the third book where they did a spell remember
1922787 i mean spells are really sort of concentrated belief the word just kind of shapes it through a persons mind calling on power like do you remember that whole thing in the third book i made a spell out of it once and it kind of worked
1922788 i only kind of remember it was a while ago and i didnt use the books to make teen angst spells youll have to share
1922789 well it went like okay in this fateful hour i call on morgoth with his power morgoth being the demon i wanted to raise
1922790 i dont care what you do pray for me to walk through a wall and find wes whatever do it
1922791 then were all doomed and demons will use your bones for cornmeal
1922792 dont fail focus the little light within and pray andy
1922793 let me out let me my god is that really you
1922794 i have always underestimated just precisely what a magnificent woman you can be
1922795 also were going to talk as we walk about this thing we had and about things in general
1922796 do you know there is very little i regret between you and me
1922797 but i wish id known how injured you were when i let you send me off
1922798 but what i meant was you let me walk away as a token of good faith and i betrayed that you deserved better than for my shame to overcome my decency
1922799 you werent kind at the end but i dont blame you i blame circumstance and mostly angel
1922800 to quote a big dumb pretentious action movie there is no spoon
1922801 he lost his son and his lover and his last true friend there is nothing left for him but vengeance and they bid him help an enemy
1922802 dont know what to do about it hell take them all out now and he wont hold back
1922803 and you may not find it so but living is sweet to me i would not care to die if i could live
1922804 of course that bonny blonde lass hes taken up with might be the reason hes back among the living dont you think
1922805 it makes everything fit he did everything for our son he joined wolfram and hart he sacrificed everyone he loved for the safety of his son and wolfram and hart murdered him without even a parley
1922806 i cant tell if what im feeling is sorrow or pity what a life what a terrible life it wouldve been better if hed died before he was born for everyone
1922807 you cant think that way if the best thing was never to have pain then wed all be better off not even existing
1922808 we do we know trying to change what is just makes it worse thank you very much and weve got a crazy champion on our hands
1922809 itll give us a chance to make alliance anyway lilahs moving fast faster than i thought she could move but damn she loves that man of hers
1922810 i think shes got her feet under her now and come on the girls power hungry the idea of raising hell to knock it over so gets her juices flowing
1922811 you cant tell me there isnt a certain appeal in it
1922812 youre kind of a bust as a higher being you know
1922813 anyway its not our destiny to be a new lucifer were rebel angels on the make we dont get names
1922814 we just get to be at a certain place at a certain time
1922815 what the hell are you all babbling about anyway i pushed destiny i was never a slayer even though i was supposed to be in another version of things thats not remarkable
1922816 its never happened before in a way we could know about
1922817 but its more than that calamity was a figure most major prophecies stepped around rather carefully most scholars didnt believe she was a single figure a current school believed it was buffy summers and her people but if its you the mind rather shies away from the possibilities
1922818 you undid eons of prophecy with that damned amulet you got from lindsey you created the angel merger with wolfram and hart that undid the circle of the black thorn other people do your dirty work but you provide that push that leads to the unthinkable and now you and i are in hell
1922819 they run on the pain the fear of it and the belief that it causes what you believe down here has a heavy impact on reality which is why magic works more reliably
1922820 we wouldnt want your ain true love to end up in isolation would we he doesnt seem to have the same iron backbone you do when it comes to torture
1922821 were leaving if you put us back in our cages ill get out again its not nearly as difficult as you make it out to be once you know its all in your head
1922822 you know that none of your challenges will be legitimate until you can prove youre not wolfram and hart property
1922823 so not only do you have to leave the main offices youre going to have to leave wolfram and harts demesnes for anyone in your form thats impossible so if you can cross the border between this and the rest of the shadowlands its inadvertent proof that youre not here legitimately and that all your claims of a badly fixed destiny are true
1922824 being one of their robots is not terribly enjoyable and i suspect youre going to have an army if you can just get out of here
1922825 how are you going to use a gun in the shadowlands lover
1922826 we just keep moving and remember theyre all as powerless as we are
1922827 this is our hail mary pass on a fourth and ten were doomed screw the odds
1922828 and its screwing the universe hard and now i have to go rescue the bitch from hell literal to stop the bad guys from winning by default
1922829 the lady knows things the rest of us do not
1922830 i listened to dana rave for a long long time spike this is the darkest hour this is the turning point if we lose the slayers were screwed and i keep coming back to the weird of this lilah woman why would wolfram and hart go to so much trouble to divert the slayer line and strip any hint of her destiny why did drusilla let her leave the wine cellar why did cordelia kill her why did jasmine say it was more important that wesley and her got groiny than wesley stealing connor in the big cosmic sense of things
1922831 your points made hell bitch had a way of being in the right place at the right time
1922832 when she was raving dana said she was too important to destroy
1922833 that hell would be overthrown and that the banner would ride high one marble knocked out of orbit knocking back
1922834 id prefer he stayed here but whats he going to do if he doesnt help wesley stays stuck in hell right
1922835 since wolfram and hart killed his werewolf girlfriend and his only son
1922836 why didnt you guys tell us that before buffy would have come
1922837 reality shift and all made it hard to understand just what was going down he told us everything though once he figured out we didnt get it
1922838 that would seem to be the point of the rescue
1922839 its a long way left to go it could take forever but it wont
1922840 whatll it be like once she gets to the other side
1922841 but their power will be broken how can you fear hell when you know its not really real
1922842 as you are the leader i will accede to your request but only if you swear to me it is for honorable purposes
1922843 i just want us down there as soon as we can be
1922844 the center of hell is not far and it is there your token would have to go
1922845 it is the place of cleansing and great deeds the senior partners used that place to unmake the old ones order and now it will be done to them
1922846 one of us should wait out here in case theres an ambush
1922847 if anything goes wrong you and illyria can go back to la and get reinforcements or get people out of here dont fight me on this dawn
1922848 come i wish to find wesley among the damned who wait on the other side of the hill
1922849 shouldnt you have an entourage with you now that youre the big man
1922850 no dont answer that lets go talk whatever youre here to talk about about six feet from here and you can even choke me if you want
1922851 i knew i needed to keep an eye on you i dont know how you convinced dawn and illyria that you were some kind of hero but when i heard that it was all i needed to know and then wesley how could you write a contract that brought him here
1922852 i didnt write the contract i even warned you angel you didnt listen to me and thats not the issue the issue is i have a job to do and thats to take over hell and look at this rather dusty system we have where the label outweighs the deed
1922853 i think gods not a part of this discussion its time to stop relying on sky daddies and monsters under the bed and big words and big gestures
1922854 was your big gesture worth wesleys life or his soul
1922855 dont talk about wesley you could have stopped this you didnt
1922856 and im not going to let someone like you rewrite the rules
1922857 but turns out im the candidate so let me pass or admit that you dont care about the good fight anymore you just care about you
1922858 but i tried your way and now youre going to learn the consequences for your way for what you did to my son
1922859 im sick of this of the war that doesnt end of angel getting crazier of all of it why is it so hard to do good
1922860 this isnt about good or evil charles this is about power and ruling and dominion i mean come on when you agreed to the crazy plan did you really think it was going to lead to good
1922861 i thought it would lead to something better thought maybe people would be free to do more good without wolfram and hart cheating
1922862 forget wolfram and hart forget angel unless youve done good with them and then maybe well think about them a little
1922863 but there are other ways what were staring at right here right now is your past its time to say good bye to it to let go someone has to keep building when they come back youre going to have to tell them
1922864 i think youre right cant change the situation by staring at the ground can we i think i know a place where we can set up therell be people looking to regroup rebuild theyll need us
1922865 please just let me cross ive got to help its got to be me
1922866 you are dead and in hell all you know how to do is ruin things
1922867 tell me one thing ive ruined by overthrowing hell name one city ive leveled out of spite for a deal i took describe for me the son i drove mad name me one person i love who i led to their deaths
1922868 get out of my way angel i am going to undo my contract and undo this order and you are not going to stop me when im this close
1922869 that you didnt have the guts to do what youre condemning me for doing right now
1922870 so is that why youre here to remind me this is all my fault
1922871 you dont change youre not going to change anything except whos sitting in the big chair
1922872 i dont have any proof youre not playing us either
1922873 and we all know how well your wolfram and hart deal worked out
1922874 i lilah morgan being formerly of wolfram and hart los angeles
1922875 do release myself from my contract and all hints of my former destiny and claim further that i not they will henceforth order hell and its domain and that i challenge them as is set down by the ancient law
1922876 you realize that youve got a destiny right to run the rebellion
1922877 its a revolution and i wasnt that interested in heavenly choirs anyway
1922878 doesnt really matter now i crossed out of wolfram and harts control and as long as big broody doesnt try to destroy me ill win
1922879 youre right that youll win if you keep fighting youve been right about a lot of things even if you are calamity for heaven and hell which hey sort of freaked me out at first but then darla helped me get over it besides youve always been good with the sneaky yet successful plans
1922880 and i did this one while i was being oh tortured by the hosts of hell
1922881 get to the point what are you going to do with angel
1922882 hes dangerous on the mortal plane and i kind of hate the idea of angel in hell i think you do too
1922883 you think wrong i want him a big ash pile
1922884 but out of my hairll do theres a war to fight and if hell be useful to you youre welcome to him
1922885 we want him and we want to help you in fact darla and i and a few others who would be better off left unnamed are thinking this new crusade might lead to better conditions everywhere
1922886 so you take our superfluous champion i continue to wage the war in hell the slayers do the real work in the real world and you guys will make some trouble in the elsewhere
1922887 right on time to watch you take angel away so i dont get blamed for him being gone
1922888 in a very real way this is all your fault
1922889 you ready for it cuz i backed you against my sister and my possible girlfriend so id prefer you not be wrong okay
1922890 once angel finally understood he was glad to go with
1922891 this is nuts i mean i was kind of down with lilah crazy anti destiny person even down with her and wes deciding to tear the mother down in hell but angel angel letting the crazy get the better of him and getting dragged off to fight in heaven
1922892 are you recovered from the hell trauma now because once we get to london we wont have time for anything and i think that would be a waste after all when i found out you asked for me to come with i figured you might be well plotting a seduction or to be seduced
1922893 thats one of the reasons i dig you no shame no pity just a love of the sex
1922894 youre so trying to get yours first and deny it was your devious plan all along
1922895 but no more sad tonight buffys in town and shes excited to hear youre better so come on well go get dinner with her
1922896 good you look a little more rested now and see im no longer covered in blood and green goo so im thinking distinct bonus
1922897 why everyone else agreed it was the only way wes
1922898 is it because he has a dick because by my count he screwed you over hard lover he erased your memories and rewrote reality treated you like a traitor at every opportunity sent you to die he brought hell to earth and almost ended any chance of stopping it why are you so damned loyal to him let me guess you dont know
1922899 just not a good friend a good father or a good champion
1922900 and cordy and darla have given him a chance to be the hero he could be so what else is there to say
1922901 he was a hero dont you think that possibly just maybe its hard to accept that i wasted my time with angel as much as you think i did
1922902 but i also dont know if i can handle having a partner who spends all his time thinking of me as a bad substitute for angel
1922903 and before you say a word i understand you dont believe i should blame myself that doesnt prevent it
1922904 but we can only blame ourselves for so long before it gets in the way of better things
1922905 nothings easy to see down there its the big plus of being up here understanding getting to see how its not that bad after all
1922906 with the unfortunate negative of not being able to do much
1922907 of course in a revolution in praxis its the symbols that matter like the paris commune
1922908 this the first time in 14 years of filing over 35 reports that anyone has sought to complain to the commission
1922909 this does not diminish or take away from the fact that several mistakes were made by me but it puts it in perspective
1922910 what do you call a beautiful woman on a drummers arm a tattoo
1922911 this is not meant to diminish bpp but morning edition and all things considered have more younger podcast listening than does bpp and way more radio listening simply because wide radio carriage delivers awareness of both
1922912 the fcc is considering a proposal that would force every radio station to take programming advice from community advisory boards broadly representative of an areas population
1922913 that means that christian broadcast stations could be forced to take programming advice from people whose values are at odds with the gospel
1922914 we know from its experience that relying too heavily on non paid citizen contributors isnt a winning strategy

1922947 that by introducing the returns of hom opathic practitioners they the treatment committee would not only compromise the value and utility of their averages of cure as deduced from the operation of known remedies but they would give an unjustifiable sanction to an empirical practice alike opposed to the maintenance of truth and to the progress of science
1922948 copies of letters addressed to the general board of health complaining of the omission of any notice of certain returns in relation to the treatment of cholera and correspondence between the president of the board and the medical council with copies of the returns which have been rejected by the medical council
1922949 when cholera finally struck europe in 1831 the mortality rate under conventional treatment was between 40 imperial council of russia to 80 oslers practice of medicine out of five people who contracted cholera two to four of them died under regular treatment
1922950 dr quin in london reported the mortality in the ten homeopathic hospitals in 1831 32 as 9 dr roth physician to the king of bavaria reported that under homeopathic care the mortality was 7 admiral mordoinow of the imperial russian council reported 10 mortality under homeopathy and dr wild allopathic editor of dublin quarterly journal reported in austria the allopathic mortality was 66 and the homeopathic mortality was 33
1922951 how can you have homeopathic medicines labelled by a department which is driven by science
1922952 there is not one jot of evidence supporting the notion that homeopathic medicines are of any assistance whatsoever
1922953 when i asked 210 gps to rate different forms of evidence that in practice they would want before using or recommending an unorthodox therapy their answers suggested that evidence forms a multidimensional mosaic an evidence profile 2
1922954 professor sackett opens his seminal book on evidence based medicine 3 with
1922955 it was good science at the time because that was what you did
1922956 outcome and costs of homoeopathic and conventional treatment strategies a comparative cohort study in patients with chronic disorders
1922957 evidence based medicine is the integration of best research evidence with clinical expertise and patient values
1922958 quantum mechanics proved 80 years ago that all of these concepts are approximate relative and contingent and that absolute objectivity is a complete myth
1922959 there are plenty of double blind placebo controlled rcts showing a positive effect for homeopathy
1922960 the two systems are different and you cant test one system using the principles of another
1922961 there are plenty of double blind placebo controlled rcts showing a positive effect for homeopathy
1922962 the two systems are different and you cant test one system using the principles of another
1922963 the important thing about homoeopathy and any other form of energy medicine is it does not do it for the body as a conventional chemical will it gets the body to do it for itself
1922964 there is not one jot of evidence supporting the notion that homeopathic medicines are of any assistance whatsoever
1922965 if attempts to replicate the data under controlled conditions and certain assumptions fail then the assumptions and the conditions youre controlling for need to be re examined
1922966 im sure a b let me test this rigorously to see whether it is true ah look if i remove all extraneous factors and test this assumption very very carefully i find that a b so despite what it looks like despite what i was hoping for despite what i expected a is not b
1922967 im sure a b let me test this rigorously to see whether it is true ah look if i test this assumption i find that a b however i know i absolutely know beyond a shadow of doubt that a is b because ive seen it so obviously i just havent tested it in the right way
1922968 were talking about a large body of people over a period of 200 years all of whom have experimentally verified and consistently replicated this experience for themselves and their patients time after time after time
1922969 it may defy explanation and it may defy attempts to replicate it under controlled conditions and certain assumptions but the data is not deniable
1922970 your explanations are totally unsatisfactory they dont fit the data if the explanations are not a good fit for the data then we need to look elsewhere
1922971 this is a common response to remedy b prescribed in these circumstances in other words its replicable and has been for 200 years
1922972 but we do know it doesnt work very convincingly in these trials therefore what is being controlled for in the trials or the assumptions behind the whole notion of these trials is up for re examination
1922973 if this produces consistent replicable predictable and powerful results that are at least as effective as pharmaceutical interventions again see above citations then why are the health services of western nations bankrupting themselves to the pharmaceutical industry why are tens of thousands of people dying and the quality of life of many more being ruined by the side effects of drugs alone
1922974 relies on a quaint old idea from the nineteenth century that the only way that the property of water can be affected or changed is by incorporating foreign molecules this is the avogadro limit high school level chemistry argument to a materials scientist this notion is absurd since the fundamental paradigm of materials science is that the structure property relationship is the basic determinant of everything it is a fact that the structure of water and therefore the informational content of water can be altered in infinite ways
1922975 the best feature on a science subject in a national or regional newspaper 2003 1 for an article on mmr
1922976 the study demonstrates the difficulties of drawing inferences in the absence of a non exposed population or a clearly defined causal hypothesis
1922977 the number and possible impact of biases in this study was so high that interpretation of the results is impossible
1922978 the interpretation of the study by madsen was made difficult by the unequal length of follow up for younger cohort members as well as the use of the date of diagnosis rather than onset of symptoms of autism
1922979 in the united kingdom dr fombonne has provided advice on the epidemiology and clinical aspects of autism to scientists advising parents to vaccine manufacturers and to several government committees between 1998 and 2001 since june 2004 dr fombonne has been an expert witness for vaccine manufacturers in us thimerosal litigation none of his research has ever been funded by the industry
1922980 the consistency of prevalence estimates across the two surveys supports high reliability or reproducibility of parental report of autism and reliability is one important component of validity
1922981 its not perfect science textbooks are always being updated and thats a good thing if more evidence came out to suggest that mmr caused autism everyone would happily start changing their mind
1922982 no credible evidence of an involvement of mmr with either autism or crohns disease was found no field studies of the vaccines effectiveness were found but the impact of mass immunisation on the elimination of the diseases has been demonstrated worldwide
1922983 evidence based medicine is beautiful elegant clever and most of all important
1922984 all im saying is that all the evidence is flawed in some way
1922985 so on your final point i strongly disagree it is absolutely not wrong to persuade pcts to withdraw funding for homeopathy
1922986 when i asked 210 gps to rate different forms of evidence that in practice they would want before using or recommending an unorthodox therapy their answers suggested that evidence forms a multidimensional mosaic an evidence profile 2

1922990 thats a matter of opinion not fact and depends on a very subjective definition of
1922991 givescienceachance just trashed homeopath bloggers ii by asking bloggers to explain about how rcts work nobody has been able to answer it amazing
1922992 theres 200 years worth of consistency and replicability throughout this body of work enabling predictability in use and continual reconfirmation
1922993 do you live in the real world m or just in your idealised black and white notion of it nothing is 100 predictable 100 of the time
1922994 that doesnt mean that replicability and consistency cant be established to a perfectly reasonable and acceptable degree
1922995 as to quantification no comprehensive studies have been done in any case you cant separate the remedys replicability from the skill of the homeopath prescribing it if the remedy isnt the right one for the case then it wont work in that instance another one will
1922996 that doesnt mean that replicability and consistency cant be established to a perfectly reasonable and acceptable degree
1922997 look weve seen black swans heres our independently verified observation records heres a video of them
1922998 unconventional claims have to be proved before they can be investigated
1922999 the skeptic dismisses claims due to all evidence pointing the outlandishness of that claim while no evidence is produced to back it up
1923000 unconventional claims have to be proved before they can be investigated
1923001 a man came in with lung cancer here are some x rays we treated him he got better
1923002 our work generates response often from other circlemakers and can sometimes act to catalyse a wide range of paranormal events i still believe there is a genuine phenomenon but i now also believe that were a part of it
1923003 for the aids references see peter duesbergs work a wider summary of all the various arguments against the hiv hypothesis can be found here
1923004 theres a ridiculous number of violations of good science in the development of this hypothesis which are frankly indefensible
1923005 well of course thats par for the course for anyone opposing the orthodoxy on any issue play the man not the ball doesnt mean any of it holds water or that duesberg is wrong
1923006 a study of the 394 705 americans found to have aids from 1984 to 1997 and reported to the surveillance system of the centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta showed that median survival times rose to 46 months from 11 months during the period
1923007 let us admit what all idealists admit the hallucinatory nature of the world let us do what no idealist has done let us search for unrealities that confirm that nature i believe we shall find them in the antinomies of kant and in the dialectic of zeno the greatest wizard novalis writes memorably would be the one who bewitched himself to the point of accepting his own phantasmagorias as autonomous apparitions wouldnt that be our case i surmise it is so we that indivisible divinity that operates in us have dreamed the world we have dreamed it as enduring mysterious visible omnipresent in space and stable in time but we have consented to tenuous and eternal intervals of illogicalness in its architecture that we might know it is false
1923008 you have even stated in the past that absolutely nothing would convince you that homeopathy doesnt work
1923009 bias in the conduct and reporting of trials is a possible explanation for positive findings of trials of both homoeopathy and conventional medicine
1923010 we see things not as they are but as we are
1923011 based on a 200 year old theory of disease that has been demonstrated to be wrong
1923012 bias in the conduct and reporting of trials is a possible explanation for positive findings of trials of both homoeopathy and conventional medicine
1923013 offered significant criticisms of the work noting that other studies performed as part of the pek program showed that homeopathic treatment is cheaper than conventional treatment and that patients treated with homeopathy show greater improvement than after conventional treatment with less side effects and less hospitalisation
1923014 an interprofessional postgraduate education programme in homeopathy adhom the academic departments of ghh became the most popular postgraduate medical course in the uk orthodox or otherwise in a decade around 20 of scottish gps completed basic level training and according to one surveys findings two years after attending this foundation course 78 were still integrating elements of homeopathy in their nhs
1923015 our work generates response often from other circlemakers and can sometimes act to catalyse a wide range of paranormal events i still believe there is a genuine phenomenon but i now also believe that were a part of it
1923016 m just because i say i give all kinds of ideas house room doesnt mean i subscribe to them you asked is there anything which you and i can agree on as being loony tunes
1923017 the patterns are too precise on hilly terrain the lay is adjusted for the terrain so the geometry is perfect when viewed from the air
1923018 these are sometimes so quick and strong that only the blind and intransigent could attribute them to chance placebo wishful thinking or deceit
1923019 these reactions dont occur in every case but they occur often enough to be well beyond the bounds of any kind of coincidence
1923020 there are more things on this earth horatio than are dreamt of in your philosophy
1923021 lucretia borgia is the most unfortunate woman in modern history is this because she was guilty of the most hideous crimes or is it simply because she has been unjustly condemned by the world to bear its curse the question has never been answered mankind is ever ready to discover the personification of human virtues and human vices in certain typical characters found in history and fable
1923022 the problems with clinical trials of cam a case of wholly holey socks
1923023 younger age and more severe disease at baseline were factors predictive of better therapeutic successes
1923024 no no this doesnt show homeopathy works you didnt deal with the lack of homogeneity presented by individualised treatment you didnt quantify the impact of the homeopaths confidence in their remedy selections go back and get me more anecdotes damit
1923025 although quantum mechanics has been around for nearly 70 years it is still not generally understood or appreciated even by those that use it to do calculations yet it should concern us all because it is a completely different picture of the physical universe and of reality itself
1923026 many scientists are like einstein in that they have a deep emotional attachment to determinism unlike einstein they have accepted the reduction in our ability to predict that quantum theory brought about but that was far enough i feel these scientists have not learnt the lesson of history the universe does not behave according to our pre conceived ideas it continues to surprise us
1923027 quantum entanglement is as real as we can say anything is
1923028 our understanding of entanglement show us that there can be no possibility of a entanglement effect in the prescribing practices of homeopaths
1923029 the story of little red riding hood is similarly a metaphor of childhood development but i would not refer to it as a guide to managing neuroendocrine problems in adolescents
1923030 unlike einstein they have accepted the reduction in our ability to predict that quantum theory brought about
1923031 nobody gets struck down by lightning because their views are
1923032 fundamental reality supports all of us in our subjective constructs of it
1923033 we really do need to stop mistaking the maps for the territory
1923034 unlike einstein they have accepted the reduction in our ability to predict that quantum theory brought about
1923035 yet much of science particularly biomedical science still behaves as if absolute objectivity internal consistency linear logic and deterministic predictabiliy are cornerstones of the fundamental
1923036 we really do need to stop mistaking the maps for the territory
1923037 by randomising patients to either geniune homeopathic treatment or to a homeopathic style interview conducted by a non homeopath plus placebo
1923038 i would expect the difference between rm and s to be similar to that already established in trials of individualised homeopathy between rm and placebo
1923039 the administration of the remedy does have an effect as the trial data already suggest
1923040 there is an effect beyond placebo in a significant majority of trials before you start meta analysing them down to a bare handful that meet your
1923041 2 in trials of individualised homeopathy the placebo group are subject to treatment effect resulting from the practitioners remedy selection decision therefore the placebo group youre using for comparison is not a true placebo group for testing the therapy
1923042 the administration of the remedy does have an effect as the trial data already suggest
1923043 there really isnt much room for doubt that there is something in the homeopathic process that is capable of instigating highly effective and permanent cure in people suffering all kinds of conditions many of which are serious and non self limiting
1923044 what do you think could it work and if not why not
1923045 the amount of positive evidence even among the best studies came as a surprise to us based on this evidence we would be ready to accept that homoeopathy can be efficacious if only the mechanism of action were more plausible
1923046 the way in which the belief of people changes after the presentation of empirical evidence depends on their prior beliefs and on the quality of the evidence critical people who did not believe in the efficacy of homoeopathy before reading the evidence presented here probably will still not be convinced people who were more ambivalent in advance will perhaps have a more optimistic view now whereas people who already believed in the efficacy of homoeopathy might at this moment be almost certain that homoeopathy works
1923047 these experts identified 377 clinical trials short listed 220 and reviewed 184 detailed research lasting several months was conducted on the best trials to evaluate their scientific value the conclusions researched by the advisory group are unequivocal the number of significant results cannot be attributed to chance the null hypothesis that homeopathy has no effect can be rejected with certainty in other words in at least one of the studies examined the patients treated with the homeopathic remedy received benefits compared with the control patients who received the placebo
1923048 randomized or quasirandomized controlled clinical trials comparing an individualized homeopathic treatment strategy with placebo no treatment or another treatment were eligible information on patients methods interventions outcomes and results was extracted in a standardized manner and quality was assessed using a checklist and two scoring systems trials providing sufficient data were pooled in a quantitative meta analysis
1923049 a total of 32 trials 28 placebo controlled 2 comparing homeopathy and another treatment 2 comparing both involving a total of 1778 patients met the inclusion criteria the methodological quality of the trials was highly variable in the 19 placebo controlled trials providing sufficient data for meta analysis individualized homeopathy was significantly more effective than placebo pooled rate ratio 1 62 95 confidence interval 1 17 to 2 23 but when the analysis was restricted to the methodologically best trials no significant effect was seen
1923050 the selection criteria were randomised controlled trials in which the efficacy of homeopathic treatment was assessed relative to placebo in patients using clinical or surrogate endpoints prevention trials or those evaluating only biological e ffects were excluded one hundred and eighteen randomised trials were identified and evaluated for inclusion sixteen trials representing 17 comparisons and including a total of 2617 evaluated patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria the reasons for exclusion of the remaining 102 trials were primary outcome not clearly defined 92 90 and methodological defects 10 10
1923051 the signficant combined p value obtained in the main analysis does not imply that the homeopathic treatments were efficacious in all the pooled comparisons this result provides evidence that in at least one trial the homeopathic treatment was more efficacious than placebo in other words
1923052 although we cannot exclude the possibly that the results of the meta analysis are a ffected by publication bias the results of the sensitivity analysis suggest that this is unlikely
1923053 from the available evidence it is likely that among the tested homeopathic treatments tested at least one shows an added e ffect relative to placebo
1923054 when orthodox scientists statisticians molecular chemists clinicians and mathematicians and rigorous scientifically trained academic clinical homeopaths begin corresponding in response to the publication of a paper in a learned journal to draw attention to a serious scientific error quite apart from its associated moral and ethical implications and when letter after letter quietly reasoned and objectively critical of the original publication is rejected by the initiating journal it is surely time to reflect very deeply on what might be taking place and to ask
1923055 we assumed that the effects observed in placebo controlled trials of homoeopathy could be explained by a combination of methodological deficiencies and biased reporting conversely we postulated that the same biases could not explain the effects observed in comparable placebo controlled trials of conventional medicine
1923056 for example for the eight trials of homoeopathic remedies in acute infections of the upper respiratory tract that were included in our sample the pooled effect indicated a substantial beneficial effect odds ratio 0 36 95 ci 0 26 0 50 and there was neither convincing evidence of funnel plot asymmetry nor evidence that the effect differed between the trial classified as of higher reported quality and the remaining trials such sensitivity analyses might suggest that there is robust evidence that the treatment under investigation works however the biases that are prevalent in these publications as shown by our study might promote the conclusion that the results cannot be trusted
1923057 double blind and or randomised placebo controlled trials of clinical conditions were considered our review of 186 trials identified 119 that met the inclusion criteria 89 had adequate data for meta analysis and two sets of trial were used to assess reproducibility
1923058 the combined odds ratio for the 89 studies entered into the main meta analysis was 2 45 95 ci 2 05 2 93 in favour of homoeopathy the odds ratio for the 26 good quality studies was 1 66 1 33 2 08 and that corrected for publication bias was 1 78 1 03 3 10
1923059 the results of our meta analysis are not compatible with the hypothesis that the clinical effects of homoeopathy are completely due to placebo however we found insufficient evidence from these studies that homoeopathy is clearly efficacious for any single clinical condition
1923060 when the analysis was restricted to the methodologically best trials no significant effect was seen
1923061 the results of our meta analysis are not compatible with the hypothesis that the clinical effects of homoeopathy are completely due to placebo
1923062 however we found insufficient evidence from these studies that homoeopathy is clearly efficacious for any single clinical condition
1923063 but being open minded and curious i tried it for myself
1923064 im constantly altering my view of the world according to my experience of it and continually testing the resultant theory as a consequence
1923065 how can someone call themselves a scientist if they put the theory on a pedestal and rely on ridiculing the bearers of new evidence and discounting their evidence as invalid in order to continue to keep faith in their theory
1923066 oof that make of car is dreadful they dont make sense the way theyre put together they cant possibly go theyre sold by a bunch of con artists who are just out to take you for a ride ditch it my car is far superior thats the sort of car you should have
1923067 the whole forum is set up as some kind of homeopath baiting sport based on the unshakable conviction that homeopathy doesnt work
1923068 most of the participants seem to spend their time in mutual self congratulatory back slapping for the latest
1923069 but if something doesnt actually do what it claims to do on the tin there is no way on earth that it could possibly survive for 200 years it would be lucky to get past 2
1923070 belief systems can come and go and are neither here nor there but if something doesnt actually do what it claims to do on the tin there is no way on earth that it could possibly survive for 200 years it would be lucky to get past 2
1923071 lets take a different example to see if it helps you buy a car
1923072 claim to be able to cure aids autism and cancer
1923073 but yet again and this is something i completely fail to understand with all of you if someone is making claims you find hard to believe why dont you go check it out for yourself sit in with them in practice review their case notes check out the lab work and scans sit down and listen to what they have to say and what their patients have to say about the treatment and then make up your minds what are you all so frightened of that you might actually be wrong that you might actually have to rewrite your world view as a result
1923074 let me ask you this how would you feel about your behaviour towards these people if it later turns out that their claims are verifiable stranger things have happened the world is full of surprises
1923075 it is these individuals who attract my ire and i will not apologise or take back my words against them
1923076 claim to be able to cure aids autism and cancer
1923077 the absolute core of homeopathic pharmacy was the discovery from empirical observation that the characteristic properties of a solute are somehow maintained through repeated cycles of dilution and succussion in an alcohol water mix and transmissible to individuals when ingested and that this phenomenon is consistently replicable
1923078 there is no assumption that this is a chemical effect
1923079 diluting on its own doesnt work it has to be dilution succussion
1923080 a complete inabilty to grasp the possibility of being wrong
1923081 as for things like musical downloads well i know next to nothing about them how can i condemn something i know nothing about thats irrational it would be making a judgement based on opinion and presupposition not evidence
1923082 if you cant discern the difference between belief which is a model of experience and amenable to change and experience itself which simply is what it is and cant be changed then there really is no point in discussing this further with you
1923083 im a bit dubious about the music downloads too on the face of it but i cant condemn them because i have nothing to base that condemnation on
1923084 make it so you dont have a malaria shaped hole in your energy
1923085 im a bit dubious about the music downloads too on the face of it but i cant condemn them because i have nothing to base that condemnation on
1923086 make it so you dont have a malaria shaped hole in your energy
1923087 i didnt say it was i said that what was transmitted was a chemical property in this instance the ability to cause cure certain symptoms
1923088 it might actually sound offensive to m simpson i just wanted to try to make an impact that could make him think a little bit in a different direction
1923089 im very angry about it because people are going to get malaria there is absolutely no reason to think that homeopathy works to prevent malaria and you wont find that in any textbook or journal of homeopathy so people will get malaria people may even die of malaria if they follow this advice
1923090 now dont you think its about time you started answering some of my questions in return
1923091 youre denying everyone else the freedom to choose their own healthcare modalities which you have absolutely no right to do
1923092 oh no lightning queen is all the way to the edge
1923093 the new sigma has improved noise and bloom control for cleaner smoother images with better controlled color saturation and detail the shutter speed capability of the sd14 is greatly increased over its predecessors and will meet most needs short of astrophotography or other very long exposure work
1923094 the good removable ir cut filter lets you use the sd14 for infrared photography and acts as a dust shield for the sensor during normal photography the bad slow performance overall overly noisy images at iso 800 and iso 1600 poor control scheme inelegant design and ergonomics
1923095 our image quality tests came down in favor of raw files over jpegs
1923096 most importantly the image quality from the sd14 at its best is simply superb
1923097 well ive had a week of occasionally playing with the camera and to be honest its growing on me it is much easier to use than the previous models and much much more reliable no hissy fits with the batteries which although the indicator in the top lcd quite quickly shows only charge has lasted me all day on a couple of occasions and to be truthful i rather like the output from the jpeg option
1923098 a practising english lawyer graduate in physics and a sometime examining lecturer on law standards and ethics particularly the law of evidence to masters student technologists at the imperial college of science technology and medicine
1923099 reliable evidence is that which is authentic accurate and complete in short scientific evidence is incomplete if used for purposes outside the strict confines of science
1923100 examples in point include the parental evidence of symptoms in the mmr cases or that of gulf war veterans about their symptoms
1923101 science treats evidence of lay witnesses of fact as inadmissible as anecdotal only for reasons which are inapplicable in court but science does so for two main reasons
1923102 neither of these propositions apply in court evidence of the direct witness of the fact whether oral or more frequently now by way of written statement is always admissible and is in fact the
1923103 governments also take advantage of the confusion and often use the term evidence interchangeably with proof when dismissing evidence they choose not to agree with or set unreasonably high standards of proof for the kind of decision required
1923104 it is a fundamental error to apply the wrong standard of proof to the decision making process concerned and yet it seems to happen regularly
1923105 for issues of public safety such as medicines like mmr or vaccines in the gulf war or the bse crisis the risk standard ought to be applied
1923106 however instead we the public are told frequently by officials in government there is no scientific evidence of a causal link between one thing and another
1923107 in the scientific context the only answer to a scientific issue that scientific journals should involve themselves in is a scientific one and they should only trouble themselves with the scientific standard of proof
1923108 the current political debates about these kinds of issues are ones science could answer if only the scientists got on with it and stopped playing politics
1923109 it is for example no answer to wakefield to claim there is no scientific evidence of a link between mmr and autism
1923110 buried in the mmr debate and little known to the general public is formal confirmation of a link between immunisation and the so called allergy epidemics in the developed world
1923111 a clear indication of the possibility of the existence of a causal connection between vaccination and the emergence of the various allergy and other issues over the last 20 years is the contemporaneous substantial increase in vaccinations as reported by the iom 3
1923112 whilst the iom considered 4 as regards asthma in particular and allergies in general it had inadequate evidence to accept or reject a causal relationship it accepted there is cause to consider that there might be a connection
1923113 the ioms conclusion is also not a reliable one for government to apply to the risk standard of proof because the iom rely upon the scientific standard of proof and that is the wrong standard to apply for a decision based on risk
1923114 but when there is such substantial variance between the observed phenomena according to day to day standards of evidence and the preferred scientific hypothesis then something has to have gone badly wrong
1923115 well are you saying that it is dangerous or harmful to believe in ghosts psychics or dare i say it god
1923116 what is the difference if any between the vast amount of anecdotal evidence for the existence of alien visitors and ghosts and psychics and the vast amount of anecdotal evidence for homeopathy
1923117 oh really a new survey indicates a strong correlation between rates of neurological disorders such as adhd and autism and childhood vaccinations while this doesnt point the finger specifically at mmr its necessarily one of the vaccines implicated
1923118 there is no evidence in support of homeopathy that we accept
1923119 this ridiculous notion that any one therapy should be all things to all men and that to concede one therapy is better in some situations and another in others is somehow an admission that one or the other doesnt work at all
1923120 youre relying in large part on the skill of the homeopath to select the right remedy in the right potency first time something which in practice probably only happens in around 50 60 of cases
1923121 i have yet to see a homeopath answer a question answer a question like
1923122 for god knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like god knowing good and evil
1923123 reality is merely an illusion albeit a very persistent one
1923124 however it seems to be the case that for people exhibiting pathology as opposed to provers setting out with the intention to test remedies if a remedy isnt right then it just seems to sail right on past them without producing any proving symptoms of note
1923125 anyone can make this observation its not a uniquely homeopathic perspective eg succumb to a good dose of the flu and your habitual heartburn and indigestion go into remission for the duration
1923126 few people are capable of expressing with equanimity opinions which differ from the prejudices of their social environment most people are even incapable of forming such opinions
1923127 science presents a highly fragmented view of the world it restricts qm pretty much to particle physics since thats the area its proved itself most precise for the rest we have a largely newtonian construct that fails to integrate the profoundly different perspective on existence that qm brought about or to acknowledge or involve the role of consciousness and the subjectivity of the observer in any of it
1923128 we have a largely newtonian construct that fails to integrate the profoundly different perspective on existence that qm brought about or to acknowledge or involve the role of consciousness and the subjectivity of the observer in any of it
1923129 thus at present it is not possible to claim clinical superiority for homeopathy individualized or otherwise over placebo
1923130 patients frequently report a marked improvement in their condition before they receive the remedy from the practitioner it can be so quick and strong they can pinpoint a date and time
1923131 eastern thought on the other hand is pretty weak on the technological side of things
1923132 so how do we deal with this impasse the only way out that seems plausible to me is to find a theoretical framework a metaphor capable of accounting for all of this at present there isnt one so logically we need to look outside our present models and suggest mechanisms which have so far not been subject to extensive investigation because if they had we would have a better explanation already this is not going to provide instant answers because an enormous amount of work remains to be done to test any theory put forward
1923133 so if discussions arent scathing and sarcastic theyre boring have you any idea how desperately sad that sounds what that boils down to is a community of people that can only feel good about themselves if theyre putting others down i know its a national disease we catch at an early age but we have a choice when we get old enough to know better and you wonder why so many people in this country are chronically sick and why so many are turning their backs on science
1923134 but it is quite otherwise with the artificial morbific agents which we term medicines every real medicine namely acts at all times under all circumstances on every living human being and produces in him its peculiar symptoms distinctly perceptible if the dose be large enough so that evidently every living human organism is liable to be affected and as it were innoculated with the medicinal disease at all times and absolutely unconditionally
1923135 eastern thought on the other hand is pretty weak on the technological side of things
1923136 western science and eastern thought are broad generalisations referring more to traditions that the present distribution of each in the world western science has crossed over to the east and eastern thought has crossed over to the west no insult is implied to anyone involved in either
1923137 how many times have you been thinking of someone you havent heard from for a while and 5 minutes later the phone rings and its them these correlations exist whether you choose to dismiss them or not
1923138 the response to placebo in these trials was exceptionally large
1923139 in fact there may be lots of different mechanisms for example
1923140 when i was starting out as a doctor my professor told me about a new migraine drug
1923141 i prescribed it to a number of my patients and it worked brilliantly many were completely cured but then i began thinking about its mechanisms and how to design a trial and it somehow stopped working so well i never again got such good results as when i totally believed in it i dont think you can measure that sort of thing in clinical trials but it is absolutely vital to the way medicine should work
1923142 placebo painkillers somehow activate the brains endorphins while placebo aspirin activates a natural anti inflammatory effect
1923143 there is only a stream of wellbeing which you are allowing or not
1923144 placebo painkillers somehow activate the brains endorphins while placebo aspirin activates a natural anti inflammatory effect
1923145 i suppose not one of us has approached homeopathy otherwise than with doubt and mistrust but facts have been too much for us
1923146 hospital doctor referrals to the ghh glasgow homeopathic hospital integrative care unit have grown from 5 in 1990 to 20 in 2005 the rise in referral rate from gps and in the numbers trained in the uk reflects the positive attitude which many doctors now have towards this treatment practitioners are rating the treatment as useable and useful in nhs practice with around 80 reporting continued integration of homeopathy in their nhs general practice 2 years after attending basic training
1923147 wheres your evidence in support of the statement that homeopaths act as if these phenomena placebo etc dont exist
1923148 take one of the things that characterises the sceptical dialogue is the complete refusal to acknowledge the validity of any perspective other that the fundamentalist interpretation of what might loosely be termed the scientific world view
1923149 wheres your evidence in support of the statement that homeopaths act as if these phenomena placebo etc dont exist
1923150 youre hardly going to attract the sort of attention that leads to your isp pulling the plug on your site if your points are merely serious and sincere
1923151 one of the key issues in conceptual development research concerns what kinds of causal devices young children use to understand the biological world we review evidence that children predict and interpret biological phenomena especially human bodily processes on the basis of vitalistic causality that is they assume that vital power or life force taken from food and water makes humans active prevents them from being taken ill and enables them to grow these relationships are also extended readily to other animals and even to plants recent experimental results show that a majority of preschoolers tend to choose vitalistic explanations as most plausible vitalism together with other forms of intermediate causality constitute unique causal devices for naive biology as a core domain of thought
1923152 i suppose not one of us has approached homeopathy otherwise than with doubt and mistrust but facts have been too much for us
1923153 the newton of medicine has not yet appeared and unfortunately we may fear that we shall never see the genius who will convey that to medicine which physics found in algebra and which chemistry found in a pair of scales medicine is still what those sciences were a hundred years ago a collection of unconnected theses
1923154 the fundamental forces of electromagnetism gravity and the two nuclear forces
1923155 facts can be established before a theoretical understanding of them is established
1923156 to andy lewis do you see homeopathy as science or as medicine
1923157 you can provide the scientific theory which underpins the definition of diseases that must be easy since diseases are the basic starting point for orthodox medicine
1923158 i do not believe homeopathy works by the placeno sic effect and have never said such a thing
1923159 for my part i believe most homeopathic beliefs about effectiveness are due to false attribution people get better homeopathy claims benefit
1923160 hard placebo effects where a belief can genuinely alter physiological states such as temperature swelling pain response etc
1923161 are you ever going to aswer a direct question or not
1923162 what biological mechanisms allow homeopathic treatments to enable homeostatsis in humans
1923163 the ability of a living system to maintain and regulate stable values for biological system parameters
1923164 science has to be grounded in empiricism thats its foundation
1923165 lost the argument that homeopathy has any claim to science
1923166 when i use the word science it means just what i choose it to mean neither more nor less
1923167 you bought up homeostasis what do you mean by it then your questions are quite absurd
1923168 any theory of homeopathy should be consilient with other areas of science
1923169 now those questions anyone want to take a stab at explaining how homeostasis has anything to do with homeopathy
1923170 the whole of biological science is now based on the central dogma of molecular biology dna to rna to protein and the evolutionary origin of the diversity of life
1923171 homeopathy has a long way to go before it can claim it has a theory to describe it
1923172 facts can be established before a theoretical understanding of them is established
1923173 i do not really see how this precludes the existence of life force
1923174 they are often described in spiritual or mystical terms are unnecessary to describe biological systems and there is not a shred of evidence to suggest they exist or any rational reason to presume so science by definition is the study of the natural not supernatural if homeopaths claim there are supernatural elements to their beliefs then fine but this thread developed on the premise that homeopathy was scientific
1923175 forces or phenomena which are not subject to natural laws and therefore beyond verifiable measurement
1923176 can you provide a reference to a study in a peer reviewed scientific journal demonstrating the existence of a life force that has been replicated by further experiment neither can i therefore the idea of a life force contradicts any of the current science
1923177 deny the truth of a statement by asserting the opposite
1923178 andy says limits to newtonian mechanics and how newtons laws were incomplete
1923179 the whole of biological science is now based on the central dogma of molecular biology
1923180 homeopaths make two fundamental mistakes with homeostasis firstly they see the body does have specific homeostasis mechanisms ph temp blood sugar urea etc but they make the mistake of turning this into a general principle where the body can regulate arbitrary variables there is no evidence for this and no reason to believe it is true
1923181 homeostasis is the existence and maintenance of a relatively constant environment in the body
1923182 the whole of biological science is now based on the central dogma of molecular biology
1923183 demanding that practicing homeopaths prove something to someone except their patients is simply unrealistic
1923184 no cam therapy has a scientifically plausible biochemical mechanism of action over and above those proposed for the placebo effect of course just because there is no rational explanation for why something should benefit a medical condition or reduce a medical symptom doesnt mean that this something cant do so unfortunately the results from high quality randomized placebo controlled trials and systematic reviews have demonstrated that cam therapies dont do so which regretfully leads me to conclude that cam therapies are nothing more than cleverly packaged placebos and that is almost all there is to say about the science of cam
1923185 homeopaths appear not to want to engage in the critical appraisal of their work that is not just interesting but morally imperative for the huge role of healer you take on
1923186 hey this is a subtle healing art it takes time
1923187 what outcomes or experiments can you imagine that would change your mind that homeopathy was effective
1923188 it is also possible that the methodology employed to investigate these concepts is inadequate the essence of homeopathy lies in its individualized treatment and it could be that this quantitative approach is not the most appropriate tool further methodological concerns include i the sensitivity of the proving definition the verum subject experienced severe belladonna type symptoms that resulted in a sae but was not classified as a prover as she experienced two false symptoms the criteria only allowing one false symptom ii young healthy subjects were recruited as they would be good responders but their consumption of alcohol and possible undisclosed recreational drug intake may minimize any homeopathic response lifestyle factors may colour the outcome e g belladonna related symptoms of headache and sinking and rising sensation in his head were reported following high alcohol intake the previous evening
1923189 history shows that when homeopathy and orthodox medicine are available on an equal basis homeopathy is preferred
1923190 hey this is a subtle healing art it takes time
1923191 no cam therapy has a scientifically plausible biochemical mechanism of action over and above those proposed for the placebo effect
1923192 of course just because there is no rational explanation for why something should benefit a medical condition or reduce a medical symptom doesnt mean that this something cant do so unfortunately the results from high quality randomized placebo controlled trials and systematic reviews have demonstrated that cam therapies dont do so which regretfully leads me to conclude that cam therapies are nothing more than cleverly packaged placebos and that is almost all there is to say about the science of cam
1923193 can spare the time away from emptying the wallets of your customer
1923194 the first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool so you have to be very careful about that
1923195 little evidence that homeopaths take any care in not fooling themselves
1923196 my observations show that people often project their internal state onto others
1923197 im writing a lot because i was upset that someone writes so nastily about something they clearly dont understand or even try to
1923198 the only legitimate conclusion one can draw from this is that the person in question has a vested interest which completely distorts their ability to reason scientifically or even logically
1923199 you continually show yourself unable to explain anything about medicine
1923200 he refuses to say what sort of cheese the moon is made of
1923201 now i can see where some of andys methods of arguing come from what we have here is the familiar tactic 1 assert a piece of nonsense 2 claim that there is no reason why it should not be true 3 point out that there is no evidence for it by reference only to rcts and their follow ups 4 state a conclusion as if it were a proven fact which is only valid if you accept the absurd premise and the particular method of testing it the only legitimate conclusion one can draw from this is that the person in question has a vested interest which completely distorts their ability to reason scientifically or even logically
1923202 homeopaths are quite fond of saying just because you cannot explain something does not mean it does not exist
1923203 but the enthusiasm for homeopathy is growing because it works and it works profoundly
1923204 among the commonest things that remedies do is to aggravate or ameliorate
1923205 so you could not get beyond the 21st sentence in the chapter and try to see what he meant by this statement
1923206 it is taken for granted after a prescription has been made and it is an accurate prescription that it has acted of course if a prescription is not related to the case if it is a prescription that effects no changes it does not take long to see what to do much patient waiting for a foolish prescription is but loss of time and that should be taken into account among the observations
1923207 trust me i am trained and senstive you will have to take my word for it that i am right
1923208 the art of medicine consists of amusing the patient while nature cures the disease
1923209 what possible outcome of releasing something from your hand while standing at sea level could not be explained by the theory of gravity
1923210 in order for symptom to be regarded as a symptom and not just a part of a normal day to day fluctuation of symptoms in a stable picture it should be really strong
1923211 if you have a bit of a sore throat most likely youll need your
1923212 reproducible experiment every time you see say a nux vomica patient give him nux vomica and hell recover this is a reproducible event i already did it a number of times
1923213 the fact is that it is impossible to devise a test that would show that kent was right
1923214 and its not the case of something that gets better by itself but when something persists without any sign of getting better by itself which causes the person to come in the first place good homeopaths do not usually treat minor acutes thats a good way to spot a reliable homeopath too
1923215 what i actually wanted to say is that i for example or im sure other proponents of homeopathy at least those who write here have already done themselves and most likely with their friends all the tests that m simpson and andy and others propose have seen the results and stick with homeopathy
1923216 i for example have already done all the tests that m simpson and andy and others propose
1923217 burns and scalds it is not necessary to treat minor symptoms but this is also possible of course and in a case of a housewife like me who is spending half of the day in the kitchen a minor burn like this is extremely annoying and hurts a lot every time it is getting wet which is all the time
1923218 i think youll find that with most minor kitchen burns brief touch of hot kettle that sort of thing the pain disappears in a minute or two anyway
1923219 science is the father of knowledge but opinion breeds ignorance
1923220 in the case of your daughter you gave her a range of standard treatments then one homeopathic treatment and because she started recovering after the homeopathic treatment you deduced that this treatment was effective and all the others werent but that is not necessarily so
1923221 of course i dont ever think that everything i see with my eyes is the sole and only truth
1923222 i for example have already done all the tests that m simpson and andy and others propose
1923223 this ointment lotion actually contains material quantities of the substances which is why it should not be applied when the skin is broken
1923224 probably the best and simplest test you can do in the home
1923225 if you ate a three course meal and subsequently developed food poisoning would you assume that the cause must have been the dessert because that was the last thing you consumed
1923226 to m simpson when substances are used in material quantities they act according to the
1923227 i think you should have noticed by now that debating anything over the internet is just bound to cause a wide range of discrepancies as to what the person writes and what they mean
1923228 you display no desire and patience to try to understand what i mean
1923229 reproducible experiment every time you see say a nux vomica patient give him nux vomica and hell recover this is a reproducible event i already did it a number of times
1923230 nothing is wrong in principle with the test you suggested but i really see no way how you could conduct it in reality
1923231 it is possible that the homeopaths belief that the patient was a nux vom patient might influence subconsciously how they interpret the case
1923232 potentisation is intrinsic to homeopathy so showing that something which is not potentised works does not validate homeopathy even if you want to call that thing homeopathic
1923233 it seems they have invented their own homeopathy maybe they should open a new school of
1923234 a nux vomica patient is going to improve from taking the nux vomica remedy
1923235 but if the response is not good then the remedy needs to be changed
1923236 mrs hubbard had to change the box and reshuffle the vials rather often so that the patient could not take the remedy too often and overdose herself
1923237 my test would only cost as much as a few vials of pills
1923238 and just how much to add to have it published anywhere where people like you would read it
1923239 openmind ebm is a belief system which does not survive the rigour of scientific scrutiny i prefer to go with the science of homeopathy rather then the questionable speculations as to the mechanisms of action of individual drugs
1923240 but if the response is not good then the remedy needs to be changed
1923241 thats why gsac said that every time its a test
1923242 every time you see say a nux vomica patient give him nux vomica and hell recover this is a reproducible event i already did it a number of times
1923243 accept that what you have been told may be wrong
1923244 a nux vomica patient is a generic term to identify a patient who needs nux vomica at a particular moment in time when the same person gets sick next time were speaking about acutes here he might need a different remedy
1923245 every time you see say a nux vomica patient give him nux vomica and hell recover this is a reproducible event i already did it a number of times
1923246 a homeopath can only be sure of his diagnosis after the patient recovers and then conveniently ignores all the wrong diagnoses made previously precisely how does this differ from guesswork
1923247 without a significantly increased rate of death or heart attack
1923248 every time you see say a nux vomica patient give him nux vomica and hell recover this is a reproducible event i already did it a number of times
1923249 theres two opinions on whether a ship needs a crew i say it doesnt and all the other captains say it does
1923250 could be prescribed by an orthodox practitioner for symptoms the substance can cause
1923251 i was clearly wrong but i am not going to admit it
1923252 which could be prescribed by an orthodox practitioner for symptoms the substance can cause
1923253 any variation indicates the presence of at least one significant factor influencing the result
1923254 it is valid as part of testing a single factor if only single factor is actually being tested
1923255 if an unknown interaction is being tested the information obtained is virtually useless
1923256 if change is produced in some cases but not in others or if the change is variable in extent then there must by some factor influencing the process in addition to the action being tested
1923257 we could find statistically different differences between the villages leaks without knowing anything about why the leeks might be growing differently the possible reasons behind such a phenomena are almost limitless
1923258 if an unknown interaction is being tested the information obtained is virtually useless
1923259 how will you define improvement up to you how would you define it how do homeopaths define improvement that is what we should measure
1923260 we do not agree to your definitions in the first place
1923261 you error is continious gsac you believe rcts are about discovered causes they are not they are there to see if there is an effect at all without an effect there is no need to consider causes
1923262 you keep saying this but refuse to say why what is the difference between an allopathic pill and a homeopathic pill
1923263 just because science says homeopathy cannot work then they believe it does not work
1923264 we could follow patients over six months and see how many days off work they took
1923265 of the 105 trials with interpretable results 81 trials indicated positive results
1923266 the amount of positive evidence even among the best studies came as a surprise to us based on this evidence we would readily accept that homeopathy can be efficacious if only the mechanism of action were more plausible the evidence presented in this review would probably be sufficient for establishing homeopathy as a regular treatment for certain indications
1923267 based on this evidence we would readily accept that homeopathy can be efficacious if only the mechanism of action were more plausible
1923268 people who use homeopathy take 3 something times less days off from work that those who use conventional treatments
1923269 well the trials havent shown anything decisive but even if they did there is still that implausible method of action so we cannot accept the results of any such trial anyway
1923270 what experiment fairly conducted designed to show a result one way or another would suggest to you that homeopathy did not work
1923271 they do not give science a chance to do what
1923272 what experiment fairly conducted designed to show a result one way or another would suggest to you that homeopathy did not work
1923273 if one believes only their perception they would necessarily fall into the trap that illusionist is setting here and beleive that such thing is possible
1923274 their sensitivity to patient improvement their ideas about what health might be
1923275 how do you know they wouldnt have got better without your treatment
1923276 consistency and replicability are key and the anecdotal evidence base of homeopathy demonstrates this
1923277 this is a total inversion of moral responsibility i am making no claims that need to be tested i a merely saying that homeopathy is totally implausible given the thoroughly tested science of atomic physics and chemistry
1923278 what theoretical framework have you for making any assessment of cause and effect in medicine
1923279 how do you know the car would not have moved without you starting the engine
1923280 if i do a then x will occur and if i do b then y will occur
1923281 the following experiment will show that after repeating the action a x generally occurs and after repeating b then y usually occurs
1923282 it is also possible that the methodology employed to investigate these concepts is inadequate
1923283 if ultramolecular dilutions have clinical effects an increased proving response should be observed in the belladonna 30c group as suggested by the pilot 28 no group differences in proving rates were identified and this was additionally borne out using alternative definitions of proving which confirms that there is no support for any clinical effect of ultramolecular homeopathy within this model the baseline data showed that the two treatment groups were balanced we identified total proving rates of 14 similar to those found in traditional proving studies e g 33 34 which suggests that the pq appears to be sensitive enough to detect proving and we confirmed that the data were completed reliably
1923284 this is how i practice my art i recognise that provings are flawed methodologically and have been shown not to work
1923285 a small percentage from from both the belladonna and the placebo will experience the expected symptoms but there will be no significant differences between the groups
1923286 garbled nonsense actually its not it makes perfect sense in its own terms but you have to be willing to open your mind to alternative ways of describing
1923287 in seeing if belladonna works you have to subtract that background noise this is what the above trial does and the answer is zero belladonna 30c adds nothing to the background level of symptoms experienced basic stuff it does not work
1923288 initial amelioration followed by aggravation to the state worse than the initial
1923289 how do you ensure that your actors do not have any intention to heal too
1923290 why is the intention of giving the right remedy so important
1923291 what if the intention was there but the pill was swapped for a dummy
1923292 would the healing still work if not then we dont need actors if it does work then we dont need homeopathic pills which is it
1923293 i do know what a proving is for but all i can see is a methodlogy for self confimraiton of previous expectations
1923294 i think it is fascinating that when asking a homeopath to describe a test that would convince them that homeopathy might be wrong they come up with a fatally flawed test and when they try to justify it they have to postulate extra mechanisms in homeopathy that justifies the extra contortions in the test
1923295 what is also fascinating that after postulating that intention is a key factor that no test is put forward to suggest that this might be real
1923296 all in all it shows a complete lack of basic curiosity about basic beliefs
1923297 why should we just not walk away and conclude that homeopathy is an inert treatment
1923298 any stimulus to the person which is capable of producing a reaction can be either curative or suppressive that is improving the persons level of health or depleting it
1923299 i have repeatedly seen that it works it has an effect and the effect is curative if the remedy is administered according to some well defined principles
1923300 ostheopathy is a fraud osteopaths should prove that what they do really works
1923301 we disagree on the interpretation of your experiences how do we decide who is right we have to remove the selectiveness of your experiences
1923302 ez would you be happy for osteopaths to claim to cure aids or prevent malaria then to set up clinics in africa or crystal healers to arrive in burma offering to help the injured the problem people have with homeopathy is that homeopaths make these claims without a shred of evidence to back up any of their claims
1923303 d for double the doctor shouldnt know whether a patient is in the treatment or control group either or else he or she can deliberately or subconciously influence the patient
1923304 i have to admit that those ostheopaths that i have seen were close to what id call deluded
1923305 but when you blind people and the practitioner cannot know how to influence the test subconsciously
1923306 the healer practitioner should find something that the receiver is able to receive
1923307 that is why this subject interests me how do people with so little grasp of reality and so unaware of it feel able to take on such huge responsibility
1923308 allow s anything to go rather than reserving judgement based on lack of knowledge
1923309 simply believe s what he feel s is right and then maybe selectively look s for evidence no matter how weak or misunderstood to support that belief
1923310 to reserve holding beliefs or at least hold hem provisionally until sufficient quality evidence can support those beliefs
1923311 as i have said before all andys efforts are oriented to defending his stupid and ignorant beliefs not towards increasing his knowledge or anyone elses
1923312 we all have a lot to learn and the stupidity of denying 200 years of peoples experience rather than investigating it using appropriate tools is beyond belief
1923313 furthermore the existence of acupuncture points has been demonstrated by biophysicists as has their relation to organs the existence of pathways corresponding to meridians and distinct from the pathways of the nervous circulatory and lymph systems and measurable changes at acupuncture points in response to potentised remedies
1923314 i have been informed though i want to check the original research myself that physicists have also demonstrated that random events can be affected by intention particularly the unified intention of more than one person
1923315 dont talk nonsense this is so easily shown to be untrue as to be utterly laughable
1923316 by the end of the nineteenth century the only drug known by europeans to be effective was quinine for malaria
1923317 by the end of the nineteenth century the only drug known by europeans to be effective was quinine for malaria
1923318 science and the practice of medicine in the nineteenth century
1923319 so easily shown to be untrue as to be utterly laughable
1923320 so what is the science of medicine what are its basic theoretical principles there are none
1923321 what is the problem here the problem is that you prefer to remain ignorant of the facts because you are happy with your beliefs
1923322 the biochemic model is based on a perspective which was going out of date 200 years ago
1923323 medically you consider side effects to be such a drawback of conventional medicine that we should turn to homeopathy i say that it is not enough that homeopathy causes no side effects to be a medicine it must also actually cure disease the evidence suggests it does not do so indeed we expect homeopathy to cause no side effects because it does nothing at all i also think your philosophical position is wrong
1923324 a physician should first and foremost act in the best interests of the patient and not do things that are likely to have a net effect of harm
1923325 said that if it does not stabilise within a day or two theyll have to resort to surgery
1923326 any one who can show under proper observing condi tions evidence of any para normal supernatural or oc cult power or event
1923327 excuse me but i have not offered a single insult
1923328 andy has been shown to be ignorant stupid and a liar
1923329 there must be some reason why the situation is like this unless we are going to postulate that millions and millions of people working in state healthcare private healthcare universities government insurance charities and publishing are all part of some vast conspiracy designed to boost the prophets of big pharma companies we must surely draw the only other conclusion which is that homeopathy doesnt work and caters only to cranks and dupes
1923330 although i dont expect any answers on this thread of course
1923331 why are people going to all that expense and trouble when homeopathy is there it works its safe its cheap
1923332 if there was a cholera epidemic and one particular treatment was getting results more than twice as good as other treatments why wasnt that treatment used everywhere
1923333 that existence of such results will make us look inadequate and we dont like that
1923334 im in the middle of my studies right now which last at least 4 years
1923335 thats why it was not immediately taken up on the spot of course
1923336 the answer that they gave is basically my interpretation of course
1923337 the existence of such results suggests that the results have not been collected properly or that there is some underlying bias here
1923338 in austria after consideration of the results of applying homeopathy during that epidemic the ban on using homeopathy was lifted
1923339 there are still too many people who prefer to look adequate rather than to save other peoples lives and improve their other peoples quality of life
1923340 millions and millions of people working in state healthcare private healthcare universities government insurance charities and publishing are all part of some vast conspiracy designed to boost the prophets of big pharma companies
1923341 people who prefer to look adequate rather than to save other peoples lives and improve their other peoples quality of life
1923342 maybe they tend to stop buying expensive insurances in the first place and they have more confidence in their health and cannot be scared into buying fancy contracts easily at that i dont think any long term growth of an insurance company can be expected in this setting if you see what i mean
1923343 considering based on clinical experience which you disregard but it does not cease to exist because of that of course that with homeopathy people get healthier with time
1923344 why would that affect the insurance companys actions im not asking about how people who currently use homeopathy relate to health insurance im asking why insurance companies whose sole aim is to maximise their profits by paying out as little as possible dont insist that all their customers use homeopathy
1923345 we know its cheaper to manufacture and deliver than most regular medicines very important we know its safer fewer side effects means less additional cost so again that makes it cheaper we are accepting hypothetically that it is more effective better value cheaper and that it has been proven to work without a doubt
1923346 dont you think you should try one before making such a judgement
1923347 if someone who has never eaten an apple tells you that apples are disgusting do you say
1923348 dont you think you should try one before making such a judgement
1923349 it should be trivial to make me look a fool
1923350 ive never taken cyanide but im prepared to believe people when they tell me its poisonous even if they havent tried it themselves
1923351 dont you think you should try one before making such a judgement
1923352 it should be trivial to make me look a fool
1923353 hey guys not withstanding my admonition on page 1 not to seek underlying causes for disease some diseases are in fact caused by dietary defects make sure you patient is getting a good diet before you start mucking about with miasmas and similliums
1923354 i know you are you said you are but what am i
1923355 the rate of an elementary reaction is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the participating molecules
1923356 hey guys not withstanding my admonition on page 1 not to seek underlying causes for disease some diseases are in fact caused by dietary defects make sure you patient is getting a good diet before you start mucking about with miasmas and similliums
1923357 all the advances in science are a result of trying to explain the inexplicable
1923358 m simpson no they cant all be explained by known psychological and statistical concepts like placebo and regression to the mean and so on because these themselves lack adequate explanation and justification
1923359 no they cant all be explained by known psychological and statistical concepts like placebo and regression to the mean and so on because these themselves lack adequate explanation and justification
1923360 not at all i never said anything about reality but surely does not take much thought to realise that it is impossible to explain something by reference to something which itself cannot be explained
1923361 im afraid not the comparison is false on the one hand you are using an unexplained and variable process to explain another process on the other hand you have a very specific dietary deficiency which is directly causative of a state of ill health and no explanation of process is required of course understanding the process involved in the latter relationship is useful but it is not necessary in the former case it is of fundamental importance
1923362 it is also possible that the methodology employed to investigate these concepts is inadequate
1923363 in the 19th century the relationship between fruit and scurvy was an unexplained and variable process just like the placebo effect is now
1923364 it is impossible to explain something by reference to something which itself cannot be explained
1923365 plenty of sailors didnt get scurvy despite no fruit in their diet
1923366 it is also possible that the methodology employed to investigate these concepts is inadequate
1923367 this is an interesting pair of points the effects are subjective but measurable could we have an explanation of how subjective effects are measured i understood that an effect is called subjective because it is not susceptible to measurement as opposed to objective when it is
1923368 subjective adj 1 based on or influenced by personal feelings tastes or opinions 2 dependent on the mind for existence 3 grammar relating to or denoting a case of nouns and pronouns used for the subject of a sentence
1923369 the height of adults is subjective people are different heights
1923370 well theres your problem right there you dont know what subjective means it means something which varies from individual to individual
1923371 it is impossible to explain something by reference to something which itself cannot be explained
1923372 scurvy is a typical instance of a disease resulting from pure dietetic causes and requiring pure dietetic treatment it is generally sufficient to place the sufferer on a full hospital diet comprising as it does fresh meat and vegetables with milk and nothing more is required for the case
1923373 that the lack of potassium salt in the system brings about such conditions
1923374 i took the case for treatment and prescribed no medicine according to dr
1923375 scurvy is a typical instance of a disease resulting from pure dietetic causes and requiring pure dietetic treatment it is generally sufficient to place the sufferer on a full hospital diet comprising as it does fresh meat and vegetables with milk and nothing more is required for the case
1923376 m simpson in short you beleive that the information presented in the case is inaccurate
1923377 we almost forget that they boy was cured in the end if we follow your trail of thought
1923378 does it not make you sad when you see the world around you in such colours
1923379 by the way kali potassium is something which abounds in fresh fruit not only vitamin c so i would not be altogether dismissive of the
1923380 the condition arrived after 2 months of treatment by a skilled allopath
1923381 so our doctor was not the only one who misdiagnosed the condition if indeed this was the case do you not wish to blame that other doctor who tried to treat the boy for 2 months to no avail
1923382 under care of dr chaterjee he was from 23 january prescribed the kali on february 26 and much better on march 2 the dynamics is clearly different did the deceptive father wait for 3 months including the period of treatment of the other doctor to start giving the boy fresh fruit do we really have to be so distrustful in our lives
1923383 so we have a doctor working 80 years ago in a caste ridden colonial city who doesnt fully understand what vitamins are interrogating an uneducated peasant and his son about their diet a lot of assumptions and prejudice in that sentence
1923384 it is impossible to explain something by reference to something which itself cannot be explained
1923385 to be honest all scientists sound the same to me
1923386 are you big enough to admit when you are conclusively shown to be wrong
1923387 i see the misunderstanding here in the scurvy example blah blah blah waffle waffle lots of irrelevant stuff about placebo effects which were not part of my question waffle waffle blah blah blah since it is at a significantly shallower level of explanation than homeopathy
1923388 the same is true in homeopathy with very vigorous disagreements at the frontiers
1923389 m simpson if you cant be bothered to read i wont bother to write replies to your questions
1923390 an objective measurement of the rate or extent of something subjective
1923391 claim that answers are obvious but then dont say what they are
1923392 to great lengths answering questions that you havent been asked
1923393 quite simply you dont know enough for there to common ground for simple answers and you dont understand enough to grasp detailed answers
1923394 you are trying to teach people the rights and wrongs of homeopathy without even the basic knowledge that could allow you to do that
1923395 can i suggest that you stop blogging and start reading books about orthodox medicine books about homeopathy books about history and so on you will be much better for the knowledge both in yourself and as a debater
1923396 homeopathic pills have exactly the effect that one would expect them to have if they were a heavily marketed inert placebo there is nothing inexplicable
1923397 when it comes to botany or mechanics or optics much can be picked up by the way if you have an interest in the subjects but in the case of homeopathy the information does not permeate our society instead it is ideas opposed to homeopathy which can be picked up all the time so to learn about homeopathy you have to question things you are hardly aware of learning and which you have no context for
1923398 it is not at all unknown for patients to have problems or even get worse after a remedy part of following up these cases just as for cases where there is improvement involves understanding what is happening and what factors may be the cause causes due to the remedy include it not being the right potency or not being the right remedy either being very similar to the right one or being suppressive
1923399 as regards your specific reference to cancer this would take hours to answer properly you need to understand a great deal about how homeopathy works before you can realise that the question as phrased is meaningless
1923400 the situation is very simple ez treated a girl for eczema but not for bulimia two years later the bulimia had largely cleared up ez claims credit for this john rs question is a good one if ez wants to claim credit for positive changes to unrelated aspects of the girls health does ez also claim credit for negative changes doesnt take hours to answer takes one word yes or no
1923401 id bet that in all the talk of side effect free treatments you wouldnt find this warning on any homeopathic promotional literature or professional society press releases would you condemn people making such claims for being irresponsible or is this another case of homeopaths holding contradictory beliefs with no qualms whatsoever
1923402 it was not my prescription i had to ask an overseas doctor and md homeopath by the way to do that on the basis of a questionnaire that she had to complete and i talked to her about any additional information i could find to help with the prescription
1923403 this is the point that stands in the way of all controlled trials as i see it
1923404 i do not try to take any credit for any cures and i think one should not the people do it all by themselves but they might need a stimulus to get them going at times
1923405 they feel of course that the challenge of taking the remedy is a bit
1923406 well thats their choice they have their right but what im unhappy about is that they think that their choice is the only valid one and forgetting that all people are different they try to deny options of making different choices to other people by putting up that campaign against homeopathy thats my opinion of course
1923407 yielded much better results 95 of them are cured and fit for discharge under a fortnight while in the old days it was the exception to discharge any case within the specified two weeks
1923408 as regards your specific reference to cancer this would take hours to answer properly you need to understand a great deal about how homeopathy works before you can realise that the question as phrased is meaningless
1923409 if during the course of their treatment for a set of symptoms one of your patients developed cancer would you tell them that this was due to the remedy causing them to express their susceptibility would you tell them that had they not taken the remedy they would not have developed cancer at this time if this did occur how would it be different to a pharmaceutical company hiding side effect data for one of their products
1923410 the principal distinction between anorexia and bulimia is that the former involves eating very little while the latter involves eating a lot then inducing vomitting what you described is bulimia if you dont know the difference then perhaps you shouldnt get involved
1923411 anorexia nervosa a psychological illness most common in female adolescents in which the patients starve themselves or use other techniques such as vomiting or taking laxatives to induce weight loss
1923412 girl n 1 a female child 2 a young or relatively young woman
1923413 however most people are sensible and would say it was clinical evidence of the greater effectiveness of homeopathy in the acute treatment of injuries
1923414 presumably this most people doesnt include all the other army doctors who ignored this evidence and continued to prescribe conventional drugs or indeed the vast majority of medically trained professionals who have worked on this planet during the past sixty years
1923415 which army doctor are we talking about in the first place
1923416 the uk included homeopathy in the nhs after the war that should tell you something about how convincing its benefits were
1923417 of course i should have modified the quote the definition of sensible people certainly doesnt include anyone who does not know what the phrase clinical evidence means like yourself
1923418 and when did i say she was an army doctor you really should not jump to conclusions if you are going to claim accuracy in your judgment
1923419 you should also consider the economic and historical dimension and this dramatically alters the significance of homeopathys inclusion in the nhs
1923420 surely you can distinguish between the numbers recovering the degree of recovery and the rate of recovery
1923421 could you provide evidence for this for example the proportion of homeopathic hospitals to orthodox medical hospitals or the proportion of gps who also practised some degree of homeopathy etc
1923422 evidence derived from clinical practice as opposed to laboratory or controlled trials
1923423 why do i persist in debating with people who do not know what they are talking about
1923424 because i am not prepared to let their lies and stupidity go unchallenged when they are aimed at the best medical system ever devised homeopathy
1923425 because i am not prepared to let their lies and stupidity go unchallenged when they are aimed at the best medical system ever devised homeopathy
1923426 i did not provide a non sequitur but specific examples of the fallacy in your argument namely that context can make all the difference and that the best option is not always the dominant one
1923427 the bodys ability to repair itself and the miracle power of the brain
1923428 when drugs are not needed and the patient still thinks that medicine would help we believe that the placebo effect can work
1923429 this placebo disempowers parents it is telling them that unless you give your children this pill theres nothing else
1923430 the problems are numerous firstly whom are we treating here children or their parents
1923431 this is designed to have the texture and taste of actual medicine so it will trick kids into thinking that theyre taking something
1923432 then their brain takes over and they say oh i feel better
1923433 each and every time you give a placebo you see a dramatic response among some people and no response in others
1923434 the idea that we can use a placebo as a general treatment method
1923435 i cant think of a single instance where id want to give a placebo
1923436 for this to work really well as placebo you cannot let the parents know that its a sugar pill
1923437 you have to lie to the parents too if you expect them to fool their kids
1923438 kids could grow up thinking that the only way to get better is by taking a pill
1923439 they used to sell candied cigarettes to kids to get them used to the idea of playing with cigarettes
1923440 anybody who has ever been up in the middle of the night with a crying child would be tempted to try something like this
1923441 youre so desperate for anything that could quiet down your poor miserable kid
1923442 the overprescription of drugs is a serious problem and i think there needs to be an alternative
1923443 i dont like the idea of parents lying to their kids
1923444 i dont have a problem with the thoughtful use of placebo the starting premise and your own belief about what youre doing matters a lot
1923445 does a sick child really want x rays or m r i s or the latest antibiotic
1923446 each and every time you give a placebo you see a dramatic response among some people and no response in others
1923447 each and every time you give a placebo you see a dramatic response amongst some people and no response in others
1923448 he added that if parents used placebos to comfort their children they were teaching them that tablets are the answer for all lifes aches and pains
1923449 kids could grow up thinking that the only way to get better is by taking a pill
1923450 homeopathic pills are used for mood swings feelings of isolation etc
1923451 jennifer buettner whose company efficacy is marketing the placebo says it can stimulate
1923452 jennifer buettner was taking care of her young niece when the idea struck her the child had a nagging case of hypochondria and ms buettners mother in law a nurse instructed her to give the girl a motrin tablet
1923453 she told me it was the most benign thing i could give
1923454 i thought why give her any drug why not give her a placebo
1923455 it was one of those aha moments when everything just clicks
1923456 this is designed to have the texture and taste of actual medicine so it will trick kids into thinking that theyre taking something
1923457 then their brain takes over and they say oh i feel better
1923458 your nightmare must be that this stuff takes hold and obecalp does replace homeopathy as the 21stc preferred placebo
1923459 how wonderful would it have been if they came across homeopathy to reverse his nervous damage
1923460 what kind of science is based on unexplained miracles and unpredictable miracles at that i presume givescieneachance you would include homeopathy in that group or do you have those explanations at hand because to date you having posted them
1923461 homeopaths like engineers recognise reality understand the principles underlying its complexities within their field and use these to determine what interventions will be effective and successful
1923462 however we found insufficient evidence from these studies that homeopathy is clearly efficacious for any single clinical condition further research on homeopathy is warranted provided it is rigorous and systematic
1923463 taking a correspondence course on shaking and dilution vital forces and dream provings
1923464 would you ez would you have no qualms about visiting the most malarial parts of africa with no protection except a homeopathic prophylaxis
1923465 the highest aim of healing is the speedy and permanent restitution of health or gentle alleviation and obliteration of disease in its entire extent in the shortest most reliable and safest manner according to clearly intelligible reasons
1923466 you homeopaths believe you are medically trained even if it is just by a correspondance course i find that staggering
1923467 to answer specifically about malaria is not possible because you have to thoroughly understand the principles of homeopathy if you are to understand the answer
1923468 the nosode malaria co a compilation of plasmodiums of malarial species p falciparum p vivax p ovale and p malariae is a prescription remedy that can be used alternately with the above mentioned remedies these remedies in a 30c can be alternated weekly prior to visiting an endemic area start with a single dose of nat mur 30c the following week take a single dose of china 30c followed the next week with a dose of phosphorus 30c and finally a single dose arsenicum 30c repeating the cycle after four weeks depending on ones constitution one or another of these remedies will have greater affinity and therefore be more effective for that person continue weekly prophylaxis with the remedy that has the best effect if you stay for an extended time in a high risk area these remedies can be administered in a 200c less frequently
1923469 thoroughly understand the principles of homeopathy if you are to understand the answer
1923470 so it would be folly to rely upon homeopathy unless i include a competent homeopath in my hand luggage
1923471 hindered promotion of homeopathy to the extent when anyone could have access to a competent homeopath
1923472 self centered and delusional is the kindest label i can offer the pair of you
1923473 thoroughly understand the principles of homeopathy if you are to understand the answer
1923474 as for your quotation of an american homeopath i would require a source i could refer to before accepting it
1923475 two german engineers i know of relying on homeopathy lasted three week working for a large corporation sulo waste disposal they where airlifted out easily said but i have no reason to believe it is true even if it were true the information is so incomplete as to be totally useless as an argument
1923476 i turned to homeopathy after my daughters middle ear infection got cured in 2 days
1923477 i know that dr peter fisher of the university college homeopathic hospital states that homeopathy is not suitable for prevention or treatment of malaria you obviously disagree
1923478 they would undoubtedly collect symptoms are try to match them to a remedy
1923479 as regards kate nash if we assume that her alleged suggestion for malaria prophylaxis were as stated
1923480 illnesses resulting from dietary deficiencies have nothing to do with the biochemic mode
1923481 rigorously tested firmly established internally and externally consistent scientific processes
1923482 instead they simply parade unsupported beliefs and arguments most of which were already exploded 200 years ago
1923483 the faculty of homeopathy the professional body for doctors and other statutorily regulated healthcare professionals who integrate homeopathy into their practice does not promote the use of homeopathy for the prevention of malaria
1923484 malaria is a serious and life threatening disease and there is no published evidence to support the use of homeopathy in the prevention of malaria
1923485 if you can do no good at least do no harm
1923486 malaria is a serious and life threatening disease and there is no published evidence to support the use of homeopathy in the prevention of malaria
1923487 within the scientific framework of homeopathy the issue is a lot more interesting and his statement is not true
1923488 so have you read hahnemanns views if so then you will be able to answer your questions
1923489 a homeopathic prophylaxis will not make you ill let alone seriously ill the worst it can do is nothing
1923490 malaria is a serious and life threatening disease and there is no published evidence to support the use of homeopathy in the prevention of malaria
1923491 a homeopathic prophylaxis will not make you ill let alone seriously ill the worst it can do is nothing
1923492 you then go on to justify this by talking about homeopathic treatment and allege that it will not work your opinion only
1923493 the prescribing of homeopathic remedies to prevent malaria is another reprehensible example of potentially lethal duplicity
1923494 has treated several travellers who caught malaria after taking homeopathic preparations
1923495 evidence based medicine is the conscientious explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients the practice of evidence based medicine means integrating individual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research
1923496 the overall contribution of curative and adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy to 5 year survival in adults was estimated to be 2 3 in australia and 2 1 in the usa
1923497 it is clear that cytotoxic chemotherapy only makes a minor contribution to cancer survival to justify the continued funding and availability of drugs used in cytotoxic chemotherapy a rigorous evaluation of the cost effectiveness and impact on quality of life is urgently required
1923498 the 46 of treatments which are not proven to be effective is 46 of all treatments for 240 common conditions and very few are used in the nhs the great majority are treatments used by alternative practitioners
1923499 the vast majority of drugs more than 90 per cent only work in 30 or 50 per cent of the people
1923500 of around 2500 treatments covered 13 are rated as beneficial 23 likely to be beneficial 8 as trade off between benefits and harms 6 unlikely to be beneficial 4 likely to be ineffective or harmful and 46 the largest proportion of unknown effectiveness
1923501 evidence based medicine is the integration of best research evidence with clinical expertise and patient values
1923502 the figures suggest that the research community has a large task ahead and that most decisions about treatments still rest on the individual judgements of clinicians and patients
1923503 we have no knowledge of the effect of this treatment because it has not been tested in an rct
1923504 we have tested this treatment in several rcts but on balance there is currently no convincing evidence that it is effective for this condition
1923505 we have no knowledge of the effect of this treatment because it has not been tested in an rct
1923506 we have tested this treatment in several rcts but on balance there is currently no convincing evidence that it is effective for this condition
1923507 i really dont see what garrow is trying to make such a mystery and song and dance about here so his astonishment seems rather incomprehensible
1923508 bewaiwai nobody is suggesting that conventional medicine has reached perfection can cure all ills and is free from side effects hence the ongoing research to provide newer more effective and safer drugs
1923509 agreed which is precisely why so much effort has gone into designing and running trials of homeopathy
1923510 such equivocal evidence would tend to indicate that not all variables are being adequately accounted or controlled for
1923511 its also the case that homeopathic trials are a rather heterogeneous collection of homeopathic methodologies and trial objectives so meta analyses of the entire data set are more than usually prone to the apples and oranges argument
1923512 many trials are performed to satisfy licensing requirements for homeopathic products in other countries
1923513 after all even conventional trails struggle to obtain funding unless theyre being financed by the pharmaceutical industry and the pharmaceutical industry wont fund a trial unless they can smell a profit at the end of it
1923514 its also the case that homeopathic trials are a rather heterogeneous collection of homeopathic methodologies and trial objectives so meta analyses of the entire data set are more than usually prone to the apples and oranges argument
1923515 it didnt work and i dont know why or what will
1923516 many trials are performed to satisfy licensing requirements for homeopathic products in other countries
1923517 well there you have it beautifully stated medical trials are closer to engineering oh boy a whole sock drawer full thank you for that one this to my mind is exactly why biomedicine is failing what did you see when you last looked in the mirror humber a machine or a human being these techniques are perfect for machines and non living inanimate systems applying them to living systems doesnt work and is little short of disastrous in the long term thats principally why the world has come to be in the parlous state its in living systems are non linear and have qualities of uniqueness unpredictability interdependence the mechanistic model is grossly inadequate in this context
1923518 well of course thats the nature of human beings and the nature of medical science trial evidence for any intervention is rarely so incontrovertible that everyone agrees with the conclusions and methodology rarely so robust that nobody can pick holes in it its invariably a matter of perspective and opinion
1923519 as for failures every practitioner has their failures and i dont know anyone shy of admitting that you wont find them published in journals because theres nothing constructive to be learned from them
1923520 because there are just as many valid reasons for believing the maddox randi circus to be no less biased or potentially fraudulent
1923521 then youve clearly been highly selective in your reading there is no blanket rejection of scientific principles in homeopathy just scientific dogma some practitioners may not be scientists by training or inclination but thats hardly a prerequisite for practicing healing modalities
1923522 and since when was professing to material atheism a prerequisite for considering yourself part of the body of
1923523 what an extraordinary statement and exactly what has spirituality or lack of it to do with the price of fish the primary and over riding purpose of medicine is to cure people of their illness didnt that even occur to you and yes i do take a very firm moral stance where that aim appears secondary to turning in a profit for the stockholders peoples lives and their quality of life is not a commodity to be bought or sold slavery has supposedly been abolished
1923524 the usa is not the largest market for homeopathic preparations either in value or volume most of the trials conducted to satisfy licensing requirements are for the german market
1923525 when i use the word disease it means just what i choose it to mean neither more nor less
1923526 put plainly every disease entity is an intellectual construction that is peculiar to some form of medicine and every form of medicine is nothing but a historical variable in any human community
1923527 truth does not change because it is or is not believed by a majority of the people
1923528 a recent post on a homeopathic site made the claim that only intentional living organisms are capable of healing
1923529 people drive recklessly take drugs and drink too much can homeopathy help here
1923530 even if there are some difficulties seems like shes talking about a slice of paradise on the earth
1923531 for who has understood the mind of the lord so as to instruct him
1923532 these are my words that i spoke to you while i was still with you that everything written about me in the law of moses and the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled
1923533 beware of false prophets who come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves
1923534 not everyone who says to me lord lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but the one who does the will of my father who is in heaven
1923535 do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal for where your treasure is there your heart will be also
1923536 the people who bought the homes say well we love looking into your yard and seeing the horses and the cattle but we dont like the flies and we dont like the mosquitoes and when i cut my field to bale it they say we dont like the dust in the air

1923730 essa cpmf um absurdo j passou da hora de acabar com ela
1923731 est errado o governo n o deveria ter feito projetos na certeza da recria o do imposto a cpmf tem o car ter provis rio e est marcada para terminar no dia 31 de dezembro
1923732 seria r 40 bilh es a menos para o governo gastar e estando todo o projeto or ament rio programado em cima desse dinheiro traria um desequil brio muito grande nas a es de governo podendo assim haver uma crise e ent o chegar a afetar a economia do pa s
1923733 hoje o imposto do cheque cobrado a uma al quota de 0 38 porque n o reduzir essa al quota para 0 28 em 2008 por exemplo para acabar com este imposto sem maiores danos para os projetos sociais do pa s seria necess ria uma redu o gradual das al quotas dessa forma o governo poderia adequar progressivamente o seu or amento

1923749 in return for this money the parties through the host committees offer access to top politicians to the president the future president vice president cabinet officials senators congressmen they promise these companies who are giving that they will be able to not only get close to these people by hosting receptions by access to vip areas but theyll actually have meetings with them
1923750 lavish conventions with million dollar podiums fancy skyboxes and broadway production teams are not necessary to the democratic process
1923751 congress should pass a law that says no more soft money for these conventions no corporate treasury union treasury no unlimited individual money instead the discard this host committee fiction can go out there and ask people to help the convention but with the same limits where theyre asking people to help them normally

1923803 we targeted those individuals who were criminal offenders and would continue to be so we got them out of the neighborhoods and into jail where they need to be
1923804 when we make nearly 300 arrests in two months and get these individuals into the legal process for their crimes it is going to make the city safer
1923805 safe city basically targets violent crime geographically across the city and we have put departmental resources to focus on those individuals who are at the heart of violent crime
1923806 anytime you combine law enforcement efforts you get a multiplying factor that citizens benefit from
1923807 we just like to take a very proactive stance in law enforcement
1923808 people are outside there is more activity and more special events going on across the city

1923828 theyre very concerned that their kids do very well and excel at a lot of things as a result
1923829 i think theres got to be a line you know
1923830 i think parents make much more of an effort to be with their kids
1923831 it seems to me that weve gotten away from everybody being an authoritarian not that we dont have authority over our kids but theres more honesty you spend more time actually talking to your kids about real things

1923839 there is apparently no court order authorizing destruction of the property or any record of what happened to the property

1923841 by the way we invited the owner and director of the company igor vladimirovich zyusin to todays meeting but he suddenly got sick meanwhile it is known that in the first quarter this year the company exported raw materials abroad at half the domestic and world price and what about the margin tax for the government

1923847 islam depends on community which places it in opposition to extreme individualism which threatens to fail in the west in addition the devout muslim is required to share his wealth with others the leftist also wants to see the strong help the weak
1923848 the progressive movement around the world and the muslims have the same enemies
1923849 the government practically permitted the left to operate since five years ago so that they would confront religious liberals
1923850 takes its language goals and aspirations as much from the crassest forms of marxism as it does from religion its leaders are as influenced by lenin sartre stalin and fanon as they are by the prophet
1923851 they should unite with the working class to destroy the capitalist system
1923852 a godsend to both sides the left a once dwindling band of communists trotskyites maoists and castroists had been clinging to the dregs of a clapped out cause the islamists could deliver numbers and passion but they needed a vehicle to give them purchase on the political terrain a tactical alliance became an operational imperative
1923853 the practical benefits of working together are enough to compensate for the differences

1923855 frankly we do not think that the current american administration is capable of making peace
1923856 w hat if iran continues its cat and mouse negotiating mixed with intransigence israels future in this regard is indeed bleak for even if a moderate republican realist like john mccain or even worse a liberal left internationalist like barrack obama is elected president each is likely to subsume israel to larger geopolitical considerations rather than hold it up as an icon to be both supported and worshipped in the post 9 11 era as george w bush has done
1923857 the local palestinians want peace with israel and therefore we have to create a new state for them
1923858 in the camps we emphasize the need to unite and put an end to the internal struggles

1923867 why doesnt the prosecutor open a case into anti semitic publications or the vandalising of memorials
1923868 our encyclopedia is virtually silent on the holocaust and theres hardly a word on it in our textbooks
1923869 if anyone says that anti semitism thrives in belarus or that we oppress the muslim population here dont believe it

1923877 that is 60 000 people on full payroll just guarding us from the effects of oslo
1923878 that money is enough to give every arab family in judea and samaria and gaza 250 000 to help them relocate elsewhere

1923892 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
1923893 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
1923894 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
1923895 we have already started the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2007 and the national association of realtors only now uses words like dampen when describing nonexistent real estate sales that is a curious use of phraseology
1923896 theres been an unusual hit to home sales starting in march when subprime problems emerged and more recently when problems spread to jumbo loans with many potential buyers on the sidelines
1923897 this is not rocket science folks if a group of people do not pay back their mortgage loans then banks wont have enough funds to finance jumbo loans
1923898 however the jumbo loan market is now beginning to settle and fha insured loans are helping to fill the subprime vacuum the volume of existing home sales this year will be better than 2002 which was the second year of the housing boom
1923899 i dont mind going back in time to find a year better than the one were currently having but to go back five years tells you how bad the current market is
1923900 estimates are just that no one is going to lose their job for a bad set of guesses to my mind anyone who wants to forecast into the year 2008 about homes bought and sold is playing fast and loose with the numbers if their crystal ball is so accurate they wouldnt be forecasting real estate news
1923901 a sharp production pullback by homebuilders deep into 2008 is a healthy trend that will help trim down housing inventory
1923902 when realtors use terms like healthy trend to describe homebuilders losing their shirt on new home construction something has to be wrong with the vocabulary set
1923903 the mortgage markets will calm further in the months ahead but its important to underscore the fact that conventional loans the vast majority of available financing are available to creditworthy borrowers
1923904 patient buyers in most areas who do their homework will recognize that housing remains a good long term investment
1923905 this is the interesting part as it pertains to owner financing and that there is very few creditworthy borrowers in todays market as i visit with various realtors they indicate that the good buyers are staying home because theyre afraid to be caught in a valuation crunch simply said they dont want to buy a home that is overvalued to lure good buyers in the market you the owner of the home will have to produce incentives such as owner financing
1923906 any discussion of what is going to happen in the fiscal year 2008 is off limits nobody can time the market and no one can see the future anyone who says otherwise has a bridge they want you to buy in arizona
1923907 we expect the fed to cut rates two times before the end of the year which will lower interest rates for prime borrowers and fha insured loans
1923908 fha modernization could buffer the fallout of subprime loans which would raise our sales forecast in the future
1923909 saying that you expect that the federal reserve board will cut interest rates is analogous to saying we expect the impossible from our government last time i checked there was no discussion as to whether ben bernanke was going to cut rates or not
1923910 if you want to know what the annual rate of inflation is is a better source not the consumer price index the consumer price index may be a useful measure first some kinds of things but is not useful for measuring inflation or wage appreciation
1923911 by all means go ahead and visit with walter molony about some of the hard data appearing in his article ask him if he trusts his puff piece enough to put his job on the line if the pie in the sky guess estimates are incorrect i know a lot of homeowners that need to sell their home and cannot trust these figures real estate is too important to leave to the realtors
1923912 sending the jpeg to boone requires getting out the ibook and cabling it to the phone she does this on automatic pilot apparently remembering how to do it correctly because her message to chu b sends immediately
1923913 at a central bankers symposium in jackson hole wyoming federal reserve chairman ben bernanke made clear that he was following what analysts have described as a
1923914 bush urged lenders to work with homeowners to renegotiate their mortgages to prevent default he called on congress to approve legislation he proposed last year to modernize the federal housing administration which provides mortgage insurance to borrowers through a network of private sector lenders
1923915 this means that many families who are struggling now will be able to refinance their loans meet their monthly payments and keep their homes
1923916 the mortgage bankers association said its seasonally adjusted index of mortgage application activity fell 5 5 to 641 1 in the week ended august 17 applications however may have climbed earlier in august as a major lender hurt by turmoil in mortgage bond and other financial markets closed its doors forcing borrowers to reapply elsewhere said jay brinkmann a vice president of research at the mba the drop in applications we see here may be an indication that those borrowers have now been taken care of he said

1923924 most of the other bills are still in planning stages like numerous measures to regulate and penalize mortgage lenders who engage in predatory lending schumer acknowledged however that it wont help anyone already suffering with a bad mortgage
1923925 this wont do anything about what happened in the past but it will prevent the present crisis from getting worse because mortgage brokers are still preying on these people
1923926 i welcome the administrations recognition that a greater public response is required and i look forward to working with them because i agree with a number of specific things that they propose the financial services committee has already advanced legislation including a gse bill that awaits senate consideration and we hope to send the fha bill over soon we also are working with the ways and means committee to address the tax issues involved however there are some points of difference that we will need to work out going forward with regard to the fha going forward i dont think that working people and lower income people who are making payments to the federal government should be charged more than others second i agree that the rules that regulators have developed for banks have been good ones but i believe that federal action is necessary to apply them to all originators and the time for further study is over third there should be some rules to provide some quality assurance to investors in the secondary market at his speech in jackson hole federal reserve chairman bernanke noted the need for modification of the securitization process to provide greater investor protection and increased incentives for responsible lending i believe that well drafted legislation is essential to achieving this next i continue to believe that the portfolios of fannie mae and freddie mac can play a bigger role than they are currently are playing particularly in helping the refinancing of subprime mortgages that are about to experience significant interest rate increases i believe that the administrations objections to this are not based on safety and soundness grounds but represent their one remaining ideological refusal to recognize the need for a greater institutional role in this regard finally there needs to be a federal role in the construction of new affordable housing and preservation of existing affordable housing
1923927 how was your relationship with your dad growing up as a kid

1923980 an early draft of the regulations found its way into public circulation before it had reached my review it contained words that lead some to conclude my intent is to deal with the subject of contraceptives somehow defining them as abortion not true
1923981 the bush administration has consistently supported the unborn however the issue i asked to be addressed in this regulation is not abortion or contraceptives but the legal right medical practitioners have to practice according to their conscience and patients should be able to choose a doctor who has beliefs like his or hers
1923982 legal right medical practitioners have to practice according to their conscience
1923983 several months ago i became aware that certain medical specialty certification groups were adopting requirements which potentially violate a physicians right to choose whether he or she performs abortion i wrote to the organizations in question protesting their actions frankly i found their response to be dodgy and unsatisfying i sent another letter more of the same
1923984 patients should be able to choose a doctor who has beliefs like his or hers

1924004 such systems would greatly expand the use of current optical technologies in areas like human and livestock health environmental monitoring and food quality

1924101 sungguhkah keadaan aceh rawan pada saat ini daud beureueh menandaskan desas desus tentang ketidakpuasan yang pecah di aceh itu dihembuskan oleh kaum feodal yang kehilangan kekuasaan selama revolusi
1924102 selain itu adalah ngawur pikiran bahwa daud beureueh mau menerima posisi rendahan di bawah kartosuwirjo darul islam sulit pula dibayangkan para tokoh kuat pusa menyingkir ke pegunungan untuk melancarkan kampanye gerilya gelap melawan pemerintah posisi runding mereka dalam berhadapan langsung dengan pemerintah pusat sekarang ini cukup kuat untuk menegaskan keinginan keinginan secara damai namun tentu saja tidak ada kepastian bahwa pimpinan pusa berpikir demikian
1924103 saya menyatakan kedamaian dan ketenangan di aceh agaknya lebih bersifat tak nyaman ketimbang memperlihatkan kegelisahan terbuka saya memperoleh kesan umum dari kunjungan singkat ini bahwa daud beureueh dan tokoh tokoh pusa memegang kontrol kuat atas pengikut mereka ketenteraman di aceh mungkin sekadar menunjukkan bahwa umat islam aceh mentaati perintah para pemimpin mereka dan menunggu semacam perkembangan lebih lanjut seandainya benar demikian alternatif alternatif di aceh agaknya adalah perdamaian yang terus berlanjut atau jihad suci menegakkan negara islam besar besaran dan terkoordinasi di masa datang yang cukup jauh

1924149 never doubt that a small group of committed people can change the world
1924150 who will tell whether one happy moment of love or the joy of breathing or walking on a bright morning and smelling the fresh air is not worth all the suffering and effort which life implies
1924151 a lie can travel half way around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes
1924152 what does love look like it has the hands to help others it has the feet to hasten to the poor and needy it has eyes to see misery and want it has the ears to hear the sighs and sorrows of men that is what love looks like

1924159 but drawing laughs is not the focus of this upcoming film
1924160 to change a creationists mind it would require divine intervention
1924161 reiss said science teachers must treat pupils who have creationist beliefs with respect
1924162 what i am saying is teach evolution as a really good part of science but be open to the fact that in most classes there are increasingly likely to be some children who come from families that cannot accept that and dont denigrate those pupils and their beliefs the days have long gone when science teachers could ignore creationism when teaching about origins
1924163 peter thanks for your email it is greatly appreciated i shall not take the bait on the movie i greatly regret the difficulty that dembski has created john
1924164 any difficulties you may be experiencing over your suppression of id related research at baylor are of your own creation my role in this has merely been to shed some light
1924165 as a former student of peter irons i have to say that i am surprised that he is involved in these antics
1924166 hi denyse as you and i both know the level of civility among blog commenters on both sides of the evo id controversy sometimes descends into personal ad hominem attacks however it should never and im sure you agree with me sink into the cesspool of racial or religious bigotry
1924167 sticking their butts in the air while praying to mecca
1924168 peter not well expressed but the message is clear he thinks you only defend
1924169 with all due respect i think your bigotry meter is set too low for those on your side although its set very high for the occasional expression of anti christian sentiment which i deplore on pro evo blogs
1924170 militant ahtiest sic who cares nothing about science or reason
1924171 suppression for anyone who does not adhere to a strict materialist line or function as a fellow traveler
1924172 peter you are trying to destroy the career of bob marks because he has good reason to believe that darwinian evolution as presented to the public and to students is not true that is likely your only real interest in baylor you can say whatever you wish wherever you wish you will find the hearers you deserve cheers denyse
1924173 hi denyse since you havent yet to my knowledge posted any of our e mail exchanges on the baylor matter heres the deal you have my permission to post mine provided that you include all of them in their original unredacted form along with any commentary you wish to add that way i wont become a victim of your sides penchant for selective quote mining id be glad to have a wider audience fair enough frankly i doubt youd want to wash uds dirty underwear in public but ill keep my eyes peeled cheers peter
1924174 then of course you will be happy for me to make this whole correspondence public so that people can judge for themselves how happy you would be to see bob markss science arguments against darwinism publicized to the world should i choose to publicize this correspondence right
1924175 hi denyse this past sunday regarding our e mail exchanges over the baylor mattere you suggested that i would
1924176 sir do whatever you wish and do not feel any need to consult me about it d
1924177 i am delighted to be back west ham is a club with lots of potential and hopefully we will be able to unlock it this year the squad is good enough and if we put in the effort w will succeed
1924178 the heart of the issue is that we cannot drive a wedge between faith and reason i believe wholeheartedly that there cannot be any contradiction between the two
1924179 faith seeks to purify reason so that we might be able to see more clearly not less faith supplements the scientific method by providing an understanding of values meaning and purpose
1924180 if belief in evolution means simply assenting to microevolution small changes over time within a species i am happy to say as i have in the past that i believe it to be true if on the other hand it means assenting to an exclusively materialistic deterministic vision of the world that holds no place for a guiding intelligence then i reject it
1924181 there is no one single theory of evolution as proponents of punctuated equilibrium and classical darwinism continue to feud today
1924182 biologists will have their debates about mans origins but people of faith can also bring a great deal to the table
1924183 while no stone should be left unturned in seeking to discover the nature of mans origins we can say with conviction that we know with certainty at least part of the outcome man was not an accident and reflects an image and likeness unique in the created order those aspects of evolutionary theory compatible with this truth are a welcome addition to human knowledge aspects of these theories that undermine this truth however should be firmly rejected as an atheistic theology posing as science

1924308 well no shit sherlock im taking 5 classes this semester im not looking for a full time job hi clues
1924309 its a great question mozzie back in july 2003 i was 42 years old happily married running a successful business and living in a lovely house in parsons green west london my life appeared to be settled most things were certain and if i projected forward in my mind i could see how the rest of my life was going to look and was relatively happy about it except at a deep deep level something was not right physically i was in poor shape and i was starting to question the meaning about what i was doing i felt like i had lost access to my spiritual intelligence so could not make sense of what was going on and at times it felt like i was living someone elses life not that there was anything wrong with it
1924310 i was the person with everything to be happy about great wife successful business a reasonably affluent lifestyle and wonderful friends and family i had no idea that what was about to unfold within the next year would change everything in my world
1924311 in the summer of 2003 i decided to go on my first ever in portugal for ten days it was a wonderful experience and gave me a chance to reflect on things staying at that remote idyllic and peaceful farm house close to nature seemed to feed a deeper part of me that had not received much nourishment for quite a while so having gone there i was ready to return to my life with a new sense of optimisim and remember thinking the time was right to start a family
1924312 at the same time my dad was very ill and had undergone a second major heart operation just before i left so my family were feeling quite unsettled and we were all experiencing a lot of anxiety about him he was struggling to recover after his surgery and had been unconscious for a couple of weeks i was actually summoned back to england prematurely and rushed to the hospital where he was being treated when charlotte rays ex wife came to meet me at the airport i had a strange sensation that something about her had changed while i was away but could not put my finger on it and needed to get to the hospital to join my family as soon as possible
1924313 this was a difficult time mozzie like the rest of my family i was very uncomfortable about my dads health and facing the potential of losing him now i was about to discover that my marriage was also in trouble when i look back on it now i cannot believe how calm i was about it
1924314 just before i went away charlotte had met someone whom she had a compelling attraction towards and this had developed while i was in portugal ironically he worked for one of our clients they had met when she had been summoned to their head office to be told our consultancy contract was being terminated had i gone to that meeting instead of her which had been a distinct possibility at one point this reality may not have materialised it never ceases to amaze me how life can totally pivot around such tiny moments of chance
1924315 i could see that charlie was torn in two by this and i really felt her pain about it
1924316 if you truly love someone let them go and if they return it is meant to be
1924317 charlotte and i had built a really successful business in five years and we were really proud of it not only had we achieved our vision of enabling our clients to outperform their rivals we had trademarked a set of principles known as heart and soul management and were gaining recognition for it we recruited a great team of people to work with and created financial prosperity for ourselves looking back in hindsight it felt to both of us as if our reason for coming together was complete and that we both needed to pursue our own paths from this point onwards which were very different
1924318 it was devastating at the time my father was still very ill in hospital which was stressful in itself charlie moved out of the house but we were still working together every day at the office which was totally surreal on one level we decided to let everyone in the company know what was going on between us which really helped and they were very sensitive to our situation luckily nic meredith who is a really good friend of mine was in london and he really looked after me at at time when i most needed it
1924319 it was very serendipitous that a few months earlier i had signed up to take part in a major fund raising event called
1924320 it had appealed to me for ages i had a growing sense that i wanted to give something back to society and raise money for a good cause plus i was re discovering my love of motor cycling having recently purchased a bike after 25 years absence if you do enduro india you are required to complete a gruelling 2 000 kilometre journey over seven days across southern india on an old fashioned royal enfield bullet motorcycle which are really old british motor cycles that are still made in india
1924321 buying the bike was a really good decision for me and it felt like i found a little piece of myself that had been lost for quite a while
1924322 if i had not bought the bike i dont think i would have signed up for enduro india something which turned out to have a significance far greater than i could have ever imagined
1924323 there were many reasons as it turned out but the first was that it gave me something purposeful to be distracted by during my period of separation with charlie as i had committed to raising a huge amount of sponsorship money for the event basically i was on the phone every day between october and december 2003 talking to my friends clients and associates to recruit them as sponsors and persuaded as many of them as i could to back me in taking on this amazing challenge
1924324 my team in the office were brilliant they responded to my call for help and we set a target to raise 10 000 which was 1 000 more than the highest ever amount raised previously by a participant
1924325 by the time 2003 came to an end i felt emotionally exhausted and really needed a break
1924326 before this horrible situation started charlie and i had made plans to go to the usa for a christmas holiday so i already had something booked i asked my friend nic who had been looking after me so kindly if he would like to be my travelling companion in place of charlie and he accepted
1924327 i am so glad he was able to go with me i really needed support at that time he was very sensitive to my situation at home and helped me get through a very difficult phase
1924328 i am sure nic will not mind me saying that at this point his own life had not been going so well for him either and he had returned to the uk after several years of living in the usa and canada where he had created businesses that were involved in film and tv production
1924329 some problems with one of his companys and difficulties with his visa made him decide to go back to england for a while from what he had told me in the time he had been back i could tell he was at a bit of a loose end and had been for some time in a strange way this really helped me it was as if he was much farther down the road of an inner journey that i was about to start in a few months time with my divorce looming so i was observing him with great interest to see what i could learn
1924330 one day during our trip we were driving towards the grand canyon when we both looked at each other at the same moment and spontaneously said
1924331 a few months before in london we had been watching a feature about sedona on the holiday programme on bbc television and to our amazement one of our ex colleagues from 15 years ago was now living and working there as an artist they interviewed him on the programme and we recognized his voice immediately although he looked a bit different than before so we suddenly had a mission for going there we decided to see if we could find him with no knowledge of his whereabouts
1924332 bizarrely from our arrival in sedona to locating him took us no longer than one hour
1924333 we had not seen each other for 15 years he was really surprised when we showed up and very pleased to see us
1924334 let me see if i can get to the point for you mozzie
1924335 by this time i was starting to get a growing sense that our lives are sometimes guided by a series of random events which we do not or cannot understand the significance of with our conscious mind proof of this phenomenon was about to emerge and it was about to happen to my friend nic but neither of us had any inkling at all about it the gift in this moment for me was that i was going to witness the unfolding events first hand
1924336 ok once we had met paul he started introducing us to members of the community in sedona who were friends of his so we were dining at peoples homes and getting involved with them as opposed to being tourists and observing the whole place as outsiders one morning paul introduced me and nic to a friend of his called regina campbell a lovely atractive woman who made an instant connection with my friend nic it was as if they were meant to find each other to cut a long story short nic and regina are now married and are living happily together in the usa which proves my point
1924337 if i had not been separated from charlie then nic would not have come with me on the trip to the us and if we had not been watching the holiday programme we would not have gone looking for paul and if we had not have found him nic would not have met regina from observing this chain of events despite my fears about the future i was also starting to experience a feeling of comfort at some level about what was happening to me in my life it didnt really make sense in my head but instinctively i knew that everything that was materialising was meant to be and that it would work out ok if i just went with the flow of things
1924338 this felt like some sort of turning point however a set back was waiting just around the corner immediately upon my return to the uk on 5th january my father died it was the beginning of 2004 and it was to be the start of my most dreadful year
1924339 it was an amazing challenge and it took my mind off everything else that was happening being part of it really lifted my spirits at a time when my life as i knew it was falling apart and although i did not realise it at the time going to india was also opening my eyes to the possibility of more travelling
1924340 with the help of my team and friends i managed to raise 13 750 which as far as i know is still the largest amount raised by an individual to this day
1924341 i knew that things were going to change dramatically in my life when i got home from india and started to mentally prepare myself for what was about to come
1924342 when i began the divorce proceeding after my father passed away i discovered that it was only going to take 12 weeks for us to become legally divorced including the approval of our agreements around our financial separation i could not believe how quickly it was all going to be undone charlie knew that i was willing to consult her regularly throughout this period so that if she wanted to re consider she had the option and i was open to talking about it with her however the twelve weeks was soon up and on 26th april 2004 i was granted a decree absolute from the wandsworth courthouse meaning we were no longer married
1924343 like everything else we had done we even went and collected the certificate together which was quite surreal charlie had also resigned as a director and shareholder of our business at the end of march which meant i had some serious thinking to do about the future but the sense of loss was overwhelming and for a while i didnt really know which way to turn
1924344 she is a very special woman who contributed an enormous amount to me during our marriage and this was the truth whether we remained together or not
1924345 with my dad my marriage and the company we had built all disappearing i felt very insecure and bewildered so i needed something in my life to remain constant for a while hence i decided to continue living in the house
1924346 the problem with that decision was the cost it was very expensive to service the mortgage and live in the area and i was now doing it alone and without the same level of income from our business with no full time staff remaining it effectively meant that i was tied into doing the kind of consultancy work which paid well but that i did not particularly enjoy as you can imagine this was an unsustainable situation but i decided to run with it temporarily hoping some natural intelligence would come through about what i should do about it
1924347 my friend nic was now living there with his new found partner regina and making plans to create a permanent life with her in sedona i was stuck in a rut and it was frustrating me i wanted to tap into some creativity in my own thinking so decided on a change of tack for a while
1924348 there was not much work and i really did not have the energy to find more so i searched on the internet to see if i could locate a guitar teacher in sedona which luckily i was able to do nic and regina agreed to let me stay with them for a month whilst i was learning which gave me the chance to hang out with them while i was practising it was perfect
1924349 i learnt a few basics from bob but have not really put in the necessary practice since then so i have not progressed very far it is still on my list of things to learn
1924350 as you can imagine my motivation to continue with my business without any of my former colleagues around had dropped to a dangerously low level yet i did not want to fully acknowledge this to myself and soldiered on
1924351 i started to network intensively and the next unconnected dot in the picture materialised
1924352 you know mozzie it is another example of tiny chance events that conspire to take you in a new direction but you do not realise this until some time afterwards
1924353 you remember i was telling you earlier about enduro india and the huge fundraising effort that i was making for it at the beginning of the year well it prompted me to get in touch with virtually everyone i had ever worked with who i thought would support me and ask them for help one person i tried to contact to ellicit sponsorship from was my former colleague elisabeth gluck who was living in india with her husband james also an ex colleague
1924354 i called her on her mobile and when she answered her phone and told me she was in london i was really taken aback as i had expected her to be thousands of miles away unfortunately the reason she was in london was that her father had recently died and the family were in mourning i felt a strong sense of empathy for elisabeth under the circumstances and offerred to attend her mothers home to mourn with the family as a mark of respect
1924355 that evening at the glucks home i was introduced to a friend of hers called
1924356 had she decided not to come we would never have met it did not seem important at the time but it really turned out to be significant
1924357 well mozzie laura is an artist and a couple of weeks later she just happened to be exhibiting some of her work up the road from where i was living at the college of art in hortensia road she seemed like a very friendly person when we met so i went to see her work as a gesture of support
1924358 we stayed in touch and after i returned from my trip to sedona with my finger tips bare from practising guitar i called her and happened to mention i was looking for work
1924359 he is in a similar line of work to you and may be a useful contact for you
1924360 i was definitely feeling sorry for myself when richards invitation came in but had this sense that some kind of invisible hand was guiding me and i knew i should go to this meeting
1924361 it was at this event that i first met nikki ashley and although i did not realise it at the time it was going to dramatically change my life
1924362 although it was richard that introduced me to nikki she also knew laura left
1924363 had i not bumped into elisabeth gluck during my fundraising for enduro india several months earlier i would never have met any of them anyone who has seen the film will recognise how our fate can sometimes rest on the smallest of decisions or the briefest moments of hesitancy
1924364 which is one of the things that i find truly amazing and exciting about being a human being
1924365 well mozzie the story probably does not go how you might think remember at this point in time i had only been divorced seven months and was struggling to come to terms with working and keeping my life together so i was definitely not feeling at my most attractive when i was introduced to nikki we only spoke for a couple of minutes and i knew there was something special about her i really hoped i would see her again at some point i just didnt know when or how
1924366 it was as if all of the crap that could happen to one person was over in one big depressing hit my dad passed away i got divorced dismantled a really successful business struggled all year to get myslef interested in work and on top of that had very painful throat surgery in the week before christmas and i did all of this whilst feeling like crap most of the time
1924367 on the other hand i was glad it had all come in one big relatively short burst rather than a prolonged period of misery and decline over a number of years up until then nothing really terrible had ever really happened to me so it was probably the right time for me to experience these things and garner the lessons life was giving me as a result i felt determined to make 2005 a better more creative year even though i really had no idea about what to do going forward
1924368 i discovered that nikki was an actress this is one of her professional photographs she was attending these meetings because she was working with training companies that serve the corporate marketplace to perform in role plays a training technique in which professional actors simulate a real scenario as a learning experience for trainees
1924369 i liked her a lot although i had been on a few dates with people since i got divorced she was the first woman i had met who i felt strongly attracted to
1924370 when i met nikki that evening in march she looked really fabulous and i was really pleased to see her trying to make a good impression i asked her if she had just been on holiday
1924371 yes i have actually i spent a few fabulous weeks in thailand and i loved it there so much i have decided to go and live there i just need to get my flat rented out and i am off
1924372 having waited four months for the chance to ask her out i felt immediately deflated
1924373 you have to remember mozzie that according to the way i was defining myself at this time i was still a london based businessman looking for ways of keeping my career and lifestyle going it really never occurred to me that i could let go of my existing life and try something completely different like travelling or living in asia no that realisation came later and i will tell you how it happened
1924374 as far as i was concerned if we managed to spend a few nice evenings together before she left the country it would be great i never expected more than that to happen and i certainly did not think we would ever see each other again after she had left meanwhile a very dear friend of mine called elizabeth taylor had developed breast cancer and i was very concerned about her
1924375 she lives with husband matthew and son pete in sydney australia and i wanted to offer my support as i believed that nikki was soon to be leaving for thailand i arranged to spend a month in australia from the middle of april so that i could spend time with elizabeth and her family and visit one or two other friends in the region my work had started to pick up a little by then so i could not be away for too long or so i thought
1924376 elizabeth and her husband matt are two of my dearest friends we used to share a house together in england before they emigrated to australia
1924377 like anyone who knows her i was deeply concerned for her and the family and very happy to visit at this particular time it certainly made my own issues seem trivial by comparison
1924378 i am delighted to let readers know that she eventually made a full recovery and has now been clear for quite a while
1924379 she was very brave and matter of fact about her illness and i was particularly impressed with the way she talked to her young son about it helping him to understand it in a simple way without it frightening him i learnt a lot from witnessing that interaction
1924380 we had re established contact towards the end of 2004 and often spoke on the phone
1924381 she had been helping me deal with the aftermath of my divorce and was helping me with a book i was thinking of writing or more specifically the proposal for the book which you are required to submit to agents and publishers to assess their interest i would send her a copy of what i had written and she would give me feedback to help me improve it and at the same time i would talk to her about what i was experiencing following the divorce and the demise of my business her support was extremely encouraging and the conversations we had always helped me
1924382 julie lived in cairns in northern queensland so i arranged to go and visit her for a few days after leaving sydney
1924383 meeting her turned out to be a major turning point in my life
1924384 me travel you have got to be joking i am not going to waste my life bumming around the world im a professional businessman and have more important things to do
1924385 now i realise that i have much to thank her for
1924386 one of the great things about meeting julie was that she was really living her life in what i would describe as an unconventional way
1924387 which enabled me to see that i also had other options to the one or two i was perceiving she was probably the first person i had met whose decisions seemed strongly governed by her energy and intuition as opposed to her rationale and logic and her life was really working well as a result
1924388 at the age of 40 she had let go of her successful career in the corporate world to pursue her interest in and thirst for self knowledge travelling solo around asia for nearly four years before returning to australia she had even created the chance to have a one to one meeting with the dalai lama himself while she was in india i was really intrigued by her travel stories and our conversations helped me remember things about myself that i had long since forgotten
1924389 of course mozzie one that springs to mind is how i had forgotten about my simple unsophisticated view of life when i was a child and some of the dreams i had growing up when i was about five or six years old i used to love pretending to be a travel agent my parents would give me their out of date holiday brochures and i collected used tickets from trains buses and aeroplanes so that when visitors came to our house i could set up my agency on the coffee table and try and get them to book a holiday another memory that came back was related to my father he always had a wanderlust and loved to travel and i think this somehow rubbed off on me
1924390 i think my mum and dad certainly made up for lost time after my brother and i left home and travelled extensively in their later years
1924391 when i was at school i remember seeing how hard my parents worked to raise our family run our home and make ends meet the same was true for the families most of my friends came from it struck me that the model society was conforming to at that time was that men worked until they were 65 which as far as i could see was most of their lives they then had a few short years in which to do everything else they had ever dreamed of if they were in good health and if they could afford it these were two really big ifs and in my observation many people never really got to live out their dreams so died unfulfllled
1924392 as a naive schoolboy it just seemed ridiculous to me that anyone would want to work for most of their lives
1924393 why dont people create all the money they need for their whole life from working twice as hard in the first half of their life leaving them to retire at 40 with the money and the health to do all the things they want to do before they die thats what i am going to do ill work until i am about 40 become a millionaire and then stop working so i can enjoy life
1924394 suddenly these new possibilities seemed very exciting and my energy levels were rising fast
1924395 being in australia and the many conversations with julie parker helped me remember some of the dreams i had and some of the promises i made to myself in my early teens which i had long since forgotten
1924396 ill tell you mozzie in cairns i was beginning to see the possibility of a different kind of life at least i was getting small glimpses for a while but i still lacked the courage to make the major changes required without some evidence or certainty that things would work out ok for me if i did i realised that such certainty would probably come afterwards but that felt too risky it was a conundrum a classic chicken and egg situation looking back i guess i was hoping for some sort of catalytic event something out of the blue that would really shake up my reality and enable me to take those big decisions and it was about to come in the most unlikely of forms
1924397 two or three nights before i was due to return to england julie and i were looking for something to do for her mums birthday
1924398 forthcoming auditions for out of order and saw that it was a british play about a member of parliament who has a secret affair with a typist from the opposition discovers a dead body and calls in his bumbling private secretary to clean up the mess a kind of carry on style farce
1924399 well mozzie as i was reading about the audition something compelled me to turn to my two australian friends and flippantly say
1924400 and i will tell you why first of all i am not an actor and there will be many real actors wanting to be in the play second i live nearly 10 000 miles away so could not possibly turn up for the rehearsal schedule over the next two and a half months and third i have to be back in london in three days to work with clients there is no way this is going to happen
1924401 why dont you go to the audition anyway just for the experience dont try and get a part in the play just go and enjoy yourself you will be here while they are happening and you only live once right
1924402 why not i thought to myself julie is right i am sure i will enjoy it
1924403 we were all asked to read different parts of the script and try on different characters
1924404 although i had never done anything like this before i am a big fan of film and television and have spoken publicly at many business conferences so i was feeling quite comfortable about it besides knowing i was never going to be selected meant there was no pressure on me so i threw myself in at the deep end and gave it my best shot
1924405 what is your situation if we were to ask you to be in the play would you be able to meet the rehearsal schedule
1924406 even though wayne had asked me to stay and was asking me these probing questions i was still convinced that i was never going to be offerred a part so i just kept up the pretence that i was living in cairns for the forseeable future
1924407 i left the theatre after that conversation with a growing sense that an invitation was probably going to come although wayne rees made it clear that he was not going to be making any decisions about who they wanted until after i was back in england
1924408 just say to him that i am living here and have had to dash back to the uk for two days to deal with a family crisis and i am coming straight back oh and ask him which part they have got in mind for me
1924409 it probably sounds a bit arrogant for me to say something like that given my lack of experience but the cost of going back was going to be considerable so i decided that i needed to land one of the two leading character roles or i would have to say no and these were complex characters so there was no way i thought this would happen
1924410 it did not take very long within a few hours julie called me and told me that wayne wanted me to play george pigden the central character of the whole story i simply could not believe it this character had over 400 lines of dialogue in the script was like a cross between kenneth williams and frank spencer and was on stage for over an hour in each performance plus he had to kiss two women on stage every night it was all a bit unreal but also one of the most unexpected exciting opportunities that had ever landed in my lap
1924411 he thought you were great and he really wants you to come back and do this
1924412 first i thought i would talk to my sister in law to get her advice and run it past nikki ashley who to my pleasant surprise was still in the uk as they are both experienced actors i wanted to ask if this was something i could take on and do well even though i totally lacked the professional training that they had both received
1924413 kitty and nikki were both very encouraging nikki even offerred to show me some techniques that would help me learn my lines as i wanted to see her once more before she left to start her new life in thailand i gratefully accepted her invitation and arranged to go and have supper with her the following evening i then called wayne rees to double checked that the message he left with julie was true
1924414 have you gone stark raving mad was my question to him
1924415 i mean you will have hundreds of paying customers coming to see the show every night and they will be expecting a really professional performance i am a high risk choice for you totally unproven i could be completely rubbish
1924416 we thought you were great at the audition and with our support we think you can do a marvellous job as george so come on over the part is yours
1924417 after calling each one of them i immediately purchased a return ticket to go back to australia a couple of days later to begin rehearsals which left me just enough time for one more evening with nikki
1924418 i had really expected her to have left because she had been so enthusiastic about going back there perhaps this was another example of fate lending a hand
1924419 whatever it was i was really pleased to see her again and ask for her help with the play but i also had another reason i wanted to see her which was much more personal
1924420 when we sat down i asked nikki if i could tell her about something that had been on my mind while i had been away and she gave me the thumbs up
1924421 well nikki for most of the month i was in australia you were in my thoughts i know you are going off to thailand and i am about to leave for australia for three months but it does not stop me thinking about the possibility of us two having a proper relationship of some kind
1924422 i dont know how this can work nikki with you in one country and me in another but in my heart i feel like you are someone i would like to have a relationship with and wondered if you if you would like that too
1924423 ray i appreciate your candour and its very sweet of you to ask but i am not really interested in starting anything new right now i want to go to thailand with no complications and start creating my life there so thanks but no thanks
1924424 i must admit mozzie i was quite disappointed to hear this but told her that i completely understood where she was coming from and respected her choice i wished her well in her new life and i left to go home and start packing i honestly thought that would be the last time we would see each other
1924425 she invited me to stay there with her which was just perfect as it meant i could rehearse my lines in total comfort
1924426 she played the part of the ministers wife and my job was to distract her from finding out that her husband was having an affair with a typist when she drops in for a surprise visit to the hotel it was great fun and surprisingly difficult to choreograph all of the moves that led up to our passionate snog
1924427 it was a big moment in the play and had to be done as if it were the first time i had ever seen a dead body every time
1924428 oh yes mozzie it was brilliant we were sold out for most of the shows and my friends matthew and elizabeth taylor flew up from sydney to see me perform which really meant a lot to me as the main character in the story i had the honour of coming on stage last for the curtain call at the end of every performance to a very appreciative applauding crowd i can really see why some people love performing it is a bit addictive
1924429 but one of the best things for me was seeing the reviews in the newspapers if i saw anything that sounded positive about my work like the article below it made me feel great for days
1924430 as far as acting is concerned one can never say never again and be absolutely sure they mean it but i do feel that this was a one off for me the biggest thing i took from that experience was the knowledge that i truly can do anything i choose that i dont need to mentally confine myself to only those things that are known where there are little or no risks where there is certainty but also mediocrity in terms of the experience it made me realise how wonderful it feels to live much more spontaneously pursuing opportunities that are exciting and challenging now i became more aware of the fears and concerns i have that cause me to worry about my future security but discovered that i do not need to let myself be dictated to by them the idea of being controlled by those kinds of negative thoughts and the restrictive decisions they would most likely result in felt much more unpalatable to me after that experience
1924431 when i was working in the theatre it had felt like i was living someone elses life and it was by contrast so creative energising and exciting in fact very different to the reality of my own life at the time so i started thinking what other ways of living could i try out how might they compare with the way that i have known for the last 25 years would i be happier if i was doing something riskier and less certain i even allowed myself to consider the idea of giving up my business life altogether
1924432 i knew i was capable in the business arena and that if i were to leave that world for a taste of something different i could always return to it should i choose to
1924433 as i returned to london i was clear that it was time to make some big decisions so i instructed an estate agent to sell my house thus creating the freedom that would enable me to experiment owning that house was probably the greatest drag on my energy at that moment in time and the one thing that kept me having to remain in a life that was no longer acceptable
1924434 the idea of travelling was taking on greater and greater appeal and i loved the stories that julie had told me of her own experiences as a nomad
1924435 having introduced them a few years ago i was thrilled that things worked out and they decided to get hitched they now have a beautiful daughter called hannah
1924436 at the time my plan was to downsize to a much smaller property that i could purchase without having to take out a mortgage but there was one further twist in my story that i had not seen coming and like most plans things did not pan out like i thought they would
1924437 a couple of days before i left australia to return home after the play was over she sent me an email saying she was still in london but was having a farewell i am off to thailand party well this came as quite a surprise to me as i believed she would have been long gone by now i called her to say thanks for inviting me but that i did not particularly relish the opportunity of watching someone i was keen on leave for another life especially as she had explicitly said she did not see us having a future together when we met for the last time three months earlier but i thought it would be polite to say goodbye so i agreed to attend for about an hour so i could once more wish her a happy life in thailand
1924438 as the time approached for me to leave the party i found nikki and said goodbye wishing her a safe trip and great happiness
1924439 well er because i havent seen your footage of the play and i would really like to watch it before i go to thailand i want to see how you got on
1924440 although i suspected there was more going on below the surface than nikki was admitting anyway i agreed to go round to her house the following monday and show her the play
1924441 there was something going on and i wanted to get to the bottom of it
1924442 i arrived and we had a bite to eat then we watched the play and when it was over i started packing my things away to leave
1924443 you asked me to show you the play and now you have seen it and i have to go so have a great life in thailand
1924444 but wait er you cant go er i think i have changed my mind i think i would like to have a relationship with you
1924445 in my mind there was only one way to find out if it was ever going to work out for us and made a suggestion to nikki i told her that i was putting my house on the market and that i expected it to take 2 3 months before it was sold i boldly invited her to move into the house with me for that period the same thing happened with my friend nic and regina a few months earlier and it had really worked out for them by doing this i felt we would discover if we were meant to be together or not and to my delight she accepted
1924446 it was during this time that the idea of us two travelling together in asia started to emerge we obviously got on very well and we both thought that if things did not work out we could easily continue travelling solo so there seemed very little to lose nikki had a lot of experience backpacking and hiking which was very re assuring to me as i had none by the end of september nikki was ready to go to thailand so she took off while i completed the sale of the house it took 42 days from the time she left until i flew out there to join her
1924447 although i never planned it like this i have been nomadic ever since an unbelievable 1 000 days so far
1924448 my tee shirt says live your life which is exactly what i want to do exploring and discovering a path that is really fulfilling and expanding my consciousness are vitally important to me i really dont want to experience my life as mediocre and end up doing things or settling for something because i think i should when i first began this journey i thought it might last six months and it has turned into two and half years it has been thrilling so far and i feel it is far from over there is still so much of the world to see and experience

1924457 some studies suggest that negative campaign ads are more easily remembered and therefore have a greater influence on voters attitudes and vote decisions
1924458 so when should a candidate use negative information about an opponent
1924459 never never use negative campaign tactics unless you have to
1924460 when candidates struggle in their efforts to build positive images of themselves many choose to close the gap by tarnishing the images of their opponents

1924478 a person can cause evil to others not only by his actions but by his inaction and in either case he is justly accountable to them for the injury
1924479 it takes less time to do a thing right than it does to explain why you did it wrong
1924480 the man who makes no mistakes does not usually make anything
1924481 sometimes we may learn more from a mans errors than from his virtues

1924483 it is a miserable state of mind to have a few things to desire and many things to fear

1924503 it was like someone had taken me by the hand that day and led me comfortably through everything that happened ron had received a revelation from god that these lives were to be taken i was the one who was supposed to do it and if god wants something to be done it will be done you dont want to offend him by refusing to do his work

1924517 gods love is real but you obviously dont feel it
1924518 a belief in god or a higher spirit is pervasive even americans who describe themselves as atheist or agnostic have a robust sense of a higher power twenty one percent of those who describe themselves as atheists expressed a belief in god or a universal spirit and more than half of those who call themselves agnostic expressed a similar conviction
1924519 the researchers said some people may identify with the term atheist or agnostic without fully understanding the definition or they have a negative view of organized religion even though they believe in god

1924522 creationists make it sound as though a theory is something you dreamt up after being drunk all night
1924523 it was of course a lie what you read about my religious convictions a lie which is being systematically repeated i do not believe in a personal god and i have never denied this but have expressed it clearly if something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it
1924524 there is something infantile in the presumption that somebody else parents in the case of children god in the case of adults has a responsibility to give your life meaning and point
1924525 my own years as a teenager were marred by a sinister regime that thought it had all the answers its influence grew infiltrating schools and civic bodies as well as politics and even religion before it was fully recognized for the monster it was it banished god and thus became impervious to anything true and good
1924526 hence today i believe that i am acting in accordance with the will of the almighty creator by defending myself against the jew i am fighting for the work of the lord
1924527 the jews life is only of this world and his spirit is inwardly as alien to true christianity as his nature two thousand years previous was to the great founder of the new doctrine of course the latter made no secret of his attitude toward the jewish people and when necessary he even took to the whip to drive from the temple of the lord this adversary of all humanity who then as always saw in religion nothing but an instrument for his business existence
1924528 i hate atheists if atheism was responsible for the holocaust instead of a centuries old cultural paradigm of christian anti semitism it would make sense for me to hate them how can i square this circle i know ill ignore hitlers obvious support for and from the catholic church and frequent references to his christian spirituality in his writing and say he was an atheist and since hitler was both an atheist and the man responsible for the holocaust it makes sense for me to hate atheists problem solved

1924556 no it is quite simply impossible even if the two of you managed to conceive a child it would never come to term and could very possibly incite internal bleeding that could result in heidi dying before you even realized that there was a problem you should use birth control up until the time that she has her hysterectomy

1924565 the search continues for the five year old daughter of migrant workers from oklahoma the little girl was reported missing two days ago from the camp near the rudger fruit companys warehouse the sheriffs office is offering a one hundred dollar reward for any information leading to the return of the child or the arrest of her kidnapper

1924626 the people want to find solutions via justice what does the government want it wants to set fire to this city caracas they are looking for violence if they do not let us express ourselves peacefully at the voting booths they are looking for us to set fire to the city

1924633 in my community living with hiv is synonymous with death
1924634 hiv reached my community 10 years ago i never thought i would get it
1924635 first i went through a process of denial and i hid the disease but later i decided to look for information
1924636 when a cuna indian in my district starts to show symptoms he is called boni which means he has a bad spirit in his body
1924637 then we go to our healers who tell us what herbs to take to strengthen our immune system but hiv is much stronger much more resistant
1924638 information is needed to curb the spread of hiv but efforts to bring information to indigenous communities must come hand in hand with our customs and beliefs and our own languages
1924639 the countries participating in the indigenous peoples conference have realised that the epidemic has now also become a rural phenomenon that the virus is in the bodies of indigenous people which makes it necessary to design culturally sensitive prevention strategies
1924640 the main problem facing indigenous people living with hiv is access to treatment and health care because of poverty marginalisation stigma and racism
1924641 how can we break down the communication barriers to ensure access to information and timely prevention
1924642 one of the great challenges we face as indigenous people because we must be able to engage in self criticism is the question of traditional customs and habits which clearly hurt women the most
1924643 indigenous people complain that outside of our communities we suffer discrimination but within our communities we dont want to recognise sexual diversity like homoerotic practices for example
1924644 our aim is to build a latin american strategy to create epidemiological indicators that allow us to gauge the number of indigenous people living with hiv and map out the spontaneous responses that are emerging in the communities
1924645 we are going to create an international secretariat for indigenous people to train leaders influence public policies and make sure we are included in the declarations of the u n general assembly special session on hiv aids
1924646 major efforts are needed to determine the intensity of the epidemic in indigenous and afro descendant communities
1924647 we need data in order to carry out this advocacy work and defend indigenous people living with hiv we need concrete statistics on prevalence rates particularly among indigenous populations
1924648 there is more information on afro descendants particularly in the northern part of central america
1924649 for example the garifuna community afro descendants who live on the coast of belize guatemala and honduras and who migrated 200 years ago from the lesser antilles had an average hiv prevalence rate of eight percent in 1998 which is very high in the regional context
1924650 it is encouraging that it has gone down somewhat but that is not a significant reduction
1924651 we believe that programmes should be designed that are adapted to indigenous and afro descendant communities they must be culturally sensitive involving the participation of traditional healers for example
1924652 i committed myself to increasing the visibility of the epidemic in these communities
1924653 i have already started talking to my colleagues on the regional u n team for latin america to see how we can identify ways to strengthen the available information and the necessary prevention efforts
1924654 most psychopaths are not violent but are apparently normal to the outsider people leading ordinary lives except for the grief they cause those closest to them
1924655 can you come and open up my house im locked out
1924656 well sir it is our rate and you are certainly free to check other companies in the area
1924657 well i called rudys lock amp key down the street from you and he quoted me 50 00
1924658 thats a really good price and i encourage you to call him back
1924659 well sir if i werent available for a few hours i could charge 50 00 too
1924660 it is good to dream big but you get to take one step at a time
1924661 sometimes you get to sacrifice to sacrifice something that may seem so important in order to get something that really means something to you or in order to get what you really wanted
1924662 playing chess is a control thing if you are good at it you can control the whole game by manipulating your enemys move and most of the time you are just waiting for your enemy to make a mistake
1924663 yup i like dat song yup i dont want to lose my mind to gain the whole world because if i lose my mind i couldnt see the world the world wouldnt be there because my mind wasnt here
1924664 little kids usually cant see their limit and they always can keep moving with hopes and energy however when they grow up they start to see their limits and most of the time they are limited by their perceived limits
1924665 i will wait for him to grwo up and be my boyfriend
1924666 what if he doesnt want to be your boyfriend after he grows up

1924674 department stores are going to have to have the right incentives to get customers into the store

1924681 so shall we go back to the office and discuss the job description or are you feeling inclined to run screaming from the joint
1924682 oh mr lazarus dont let my girl next door looks confuse you i did ten years with the military police i know security like the back of my hand and there hasnt been a man born yet i cant put on his ass if ive a mind to lead the way
1924683 is she the one youve been looking for i didnt see even a hint of red emanating from her too soon to say id guess
1924684 point taken yet i cant help but feel its her her fragrance resonates and shes more than qualified for the position question is how will she be able to handle the nuances of the job
1924685 you mean how is she going to handle it when she finds out what you are
1924686 something tells me the lady can handle anything you throw at her
1924687 the jury is still out on that one brother but if she is the one theyll figure it out soon enough if shes not the one well still have to keep an eye on her until they see she isnt a threat
1924688 good i need to feed then ill get dressed and meet your girl next door security expert
1924689 how does if feel to beat out all those pumped up amateurs
1924690 just to the left of fanfuckintastic and icing on the cake richard bellows applied and got turned away as the manager was walking me out he was so pissed his ears were red
1924691 oh that is too precious bet he thinks twice before calling you chickie again you know he didnt pass the psych profile for the academy right so when do you meet the mysterious mr lazarus
1924692 tonight at nine i gotta run sweetie i need to shower and rummage through my closet for something appropriate to wear
1924693 ill be waiting on your doorstep when you get back
1924694 id say thanks if i thought you really meant it
1924695 yeah well what can i say im not really sorry you didnt get the job and im deliriously happy that i did
1924696 dunno he wasnt there im meeting with him tonight to get his approval although ian says its just a formality
1924697 hey id love to spend the next few minutes chatting about why im more qualified for the position but im meeting the big guy in a little over an hour and i need to get ready bye now
1924698 ian tells me you have quite the impressive resume were lucky to have you but tell me why flirt
1924699 truthfully it was an impulse after ten years with the military police i was ready for a change
1924700 as you can imagine the service doesnt allow for much of a life outside the job and the politics involved after september eleventh became unbearable in short i wanted a life
1924701 did ian mention i might want you to provide personal security for me when i travel would that be something you would be open to doing
1924702 i suppose that would depend on where you were traveling and how long you intended to be gone sir if i was unable to provide that service personally i would certainly be able to find someone more than capable to do so
1924703 i was given to understand i would be head of security for flirt no mention was made of obligatory travel
1924704 actually ms sheppard its my intention to offer you the position of head of security for all my clubs naturally that will require occasional travel in fact once flirt is open and operating smoothly i would like you to accompany me to the other locations and assess the security needs at each one i will also need you to oversee any updates required and see to the hiring of any additional staff is that something you feel comfortable doing
1924705 and you are comfortable with some of the more atypical aspects of my establishments
1924706 you would be surprised by some of the things ive seen in the line of duty mr lazarus
1924707 then you know its impossible to be a shrinking violet in my line of work
1924708 nobody ive talked to has any idea why were seeing an increase though everybody has a different theory
1924709 the meat industry basically has no answers its pretty frustrating therell be some hand wringing a bunch of lawsuits and nothing will be done until three months later when it all happens again

1924740 il presidente berlusconi ha informato il consiglio circa due importanti decreti da lui adottati
1924741 i was a screenwriter who had gotten into the writers guild i had worked with a partner i had a few things that got made but not big deals there was a point in my career where i could have given up where i could have said well im just going to do something else now i gave myself one last year to turn my career around
1924742 my motto was discipline focus and positive energy i wrote those words down on my computer and had it there staring at me every day i focused on a goal which was selling a script i learned as much as i could by myself and tried to change three or four years later i had a deal on the disney lot and i had sold two million dollar screenplays i had achieved the things that i wanted to achieve
1924743 its about finding yourself somehow lost and finding your way back
1924744 my personal theory is that in writing every screenplay you must have a dark night of the script some point in writing when you go im so terrible at this ive got to quit because if you arent pushing it that hard if you arent trying to get the most out of yourself and the project you arent doing it right
1924745 trouble is good is the subtext of this whole thing
1924746 the amazing thing is how many letters ive gotten from people who say i love your screenwriting beats is it okay if i use them to write a novel yes of course
1924747 i dont know if you know this but you can use the fifteen beats to sell a house and i do that
1924748 i was rebellious as a young writer myself i looked at the tricks of screenwriting as not necessarily high art and thought i was better than that
1924749 what i came up against and what other writers come up against
1924750 are certain laws of nature i found that the ideas ive had that werent good were the ones i kept to myself because i thought somebody might steal it
1924751 the storys magic wont disappear if the idea is good
1924752 we fall in love with our inspiration because it feels so good this sense of this amazing thing that weve been given

1924997 33 again ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time thou shalt not forswear thyself but shalt perform unto the lord thine oaths 34 but i say unto you swear not at all neither by heaven for it is gods throne 35 nor by the earth for it is his footstool neither by jerusalem for it is the city of the great king 36 neither shalt thou swear by thy head because thou canst not make one hair white or black 37 but let your communication be yea yea nay nay for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil
1924998 what did the law of moses actually teach concerning the swearing of oaths
1924999 12 and ye shall not swear by my name falsely neither shalt thou profane the name of thy god i am the lord
1925000 2 if a man vow a vow unto the lord or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond he shall not break his word he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth
1925001 21 when thou shalt vow a vow unto the lord thy god thou shalt not slack to pay it for the lord thy god will surely require it of thee and it would be sin in thee
1925002 1 lord who shall abide in thy tabernacle who shall dwell in thy holy hill 2 he that walketh uprightly and worketh righteousness and speaketh the truth in his heart
1925003 1 hear the word of the lord ye children of israel for the lord hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land because there is no truth nor mercy nor knowledge of god in the land 2 by swearing and lying and killing and stealing and committing adultery they break out and blood toucheth blood
1925004 34 but i say unto you swear not at all neither by heaven for it is gods throne 35 nor by the earth for it is his footstool neither by jerusalem for it is the city of the great king 36 neither shalt thou swear by thy head because thou canst not make one hair white or black
1925005 16 woe unto you ye blind guides which say whosoever shall swear by the temple it is nothing but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple he is a debtor 17 ye fools and blind for whether is greater the gold or the temple that sanctifieth the gold 18 and whosoever shall swear by the altar it is nothing but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it he is guilty 19 ye fools and blind for whether is greater the gift or the altar that sanctifieth the gift
1925006 i swear by the earth by jerusalem by the altar by the temple by my head
1925007 34 but i say unto you swear not at all neither by heaven for it is gods throne nor by the earth for it is his footstool neither by jerusalem for it is the city of the great king 36 neither shalt thou swear by thy head because thou canst not make one hair white or black
1925008 16 for men verily swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife 17 wherein god willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath 18 that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for god to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us
1925009 23 moreover i call god for a record upon my soul that to spare you i came not as yet unto corinth
1925010 5 and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven 6 and sware by him that liveth for ever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets
1925011 hate your ye have heard that it hath been said thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy
1925012 this phrase is not in leviticus 19 18 but is a rabbinical inference which jesus repudiates bluntly the talmud says nothing of love to enemies
1925013 the rabbis corrupted lev 19 18 which sums up the law of israel by adding and hate your enemy by thus tampering with scripture they intended to define their neighbors to include only jews and to exclude samaritans and gentiles
1925014 that you may be sons of your father in heaven

1925020 the methodological question is answered by adherents of the conventional paradigm by asserting that inquiry must be mounted in ways that strip the context of possible contaminating influences confounding variables so that the way things really are and the way things really work can emerge

1925032 we are concerned how few landlords appear to be aware of their responsibilities relating to digital tv switchover
1925033 any landlord who rents out a property which relies on a communal television system must ensure that the necessary steps are taken to make the switch to digital letting properties professionally is a serious responsibility with so many legal obligations to the tenant the business of letting can be a minefield of regulation
1925034 38 ye have heard that it hath been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth 39 but i say unto you that ye resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also 40 and if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also 41 and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him twain 42 give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away
1925035 21 ye have heard that it was said of them of old time thou shalt not kill and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment 22 but i say unto you that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment and whosoever shall say to his brother raca shall be in danger of the council but whosoever shall say thou fool shall be in danger of hell fire 23 therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee 24 leave there thy gift before the altar and go thy way first be reconciled to thy brother and then come and offer thy gift 25 agree with thine adversary quickly whiles thou art in the way with him lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge and the judge deliver thee to the officer and thou be cast into prison 26 verily i say unto thee thou shalt by no means come out thence till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing
1925036 27 ye have heard that it was said by them of old time thou shalt not commit adultery 28 but i say unto you that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart 29 and if thy right eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell 30 and if thy right hand offend thee cut it off and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell
1925037 31 it hath been said whosoever shall put away his wife let him give her a writing of divorcement 32 but i say unto you that whosoever shall put away his wife saving for the cause of fornication causeth her to commit adultery and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery
1925038 33 again ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time thou shalt not forswear thyself but shalt perform unto the lord thine oaths 34 but i say unto you swear not at all neither by heaven for it is gods throne 35 nor by the earth for it is his footstool neither by jerusalem for it is the city of the great king 36 neither shalt thou swear by thy head because thou canst not make one hair white or black 37 but let your communication be yea yea nay nay for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil
1925039 38 ye have heard that it hath been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth 39but i say unto you that ye resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also 40 and if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also 41 and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him twain 42 give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away
1925040 an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
1925041 24 eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot 25 burning for burning wound for wound stripe for stripe
1925042 21 and thine eye shall not pity but life shall go for life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot
1925043 15 one witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity or for any sin in any sin that he sinneth at the mouth of two witnesses or at the mouth of three witnesses shall the matter be established 16 if a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him that which is wrong 17 then both the men between whom the controversy is shall stand before the lord before the priests and the judges which shall be in those days 18 and the judges shall make diligent inquisition and behold if the witness be a false witness and hath testified falsely against his brother 19 then shall ye do unto him as he had thought to have done unto his brother so shalt thou put the evil away from among you 20 and those which remain shall hear and fear and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among you 21 and thine eye shall not pity but life shall go for life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot
1925044 22 if men strive and hurt a woman with child so that her fruit depart from her and yet no mischief follow he shall be surely punished according as the womans husband will lay upon him and he shall pay as the judges determine 23 and if any mischief follow then thou shalt give life for life
1925045 18 thou shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself i am the lord
1925046 29 say not i will do so to him as he hath done to me i will render to the man according to his work
1925047 19 dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but rather give place unto wrath for it is written vengeance is mine i will repay saith the lord
1925048 40 and if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also
1925049 4 and joseph said unto his brethren come near to me i pray you and they came near and he said i am joseph your brother whom ye sold into egypt 5 now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that ye sold me hither for god did send me before you to preserve life 6 for these two years hath the famine been in the land and yet there are five years in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest 7 and god sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance 8 so now it was not you that sent me hither but god and he hath made me a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of egypt 9 haste ye and go up to my father and say unto him thus saith thy son joseph god hath made me lord of all egypt come down unto me tarry not 10 and thou shalt dwell in the land of goshen and thou shalt be near unto me thou and thy children and thy childrens children and thy flocks and thy herds and all that thou hast 11 and there will i nourish thee for yet there are five years of famine lest thou and thy household and all that thou hast come to poverty 12 and behold your eyes see and the eyes of my brother benjamin that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you 13 and ye shall tell my father of all my glory in egypt and of all that ye have seen and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither 14 and he fell upon his brother benjamins neck and wept and benjamin wept upon his neck 15 moreover he kissed all his brethren and wept upon them and after that his brethren talked with him
1925050 8 david also arose afterward and went out of the cave and cried after saul saying my lord the king and when saul looked behind him david stooped with his face to the earth and bowed himself 9 and david said to saul wherefore hearest thou mens words saying behold david seeketh thy hurt 10 behold this day thine eyes have seen how that the lord had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave and some bade me kill thee but mine eye spared thee and i said i will not put forth mine hand against my lord for he is the lords anointed 11 moreover my father see yea see the skirt of thy robe in my hand for in that i cut off the skirt of thy robe and killed thee not know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand and i have not sinned against thee yet thou huntest my soul to take it 12 the lord judge between me and thee and the lord avenge me of thee but mine hand shall not be upon thee 13 as saith the proverb of the ancients wickedness proceedeth from the wicked but mine hand shall not be upon thee 14 after whom is the king of israel come out after whom dost thou pursue after a dead dog after a flea 15 the lord therefore be judge and judge between me and thee and see and plead my cause and deliver me out of thine hand
1925051 20 for what glory is it if when ye be buffeted for your faults ye shall take it patiently but if when ye do well and suffer for it ye take it patiently this is acceptable with god 21 for even hereunto were ye called because christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that ye should follow his steps 22 who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth 23 who when he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously
1925052 59 and they stoned stephen calling upon god and saying lord jesus receive my spirit 60 and he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice lord lay not this sin to their charge and when he had said this he fell asleep
1925053 32 but call to remembrance the former days in which after ye were illuminated ye endured a great fight of afflictions 33 partly whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions and partly whilst ye became companions of them that were so used 34 for ye had compassion of me in my bonds and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance
1925054 19 dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but rather give place unto wrath for it is written vengeance is mine i will repay saith the lord 20therefore if thine enemy hunger feed him if he thirst give him drink for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head 21 be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good
1925055 9 i wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators 10 yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world or with the covetous or extortioners or with idolaters for then must ye needs go out of the world 11 but now i have written unto you not to keep company if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator or covetous or an idolator or a railer or a drunkard or an extortioner with such an one no not to eat 12 for what have i to do to judge them also that are without do not ye judge them that are within 13 but them that are without god judgeth therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person
1925056 do good and give liberally to all who are in need from the wages god gives you do not hesitate about to whom you should not give give to all for god wishes gifts to be made to all out of his bounties
1925057 and he said to love not only our neighbors but also our enemies and to be givers and sharers not only with the good but also to be liberal givers towards those who take away our possessions
1925058 do not judge those who is worthy and who is unworthy for it is possible for you to be mistaken in your opinion in the uncertainty of ignorance it is better to do good to the unworthy for the sake of the worthy than by guarding against those who are less good not to encounter the good for by sparing and trying to test those who are well deserving or not it is possible for you to neglect some who are loved by god the penalty for which is the eternal punishment of fire but by helping all those in need in turn you must assuredly find some who are able to save you before god

1925072 jo o de almada e melo tomou a iniciativa de renovar cidade de a abrir para fora das muralhas e depois abrir a rua do almada que na altura se chamava rua das hortas dando lhe continuidade at pra a da rep blica
1925073 uma maneira de dinamizar a cidade recuperar as casas que estavam muito degradadas h estabelecimentos curiosos com mercadorias que se adaptam mais aos nossos tempos uma forma de manter viva aquela rua caracteristicamente comercial
1925074 o que se est a passar na rua do almada n o foi um fen meno espont neo o que aconteceu foi que v rias pessoas ligadas ao teatro m sica dan a nos ltimos anos vieram morar para aqui
1925075 as pessoas aparecem e come a a despertar a vontade de muita gente jovem de vir morar para aqui neste momento quando h uma casa para alugar vai logo
1925076 penso que est a ter bichinho e porque uma rua t pica do porto encontr mos esta loja e apaixon mo nos de imediato
1925077 esta rua tem muitas casas abandonadas barata por estar meio parada no tempo
1925078 queria abrir a loja aqui na baixa foi nesta rua a nica em que encontrei uma renda compat vel com o que devia pagar
1925079 foi uma boa aposta tanto que est o a abrir outras coisas aqui est a ficar uma rua bem interessante
1925080 a rua do almada est degradada isto n o nada como h uns anos atr s
1925081 para j n o se nota as novas lojas podem vir a trazer mais movimento n o sei
1925082 um exemplo de como se deve reabilitar a baixa sem a ajuda de nenhuma entidade as pessoas vieram para aqui por iniciativa pr pria
1925083 apoiamos o rejuvenescimento da baixa que tem vindo a melhorar mas que precisa de mais apoios porque h ainda muito a explorar todas as iniciativas que pretendem dar vida ao porto s o bem vindas esta cidade tem carisma e preservando a parte antiga e hist rica associando a aos dias de hoje poss vel fazer coisas espectaculares n o s na m sica mas em todas as reas

1925087 who would have thought there would be competing hispanic voter outreach efforts in iowa
1925088 theres a sea change but whether its surfs up or a tsunami i dont know well see over the course of this electoral season it could end up being a relatively minor political force it could be heavy on symbolism but lighter in the ballot box it could turn out that the election is a landslide and it doesnt really matter how arizona new mexico colorado go how florida goes
1925089 as recently as 2004 the hispanic vote was really an afterthought if there was money that was sort of leftover after everything else was accounted for then the money was put into spanish language television that to me is a sea change
1925090 you are going to see next year in nevada especially in the las vegas market that it is not going to be an afterthought it is going to be just as important as nbc abc and cbs univision and telemundo are going to be right up there with the three major networks
1925091 i did not think that immigration in and of itself would carry the day
1925092 the results are proving that while immigration is a concern to people and it should be it is not returning the votes that they thought that it would
1925093 immigration which has become a near obsession to many pundits and political consultants was of only minor concern to voters yesterday
1925094 those who thought they could ride to victory on the backs of immigrants misjudged the american people
1925095 voters chose moderation over manipulation when it came to immigration policies candidates and parties should heed that message when planning for 2008
1925096 i support governor spitzers decision today to withdraw his proposal his difficult job is made that much harder by the failure of the congress and the white house to pass comprehensive immigration reform
1925097 as president i will not support drivers licenses for undocumented people and will press for comprehensive immigration reform that deals with all of the issues around illegal immigration including border security and fixing our broken system
1925098 as a community and as a culture we provide so much richness to this country

1925108 the etymology for the word evangelist derives or comes from the word angel or messenger
1925109 but believe me im no angel in the sense of purity but instead one who has learned much of lifes painful journey from past mistakes
1925110 i believe that being a christian is not about proclaiming to have obtained a holy lifestyle nor projecting a higher moralistic picture of ourselves to those around us
1925111 but rather its recognizing that all of us humans have been dealt with the card of imperfection and we need to acknowledge this to one another carry each others burdens and allow god to work his own righteousness through us
1925112 i was born at a time that if you even spoke in spanish during school time you were either slapped in the face by teachers or sent to the principals office
1925113 due to that mind set i mastered the english language at a very very young age which actually helped me succeed in mainstream broadcasting
1925114 most of my social service jobs were motivated by my concerns for underprivileged individuals in the barrios and ghettos of los angeles
1925115 i also used the platform that radio broadcasting provided me to articulate the problems in those respective communities
1925116 about 85 of their broadcast time focused on entertainment and tactics designed to solicit money for their respective ministries
1925117 those shows were lots of fun and it was very much a pioneering venture to see two latinos for the first time in history hosting a daily drive time 6 to 9 a m slot and killing the competition
1925118 that period of time was the most spiritual and redeeming time i ever spent in my life
1925119 yes it was hard work but very very gratifying and it also afforded me the opportunity to finish writing the end times passover and why christians will suffer great tribulation ortiz book has been examined by several writers in the eschatology genre including dave macpherson who wrote several books including the rapture plot the incredible cover up the great rapture hoax unbelievable pre trib origin the end times passover the book by joe ortiz is not just another prophecy book out of thousands but i dare not tell you the conclusion because i dont want to spoil your journey whatever you do dont pass over joes well thought out and scriptural work
1925120 the reader will find the end times passover and why christians will suffer great tribulation to be a scholarly sound and profound work that will straighten out a lot confusion surrounding biblical issues related to end times prophecy it will cause many teachers and students of the bible to rethink much of what they have accepted as fact concerning the end times joe ortiz has done a magnificent job of researching and writing this important book this is the book i wish i would have written and im sure there are a few others who will wish they had written it as well
1925121 the facts i present in my book will upset many right wing evangelicals and people who support the government of the state of israel
1925122 my book is a treatise that makes a clear distinction between people who actually have faith in jesus christ as opposed to certain factions that believe they have been chosen by god based on their unfortunate interpretation of scripture
1925123 i have found that most religious people are slow to change the belief system they have been indoctrinated with some wont even accept the true facts if they were presented to them on a golden platter
1925124 however if premillennialists and dispensationalists will read this book all the way through im certain they will conclude that the left behind notions they have been fed are blatant lies and anathema to gods will
1925125 lets face it regardless of how much involvement i spend on these minority community advocacy issues the bottom line for me
1925126 if it isnt in concert with what the bible tells us then any thing i do differently will never coincide with gods will
1925127 your old ways of thinking have carried you quite far dear pisces but you may now find that it is time to seek a new platform for your ideas look for more adventurous ways to express yourself break out of the old mold and try something new once you start out in a brand new direction there will be a great deal of support encouraging you to continue on in that way

1925129 its rated pg 13 and were both older than thirteen
1925130 because that movie contains nudity and portrays immorality as being normal and acceptable behavior
1925131 but dad those are just very small parts of the movie thats what our friends whove seen it have told us the movie is two hours long and those scenes are just a few minutes of the total film its based on a true story and good triumphs over evil and there are other redeeming themes like courage and self sacrifice even the movie review websites say that
1925132 my answer is no and that is my final answer you are welcome to stay home tonight invite some of your friends over and watch one of the good videos we have in our home collection but you will not go and watch that film end of discussion
1925133 dad must be feeling guilty and now hes going to try to make it up to us with some fresh brownies maybe we can soften him with lots of praise when he brings them out to us and persuade him to let us go to that movie after all
1925134 before you eat i want to tell you something i love you both so much
1925135 that is why ive made these brownies with the very best ingredients ive made them from scratch most of the ingredients are even organic the best organic flour the best free range eggs the best organic sugar premium vanilla and chocolate
1925136 but i want to be perfectly honest with you there is one ingredient i added that is not usually found in brownies i got that ingredient from our own back yard but you neednt worry because i only added the tiniest bit of that ingredient to your brownies the amount of the portion is practically insignificant so go ahead take a bite and let me know what you think
1925137 dad would you mind telling us what that mystery ingredient is before we eat
1925138 why the portion i added was so small just a teaspoonful you wont even taste it
1925139 come on dad just tell us what that ingredient is
1925140 well ok if you insist that secret ingredient is fresh organic dog do
1925141 dad why did you do that youve tortured us by making us smell those brownies cooking for the last half hour and now you tell us that you added dog do we cant eat these brownies
1925142 why not the amount of dog do is very small compared to the rest of the ingredients it wont hurt you its been cooked right along with the other ingredients you wont even taste it it has the same consistency as the brownies go ahead and eat
1925143 and that is the same reason i wont allow you to go watch that movie you wont tolerate a little dog do in your brownies so why should you tolerate a little immorality in your movies we pray that god will not lead us into temptation so how can we in good conscience entertain ourselves with something that will imprint a sinful image in our minds that will lead us into temptation long after we first see it
1925144 we basically filed a brief that says if you injure someone in houston texas you should properly be held accountable in houston

1925147 its sort of the legal equivalent of dont mess with texas

1925191 wolfmother toured the world virtually non stop through 2006 and early 2007 on the back of their acclaimed self titled debut album
1925192 longstanding frictions within the group then led them to take an extended break during the second half of 2007 to consider their future

1925338 the alcoholic has obsessions to an exaggerated degree over a period of time he has built up self pity resentments toward anyone or anything that interferes with his drinking dishonest thinking prejudice ego antagonism toward anyone and everyone who dares to cross him vanity and a critical attitude are character defects that gradually creep in and become a part of his life living with fear and tension inevitably results in wanting to ease that tension which alcohol seems to do temporarily it took me some time to realize that the twelve steps of aa were designed to help correct these defects of character and so help remove the obsession to drink

1925387 this is notification of an event in washington state as reported to or investigated by the wa department of health office of radiation protection
1925388 date of event 17 november 2005 called in 5 45 pm
1925389 abstract the licenses radiation safety officer reported that sometime between 2 and 5 pm a troxler model 3411b moisture density gauge serial number 5541 was stolen out of the operators transport vehicle parked in a diamond parking lot adjacent to the flour mill where the companys offices are located at 621 w
1925390 bolt cutters were used to liberate the gauge transport box from 2 separate chains with a padlock on each attaching the box to the rear of the operators pick up truck the parking lot of over 75 vehicles has an attendant who did not observe the theft
1925391 the operator appears to have violated at least one doh requirement that may have contributed to the theft to the device
1925392 another potential contributing factor to the theft is that the operator was planning on transporting the gauge to his residence to recharge and take it to the work site the next morning because the work site was halfway between the operators residence and the primary storage location
1925393 the event is currently under investigation this report will be updated to include any new findings no media attention noted at present

1925413 spokane police chief anne kirkpatrick is inviting protesters from the july 4 riverfront park demonstration to a chat wednesday to discuss human rights

1925417 ask questions you know because you have seen it before
1925418 we ask that you follow only one rule to act within the bounds of civility and respect well do the same and the meeting will be valuable and rewarding
1925419 kirkpatrick said that the taser probes missed the man she did not allow the press to ask questions since the case is still under investigation
1925420 well have a great facilitator for this meeting terry goetz of the citys human rights commission
1925421 we will all need to get right to the point
1925422 youre question please mama do you have a question maam maam your question maam we are going to have to ask you to let someone else who has a question speak maam
1925423 we created this online space for the community to exist which had never had a space before and people just flocked to it
1925424 the first five or 10 took a lot of negotiation mostly with their editors to allow them to spend the time as part of the 40 hour work week required under the papers union contract but then we started to get some success and industry recognition
1925425 at that point something interesting happened now the bloggers started coming to us requesting a blog
1925426 none of this could have happened without his complete support
1925427 he came soon after we started blogging we had a handful of them going by then but it really blossomed and all the obstacles went away
1925428 thats one of the reasons frankly why we developed so much web original content
1925429 we didnt want to lose all of the non subscribers from the web audience
1925430 invites readers to talk about our news coverage and content on a daily basis what they like what they dont like and what theyd like to see more of
1925431 it really gives us a place to explain what were doing why were doing it and send people to the raw materials and second guess us
1925432 there are officials challenging the reporting and challenging the context these blogs and forums let us explain what weve done and why weve done it and then it enables us to provide readers with the raw material that people can review and decide for themselves once people get into that it takes a lot of heat off the organization and it puts the heat right back where it belongs on the officials were trying to investigate
1925433 we tried at first to have each post copy edited before it went live but that proved to be unwieldy and an impediment to immediacy
1925434 one thing weve recognized is you cant just give someone a blog and expect them to understand what that means
1925435 there has to be an understanding with the writer and writers editor in terms of frequency of posts editing etc i think 80 percent of the time newspaper blogs arent very good because they dont know anything about interactivity they dont understand the need to aggregate they dont understand the need to post frequently
1925436 something thats come up during the day or advancing something what huckleberries is going to do online
1925437 what we dont do and were talking about it for 2007 is external advertising for online in general
1925438 for the best things we have online we dont advertise those like we do other aspects of the paper and thats going to have to change
1925439 were trying very hard to show that these things can be done with a reasonable size staff
1925440 link to your competitors for those of us in the news business thats counter intuitive
1925441 our least successful blogs are those where the author simply states a point of view
1925442 people respond they get angry but they rarely advance an issue or an idea
1925443 blogging isnt the only tool and i dont want people on the staff to think just because i have a blog i dont have to do multimedia or podcasting or i dont have to learn anything else
1925444 people might tend to overlook the significance of it but it has advertisers and they recognize that you deliver a niche audience that is so well targeted
1925445 the difficulty is we have an organization that primarily chases big dollar accounts and there is big money to be made here but in nickels and dimes at a time
1925446 if we were able to sell out all of the ad spots on huckleberries online we would generate 50 000 per year but somebody has to go out and beat the bushes to find 20 to 30 advertisers who want to be on that thats no easy task
1925447 one or two advertisers on huckleberries online would bring in more than all the google ad words
1925448 advertisers who are willing to spend 1 000 to 2 000 per month want their message to be broadcast they want it everywhere on the site
1925449 they might be better served if they paid 100 to 200 a month and had their ad in targeted areas
1925450 were always running short of ad inventory space on our business pages
1925451 none of us has a clue where its going to go the blogging concepts we are playing around with now are just a piece of what we have to do
1925452 how to take huckleberrries online and adapt it to pdas and newsreaders and podcasts and the other kinds of technology were playing around with
1925453 huckleberries online gets closest to the strategic model of what a newspaper blog can be
1925454 its a blog that breaks news it engages citizens and the movers and shakers in dialogue in some ways it has become its own 24 7 source of news and information for people in that community
1925455 im going to take whatever time i can out of his schedule and have him teach others as we try to create similar hubs in other outlying communities
1925456 what huckleberries online has shown is that between the trained journalist and the citizen participants you can really leverage your presence
1925457 reality tv meets the newsroom trailblazer steve smith brings newspaper transparency to a whole new level
1925458 and i thought i was over here teaching iraqis to kill and sodomize each other so that we dont have to anymore and to defend the right of mr brookbank and mr olsen and mr savage and mr cheney to say what the constitution allows

1925462 under the clocktower in spokanes riverfront park 17 people protesting police brutality were arrested about 6 45 p
1925463 officers charged the group which included self proclaimed anarchists and other teens and young adults after ordering them to disperse one arrest was after what police say was an assault on an officer protesters dispute that
1925464 if you want to go where its peaceful and let the anarchists have their way move to eugene oregon
1925465 officers charged the group which included self proclaimed anarchists and other teens and young adults after ordering them to disperse
1925466 while some in the group began to picnic sitting on a large american flag a few others held signs and distributed fliers some asked police who were beginning to congregate around them if they wanted a copy of their literature on police brutality officers declined
1925467 police soon began to assemble around the group and a couple with cameras photographed those in the crowd who responded by chanting
1925468 a scuffle began and a protester was taken to the ground and arrested police allege the male pushed and tried to choke the officer protesters said the officer shoved the man to the ground without provocation
1925469 more officers gathered and one read an order telling the protesters to disperse moments later police charged the group ripping down their sign and pushing protesters to the ground
1925470 those who were arrested were forced onto their stomachs their hands were tied behind them with plastic ties
1925471 as far as being placed on their stomachs and restrained
1925472 i think you can also see that they were not having any difficulty breathing
1925473 how do you know they were not asked to leave before the arrests began
1925474 dont rely on the s r to report the truth on this event or any other incident
1925475 under the clocktower in spokanes riverfront park 17 people protesting police brutality were arrested about 6 45 p
1925476 officers charged the group which included self proclaimed anarchists and other teens and young adults after ordering them to disperse one arrest was after what police say was an assault on an officer protesters dispute that
1925477 yes your honor hell ya i was there i did it and i would do it again
1925478 protesters who believe deeply in the rights guaranteed under the constitution often become belligerent and communicate nonverbally personna of rebellion and defiance etc
1925479 rights arent really rights if everyone threatens to take them away when you use them
1925480 speriamo che il mio serial faccia il botto cos mi lancio nel mondo del cinema

1925483 50 was screaming into his blackberry phone he was on a rampage he ripped off the 70 inch plasma on the wall and then to top it off he threw his phone straight thru the window of his executive office shattering the glass all over thirtysomething street

1925487 thats the great thing about hair it always grows back
1925488 suppongo che prima o poi tutti debbano prendere decisioni dolorose ma giuste e questo il caso ho deciso di non impersonare pi il personaggio di dr house per dei semplici motivi da quando lavoro a questo progetto che mi ha dato tanto ho perso di vista la mia famiglia i miei interessi e sopratutto non sono riuscito pi a fare quello che adoro il teatro avevo firmato per quattro stagioni dopo che lepisodio pilota era stato promosso a serie vi assicuro che la decisione non stata repentina ci ho rifletutto sopra per mesi
1925489 he could be a serious candidate to be our captain
1925490 its aug 6 and we have to start thinking about these things
1925491 my personal opinion is that 10 years ago or maybe longer now the decision to bring import players to the chl was something very good now its getting tougher to bring those players second we must look at the calibre of players we are bringing over now third we must look and see if we can improve the situation we have with them
1925492 the discipline which makes the colleagues of a strong organization effective in operations is not to be gained by harsh or tyrannical treatment on the contrary such treatment is far more likely to destroy than to make a strong organization it is possible to impart guidance and to give directions in such a manner and such a tone of voice to inspire in a colleague the feeling of an intense desire to obey while the opposite manner and tone of voice cannot fail to excite strong resentments and a desire to disobey the one mode or other of dealing with colleagues springs from the corresponding spirit in the breast of the leader he who feels the respect which is due to others cannot fail to inspire in them regard for himself while he who feels and hence manifests disrespect towards others especially his subordinates cannot fail to inspire hatred against himself
1925493 he who feels the respect which is due to others cannot fail to inspire in them regard for himself
1925494 ricordando certe cose in un futuro sono sicura che mi verranno in mente solo stupendi ricordi ecerto mi sarei pentita solo nel caso non avessi provato a vivere certe cose seguendo listinto bello vivere il momento quando si presenta loccasione giusta e almeno in quel momento lasciar stare la razionalit perch molto spesso ci che ci blocca pensare troppo a cosa ne potrebbero pensare gli altri ma sapete che vi dico fanculo il mondo

1925499 the university regrets any inconvenience or concerns this situation may have caused
1925500 its a surprise and a shock to us that this has happened
1925501 it seemed to me like it was business as usual
1925502 although health officials said its unlikely that the source of the outbreak will ever be identified they believe its an isolated incident
1925503 mike theres a federal judge whos pissin on my neck and its about this anson thing
1925504 i cant tell you that a federal level judge had issued a warrant for all information connected with this case that would be a violation of the law and a reason for my dismissal as captain of king county police department
1925505 nor can he preside in a case where he is privy to information outside that presented by the litigants thats both are unethical
1925506 hes sitting on that kids case the one that shot the insurance agent
1925507 so if you come across a warrant filing with that mans name on it you might be surprised to see that he issued a warrant for a sealed copy of the anson files and that hes now hearing that kids case
1925508 uh apparently right after you went to see the right reverend watts within hours as a matter of fact
1925509 so the judge had the files for a week before that kid shot jason
1925510 that the files were sealed and he never saw em
1925511 ive already put my tenure in jeopardy by telling you this much
1925512 well i found your name as the presiding judge in the jason shooting and wanted to talk to you about scheduling the hearings
1925513 well it might consume uh i might get caught up in something else
1925514 your name on a warrant that was routed through my department and uh are you okay
1925515 no i just wanted to be sure you knew i was covering two bases here um you know investigating this jason shooting and heading up the anson murder
1925516 judge simpson are you responsible for warrants for wiretaps or information in this district
1925517 did you issue a warrant for police records from the anson case or was it something else you wanted
1925518 did you look at any of those records or have any information forwarded to you from the melissa anson case files
1925519 if i did i would have to recuse myself from the jason trial but you already know that dont you
1925520 youre an appointed official is that correct i mean now you
1925521 well because you can only issue warrants requested from federals levels isnt that right
1925522 federal jurisdiction under the fbis interpretation of the crimes against children act
1925523 but also one ready to live eat drink and be happy for tomorrow we die was easier than
1925524 well i was in vietnam youve heard of that one right
1925525 i just wanna know how and from where details about the anson murder are being fed to potential suspects
1925526 i dont thats why i wanna question em without them being privy to details
1925527 all right who do you want me to question about that sorta thing
1925528 thats not my jurisdiction wouldnt that come under the realm of the federal grand jury right
1925529 im just a civil servant your honor who do you think
1925530 im a man whos been there for the people for a lotta years you
1925531 do you think i gave out information on this investigation
1925532 how did the other case the jason shooting get to be heard before a federal magistrate and not under some state jurisdiction
1925533 but you didnt make that determination someone else did right you were just following orders
1925534 then he called me a cocksucker and ordered me out of his office
1925535 damn when you light a fire joseph you do it with a flamethrower
1925536 stay the fuck away from him joseph i mean it
1925537 but i wouldve loved tove seen that that prick has been nothing but a burr under my saddle for too long
1925538 i always feel guilty givin her an order i dont know many more trips she can make across this hardwood floor
1925539 shit that ole battle ax is tough as she is old she served the first egg i bet
1925540 all right ill give you my story with that swine
1925541 i was working at that inter agency drug thing um ycint
1925542 long after i was gone and simpson too fortunately for him it was his baby and somebody else had to jump on the grenade to cover his ass the only people he would go after were the people with something to lose all the dealers who packed their profits back up their nose were considered non players in that mind he was all about the money if a dealer had something to lose cash cars house boats anything that could be turned over simpson wanted us to nail em the rest went begging
1925543 his daddy gave him a chunk o change and he turned it into serious money by turning over a rather large quantity of white drugs and simpson had a hard on for the guy or i should say his money and his car dealership and his big house and
1925544 but simpson had no interest in milton and price remember them
1925545 even with that the judge would not let go of watson judge simpson wanted that guy bad so everybody is pissing n moaning about us missing the big fish and we are ordered to chase down every mope connected to price and milton while doc watson cleans up selling off his bundle in the ensuing power vacuum and then he goes legit as the crazy car dealer and ycint doesnt fucking catch anybody
1925546 i told an inquest board that simpson pushed us to take down watson and to forget about the two big players because they didnt have anything that we wanted
1925547 yeah but it was the last time i had anything to do with that sanctimonious prig
1925548 well now i have to see if i cant get that preacher to fold
1925549 ive never met anybody so obsessed with knowing every detail
1925550 i know when i was in the corps i wasnt given any answers and was happier for it now i just get tangled up in knowing the details thats probably why my methods work so well because i have to know sometimes i feel like im gonna bust if i dont
1925551 i just cant stand to see some of these people suffer
1925552 oh melissa anson she didnt deserve that im sick of watching bystanders and the mopes and the no bodys getting mauled while the creeps and fucking
1925553 i mean it some days i feel like were putting a band aid on brain tumor its just not workin
1925554 i dont like it when people easily condemn someone who has an addiction as if he were a criminal as if he were a person who should be persecuted
1925555 those who should be persecuted are those who sell the substances those who give it away those who traffic in it
1925556 decriminalization of the consumer should include what are called second generation human rights but at the same time there should be a strong policy of prevention so that no one falls in the situation of consuming any substance
1925557 the evidence generally shows that the decriminalization of possession is not clearly associated with any increase in illicit drug use
1925558 you basically need to get those people out of the underground and into health systems
1925559 this would be part of a growing number of countries in latin america where there is either for political or judicial reasons a push toward decriminalization of personal possession sometimes combined with initiatives to crack down harder on bigger drug traffickers
1925560 it typically involves both lessening the criminal sanction for possession of cannabis while also providing for alternatives to incarceration for people addicted to drugs who are arrested for drug possession or other minor offenses
1925561 the rest of us might have had misspent youths but cheye is one of those fellows who has been on the straight and narrow his whole life
1925562 i never imagined when i set out to protect people from the crooks and the criminals that i would have to protect them from my fellow police officers
1925563 injustice in this county in this country in this world happens every day
1925564 but people who experience it most often dont have the support dont have the community dont have the resources that we do
1925565 you get to carry guns pepper spray and clubs and be top dog under a big sheet of moral justification
1925566 fuck yeah sign me up i cant wait to beat me some minorities and skinny queer lookin dudes when they give me an excuse or at least fuckem over
1925567 to eliminate most federal penalties for possession of marijuana for personal use and for other purposes
1925568 notwithstanding any other provision of law no penalty may be imposed under an act of congress for the possession of marijuana for personal use or for the not for profit transfer between adults of marijuana for personal use for the purposes of this section possession of 100 grams or less of marijuana shall be presumed to be for personal use as shall the not for profit transfer of one ounce or less of marijuana except that the civil penalty provided in section 405 of the controlled substances act 21 u s c 844a may be imposed for the public use of marijuana if the amount of the penalty does not exceed 100
1925569 i want you to support h r 5843 to decriminalize marijuana possession under federal law
1925570 removing computers medicine and money and using a steel cylinder battering ram to get into the upstairs bedrooms
1925571 trash counters strewn with open and empty glass jars piles of receipts thrown on the ground upturned couch cushions bits of marijuana on the edges of counters and an atm with its doors torn open and emptied an outdoor vegetable garden had plants uprooted along with marijuana plants removed by the agents
1925572 were used to the dea calling in help from various federal agencies and local law enforcement but i guess none of their usual buddies were available yesterday because from the picture below which appeared in the la times today it looks like they had to resort to calling in blackwater
1925573 are members of a disputed mercenary killer group now working with the dea a photo from the la times shows proof of one of two things either blackwater members are now working for the bush white houses drug enforcement agency or this semi illegitimate band of rogue federal cops have worse discipline than any of us ever imagined

1925598 on the wrong side of the of the most important issue to americans right now
1925599 barack obama nancy pelosi and harry reid find themselves on the wrong side of the drilling question and it has thrown their party into disarray all three democrats are tangled on the same tripwire their friends in the environmental movement want to stop oil exploration unlike most politicians who face public outcry when gas gets pricey environmental groups are willing to argue that gas should to be more expensive in order to make alternative sources of energy seem cost efficient by comparison
1925600 for years they actually thought that high gas prices were a good idea most liberals have always thought that gas tax increases were a good idea and high price gas was a good idea thereby just forcing less consumption of course that is a very very elitist notion unless youre fortunate enough to live on the upper east side of manhattan and can run downstairs and get on the subway most americans depend on their automobiles to get their kids to school to get to work and to get to the grocery store
1925601 from my travels across this state it is clear that minnesotans are united in the belief that any solution to our nations energy crisis that doesnt produce a single drop more of oil is half hearted i believe the most effective way to lower prices is to increase supply while lowering demand its basic economics the great news is that america is blessed with the tools to affect both supply and demand if congress would just act to unlock the nations energy potential not only did democratic leaders block a vote on my amendment but they went so far as to object to drilling even if gas were to reach 10 a gallon how high do prices have to get before producing more becomes a viable option
1925602 maybe in a month ill let everyone kind of cool down and approach it energy a little differently than we have in the past

1925670 am i not an apostle have i not seen the lord
1925671 after he was seen by james and then by all the apostles then
1925672 last of all seals the case that paul was the last apostle
1925673 since no one today can meet the qualifications of having seen the risen jesus with his own eyes there are no apostles today in the place of living apostles present in the church to teach and govern it we have instead the writings of the apostles in the books of the nt those nt scriptures fulfill for the church today the absolutely authoritative teaching and governing functions which were fulfilled by the apostles themselves during the early years of the church
1925674 i do believe that apostles have a place and purpose but not the place and purpose that the 12 had which is to set the foundation
1925675 the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints
1925676 remember the words that were spoken beforehand by the apostles of our lord jesus christ
1925677 having been built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets christ jesus himself being the cornerstone
1925678 its impossible to please god apart from faith and why because anyone who wants to approach god must believe both that he exists and that he cares enough to respond to those who seek him
1925679 god had a better plan for us that their faith and our faith would come together to make one completed whole their lives of faith not complete apart from ours

1925723 although ive been aware from the start that my books might offend some people ive never been afraid of physical harm because of them i wrote these books because i felt called to write them after researching aisha for my own purposes my passion for her story trumps the fear factor ive expected controversy yes but never terrorism

1925729 we stand firmly by our responsibility to support our authors and the free discussion of ideas even those that may be construed as offensive by some however a publisher must weigh that responsibility against others that it also bears and in this instance we decided after much deliberation to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel

1925767 yang halal itu jelas dan haram juga jelas dan antara keduanya adalah perkara yang syubhat remang remang banyak manusia tidak mengetahui kejelasannya maka siapa yang manjaga diri dari barang syubhat ini maka dia telah menjaga harga diri dan agamanya dan siapa yang terjerumus pada syubhat maka dia akan terjerumus pada yang haram ibarat seorang pengembala yang menggembalakan kambingnya di dekat daerah larangan maka dia nyaris akan memasuki daerah larangan itu

1925908 a fascinating ground breaking must read wake up call for all professionals and aficionados of the luxury goods industries the consumers of their products and the celebrities that endorse them

1925912 could herald a huge change in the way global luxury brands operate
1925913 the luxury goods industry looks like its having its own nike moment
1925914 press coverage has focused on the ranking and on what these companies are failing to do right for the environment
1925915 however the main thrust of the report looks to a future in which the very definition of luxury deepens to include not only technical and aesthetic quality but also environmental and social responsibility
1925916 we examined key commercial challenges facing the industry and found that greater depth and authenticity is a strategic response to many of them
1925917 modern technology means that whats on the catwalk today can be copied and in the shops tomorrow so brands need to offer something deeper than purely appearance the same goes for counterfeiting
1925918 sales growth in societies with high social inequality means that luxury brands face a crisis of legitimacy and a regulatory backlash so their products will need to benefit the local economy with good jobs the increasingly youthful profile of luxury consumers means luxury brands need to find ways to build in value to casual fashion items without making them non casual with sustainability and ethics an obvious approach
1925919 the increasing availability of luxury items means that brands must find new ways of maintaining their cachet rather than relying on the memory they were once scarce and exclusive deeper luxury is the strategic answer to all these challenges
1925920 consumer awareness should no longer be assumed as the only commercial driver for ethical excellence though counter intuitive to traditional corporate strategists this shift in thinking is fundamental to the contemporary business environment of global communications where successful brands are behaving more like social movements
1925921 theres no one better than tom ford for spotting trends in consumer mood the report details a variety of strategic commercial imperatives for deeper luxury if executives dont get it that could be because theyve had it so good for so long and have become complacent
1925922 in the report we explain that no logo luxury is a growing trend that responds to consumers desire for authenticity as well as responding to the availability of counterfeits
1925923 executives could do well to hire expert advice on the stages of corporate response to social challenges over the past 10 years to learn from the experience of others
1925924 lifeworth is working with research and consulting partners to offer solutions to those executives in the luxury industry who really believe in achieving social and environmental excellence as part of the identity of luxury brands
1925925 some executives might be stung by the coverage and some environmentalists confused
1925926 but wwf uk should be applauded for sticking its neck out by publishing this report
1925927 the scale of the environmental challenge is so great and pressing and the reach of ngos into asian societies currently so limited that if the brands that affluent asians love can excel in sustainability then awareness of sustainable living may grow in emerging economies fast enough to offer a chance of curbing global consumption and pollution within environmental limits

1926155 our biggest question right now is getting our life support systems working so we have enough for six person crew
1926156 right now were running kind of a water deficit and its being supplemented by the shuttle

1926166 there have been a lot of interest in estrogen and isoflavones in particular and a potential relationship to fertility and other reproductive disorders
1926167 its way too early to say stop eating soy foods
1926168 its not time to worry about whether youre eating too much soy
1926169 when patients are overweight the fat tissue converts male hormones to more female hormones
1926170 so it is possible that the combination of this estrogenic source soy and the extra internal estrogen that is caused by the conversion of androgen to estrogen through the fat has a more deleterious effect in that group of patients
1926171 but this is a good reminder that if you have an overweight patient with abnormal semen parameters and a very high soy intake it may be wise for them to decrease this factor

1926181 we have developed a number of strategies to make sure our athletes are able to succeed despite the smog
1926182 elite athletes participating in strenuous activity inhale much more air and air pollution than the average person at rest or during light activity
1926183 since air pollutants can cause symptoms like cough and throat irritation even in people without underlying health problems this can reduce athletic performance
1926184 heat and humidity is a bigger issue for our athletes than pollution

1926190 the lord of varanasi once hunted and killed many deer on this land the deer king implored him to stop the unnecessary killing and promised that each day he himself would give the lord the number of deer which he required one day he was faced with the necessity of sending a pregnant deer rather than sacrifice her with her unborn child the deer king went to the lord to offer his own flesh instead the lord was so moved by the deer kings compassion that he stopped the daily killing and gave it the land hence it was named the deer park
1926191 during the ching dynasty in china in yang chou there was a person named cheng pai lin one day he had a dream in which avalokitesvara bodhisattva told him tomorrow the ching army will arrive out of the seventeen people in your household sixteen will survive but you cannot escape your fate tomorrow wang ma tze will kill you because in a past life you stabbed him twenty six times and killed him then avalokitesvara bodhisattva added there is still an expedient method that may work prepare a fine feast tomorrow and when he comes invite him to eat with you afterwards allow him to kill you perhaps that will change things the dream was vivid and when cheng pai lin awoke the following morning he went out and bought wine and vegetables brought them back and had a feast prepared then noontime came someone knocked at the door he opened the door and said are you wang ma tze how strange said the man at the door im from the north how did you know my name his host invited him in and said youre welcome ive prepared a feast for you wont you join me then he related the dream hed had the night before last life i killed you with twenty six stabs of a knife and so this life you have come to kill me after weve finished this meal you can do it wang ma tze pondered over this and said but if you killed me last life and i kill you this life wont you kill me again next life it will just go on and on no i wont kill you then he took his knife and scratched twenty six marks on his hosts back to represent that the debt had been repaid not only did wang ma tze not kill his host but afterwards they became very good friends wang said to his host the ching army is following en masse they are not reasonable so the best would be for you and your family to go to su chou its safe there so that is what cheng pai lin did this is a case of turning grievance into friendship and reversing the retribution that is due one from this you can see that its possible to alter ones fate

1926355 serbs would massacre for example one hundred to two hundred people or rape one hundred women or one hundred girls so that they would be terrorized so that they flee then you get an ethnically pure land
1926356 i feel responsible because i made the preparations for this war even if not the military preparations if i hadnt created this emotional strain in the serbian people nothing would have happened
1926357 responsibility exists on all levels and while the atrocities of ethnic cleansing and genocide are usually what capture our attention it is important to recognize the ideology that spawns them and to hold those responsible for this to account

1926392 the three storied pyramidal shaped temple placed nealy two meters higher that the ground has windows that open to give a pleasing view of the durbar square of patan but one has to enter it through narrow low metal doors and climb equally narrow steps of the small stairs risking a fall always due to continuous traffic of the people going up or down and almost darkness inside while continuously minding ones head due to a very low roof the temple opens for only few very special days in a year and devotees have to make a rush to see and be seen at here the boys looking after the shoes that one has to leave behind while entering the temple charge a small fee for their service else they are certain to disappear there remains a sense of hustling and hoarding in the air near the temples here instead of calm and tranquility

1926464 instead of obtaining medical treatment or calling for an ambulance you called the agent to say that you wanted to return the maid
1926465 and consolidating the highly fragmented land is indispensable for raising agricultural productivity
1926466 fight and youll never survive run and youll never escape
1926467 any increase should be based on the performance of the maid they polo just cannot arbitrarily fix a rate and expect every employer to follow it
1926468 most maid agencies are rejecting the increase and employers have expressed their objections as well
1926469 some employers are not even paying the current us 200 salary stipulated by polo
1926470 this may encourage filipino women to come into the country as tourists and be employed as maids at a lower salary
1926471 i cannot but be pleased with the filial affection which seems to evince you to preserve the estate for a parent
1926472 to you sir the thanks of the state were eminently due
1926473 i made pretty much of it in 20 years from 1844 to 1864 everything i touched within that time seemed to turn to gold i bought largely of u s state securities when their value was low and they advanced greatly
1926474 she looks a lot more tended to than when i have seen her in recent years she has scars on her arm she told me her arm was bitten off and surgically reattached
1926475 i guess i was surprised she was in south korea
1926476 id ski naked down mount everest with a carnation up my nose if he asked me
1926477 me think the mormon doth protest too much you have seen the size of mr anderson and you have seen the size of my client
1926478 my own view is that we were well rid of her
1926479 my instinct is that the prosecuting authorities were very pleased to see the back of them i myself was rather sorry she was a woman of considerable presence
1926480 not again she always was a nutter every so often she finds us and drives us mad last time she wanted to know what material stuart had because they wanted to make a film about her anthony hopkins was going to play the part of stuart
1926481 grandpa are you holding her up or is she holding you up
1926482 deprived as i was of the opportunity of obtaining anything more than the most common education i am well qualified to estimate its value by the disadvantages i labour under in the society in which my business and situation in life frequently throws me and willingly would i now give twenty times the expense attending a good education could i now possess it but it is now too late for me to learn and i can only do to those who come under my care as i could have wished circumstances had permitted others to have done by me
1926483 heaven has been pleased to reward my efforts with success and has permitted me to establish a house in the great metropolis of england i have endeavored to make it an american house to give it an american atmosphere to furnish it with american journals to make it a center for american news and an agreeable place for my friends visiting london
1926484 after my disappointment long ago i determined to devote myself to my fellow beings and am carrying out that decision to my best ability
1926485 you always had the faculty of an extraordinary memory and strong mind which enabled you to carry out your plans better than almost any other man i ever knew
1926486 he gp had a vigorous personality and in spite of a humble origin apparently found little difficulty in moving in prominent circles
1926487 leading u s business men william shepard wetmore john cryder sherman and curtis miranda lampson and william wilson corcoran
1926488 mr peabody is a remarkable man he is 74 years old large and has been powerful of frame he has made an enormous fortune which he is giving for good objects chiefly for education in america and for useful purposes in london he has had almost no schooling and has not read books but has had much experience and is deeply versed in questions of commerce and banking he is a man of strong will and can decide questions for himself
1926489 well well i must give you 50 000 more to get you out of trouble and i must say that none of my foundations have given me so much satisfaction as this one at my native place

1926491 how albert einstein 1879 1955 changed the way we see the universe
1926492 my parents were worried because i started to talk comparatively late and they consulted a doctor
1926493 when i saw its needle always point north no matter how i turned it the fact that it behaved in such a fixed way changed my understanding of the world until then i thought that one thing had to touch another to make it move i realized that something deeply hidden had to lie behind things
1926494 i dont want to be regimented like those poor people
1926495 yes but you sit there in the back row and smile and your mere presence here spoils the respect of the class for me
1926496 as a boy of 12 i was thrilled to see that it was possible to find out truth by reasoning alone without the help of any outside experience
1926497 what if i could ride alongside a beam of light
1926498 exceptional intelligence which enabled him to discuss with me a college graduate subjects far beyond the comprehension of so young a child
1926499 in aarau i made my first rather childish experiments in thinking that had a direct bearing on the special relativity theory
1926500 einsteins muse partner lover wife 16 years 1903 19 and finally antagonist
1926501 what do you make of einstein he always does something different from what i have ordered
1926502 he does indeed herr professor but his solutions are right and the methods he uses are of great interest
1926503 my son albert 22 unhappy with his present lack of position feels that he is a burden on us people of modest means i have taken the liberty of asking you to write him a few words of encouragement so that he might recover his joy in living and working if you could secure him an assistants position my gratitude would know no bounds hermann einstein
1926504 no matter how humble and despite my scientific goals and my personal vanity
1926505 when you pick up an application think that everything the inventor says is wrong
1926506 enforced my many sided thinking and also provided important stimuli to my thought s on physics
1926507 revolution in science new theory of the universe newtons ideas overthrown
1926508 einstein as a boy disliking a prussian style military parade
1926509 a lazy dog who never bothers about mathematics at all
1926510 for me einsteins work came as a tremendous surprise for in his student days einstein had been a lazy sluggard faulpelz he never bothered about mathematics at all
1926511 on a heuristic i e hypothetical point of view concerning the production and transformation of light
1926512 on the movement of small particles suspended in stationary liquids required by the molecular kinetic theory of heat
1926513 if einsteins theory should prove to be correct as i expect it will he will be considered the copernicus of the twentieth century
1926514 i much admire the work which einstein has published and think his work as being in the first rank
1926515 the future will show more and more the worth of einstein and the university which is able to capture this young master is certain of gaining much honour from the operation
1926516 world year of physics honoring the centennial of einsteins 1905
1926517 what matters to me is how the court overall is perceived and how if it was not kwame kilpatrick sitting in that seat if it was john six pack sitting in that seat what would i do and that answer is simple

1926527 god is no fonder of intellectual slackers than of any other slackers if you are thinking of becoming a christian i warn you that you are embarking on something which is going o take the whole of you brains and all
1926528 yet i fear upon examination we should find that most of you have not so much faith as the devil himself i am persuaded that the devil believes more of the bible than most of us do he believes the divinity of jesus christ that is more than many who call themselves christians do nay he believes and trembles and that is more than thousands amongst us do

1926572 menurut kitab tok boet tay coan dalam urutan racun kim gin hiat coa jatuh nomor tiga puluh tujuh
1926573 biarpun mereka bukan termasuk binatang beracun terlihai tapi mereka mempunyai satu keistimewaan ialah mereka suka sekali makan racun leng cie lan yang ditanam di luar jendela kamar hoejin yang mengandung racun sangat hebat dan sudah mengundang kedua ular itu
1926574 kim gin hiat coa adalah sepasang yang satu lelaki yang satu perempuan
1926575 tapi dengan menggunakan tay hong kam coe dan lain lain aku membakar gin koan hiat coa untuk menolong kawan hidupnya kim koan hiat coa mesti menghisap racun dalam tubuh hoejin sebentar sesudah berselang tiga jam aku akan membakar ular lelaki yaitu kim koan hiat coa dan ular perempuan pasti akan menghisap darah beracun dalam tubuh hoejin untuk menolong yang lelaki dan begitu seterusnya sehingga darah beracun habis dihisap

1926578 kau mempunyai begitu banyak murid tapi di waktu perlu hampir semua tak ada gunanya
1926579 kalau cim kouwnio penuju bocah itu terimalah di belakang hari mungkin sekali akan menjadi muridmu yang paling boleh diandalkan
1926580 syaratnya yaitu dia tidak boleh memikir yang gila gila menikah dengan coen jie

1926585 kim gin hoat coa suka makan racun dan begitu mengendus bau racun mereka bersuara dan meronta ronta
1926586 aku aku tak tahu arak itu beracun aku mengambil dari dapur
1926587 waktu kau datang kemari dari dapur apa kau bertemu dengan orang lain
1926588 ia menarik tanganku dan mengajakku omong omong sesudah itu ia membuka tutup poci dan mencium cium arak itu
1926589 dalam hal penyakitnya hoejin ada sesuatu yang sangat mengherankan dan tak dapat dipecahkan olehku baru sekarang aku melihat latar belakangnya coba pikir mengapa kedua ular itu menggigit kaki hoejin sekarang aku mendapatkan jawabannya sebabnya ialah dalam tubuh hoejin memang sudah ada racun dan racun itu mengundang kim gin hiat coa menurut pendapatku orang yang meracuni hoejin adalah orang yang menaruh racun di dalam poci arak
1926590 akulah yang sudah menaruh ular kelabang ke dalam arak mau apa kau
1926591 eh aku bertanya aku yang menaruh racun mau apa kau
1926592 semua lai laki bukan manusia baik baik aku memang ingin kamu mampus semua
1926593 tapi setan kecil itu keburu mengendus rahasia sekarang aku bersedia mengampuni empat orang tapi arak itu harus diminum oleh salah seorang aku tak peduli siapa yang mau meminumnya terserah pada kau setan tua
1926594 ngo kouw dan coen jie juga tak boleh boe kie tidak boleh boe kie seorang tuan penolong hanya perempuan kecil saja yang tiada sangkut pautnya denganku
1926595 seta cilik itu sangat licik mungkin sekali ia sudah menyediakan obat pemunah kalau ia yang minum secawan tak cukup dia harus minum kering sisa arak yang ada dalam poci
1926596 tapi waktu jiwaku sendiri terancam mereka berpeluk tangan jangankan menolong bicara saja mereka tak berani
1926597 sesudah aku mati aku minta pertolonganmu untuk mengantar adik kecil ini kepada ayahnya di puncak co bo hong apakah kau sudi melakukan itu

1926601 biarpun sang seng tong bukan kobokan naga atau sarang harimau kurasa seorang yang sepertimu takkan bisa keluar dari tempat ini
1926602 menurut pendapatku kecuali dengan obatku sendiri racun kioe pie wan tak akan bisa dipunahkan dengan apapun juga

1926620 ia sungkan mencelakakan kau tapi iapun tak mau mendustai guru sendiri

1926622 yo peh peh aku sudah memenuhi janji dan sekarang poet hoei moay moay sudah berada dalam tanganmu di sini saja kita berpisah
1926623 dari tempat yang jauhnya berlaksa li kau datang kemari untuk mengantarkan anakku tak dapat aku membiarkan kau pergi tanpa memberikan sesuatu padamu apa yang dikehendaki olehmu katakan saja dalam dunia ini tidak banyak yang tidak bisa didapatkan olehku
1926624 kau memandang kie kouw kouw terlalu rendah sungguh percuma kie kouw kouw mengorbankan jiwa untukmu
1926625 kie kouw kouw tidak memandang rendah kepadaku baru ia meminta pertolonganku untuk mengantarkan putrinya kepadamu
1926626 jika aku memenuhi permintaan itu dengan niat mendapatkan sesuatu apakah aku berharga untuk menerima pesanan kie kouw kouw
1926627 kau sudah membuang budi yang sangat besar kepadaku yo siauw adalah manusia yang selalu membalas budi dan sakit hati ikutlah aku dalam tempo setahun aku akan turunkan kepadamu beberapa ilmu yang jarang tandingannya di dunia ini

1926636 toasiok kalau dapat sekarang saja aku mohon kau mengantarkan aku pada mereka
1926637 bocah yang digigit anjing sudah sembuh dan ia datang untuk menghaturkan terima kasih kepada looya dan tai tai

1926650 ibadat macam itu adalah bidah hasanah bidah baik yang diberi pahala mengerjakannya kerana dalam amal ibadat itu terdapat suasana membesarkan nabi melahirkan kesukaan dan kegembiraan atas lahirnya nabi muhammad saw yang mulia
1926651 telah berlaku kebiasaan bahawa orang apabila mendengar kisah nabi dilahirkan maka ketika nabi lahir itu mereka berdiri bersama sama untuk meghormati dan membesarkan nabi muhammad saw berdiri itu adalah hal yang mustahsan bai kerana dasarnya ialah membesarkan nabi muhammad saw dan sesungguhnya telah mengerjakan hal serupa itu banyak dari ulama ulama ikutan umat
1926652 saya berpendapat tidak menjadi kesalahan untuk menyambut maulid apatah lagi di zaman ini pemuda pemudi islam semakin lupa dengan agama dan kemuliannya perlu juga diingat sambutan tersebut janganlah dicemari oleh perkara perkara haram dan bidah seperti pergaulan antara lelaki dan wanita tanpa batas kita juga tidak sewajarnya menjadikan sambutan ini sebagai satu tradisi yang khusus sehingga timbul dalam kefahaman masyarakat jika sesuatu acara tidak dilansungkan maka seseorang itu dikira telah berdosa dan melanggar syariat
1926653 semua telah sedia maklum bahawa sahabat sahabat rasulullah saw tidak merayakan hari kelahiran rasulullah saw ini adalah kerana mereka telah menyaksikan secara langsung setiap gerak geri rasulullah saw dan seterusnya ingatan terhadap rasulullah saw itu kekal di dalam hati dan juga ingatan sad abi waqas mengatakan bahawa beliau begitu ghairah untuk menceritakan mengenai rasulullah saw kepada kanak kanak sama sepertiman keghairahan mereka mendidik anak anak itu al quran oleh kerana mereka sering menceritakan sejarah perjuangan rasulullah saw maka tidak perlulah mereka merayakan sepertimana dirayakan maulid ar rasul kini walaubagaimanapun generasi terkemudian telah mula melupakan kegemilangan sejarah islam dan kesannya dengan itu perayaan maulid rasul ini diadakan bertujuan untuk mengingati sejarah islam ketika rasulullah saw masih hidup tetapi malangnya maulid rasul ini telah bercampur dengan amalan bidah yang ditentang oleh islam sebenarnya meraikan hari kelahiran nabi bermakna meraikan hari kelahiran islam maka dibolehkan meraikan maulid nabi ini dengan syarat tidak dicampur adukkan dengan perkara perkara bidah tetapi sebaliknya diisi dengan ceramah yang menceritakan akan sejarah islam
1926654 maka orang yang beriman kepadanya muhammad saw memuliakannya menolongnya dan mengikuti cahaya yang terang yang diturunkan kepadanya al quran mereka itulah yang beruntung
1926655 ini adalah hari peringatan pada hari serupa itu dikaramkan firaun dan pada hari serupa itu musa dibebaskan kami berpuasa kerana bersyukur kepada tuhan
1926656 di hari tersebutlah aku dilahirkan dan di hari tersebut jugalah aku diutuskan
1926657 jangan memperbesarkan mengenai aku seperti kristian memperbesarkan mengenai anak maryam
1926658 di hari tersebutlah aku dilahirkan dan di hari tersebut jugalah aku diutuskan
1926659 dan hendaklah kamu menjauhi perkara perkara yang diada adakan kerana setiap yang diada adakan itu adalah bidah dan setiap bidah itu adalah sesat
1926660 jika kamu benar benar mencintai allah ikutilah aku niscaya allah mengasihi dan mengampuni dosa dosamu sesungguhnya allah maha pengampun lagi maha penyayang
1926661 taatilah allah dan rasul nya jika kamu berpaling maka sesungguhnya allah tidak menyukai orang orang kafir
1926662 setiap ibadah yg tidak dilakukan oleh sahabat rasulullah saw maka janganlah melakukannya
1926663 demi sesungguhnya adalah bagi kamu pada diri rasulullah itu contoh ikutan yang baik iaitu bagi orang yang sentiasa mengharapkan keredhaan allah dan balasan baik hari akhirat serta ia pula menyebut dan mengingati allah banyak banyak dalam masa susah dan senang
1926664 umat lain akan meratah kamu dengan rakus sebagaimana orang orang yang mahu mengelilingi hidangan makanan
1926665 tidak bahkan jumlah kamu masa itu banyak sebagaimana banyaknya buih di permukaan air banjir

1926697 the more and more business they get in the store the more it seems like another fast food job
1926698 not in my wildest dreams did i see this coming
1926699 it could be that these men have greater access to mates maybe these men that have deeper voices have higher levels of testosterone or maybe theyre better hunters and theyre able to bring more food home to their wives
1926700 we found that the men actually thought the women with the lower pitched voice or the deeper voices were the better gatherers
1926701 i think this study does speak to the fact that voices are signaling some biologically relevant information to potential mates

1926704 a city laid out on apparently rational grounds where different specialized facilities are separated from one another across a vast terrain connected by motorways deprives its inhabitants of the pleasures of incidental discoveries and presupposes that we march from place to place with a sense of unflagging purpose but whereas we may leave the house with the ostensible object of consulting a book in a library we may nevertheless be delighted on the way by the signt of the fishmonger laying out his startled bug eyed catch on sheets of ice by workmen housing patterned sofas into apartment blocks by leaves opening up their tender green palms to the spring sunshne or by a girl with chestnut hair and glasses reading a book at the bus stop

1926716 no se les est dando la posibilidad de que exploren otras opciones legales para resolver su situaci n porque al aceptar una fecha de deportaci n los inmigrantes est n renunciado a sus derechos
1926717 espero que usted sepa corregir el rumbo de su pol tica econ mica pues si no lo hace las elevadas tasas de inter s la aceleraci n de la tasa de inflaci n el d ficit fiscal y de la cuenta corriente de la balanza de pagos la recesi n econ mica y el mayor desempleo provocar n el deterioro de la calidad de la cartera de la banca poniendo en peligro la estabilidad macroecon mica y el bienestar de todo el pueblo dominicano

1926719 la decisi n de la justicia dominicana complementada por ese grupo de opiniones totalmente independientes demuestra que la acusaci n de usted y algunos de los funcionarios de su equipo econ mico contra mi gobierno es totalmente infundada y politiquera
1926720 en mi gobierno tan pronto nos percatamos de la insolvencia de las tres entidades financieras que posteriormente colapsaron intervenimos para proteger a los depositantes y al sistema financiero
1926721 casi todos los expertos y organismos mencionados reconocieron que la decisi n de rescatar a los depositantes de los bancos quebrados se tom dada la elevada probabilidad de que de no hacerlo el resto del sistema bancario se contagiase dando lugar a una crisis sist mica que hiciese colapsar el sistema de pagos
1926722 las autoridades actuales del banco central podr an ratificarle si es o no cierto que 19 asociaciones de ahorros y pr stamos 3 bancos m ltiples y varios fondos de pensiones planes de retiro as como fundaciones organizaciones no gubernamentales e iglesias ten an dep sitos sustanciales en los bancos quebrados

1926727 cada a o miles de trabajadores haitianos son apresados en redadas y deportados a su pa s de origen y en el 2005 turbas armadas incendiaron casas y lincharon a muchos de esos inmigrantes
1926728 ahora el director general de migraci n doctor carlos amarante baret ha declarado que la presencia de los haitianos en la rep blica dominicana es insoportable
1926729 leonel fern ndez cuyo segundo mandato comienza el 16 de agosto ordena frecuentemente a la polic a que haga redadas y deporte masivamente a los haitianos que encuentren en las calles
1926730 de igual modo los inmigrantes haitianos y dominicanos radicados en nueva york se enfrentan a una situaci n igual por las redadas que hace la polic a migratoria de los estados unidos

1926800 one tick species making its way to new parts of the country is the deer tick ixodes scapularis the primary transmitter of lyme disease in eastern north america
1926801 recent data show that deer ticks now can be found from minnesota to florida from texas to maine and from kansas to virginia
1926802 that means lyme disease and or other diseases associated with the deer tick such as anaplasmosis may exist throughout all of those regions
1926803 medical doctors and veterinarians are finding that coinfections in both humans and pets are making treatment for tick borne diseases more difficult
1926804 with more ticks carrying more diseases screening your pet becomes all the more important
1926805 the deer have also been responsible for relocating ticks a raccoon might travel a few miles in a lifetime deer travel much farther
1926806 its wonderful that wildlife is coming back and that were preserving nature but a consequence is more ticks

1926818 the whole outworking of calvinism in life is thus but the efflorescence of its fundamental religious consciousness which finds its scientific statement in its theological system
1926819 he who knows that it is god who has chosen him and not he who has chosen god and that he owes his entire salvation in all its processes and in every one of its stages to this choice of god would be an ingrate indeed if he gave not the glory of his salvation solely to the inexplicable elective love of god
1926820 behold what manner of love is this that we should be called the children of god

1926826 if the law might be disannulled as to new creatures then why doth the spirit of god write it with such legible characters in their hearts now that which the spirit engraves upon the heart would christ come to deface and abolish
1926827 all who are united to christ and justified for his righteousness imputed to them are dead to the law as a covenant not that they may be without law to god but that they may be under the law to christ not that they may continue in disobedience but that they may be inclined and enabled to perform sincere obedience in time and perfect obedience through eternity to the law as a rule of life one design of their being delivered from the obligations of the law in its federal form is that they may be brought under the eternal obligation of it as a rule of duty in the hand of the adorable mediator
1926828 it is the contemplation of god and zeal for his honour which in it draws out the emotions and absorbs endeavour and the end of human as of all other existence of salvation as of all other attainments is to it the glory of the lord of all it begins it centers it ends with the vision of god in his glory and it sets itself before all things to render to god his rights in every sphere of life

1927066 as often as weve been critical of page during his decades of announcing from his bald pate to his irs problems to his mistakes made on air and anyone on tv and radio that much is an easy target this was one of his finest hours
1927067 im often asked what race drivers are like and i tell those who ask that they are living a life of desperate desperation meaning that they are wonderfully outgoing with their friends living a wonderful life and the desperation part is that somewhere they recognize that what they do other than any game or sport in the world there lingers this possibility

1927107 something good is going to happen to me everywhere i go i know gods blessings are chasing me favor is following me around

1927159 it was a friend who invited me to work in singapore i am very happy working here and very quickly fell in love with singapore i never thought of returning to the philippines
1927160 since the response has been so enthusiastic we hope to organize a similar event next year to encourage foreign workers and maids provide an opportunity for them to relax and mix with their fellow countrymen and women
1927161 look how happy everybody here is today the maids are enjoying themselves many employers have made the effort to be part of the event these show that the accusations of human rights watch are not true
1927162 do you even have a process you go through when making decisions or do you just wing it
1927163 look at the cool video we do on sunday morning
1927164 what is the standard for the church what are they using
1927165 the first indication that spiritual health is in decline is an absence of laughter
1927166 we discovered that if you miss sampling these storms then you miss truly understanding the sediment and chemical delivery of these rivers
1927167 i dont want to say that a typhoon is serendipity but you take what the weather provides
1927168 since taiwan has an average of four typhoons a year in summer you pretty much cant avoid them its not unusual for some of us to be out in the field when one hits
1927169 but with two to four typhoons happening in taiwan per year its not unreasonable to think that the amount of carbon sequestered during these storms could be comparable to the long term annual carbon flux for the country
1927170 what is the true budget of carbon being sequestered in the ocean per year if the majority of sediment and dissolved constituents are being delivered during these storms and the storms arent taken into account those numbers are going to be off
1927171 but if you want to build an accurate climate model you need to understand how much co2 is taken out naturally every year and this paper shows that those numbers could be off substantially
1927172 youd have to weather all the volcanic rocks in the world to reduce the co2 level back to pre industrial times
1927173 youd have to grind the rock into really fine particles and youd consume a lot of energy fossil fuels to do that so there probably wouldnt be any long term gain
1927174 i just want to focus my attention on our objective to win a medal and will make a decision after the olympics
1927175 the position of the coaches will be reviewed next month and i dont want to preempt anything
1927176 the climate change sensitive diseases and conditions are already creating huge burdens in many countries the impact of climate change can act as an amplifier

1927178 since the early 1990s a growing body of evidence from canada the u s and europe has documented increased rates of heart attack and more hospitalizations for serious heart diseases such as heart failure and stroke after both short and long term exposure to polluted air
1927179 now i try to say were going to concentrate on the north today
1927180 but when youve got hundreds or thousands of drivers out there doing it every day it adds up
1927181 theyre trying to turn every rock they can to cut fuel costs

1927183 make sure you do all can do so you dont have to go back next week
1927184 more companies are looking for help because drivers are complaining
1927185 theres no pressure when you are practicing alone unlike in competitions
1927186 however my feat in training has given me that self confidence and self believe ahead of the games
1927187 however in competitions i have not been making any impact with my seasons best being 579
1927188 but i have gained an insight and also received some tips from world class shooters during several competitions this year
1927189 i need to score 583 to make the top 10 and post around 586 to make the final of six shooters its tough but im not going to beijing to make up the numbers
1927190 there is a difference between choosing to serve and choosing to be a servant when i choose to serve i retain control about whom i serve and when i serve but when i choose to be a servant i have given up all rights and control

1927224 two weeks ago the kingdom attempted an offensive maneuver dropped one hundred squads in and around the city it was a nightmare thirty five squads down in the first ten minutes they called a retreat and everyone ran to their evac points either to find plague soldiers waiting or their copters taking off early we were stranded
1927225 we listened to the other squads cry out for help only to get no response we were to far to assist
1927226 the whole situation was fucked we found a place to stay and fortify as everything went down then we saw them squad of four plague infantry their squad leader not wearing a mask with silver crosshair on the breast of his camo
1927227 we had a squad we were close with that were killed during the retreat
1927228 taunted them as they killed them slowly for twenty minutes we listened to our friends scream cry and plead for their lives
1927229 our boys last words were a description of the squad leader behind it and a request to make him hurt
1927230 after a couple years in the marines i was approached with an offer to work for shroud corporation your so called plague so i did two years there after the revolution i ran been living here for a couple months now
1927231 i just need to pack a few things next door in the garage there should be an suv a weapon rack and a fridge grab what you need rest and start the truck we leave in forty
1927232 scout squad gunned down in the lt they were chasing a squad left behind by the kingdom during the last offensive

1927245 well why dont explain why it had to be so long
1927246 well id love to chat but i really think we should be going
1927247 well i had to splice video feed in order to get your boys into position and i had to hack the the defense system to be able to remotely set off the certain points of the self destruct system
1927248 okay in other words it took alot of computer work to make this shit possible
1927249 all units go to the southside of the complex were under attack
1927250 well tom those are pretty tough words coming from a guy who cant fight me
1927251 you shot me in a fist fight motherfucker feeling lucky enough to go another round

1927257 well kenn was rocking a pretty similar one as well
1927258 kenns is from a training accident about a year ago we were training we were always training trying to one up each other during a sword duel he jumped up when my back was turned i spun and barely caught him with my blade just enough to scar the kid
1927259 theres a colony coming up after that its just another two and a half hours until we get to the wall
1927260 steve seems to be doing well the other two im assuming are old friends as well
1927261 the one with the baseball cap is tony an old mentor of mine the other is anthony pinto another guy me and steve grew up with
1927262 not everything just enough to understand that where weve been the past couple years
1927263 anyway look at you youre looking pretty good for a guy whos been living alone in a war torn suburb for a couple months
1927264 yeah amazing what you find left behind in grocery and convenience stores canned or bagged tuna and bottled water can take a guy far and you you seem to be doing pretty well
1927265 brian leads a four man team to invade a military powerhouses base for a love interest
1927266 let the boy be you know hed do it for any one of us
1927267 all im saying is that this chick better be valuable
1927268 we both know that you wont always be here or be capable of protecting me
1927269 she was a techie ran computer work and logistics and shit
1927270 you mean to tell us that theres three guys wearing a bunch of dark ages styled armor and slaughtering thousands of soldiers and innocents
1927271 we mean to tell you that there are three guys out there on the loose that are composed of the same things nightmares are three men who could easily rule the world if they willed it
1927272 july 2009 the government begins funding a military powerhouse to head a secret project with the war in the middle east escalating and oil running dry conflict was inevitable and america wanted something every other country would not only not be able to match but fear after they made the weapon they realized they needed someone to use it the government began looking through their ranks for their soldiers best suited mentally and physically for the suits after three men wore chosen they underwent surgeries and training to make the suits an extension of their bodies the military powerhouse began investing millions of dollars in politics and communities of military families interests easily becoming a widely and thoroughly supported organization excuse me
1927273 sorry anyway soon enough world communication began failing and shroud declared the revolution in the us offering a new and glorious world to the public who would support them the government was taken aback by the move and even more by the support behind it by the public well the government went defensive created that so called kingdom in the northeast playing strictly defensively the shroud on the other hand had the last laugh they possessed the weapon that is the soldiers wielding the suits the government had spent so much on
1927274 no one really knows except for shroud corporations president and the users themselves
1927275 well each armor supposedly glows a different color between the sections of metal green is the leader named the guardian of war his armor isnt flat like the others instead having short spikes all over it that conduct green electricity he controls and forms into forcefields and walls blue is his left hand aptly named the ghost of war hes the smallest of the three with a more streamlined body designed for his ghostly capabilities his armor allows him to move faster than the eye can register sight and lets him become intangible you know any object passing through him as if he wasnt there red is the right hand the scariest of the three to run into directly hes reffered to as the savage of war his armor is the biggest and heaviest not made for subtlety one bit he is notorious for immense strength supposedly capable of lifting vehicles easily and breaking walls without effort as the story goes they enter a battlefield and eliminate everyone and thing within it except for one person whom they direct to run away and spread the story but and this is a big but they havent been seen since an event known as the betrayal which was almost a year ago
1927276 red during a battle of great strategic importance had a change of heart he turned on the other shadows and after a short struggle disappeared
1927277 well you were their tech consultant what happened to them
1927278 well the armor gives them superhuman abilities the resulting clash would not only destroy any and all things around the users but most likely kill them both
1927279 well before we leave i would like to make a phone call
1927280 so anyway steve here decides it would be a smart idea to
1927281 youve reached presque isle estates this is connor speaking how may i assist you this evening
1927282 yes im looking for an old friend i believe she is staying there
1927283 well what is the young misss name and ill be more than happy to look for you
1927284 yeah im sorry ill have to get back at you theres an emergency
1927285 i cant leave you guys alone for five minutes seriously
1927286 well where are we going after we get through the wall
1927287 your boys just came through here squad 33 brian and amber
1927288 hold your position in that colony soldier evac will arrive five minutes after next call then youre on for phase two
1927289 squad 33 of the first offensive the two were found survivors in the philadelphia area a hot zone
1927290 you have been assembled as a team to effectively apprehend any high priority targets that are dangerous to the kingdom tonight we have confirmation of two ex plague presumedly current plague members and three soldiers from the first offensive entering the city you will be put on surveillance duty with a hold for action when you have the green light you bring them down swiftly
1927291 the very first time i saw a picture of him i knew i was looking at the future
1927292 his eyes were a double zero there was just nothing there he was like an outrider of what america might become
1927293 a few killings on the south side of chicago and who notices
1927294 but as soon as you put them in a context where were not used to seeing them you get a somewhat more indelible act
1927295 here was this sort of teenage rebel it was a sign of what was happening in society
1927296 were not too happy about people making money out of it
1927297 its too close to home its like glamorizing some idiot
1927298 a boy feeling oppressed and downtrodden with no chance of making it and he takes the violent way out
1927299 i think that probably the impulses that drove charlie starkweather are similar to the impulses that drove the columbine killings
1927300 in a way its a very american thing its a very capitalistic thing we have folks capitalizing on the crimes to make a little money
1927301 he wanted her to sit on his lap when he was put in the electric chair
1927302 you are growing very quickly you need us to help you manage that growth to you are focused internally on project profitability and organizing your firm in a different way and we can help you with that as well
1927303 i will sail the darkness of the cosmos and use this planet as my vessel

1927309 i think were getting into better territory ive been very much focused on the fall in oil prices as a necessary ingredient to avoid recession to the extent that were getting that thats just great
1927310 what we need in this market is for the financial stocks to stabilize i think theyll stabilize well before the housing market fixes itself
1927311 this commodity pullback is very timely because i think it does take that stress point away from the market
1927312 how the west except for the u s ended slavery
1927313 you think you can lie and get away with it
1927314 maybe you can at the cato institute but not here on hnn
1927315 does the cato institute endorse it the book he asked in disbelief
1927316 the more violence was involved in the emancipation process the worse the outcomes were making a provocative case for peaceful antislavery strategies
1927317 were to inspire abolitionists in the united states and abroad and they helped change history
1927318 an estimated 50 000 slaves were also brought into the u s between 1807 and 1860
1927319 republicans promoted government spending schemes that resulted in skyrocketing taxes
1927320 tax rates in the region in 1870 were three or four times what they had been in 1860
1927321 although the war brought the end of chattel slavery the resulting death and destruction intensified the determination of former slaveholders and their allies to suppress blacks
1927322 the military strategy for abolishing slavery was no short cut
1927323 the idea that the federal government would protect blacks was an illusion because they were a minority and a minority isnt likely to control government in a democracy
1927324 some people have objected that the united states couldnt have bought the freedom of all the slaves because this would have cost too much but buying the freedom of slaves was not more expensive than war nothing is more costly than war the costs include people killed or disabled destroyed property high taxes inflation military expenditures shortages war related famines and epidemics the billions of dollars of union military expenditures during the civil war would have been better spent reducing the number of slaveholders and slaves accelerating progress toward total emancipation
1927325 s lavery was being eroded throughout the west by political trends and relentless agitation the process would have continued and perhaps accelerated without the civil war
1927326 there would have come a time much sooner than most people might expect when the combined effects of multiple antislavery strategies would have brought about the fairly peaceful collapse of confederate slavery if this seems doubtful just recall how a combination of pressures led the mighty soviet union to collapse and vanish from the map without a nuclear war
1927327 with 270 000 arabs in jerusalem there will be more tractors in jerusalem
1927328 this is not the first investigation not the second investigation not the third investigation not the fourth or fifth and i dont know if it will be the last so what who really cares
1927329 since my first days in the prime ministers office i have been forced to defend myself against ceaseless attacks on the part of self named justice seekers who have made the goal of deposing me one in which the ends justify all the means
1927330 you can get them in wood you can get them in stucco boy can you get stucco

1927332 the world will note that the first atomic bomb was dropped on hiroshima a military base that was because we wished in this first attack to avoid insofar as possible the killing of civilians
1927333 all major factories in hiroshima were on the periphery of the city and escaped serious damage
1927334 the thought of wiping out another 100 000 people was too horrible
1927335 it was the insistence on unconditional surrender that was the root of all evil
1927336 eliminated for all time the authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the people of japan into embarking on world conquest sic
1927337 more than two thousand times the blast power of the british grand slam which is the largest bomb ever yet used in the history of warfare
1927338 thousands of children trapped in the thirty three schools that were destroyed
1927339 the most powerful blow ever delivered against christian civilization and the moral law
1927340 when you deal with a beast you have to treat him as a beast it is most regrettable but nevertheless true
1927341 understanding the atomic bomb and the japanese surrender missed opportunities little known near disasters and modern memory
1927342 would not be as devastating to the city and the people
1927343 a post war myth 500 000 u s lives saved
1927344 history collective memory and the decision to use the bomb
1927345 is far worse than gas and biological warfare because it affects the civilian population and murders them wholesale
1927346 seizing the contested terrain of early nuclear history stimson conant and their allies explain the decision to use the bomb
1927347 the potsdam proclamation offered the military die hards in the japanese government more ammunition to continue the war than it offered their opponents to end it
1927348 it does seem very likely though certainly not definite that a synergistic combination of guaranteeing the emperor awaiting soviet entry and continuing the siege strategy would have ended the war in time to avoid the november invasion

1927380 its just not natural to want to step off a cliff backwards
1927381 but since ive gotten over the shock ive felt i have a responsibility to promote some conversation some discussion about this
1927382 in light of the long racial history between black and white the commission cant help but to wince at the notion of expressly sanctioning a practice that would have the effect of requiring an african american to relinquish his or her seat to a caucasian patron
1927383 race was a factor in the escalation of the situation
1927384 it creates a nice social environment when gentlemen give up their seats at the bar thats the way we like to do business its a courtesy to our female guests
1927385 this was absolutely different from simply asking us to give up our seats for some ladies

1927416 during the concert i was struggling with pride i was critically analyzing louies speech especially about grace i asked god to show me something glorious show me something more glorious than the heroes of old of the prowess of achilles in battle and his death of the perseverance and cunning of ulysses of heracles persistence and labors or the 300 spartans who defied an army of 3 million at the battle of thermopylae what is more glorious than moses parting the red sea or joshua conquering the promised land what is more dazzling than the miracles performed by jesus what about the kingdom of david and his victories after all it is jesus that claims to be god of gods king of kings and lord if lords louie did not speak about the glory of the universe nor did he speak about the mysteries of the atom this time he spoke about a sinner named ashley who repented he spoke about grace then i understood that the grace of jesus christ that leads men to repentance more glorious than any of these i tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety nine righteous persons who do not need to repent

1927483 there is no unity of command in afghanistan a sensible coordination of all political and military elements of the afghan theater of operations does not exist there is no single military headquarters tactically commanding all u s forces

1927515 men and women to join their organization who are ready to fight for their country and protect their people
1927516 those who have gone before me to defend freedom and democracy around the world
1927517 the military protects your freedom from those who would take it
1927518 i disagree more and more of my freedoms are disappearing through actions initiated by the government that claims to represent me
1927519 i stay very well informed on such matters and i agree many areas of the government have overstepped their constitutional authority and damaged or taken some of your freedoms however the military did not take those illegal actions other areas of the government did
1927520 agreed but earlier you claimed unequivocally that the military protects my freedom you have agreed with my assertion that my freedoms are quickly disappearing therefore i can conclude that the military despite their claims to the contrary is not protecting my freedom the military may not have the authority to counter other rogue elements of the government that threaten my freedom but that fact is irrelevant what is relevant is the fact that my freedom is not being protected and you claim the military is protecting my freedom im not so much upset that the military cant through legal restrictions defend my freedom as i am that they claim they do protect my freedom when the military claims to protect my freedom they do so without listing any qualifiers or exceptions therefore the military and its supporters are promoting a lie
1927521 the military protects and defends the us constitution in obedience to its
1927522 i disagree many areas of the government have damaged taken and continue to threaten my liberties guaranteed under the us constitution you have previously agreed to this claim but the military makes no effort to protect or rectify these abuses it cannot do so because it lacks the legal authority to interfere in the activities of other areas of the government yet the military claims it does protect the us constitution and therefore protects the individuals safeguarded by that document clearly as these examples prove the military does not and can not the military is telling a lie
1927523 in addition the military continues to execute acts of war against other states without the declaration of by doing so the military actively participates in an illegal unconstitutional action how can the military be defending the constitution at the same time it is actively violating it the military may be excused for not having the authority to question or refuse participation in such illegal actions it is in effect impotent but by not having this authority to refuse participation it is clearly unable to take steps that would stop such an action the military claims to defend the constitution without offering any qualifiers or exceptions therefore this unequivocal categorical claim is a lie
1927524 the military protects your freedom when it is legally allowed to do so

1927880 kalau puisinya udah menarik pembacaan itu sudah nomor dua penyair besar kita amir hamzah dan chairil anwar kita nggak tahu baca puisinya bagus kek jelek kek dan bahkan gunawan mohamad tak pernah baca puisi konon dia malas dan nggak suka sapardi konon kata orang baca puisinya tak bagus tapi mereka itu penyair penyair terbilang ya dari puisinya itu sendiri
1927881 itu yang disayangkan oleh subagyo sastrowardoyo puisi yang membunuh puisi pamflet itu ketika seorang penyair tidak puas dengan keadaan dia bermain di luar aturannya sebagai penyair kita harus berani dalam hukum nah rendra itu orangnya melanggar hukum kepenyairan
1927882 itu jangan berubah jangan lantas kau berteriak oiii maling kamu ketika kau berteriak maling kau udah keluar dari puisi yang terjadi adalah interjeksi biasa itu bukan ucapan penyair itu ucapan masyarakat biasa atau itu polisi kau bukan puisi tapi polisi kau udah keluar dari norma puisi melanggar hukum kau
1927883 nah semua itu kan ada benang merahnya aku penyair yang melihat benang merah bukan melihat keadaan sehari hari yang kecil kecil itu itu bukan pekerjaan aku maka aku tetap melihat puisi sebagai suatu norma yang harus di jalur hukum itu tidak ada kecemasanku yang membuat keluar dari tangan puisi muncul di tangan realitas aku tetap dengan kata kata
1927884 ada juga penyair yang bilang gua mau buat sajak emang buat performance sajak ini kalau dibaca begini aja jadi kurang wah tapi jadi menarik kalo dibikin perfomance
1927885 mestinya ada suatu ajang yang representatif ada di tuk teater utan kayu red sekali sekali tapi penampilan itu selalu tak dianggap representatif mestinya ada di tim untuk mencari lagilah bakat bakat baru yang muda muda
1927886 kalau ajang baca puisi itu hanya pada acara kebangkitan nasional pada event seperti itu tak ada unsur sastra
1927887 dari koran koran nasional atau daerah itu kan juga bisa didapat siapa yang berbakat diundang tujuh atau delapan orang kemudian dari situ dapat dilihat apakah ada sesuatu dari mereka yang memesona
1927888 pertama tama tentulah kita harus disenangi kelompok ini sudah jelas tapi bagaimana kau bisa begitu hebat sehingga kau seperti air seperti air yang dibuat es kau bisa mengisi kotak ini kotak itu semua kotak bisa terisi olehmu itulah kehebatannya kau sebagai penyair itu usaha bagaimana melampaui kotak kita
1927889 orang tak bilang ah dia kan penyair asing ah dia kan orang inggris kotak ideologinya telah lepas tak peduli apakah ia islam atau kristen yang penting karyanya
1927890 dalam puisi yang kau cari ya itu berkahnya itu berkah itu lewat dari langit pada langit kebakatan itulah muncul berkah itu langit kebakatan itu hanya bisa dipertajam dengan pengalaman hidup dengan pengalaman orang lain dengan ketulusan dengan konsentrasi dengan sentuhan sentuhan kewahyuan
1927891 sebelumnya datang begitu saja misalnya bagaimana kau tahu sakit pinggang bisa diobati dengan kumis kucing nenek moyang kita tahu dari mana dia nggak studi dan nggak ada laboratoriumnya ilham datang hanya dengan dipertajam dengan kepekaan
1927892 itu lagi masalahnya tentu dalam hal ini kita tidak boleh bergegas mereka kan masih muda mana tahu nanti muncul atau memang tidak semua begitu ada juga yang bagus
1927893 joko pinurbo kan juga menemukan dengan caranya sendiri meski kadang kadang bisa kering sitok pun punya caranya walaupun terlalu banyak ornamen banyak hiasan afrizal kadang kadang konsep konsepnya terlalu abstrak

1927935 the balanced scorecard retains traditional financial measures but financial measures tell the story of past events an adequate story for industrial age companies for which investments in long term capabilities and customer relationships were not critical for success these financial measures are inadequate however for guiding and evaluating the journey that information age companies must make to create future value through investment in customers suppliers employees processes technology and innovation
1927936 modern businesses depend upon measurement and analysis of performance measurements must derive from the companys strategy and provide critical data and information about key processes outputs and results data and information needed for performance measurement and improvement are of many types including customer product and service performance operations market competitive comparisons supplier employee related and cost and financial analysis entails using data to determine trends projections and cause and effect that might not be evident without analysis data and analysis support a variety of company purposes such as planning reviewing company performance improving operations and comparing company performance with competitors or with best practices benchmarks
1927937 a major consideration in performance improvement involves the creation and use of performance measures or indicators performance measures or indicators are measurable characteristics of products services processes and operations the company uses to track and improve performance the measures or indicators should be selected to best represent the factors that lead to improved customer operational and financial performance a comprehensive set of measures or indicators tied to customer and or company performance requirements represents a clear basis for aligning all activities with the companys goals through the analysis of data from the tracking processes the measures or indicators themselves may be evaluated and changed to better support such goals

1927947 the change of religion did not always succeed in eliminating castes the converts carried with them their castes and occupations to the new religions the result has been that even among sikhs muslims and christians casteism prevails in varying degrees in practice their preachings not withstanding casteism has thus been the bane of entire indian society the difference in its rigidity being of a degree varying from religion to religion
1927948 though christianity also does not recognize caste system there are upper and lower caste among christians

1927990 no puede justificarse sino en el caso de que aquellos a quienes se concede el privilegio ofrezcan garant as afianzadas por una selecci n y una disciplina rigurosas
1927991 1 se necesita que en cada pa s exista una normativa que imponga como condici n para el ejercicio profesional la matriculaci n en una entidad p blica creada por ley colegio consejo orden dirigida por los profesionales dichas entidades tendr an en esencia estas funciones a organizar la matr cula la cual es indispensable para ejercer la profesi n b definir el campo de actuaci n en que el profesional tiene el deber y derecho para intervenir como tal c ejercer el control del ejercicio profesional desde el punto de vista deontol gico o tico y ejercer la potestad disciplinaria cuando se vulneren los respectivos deberes tambi n promover mecanismos que permitan mantener en los profesionales adecuado nivel de excelencia t cnica d elaborar el c digo de principios derechos y deberes ticos que se deben cumplir por los profesionales e facilitar el acceso a la asistencia profesional a quienes carezcan de suficientes recursos para solventar su costo 2 se deber tender a que los sistemas de habilitaci n para el ejercicio profesional sean compatibles entre los diferentes pa ses 3 la matr cula profesional habilitante en el pa s donde el profesional recibe su t tulo universitario ser en principio reconocida por los dem s pa ses miembros para la efectivizaci n de ello ser necesario previamente acordar y armonizar en cada profesi n los sistemas de acceso a dicha matr cula teniendo en cuenta el principio de equivalencia de nivel acad mico
1927992 la obligatoriedad de la colegiaci n de los abogados resulta la mejor garant a de la libertad e independencia de los abogados que debe entenderse rectamente m s que como un privilegio profesional como un imperativo del servicio que han de prestar a los ciudadanos nuestros colegios o agrupaciones se constituyen en la mejor fortaleza frente a las tentaciones de interferencia de los poderes p blicos o f cticos al tiempo que permite compatibilizar la exigencia de los deberes deontol gicos del buen hacer profesional sin que a trav s de ella se merme la libertad e independencia del profesional que garantiza al ciudadano una aut ntica defensa
1927993 ciertamente que los colegios y agrupaciones profesionales son instrumentos para la representaci n y la defensa de los intereses de sus miembros y para la ordenaci n del ejercicio profesional pero junto a esas misiones desempe an otras como las relativas a la formaci n profesional y al establecimiento y control de la deontolog a lo que redunda en directo beneficio de quienes utilizan los servicios del profesional e incluso desarrollan una funci n social en cuanto catalizadores de problemas sectoriales que detectan primero y m s f cilmente por vivirlos d a a d a urgiendo su soluci n antes de que se produzcan crisis casi irreversibles capaces de preocupar a la opini n p blica y pol tica
1927994 segunda convenci n nacional de entidades profesionales universitarias de la rep blica argentina
1927995 primero se ha llegado a la conclusi n de que la colegiaci n legal con el control de la matr cula y el ejercicio de la potestad disciplinaria por los directos interesados constituye garant a indispensable para el libre ejercicio de las profesiones universitarias segundo si la vida el honor la seguridad la salud y en general el orden el bienestar y la paz de la sociedad depende en gran medida de las prestaciones profesionales pretender que ello no requiera una adecuada reglamentaci n significar a ignorar una realidad que no exige mayor demostraci n que la de su propia existencia
1927996 sexto el sistema de colegiaci n no vulnera el derecho de asociarse y la correlativa libertad de no hacerlo porque se trata precisamente del estatuto legal de una estructura social preconstituida por la naturaleza de las cosas en el que no se impone a los profesionales la formaci n de una sociedad distinta de aqu lla a la que se incorporan por el solo hecho de inscribirse en la matr cula y ejercer su profesi n y esa comunidad se formaliza para la disciplina y el mejor resguardo moral del ejercicio profesional s ptimo los alegatos que sit an la colegiaci n obligatoria como un medio para asegurar la responsabilidad y la tica profesionales deben considerarse fundamentales en la idea de que dicha colegiaci n representa una exigencia del bien com n
1927997 el estado tiene la facultad para reglar y limitar el ejercicio de las profesiones por causa de utilidad general y que la reglamentaci n de su ejercicio no altera un derecho cuando s lo se le imponen condiciones razonables que no lleguen al extremo de constituir una prohibici n destrucci n o confiscaci n siendo razonable imponer la afiliaci n obligatoria a un colegio profesional pues la afiliaci n hace a la forma de actuar del profesional y no a los requisitos habilitantes sustanciales

1928028 i gave all my fat clothes away to my fat friends
1928029 jehovah i would like to know what the difference is between the light of your truth and the darkness of satan
1928030 it requires but one skill you see they have learned to feed each other while the greedy think only of themselves
1928031 are you kidding me look at this guy i dont see how you can drink his blood without getting a dui for flying away afterwards
1928032 but if i dont watch what i eat ill get fat
1928033 he had vision and drive and he knew what he wanted you just felt he knew how to go about getting it and making it happen
1928034 we were very proud that we were a married couple and running a business together
1928035 what we do know is gary tried to get away
1928036 five bullets for five men gary managed to put the van into drive it lunged onto pleasant street but veered into parked cars and trees gary toppled out of the van and into the road where a college student found him and called police
1928037 i dont think i slept through the night for four years after he died
1928038 it was like firing a cannon at close range in a persons body
1928039 not having gary there i couldnt figure out what to do next
1928040 i didnt have the vision he had the store closed in 1990 another march loss a final end to the passion for music the couple once shared meanwhile garys fathers health continued to deteriorate the family is convinced his death in 1998 was caused by the stress of his sons
1928041 you just get stronger with time as to what you can deal with
1928042 when you lose somebody like that and theyre so young and you see this person whos only 45 you kind of want to get a glimpse of them
1928043 hes made statements he wishes he could take back what happened but he cant
1928044 i cant just walk away from it my heart wont let me
1928045 why do christians sometimes say jesus and sometimes they say god
1928046 im feeling eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh
1928047 he played an instrumental vital part in the philadelphia rock scene
1928048 going to see this band that i had heard about called robert hazard and the heroes
1928049 and they just ripped it up they were all dressed in black with red accents it was a macho stripped down lean mean attack machine
1928050 they were playing their tight and solid new wave rock with the musicians in line behind their fearless leader and rocking the hell out of the downtown crowd
1928051 theyd move back and forth as a unit raising the energy of the crowd with each and every step it was a talented group of players and roberts songs and stage presence were not to be denied
1928052 i didnt really play guitar till much later in my teens i would audition at coffee houses like the second of autumn and the edge
1928053 i never got a job but learned about acoustic music by hanging out at these places listening to eric andersen chris smither jimmy webb and other great songwriters and poet guitar players
1928054 fought this dichotomy he was known for one thing but that was really not his essence his soul he was a folky rootsy guy
1928055 the stripped down acoustic concerts i did with my buddy michael pilla i thought these were the most rewarding and the most appreciated by my audience
1928056 gina cobb is proof that not all lawyers deserve the death penalty
1928057 i have told you these things so that in me you may have peace in this world you will have trouble but take heart i have overcome the world
1928058 there was no evidence in general no evidence of excessive force being used
1928059 i cant get down to the specifics of what we did or did not find in the autopsy
1928060 its more of like a passive investigation where well gather police reports and newspaper accounts we will be monitoring the county investigation
1928061 in a progressive society the people cannot allow overzealous poorly trained police officers to commit murder against innocent citizens
1928062 we demand that the officers involved in the death of andre thomas be relieved of duty until a complete investigation has been conducted
1928063 no comment regarding this case will come from this council due to the fact that the incident you are referring to is under investigation by the county police and district attorneys office
1928064 we were harmed by the very people who took an oath to protect us
1928065 they were the reason we bought this house because it had a big yard for them to run in
1928066 cheye and trinity we support you friends and citizens of berwyn heights
1928067 i was completely stunned because those dogs didnt hurt anybody they barely bark
1928068 what do you want us to come in this weekend
1928069 two roads diverged in a wood and i i took the one less traveled by and that has made all the difference
1928070 artificial intelligence to extend and improve the existing monitoring system
1928071 we aim to achieve all day and all weather monitoring capability
1928072 when you are ready you will send me an email i will know

1928075 if you really want to get anywhere in your life youll give up that silly idea
1928076 well their lives sucked so let us pay them peanuts then they must be happy
1928077 they dont need more than a couple dollars a day they dont know any better they have enough money to buy a bowl of rice and theyre happy
1928078 successful people dont whine about their circumstances they go out and try to change them
1928079 the atlanta fire department is battling a steeple fire on a church believed caused by lightening at mcdaniel st and ralph david abernathy
1928080 children children i used read the homer price donut story when i was a boy
1928081 well id rather you go because the pizzas are going to that group in the back there and im afraid they might get rowdy their pizza is late theyve been drinking a lot of beer and have been yelling a good bit steve will go with you
1928082 chucky chucky chucky gimme some pizza where my pizza at
1928083 i know i am you little bastard now keep your damned hands out my mask
1928084 i cant believe this isnt the most loved song in the world
1928085 i should be playing another sport i should stop playing for peanuts it is not fair that i need a day job as a fireman to support my family at least on the day i have a tournament i should have the day off
1928086 he was a hall of fame human being a lot of good players didnt want to teach anybody else or help them with their game he always did
1928087 it is unfair that the ceo earns so much and the teacher earns so little
1928088 it is unfair that the coal miner earns so little while the baseball player earns so much
1928089 the children of that generation may well be considered the most self indulgent and selfish that our country has ever known
1928090 any decisions we make that affect atlanta could affect every other airport in the country
1928091 i dont really like the idea of people coming here with weapons and carrying them into terminals but thats their right as citizens of the state of texas
1928092 if airports think guns should not be allowed they should have the right to modify their security plan to reflect that
1928093 there is no justification for permitting firearms at any airport
1928094 you might like to have a gun in your car because you come home on an 11 30 p m flight
1928095 while i am mildly excited for the golf the grab a is what has me really stoked its a shame that i have to fly half way across the country and play lousy golf just to get in some good grab a but if thats the way it has to be sign me up is it wrong well if this is wrong i dont want to be right
1928096 okay so does everyone else do this weird thing too
1928097 a leader will know their job is done when people stand up and say i can do it myself
1928098 mommy i on da boat on da wader da bug bit me
1928099 mommy i was on the boat on the water and the bug bit me
1928100 there will be no more php 4 releases regardless of whether there are security issues found in php 4
1928101 now more than 3 years after the last major php 4 release it is time to die down with hardly any support for oo sub standard xml support and generally lots of other suckyness as well its time to focus on the future php 6 so please die php 4 and quickly today august 7th 2008 is the last release of php 4 php 4 4 9 after today there will be no more php 4 releases regardless of whether there are security issues found in php 4 its time to upgrade now
1928102 wordpress works just as well with php 5 as 4 and there are no features on the roadmap including ones on your list that would require php 5 the only reason for us to break php 4 compatibility would be political and our users without the ability to upgrade their server would be the ones who lose wordpress doesnt make php 4 interesting or not its agnostic

1928106 they have to play like that otherwise well kill them
1928107 elbows were raised i dont know if they were trying to make us injured for the olympic games
1928108 i dont know when australia and the u s have ever met and it has not been physical
1928109 i dont think we left the game feeling like it was any more physical than when we played russia or latvia
1928110 it was physical it was just another game to us it was just another 40 minutes of basketball
1928111 it got very physical but it certainly was not one sided
1928112 any time you put the best teams in the world against each other its going to get competitive its going to get as physical as the rules allow and as the officials allow
1928113 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
1928114 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
1928115 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

1928118 vmware lab manager 3 gives us much more flexibility in the way we deal with a global lab environment it simplifies administration supports multiple networks and lets us assign resource pools and manage user access rights for all of our teams from a central location vmware lab manager has quickly become the industry standard virtual lab automation solution used by software development and testing teams worldwide said raghu raghuram vice president of products and solutions vmware this new release expands the appeal of vmware lab manager to more groups of people at our customers by promoting effective self service combined with centralized it control
1928119 the pastor phelps project is a tacky bit of filthy sodomite propaganda with no literary merit and zero redeeming social value masquerading as legitimate theatre
1928120 in nature as a result of sexual conflict females often experience harassment from males which can be costly
1928121 in the presence of males females actively select areas of high predation risk but low male presence and thus trade off increased risk against reduced sexual harassment
1928122 sure its boyish humor perhaps to wish for something like that but at the same time its something people feel very strongly about theyre concerned about where he would take the nation
1928123 wait in the yellow box for the next available librarian
1928124 each cannot live without each other and would rather die if one or the other die

1928126 those of us working in the community sector over the past few years have watched the poverty and disadvantage swell and rise along with the property values of our citys real estate homelessness was a dire problem 10 years ago it is now scandalously out of control and urgent intervention is now required

1928142 a lot of college students take only a survey course in american history and even those who major in history know nothing about jews
1928143 but i dont think you can understand american history without understanding them
1928144 jews have had a profound role in shaping america even though theyve never been much more than 3 percent of its population
1928145 especially in those articles where a specialist in a particular field sums up an aspect of american jewish life in a small space and in articles on subjects hard to find elsewhere
1928146 linds was asked to pose for a photo with katy but she said she wouldnt do it
1928147 the revenue generated from these advertisements goes to artists labels and other rights owners
1928148 you get music for free and the artist gets fairly paid
1928149 i can think of three or four outcomes we might see there might be free content thats used to stimulate demand for the other things like concerts and t shirts there might be free ad supported content or there might be a model where you buy the songs but it will not be the rigid pricing model that we see today or lastly it might be a model where payment is on a per play basis rather than a per purchase basis

1928161 at least evidentiary value in the mens rea criminal intent determination for genocide the most significant crime karadzic has been indicted for
1928162 the violent nationalism of radio broadcasts political journals speeches interviews and manifestos have been fair game for the office of the prosecutor to make their cases in the last decade in both the yugoslavia and rwanda tribunals why should poetry perhaps the most powerful maker of myth and in the yugoslavia context a great mover of dangerous men and women be any different in the eyes of international law
1928163 consistent pattern of conduct relevant to serious violations of international law
1928164 the concept of the first amendment microphone for me comes from slam poetry
1928165 it is a microphone and a space to say whats really on your mind your real freedom of speech and expression its open to art of any kind as long as it is thoughtful and not derogatory
1928166 when i can uphold the freedoms that we were originally founded on freedom of speech freedom of religion and freedom of assembly for starters i do know that there will be things said on the microphone that might be offensive to some people or to make them uncomfortable so i open the evening with the first amendment microphone to allow those more sensitive people or those with little children to leave if they want before it begins
1928167 oh yah i use to hook up with so and so all the time

1928171 great thoughts do not nourish small thoughts as parents do children
1928172 like the eucalyptus they make the soil beneath them barren

1928174 ryans work evokes both the cryptic moral clarity of the delphic oracle and the decontextualized self reflexiveness of conceptual artist jenny holzers
1928175 may the wind always be at your back the sun upon your face and one day you shine amongst the stars
1928176 when we know ourselves when we see that god is the reason for our groaning then we achieve an insight that gives us confidence in the greatest and deepest sadness we see death in the light of life we justify god who by his spirit causes us to groan in this tent we see the necessity of death and of the no in transitoriness they are needed to free a place as they do their work true life comes closer we are closer to the goal of being clothed upon with our heavenly dwelling

1928179 ive begged my dad for the mercedes g wagen but
1928180 about hometowns and heartbreak born out of images from growing up in central and northern alberta
1928181 she was demanding that attention be given to her immediately
1928182 she took sharon by the shoulders and pushed her out of the way sharon stumbled
1928183 sharon was attacked by someone in the community who supposedly represents a higher degree of human decency
1928184 victoria osteen never attacked her never tried to get in the cockpit
1928185 the aggressor and the person who was out of control who flipped out was ms brown
1928186 they will say this is about money but that is the only remedy a jury can offer
1928187 i hope the day comes that you return to your wife and daughters and your country and youre able to be a provider a father and a husband in the best sense of all those terms
1928188 they chose to make this a test case but they never imagined that it would result in such a stunning rebuff
1928189 the government attempted to inflame the emotions of the panel
1928190 asking for 30 years to life not only was ill advised and wholly inappropriate but was also soundly rejected by the panel
1928191 it was all for show if mr hamdan does not go home in december
1928192 i would like to apologize one more time to all the members and i would like to thank you for what you have done for me
1928193 i can reassure you that the defense department is hard at work on this issue
1928194 the decision showed what the jury thought hamdan was worth
1928195 there is a perception that trying people in front of the military was going to be a rubber stamp process
1928196 this shows they are conscientious following instructions and are making rational decisions
1928197 its true there are work opportunities in yemen but not at the level i needed after i got married and not to the level of ambitions that i had in my future
1928198 i personally present my apologies to them if anything that i did has caused them pain
1928199 you have found him guilty of offenses that have made our world extremely unsafe and dangerous
1928200 the government asks you to deliver a sentence that will absolutely keep our society safe from him
1928201 the problem is the law was specifically written after the fact to target mr hamdan
1928202 we were harmed by the very people who took an oath to protect us
1928203 they were the reason we bought this house because it had a big yard for them to run in
1928204 cheye and trinity we support you friends and citizens of berwyn heights
1928205 i was completely stunned because those dogs didnt hurt anybody they barely bark
1928206 she gave me a big hug and she said if the police shot your dogs dead and did this to you how can i trust them
1928207 i dont want people to feel like that i just want them to be proud of our police and proud to live in prince georges county
1928208 everything you can think of we have done it physically we the coaches have put all weve got to get them ready it is how they cope with their emotions at that moment that will determine their fate
1928209 it is not just tough for malaysia but for the other countries as well if our players concentrate on their own game they have a good chance to beat their opponents
1928210 it makes no difference whether we have it easy or tough in our opening matches you need to beat everyone to become a champion
1928211 our pairs must not let even the smallest of differences between themselves affect their game its also important that everyone stays together all the time once we check into the games village there my advice to them is to stick together even during meal and resting times
1928212 the third rider needs to have good endurance as he will have to maintain the high speed right to the finish line
1928213 i fought hard to win this position because i knew it was my only chance to take part in the olympics this time
1928214 i know i could have had a chance to create history for the country if the 1km time trial was not dropped but thats in the past my goal now is to help the team set a new national record in beijing
1928215 we have been combining well in training in valencia the olympic track is a fast one and we have a good chance to crack the record again
1928216 while we cannot hope for a medal in the team sprint it will be great if we can finish ahead of a few other teams provided we clock our best time
1928217 this is my first olympics and everyone will be in their best form but if i get my chance i will surely make a dash for it
1928218 saya ditawari partai untuk jadi calon di pilkada bogor lalu garut pokoknya banyak deh saya tolak semua

1928225 pasar masih memiliki kekuatan yang melekat sekali sekalipun pendapat permintaan menyusut diterima di sana masih cukup unsur untuk memjaga harga dari penurunan terlalu jauh
1928226 secara keseluruhan pasar masih di sebuah persimpangan jalan para pelaku pasar berada antara kekhawatiran berlanjutnya pelambatan permintaan energi dan potensi untuk gangguan pasokan lebih lanjut
1928227 jika dipandang dari sisi hukum maka permintaan anggota kongres as itu jelas jelas merupakan campur tangan orang asing terhadap hukum indonesia filep dan yusak itu adalah warga negara indonesia kelahiran papua yang dihukum antara lain karena mengibarkan bendera bintang kejora yang oleh kelompok tertentu dijadikan sebagai lambang perjuangan kemerdekaan papua di persada indonesia
1928228 apa maksud kedua orang itu mengibarkan bintang kejora jika bukan untuk tujuan perjuangan memerdekakan papua lepas dari pangkuan ibu pertiwi indonesia
1928229 saya menilai apa yang disampaikan para anggota kongres as itu lebih banyak bermuatan politik ketimbang hukum negara indonesia anggota kongres itu bertindak berdasarkan pandangan hak azasi manusia pertanyaannya adalah hak azasi mana yang dilanggar indonesia terhadap warga negaranya filep dan yusak
1928230 janganlah kita memperjuangkan kepentingan politik disintegrasi bangsa dan negara ini dengan mengenakan
1928231 maksud hati dua warga papua ini mungkin baik yaitu menyatakan kebebasan berpendapat tetapi caranya saja yang salah kebebasan berpendapat bisa dilakukan dengan cara lain seperti menulis surat berdialog dan berdiskusi tetapi bukan dengan mengibarkan bintang kejora yang oleh sekelompok orang dijadikan lambang perjuangan kemerdekaan
1928232 kita tidak boleh gentar melawan langkah langkah politik yang dilakukan para anggota kongres as yang meminta presiden sby membebaskan dua narapidana politik filep karma dan yusak pakage kita sebagai bangsa yang berdaulat tidak boleh didikte oleh negara mana pun dalam hal penerapan hukum positif di dalam negara republik indonesia

1928245 its not like were not running well because we are
1928246 weve just had some circumstances that havent gone our way youll have that
1928247 in nine years weve won four races if you cant be counted as a factor after that i dont know when they do count you as a factor
1928248 when you have a day like we had last year at the glen and the laps that we were ahead of jeff we could drive away from him a little bit it makes you feel good
1928249 i know what it should feel like to go fast
1928250 were working way way too hard for these types of finishes
1928251 irreconcilable differences for the end of the couples six year marriage the pair have three children together including twins born in 2005
1928252 hes done a good job were six games over 500 since he took over weve got a long way to go offensively but hes really laid the groundwork for some of the right stuff offensively the guys like playing for him
1928253 i think were real close said gaston who managed the blue jays to consecutive world series titles in 1992 93
1928254 weve just got to get some guys back who are on the dl and maybe if we can add here and there i think we certainly have a chance id like to be a part of it thats great
1928255 we were just fortunate that he was there ricciardi said
1928256 we were just really lucky that no one else had hired him he was the right guy at the right time we never had any doubts that hed be back
1928257 cito is going to have a big hand in what kind of staff we have here ricciardi said
1928258 its important that hes comfortable with the staff i think bringing gene tenace and nick leyva here was important to him at that time well see how it goes
1928259 i cant wait to get back to america and triumph over another boxing legend calzaghe said in a statement thursday
1928260 i have had lasik surgery and have been wearing lasik lenses which have a hard center and flatten out at the end he said after withdrawing
1928261 i had got some infection in there and my doctor said that i needed to let my eyes rest by keeping the contacts out
1928262 he gave me cortisone and steroids which were very painful and it was annoying and difficult to be to trying to fight a tough golf course and have my eye aggravating me at the same time
1928263 i love the pga championship and i hate to not be continuing but i have got to get ready for the ryder cup said perry who turns 48 on sunday
1928264 when mayweather floyd mayweather jr was on top before he retired i wanted mayweather margarito is the best welterweight out there right now so i want margarito
1928265 i love the challenge ive always been that way wanted to be the best so if hes the best fighter im going after him
1928266 i want to let the world know that im the best fighter even today he said
1928267 back in my good old days in the early 2000s i displayed that and i want to do it again before 2010 want to let people know that im truly a legendary fighter
1928268 for maybe a year or two i felt like i lost something but now im really motivated
1928269 remember what i did to vernon forrest and what vernon forrest did to you mayorga speaking through a translator told mosley
1928270 and as we go through the preseason we will start a different quarterback in a different game smith said thursday
1928271 thats the plan right now were going to make sure that all of our guys have an opportunity to play with the first unit its an open competition for those guys and this will be the first opportunity for them
1928272 i think itll be a good test for our offense right now we just need to go out and compete i dont think it means anything weve got four quarterbacks here so you just go out and compete and see what happens
1928273 i think everybodys a little excited heading in to jacksonville ryan said
1928274 for me itll be good just to get one game under my belt and then ill start to feel more comfortable
1928275 when they tell me to go in the game ill go redman said
1928276 absolutely not im not going to waste my energy trying to explain this its awesome
1928277 i think a lot of us who supported the independent board thought it would provide more rigorous financial accountability but this doesnt sound like a very responsible use of the taxpayers dollars
1928278 we want to be very conservative with this committee chairman michael adams said of the beer ads
1928279 though we dont think this type of advertising is appropriate for college sports we have tried this once before in this country and it didnt work very well
1928280 alcohol and college sports are a bad mix the letter said
1928281 beer promotion during college sports telecasts undermines the best interests of higher education and compromises the efforts of colleges and others to combat sometimes epidemic levels of alcohol problems on many campuses today
1928282 we find it puzzling that ncaa advertising rules prohibit ads for cigarettes other tobacco products organizations promoting gambling and alcoholic beverages yet continue to allow ads for beverages with alcohol content of 6 percent or less beer the top alcoholic drink of college students the letter said
1928283 given the devastating problems caused by underage and excessive drinking much of it in the form of beer this policy makes little sense and flouts the core values of sports and learning
1928284 i think weve taken a very sensible very rationale very conservative approach and weve asked that any company that advertises alcohol during our games continue to include the message drink responsibly on its ads adams said
1928285 i think weve taken about as a conservative an approach as any sport in the country while not everyone agrees 100 percent i think we represent what is a good balance in that opinion
1928286 our bylaws lump together names images and likenesses and the names are being used now so well have to go back and look at this brand said
1928287 we will need to go back and look at our options we certainly are not giving up our model of amateurism
1928288 i got these because i think the message is great and also the colors are great too but the elastic ankle cuffs are a little too small now im worried that my chubby ankles and pro abstinence stance are not compatible would recommend to a friend that had smaller ankles and also was not allergic to the yellow dye

1928299 no in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us for i am convinced that neither death nor life nor angels nor rulers nor things present nor things to come nor powers nor height nor depth nor anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of god in christ jesus our lord
1928300 the dozens of seagulls that plagued fridays game returned tonight but the brewers combatted the problem saturday night with gus the wonder dog from wisconsins waterfowl association gus was used between innings to scatter the birds and he was successful in keeping them off the field
1928301 they had to bring in the dog to chase the birds then they had a guy with a shovel chasing after the dog to clean up after him that was pretty embarrassing id have to say
1928302 and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul
1928303 because he hath set his love upon me therefore will i deliver him i will set him on high because he hath known my name he shall call upon me and i will answer him i will be with him in trouble i will deliver him and honour him with long life will i satisfy

1928305 i havent ordered my playoff tickets yet the question is now why bother who wants to pay 10 and endure mid august weather to see this team get the snot kicked out of them the only reason to go to the ballpark this half has been to see the other team the other team and it doesnt matter who it is has more talent plays better defense smacks the ball around and generally gets to fatten their stats chalk up an easy win and laugh at the bad news travs

1928307 i had always heard that people in northwest arkansas think it is better than central arkansas and vice versa

1928311 were assuming for now that adam is a starter and thats whats dictating his rehab but if a glaring issue should arise in our bullpen then wed certainly entertain the idea
1928312 for the record however i would like to confirm that i strongly stand firm on my findings
1928313 he was initially attended to by another female doctor but subsequently referred to me as the patient requested to be examined by a male doctor
1928314 through my experience i have encountered many similar complaints and i therefore proceeded with the appropriate examination on the patient
1928315 i would like also to stress that i have no knowledge of the person responsible for leaking the report to any third party
1928316 i also pointed out to him that certain facts which has not been discussed in the previous meeting were introduced in the typed statements
1928317 the facts i queried was why the name of dato seri anwar ibrahim appeared in several paragraphs when it was never brought up during the first interview neither did the patient ever confide in me the identity of the alleged perpetrator
1928318 he asp rosmi replied that anwar is the accused and i already by then knew anwar was the accused after reading the newspaper
1928319 as i did not want to have any issues with the police
1928320 she asked me to explain all over again and i complied by explaining everything that i knew in detail the whole procedures in relations to the examination on the patient
1928321 at the onset of the interview she impressed upon me that i will be charged if i refuse to cooperate with the police
1928322 the seemingly constant and unending police investigation and being aware of the high profile nature of the case has disturbed me tremendously and i become worried for my safety and that of my family
1928323 approximately one week after the third visit by the police i decided to apply for leave and left malaysia with my family

1928338 kalau kita ingin berkahwin secara islam saya sanggup memeluk islam tetapi kita terpaksa berhadapan dengan dua perkara pertama mengikut hukum islam kita boleh dikenakan 100 sebatan sebagaibalasan dosa kedua masyarakat islam akan mencemuh dan meminggirkan kita kerana mempunyai anak diluar nikah yang kita hasilkan bersama kita akan berasa amat malu lebih lebih lagi awak yang berpendidikan agama sanggup kah kita saya rasa saya tidak sanggup menghadapinya
1928339 kalau kita berkahwin secara agama saya awak hanya perlu untuk menukar agama dan kita akan terlepas dari dua seksa pertama mengikut agama saya kita hanya perlu untuk membuat pengakuan di hadapan paderi di gereja untuk menghapuskan segala dosa kedua masyarakat agama saya akan menganggap anak kita ini senasib dengan jesus nabi isa yang dilahirkan tanpa bapa mereka juga akan menganggap awak senasib dengan mary mariam yang melahirkan nabi isa maka kita pasti tidak akan dipersia saya rasa ini option terbaik buat kita

1928342 no one has greater love than this to lay down ones life for ones friends
1928343 to the ancients friendship seemed the happiest and most fully human of all loves the crown of life and the school of virtue the modern world in comparison ignores it we admit of course that besides a wife and family a man needs a few friends but the very tone of the admission and the sort of acquaintanceships which those who make it would describe as friendships show clearly that what they are talking about has very little to do with that philia which aristotle classified among the virtues or that amicitia on which cicero wrote a book
1928344 the intense emotional and affective relationships described in the past as
1928345 hence in our cultural context where homosexual desire has for centuries been considered sinful unnatural and a great evil the experience of homoerotic desire can be very traumatic for some individuals and severely limit the potential for same sex friendship
1928346 the more one has to assure oneself that ones relationship with another man is not homosexual the more conscious one becomes that it might be and the more necessary it becomes to protect oneself against it
1928347 there is no friendship between men that has not an element of sexuality in it however little accentuated it may be in the nature of the friendship and however painful the idea of the sexual element would be but it is enough to remember that there can be no friendship unless there has been some attraction to draw the men together much of the affection protection and nepotism between men is due to the presence of unsuspected sexual compatibility
1928348 nations have no permanent friends and no permanent enemies only permanent interests
1928349 anyone can play the harmonica but only a few can actually master it
1928350 because of concern at the high level of public misunderstanding about the drug and its effects
1928351 herceptin is promoted as the magic bullet for early breast cancer treatment
1928352 people used to think and many still do that her 2 positive breast cancer can and will be cured by herceptin
1928353 we wish that was true but the evidence just isnt there and people need to know that at its best 87 women in every 100 taking herceptin get no benefit from the drug at all and may be harmed by it
1928354 in that context and given the ability of dhbs to improve health through other interventions it would have been concerning if pharmac had come to dhbs and asked that the 12 month treatment be funded

1928436 as simple as possible while still solving the general case with a nice api iff youre good at api design and are working on a well understood problem and not figuring out the problem as you go and conforming to the complex constraints of the libraries used uh so that generally means er not very simple at all

1928498 how do those no good dirty rotten amp get away with this
1928499 its not the governments job to bail out speculators or those who made the decision to buy a home they knew they could never afford
1928500 yet there are many american homeowners who could get through this difficult time with a little flexibility from their lenders or a little help from their governmen
1928501 this means that many families who are struggling now will be able to refinance their loans meet their monthly payments and keep their homes
1928502 arm loans are not inherently good or bad they are a tool just like a hammer is a tool a hammer can be used to build amazing structures or beat someone to death it isnt the hammer that is bad its the person using it
1928503 its bold so watch out people may actually take notice of us

1928509 over the past couple of months a small group of people has been working on reverse engineering the r500 based amd video cards
1928510 the continuation of the project has surprise surprise slowed to a halt
1928511 the client could not be an integral part of the early development meetings within our office not for any overt official reason or specific issue of confidentiality but rather our backstage team interactions rely heavily on our familiarity with each other
1928512 allowing the client into the process would be an insightful experience for both parties at least at a later stage of testing and feedback and its something we will hopefully be doing
1928513 two weeks after we took the job on he seemed to change his mind after having agreed in earlier meetings to everything we had asked of him because we left him with nothing in writing about what he was getting only verbal we had no way of controlling the situation
1928514 several of my jobs are now stuck on the awaiting copy phase its a morale eroding situation
1928515 it the previous ai was missing some business like data analysis for example an analysis of sales incremental sales etc
1928516 are you going to use arpu as a sales target in the future this would allow you to compare and contrast campaign effectiveness
1928517 the beauty of ar is that you can just go again and try tweaking something else

1928520 robert what a great and wonderful mess you have made i have rarely seen such a huge puddle of milk well the damage has already been done would you like to get down and play in the milk for a few minutes before we clean it up
1928521 you know robert whenever you make a mess like this eventually you have to clean it up and restore everything to its proper order so how would you like to do that we could use a sponge a towel or a mop what do you prefer
1928522 you know what we have here is a failed experiment in how to effectively carry a big milk bottle with two tiny hands lets go out in the back yard and fill the bottle with water and see if you can discover a way to carry it without dropping it

1928534 theres just something about this place at another school the kids might be nice to sophie but they wouldnt be her friends
1928535 that means she loves the school because she loves me
1928536 the friends are why we have to make this work at

1928544 oh okok i think i know its like going to your house right
1928545 it is a big strong line up perhaps one that lacks a little creative finesse but which is capable of addressing arnolds fear about the serbians forest of tall timber
1928546 people have realized that the complete removal of the feminine element from the christian message is a shortcoming from an anthropological viewpoint it is theologically and anthropologically important for woman to be at the center of christianity
1928547 that there may be an increase in the number of those who as volunteers offer their services to the christian community with generous and prompt availability

1928553 the call came over the dormitory just like always and i knew they were ready for me
1928554 there was no use fighting it they gave me some pills that made me drowsy and then they wheeled me up to the operating room
1928555 and havent missed more than three days of work theres nothing wrong with me except my lack of education
1928556 ill never understand that they took a lot of my life away from me having children is supposed to be a part of the human race
1928557 i lay in bed and cried because i couldnt give him a son
1928558 he said it didnt matter but as years went by he changed we got divorced and he married someone else
1928559 and they were all doctors like me who tried to think biologically biology as the foundation of medical thought we didnt want politics we were critical of politics but concerned with the way human beings really are not just an idea or philosophy
1928560 and to make matters even more complicated id go so far as to argue that it is not at all obvious whether or not e we know what a justification for morality is
1928561 f we have criteria for determining good justifications from bad ones
1928562 g morality is the sort of thing that even needs justification in the first place h it is only a particular conception of morality which inclines us to think that morality requires justification i there are alternative conceptions of morality available
1928563 in short i think that the entire situation is far more complicated than posts such as this one indicate and the complications are immensely important
1928564 may do evil things with the conviction that they are in accord with the natural history and biology of man and that one is acting as healer and savior
1928565 are you asserting that genetic and hence functional superiority and survival of the fittest are no longer considered to be important to evolutionary theory
1928566 scientifically speaking minimizing genetic diversity might lead to evolutionary problems in the future we may have already cut down the normal sort of natural selection that acts on wild animals by allowing the slow the old and the weak to stay alive when they would have died in the wild but in a world with very little genetic diversity natural selection might indeed be stopped altogether and thus only artificial evolution through technology would be able to allow us humans to cope with a changing environment modern eugenics designer children author unknown
1928567 my life in refugee camp is better than burma but i do not have opportunities to go outside of my camp
1928568 we are refugees and our dream is to go back home
1928569 we have no peace in burma now the possibility for us is to go to third countries
1928570 most people do not want to have to move to third countries they would rather move to their home villages in safety and security
1928571 all countries in the world have to come together and work together for change in burma
1928572 the perfect 10 you dont have to say anything to describe it the perfect 10 you were perfect
1928573 why why is it needed it attracted so much attention the perfect 10 was something that was cherished
1928574 i thought it was crazy to take it out a humongous waste i still feel that kind of in this way maybe selfishly
1928575 something needed to be done to try and make it more fair
1928576 im always thinking about that you can still strive for perfection in the b score
1928577 im always thinking how to get closer to a 10 on that part
1928578 the 10 is what you dreamed of as a kid you were always trying to reach a 10 you dreamed youd do a routine so awesome youd get a 10
1928579 but im pretty happy with the system ive gotten comfortable with it
1928580 you could sit down and look at a rule book for four years and probably still wont get it
1928581 its like half of my routine that i do now and i thought it was hard
1928582 it makes it harder but at the same time i think it makes it more fun because it brings out the best in you and brings out the most difficult things in gymnastics
1928583 man kandice you have an opinion on everything dont you
1928584 no thank you were on our way to view the mosque
1928585 its a shame that the hagia sophia closes so early have you seen the cisterna basilica yet its still open
1928586 yes thats one of the things ive wanted to see
1928587 let me show you where the entrance is its just a block from here
1928588 i know but it is really no trouble and will save you some time how long are you in turkey for
1928589 the entrance is just here make sure that you walk through all of the passages some people just go into the cisterna take a look and then come back up there is a whole passage to follow and youll see the pillars of minerva and eventually come out about a block down the street
1928590 ill wait for you at the exit in case youd like to have a glass of tea and see our showroom there wont be any pressure for you to buy anything but as long as youre in istanbul you should get to know what types of things are on sale
1928591 thank you but were not buying anything today if we buy anything it will be on our last day
1928592 i didnt say anything about buying anything after all no one needs to buy a rug but this will just give you a chance to get educated and no museums or mosques will be open at that time anyhow and it will be too early for dinner
1928593 did you get to take any pictures can i see them
1928594 and now maybe you would honor me by taking some time to have a glass of tea relax and learn about turkish carpets my shop is just 20 meters this way
1928595 come sit down let me explain the different types of rugs to you and educate you so youll know a good rug from a cheap one here have some tea
1928596 you know no one comes to turkey to buy a rug its not something that you need yet most people end up buying one why because its art its something they decide that they like and its something that they will have and enjoy for the rest of their lives a good rug will last for over 100 years
1928597 you know we really do need to replace the rug in the dining room sometime as well as the rug in rosies our daughter room but we do not need to purchase a rug at this time
1928598 if you could have one of these rugs and if you didnt have to pay for it can you see any of them working in your room
1928599 you have very good taste that rug is 100 wool look here thats how you can tell that they dyes are natural and not artificial look at the weave this is how you can tell it is not machine made it takes someone three to four months working full time to make a rug like this
1928600 i know that you are not looking to purchase a rug in the summer i would start off with a price of around 3 000 for this rug and we would easily sell it for more than 2 500 but if you were interested at all id offer you this rug at 1 800
1928601 thank you but we really are not interested in purchasing a rug right now
1928602 nearly everyone who comes to turkey is not interested in buying a rug but you know nearly everyone who comes ends up buying one because they find something that they really like something that is going to last them the rest of their lives and something that they will forever remember their trip to turkey with
1928603 is there any price where if you could own this rug for that price you would walk out of here happy
1928604 yes and you may end up not purchasing one but is there any price where you would say i am happy to buy that rug
1928605 i guess if i could have that rug for 800 id probably be happy
1928606 this is a rug that i would be selling in the summer for over 2 500 but you know
1928607 you are a very lucky young lady to have a father who has the means and the desire to purchase something like this for you that you really want i hope you appreciate him
1928608 wait a minute thats a line that ive used in sales training before that comes right from joe girardi
1928609 im in education but i used to sell and i used to train sales people
1928610 i think we can come to a deal how about 1 500 for the rug
1928611 i just cannot sell it for 1 000 lets say we have a deal at 1 100
1928612 oh this is the reciprocation technique dont feel that you need to reciprocate only purchase if you want the item
1928613 once a reliable democratic voting bloc never forgot what they considered a slight
1928614 anti abortion views stemming from his roman catholic faith clashed with the partys platform and powerful constituencies
1928615 mr caseys appearance would be an important signal to catholics
1928616 use his choice of a vice presidential running mate to reassure roman catholics
1928617 conservative catholic legal scholar at the pepperdine school of law
1928618 he was supporting mr obama because his platform met the standard of justice and concern for the poor the church has always defended
1928619 put them in conflict with millions of lay catholics for whom abortion is a nonnegotiable issue
1928620 its the kind of reason we will be able to explain with a clean heart to the victims of abortion when we meet them face to face in the next life which we most certainly will if were confident that these victims will accept our motives as something more than an alibi then we can proceed
1928621 that is a tough standard for mr obama or any supporter of abortion rights to meet
1928622 republicans are gearing up campaigns to depict mr obama as a radical on the question of abortion
1928623 dramatic act of historical rectification that would resonate with catholics
1928624 speak out in favor of legislation now before congress to provide financing for alternatives to abortion like free prenatal care and adoption assistance
1928625 kita telah memberi alibi dan nama mereka kepada pihak polis sewaktu siasatannya
1928626 kita mahu melihat bagaimana mereka pihak pendakwaraya akan menjalankan pendakwaan dan kita harap mereka akan menggugurkan kes tersebut
1928627 the task of realizing the independence of tibet has fallen upon all tibetans in and outside tibet
1928628 all work of the government shall not be approved without the consent of the dalai lama
1928629 sometimes 100 or 200 tibetan guerrillas went as far as 100 miles into the area occupied by the chinese
1928630 the 17 article agreement was imposed on tibet under armed force
1928631 owing to han immigration the tibetans have become a minority in tibet
1928632 the communists in tibet force women to practice birth control and abortion
1928633 the dalai lama may return but only as a chinese citizen
1928634 we have but one demand patriotism and we say that anyone is welcome whether he embraces patriotism early or late
1928635 the dalai lama is welcome to come back he can go out again after his return
1928636 now whether the dialogue to discuss and settle problems will be between the central government and tibet as a state or tibet as a part of china this is a practical question
1928637 essentially tibet is a part of china this is the criterion for judging right or wrong
1928638 chinas sovereignty over tibet brooks no denial of tibet there could be no independence nor semi independence nor independence in disguise
1928639 at present so large a number of hans are pouring into tibet that many young tibetans cannot find jobs this adds a further element of instability in the tibetan society therefore new riots are quite possible
1928640 the central governments policy towards the dalai lama has been consistent and remains unchanged we have only one fundamental principle namely tibet is an inalienable part of china on this fundamental issue there is no room for haggling the central government has always expressed its willingness to have contact with the dalai lama but he must stop activities to split the motherland and change his position for tibetan independence all matters except tibetan independence can be discussed
1928641 over the past several hundred years as far as i know at no time has any foreign country denied chinas sovereignty over tibet
1928642 britain be the weaponry supplier after total independence of tibet
1928643 tibet accept british envoys supervision of tibetan financial and military affairs in return for britains support of tibetan independence
1928644 britain be responsible for resisting the army of the republic of china when it reaches tibet
1928645 tibet adopt an open policy and allow freedom of movement of the british
1928646 when i met lon chen shatra in gyantse i advised him to bring down all the documents which he could collect bearing on the tibetan relationship to china in the past and on the formers claims to the various provinces and districts which had from time to time been occupied by china
1928647 however china may still send its high commissioner to lhasa and maintain an escort army of no more than 300 soldiers
1928648 government of china refuses to recognize any agreement which his majestys government and tibet might conclude independently either now or in the future
1928649 the united states is ready to recognize tibet as an independent and free country
1928650 it was the imperialists who taking advantage of the tibetan peoples antipathy to the qing dynasty and the reactionary kuomintang government attempted by enticement deception and instigation to get the tibetan people to separate from the motherland and come under their oppression and enslavement
1928651 the central government will not change its decision on postponing reform in tibet and in the future when the reform is conducted the policy to be followed will still be one of peaceful reform
1928652 for nine years the hans have not dared to touch our most glorious and sacrosanct system when we attacked them they could only parry our blows without being able to strike back so long as we transfer a large number of troops to lhasa from outside the hans will surely flee at the first blow if they dont run away we will carry his holiness the dalai lama to shannan and gather our strength there to launch a counter attack and seize back lhasa if all these efforts fail we can go to india
1928653 i was told that after its return from studies in the hinterland the song and dance ensemble under the tibet military area command has a very good repetoire i would like to see its show please arrange it for me
1928654 the military area command is planning to poison the dalai lama
1928655 reactionary evil elements are carrying out activities endangering me under the pretext of ensuring my safety i am taking measures to calm things down
1928656 the unlawful activities of the reactionary clique cause me endless worry and sorrow as to the incidents of yesterday and the day before which were brought about under the pretext of ensuring my safety and have seriously estranged relations between the central peoples government and the local government i am making every possible effort to deal with them
1928657 let no unwholesome talk come out of your mouth but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs that it may benefit those who listen
1928658 with man it is impossible but not with god with god all things are possible
1928659 take courage it is he who will save you he who will pull you through
1928660 without faith it is impossible to please him because he who comes to god must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly and diligently seek him

1928671 the highway as anybody can see is operating over capacity at the peak times
1928672 this will provide that additional capacity and also during a hurricane evacuation we could reverse flow the lanes and get folks away from this area a lot quicker

1928683 and usually we have someone in the area i tried to explain that to the referee and he just told me he didnt understand what i was talking about
1928684 but we really didnt work that much on it but its definitely something were going to have to work on in the future we have to adjust to that and we have ways of doing that
1928685 i shook his hand after the game and told him that he just said he was glad to get the chance to play that much

1928696 tribal sovereignty must mean that the place to resolve intertribal disputes is the tribe itself
1928697 the establishment of black slavery in the cherokee nation as in the united states was an evolutionary process antoine bonnefoy a french
1928698 he could not be adopted into the family of a cherokee and his wounds probably kept him from being considered desirable as a slave
1928699 gave him over to the young people who killed him and took his scalp
1928700 i am going back next summer and pay old shelby a visit and take all his negroes
1928701 this institution was derived from the whites it has all the general characteristics of negro slavery in the southern portion of our union in such a state of society as we find among these indians there must of necessity be some modifications of the system but in all its essential features it remains unchanged
1928702 the advent of slavery on a larger scale had been accompanied by unique problems concerning the conduct and legal status of slaves this condition was partially alleviated by the enactment of a series of slave codes since the cherokees were in the process of accepting the white mans civilization it is not surprising that they also adopted his slave codes the first of these acts was apparently passed in 1819 as the result of a runaway blacks trading a stolen horse to a cherokee the act read november 1st 1819 in committee the national committee have taken up the case submitted to them by the council relating to the exchange of horses between otter lifter and a runaway negro man belonging to wm thompson the horse delivered to otter lifter by said negro man was proven away from him and the question submitted to the committee was whether or not the master of the negro man wm thompson should be accountable to the otter lifter for the horse so proved away from him on account of the transgression of his said negro man the committee therefore have decided that wm thompson ought not to be accountable for the contract entered into with his runaway negro man by any person contrary to his approbation and resolved by the committee that no contract or bargain entered into with any slave or slaves without the approbation of their masters shall be binding on them
1928703 that any person or persons whatsoever who shall trade with any negro slave without permission from the proper owner of such slaves and the property so traded for be proven to have
1928704 real white people and what few i have seen of them looked like mulattoes and i would never have anything to say to them
1928705 the cherokees did not experience the inner conflict between the practice of slavery and conscience that permeated much of the united states
1928706 black slaves in the west were sometimes the recipients of harsh and brutal treatment the following letter from the cherokee agent in arkansas to the secretaty of war graphically illustrates such conditions
1928707 the work performed by cherokee slaves varied little from that done by slaves in the southern states
1928708 slavery in the nation was different in one respect cherokee slaves did not always enjoy the holidays and laying by time that slaves in the united states did
1928709 the slaves quarters usually consisted of windowless log huts with dirt floors a stone fireplace supplied warmth and heat for cooking slaves usually did their own cooking from rations periodically issued by the master or overseer
1928710 they avery vann family were kind to their slaves and gave orders that they were not to be whipped or abused john naw a son in law disregarded these orders and tried to whip an old slave named uncle joe who cut john naw in two with a bowieknife naw died and uncle joe was mobbed by a gang of men and beheaded and his head stuck on a pole

1928714 http www cherokeebyblood com constitution htm member http thorpe ou edu constitution cherokee index html the november 28 1866 amendments to article lll of the constitution were approved and adopted by a convention of the cherokee people at tahlequah all native born cherokees all indians and whites legally members of the nation by adoption and all freedmen who have been liberated by voluntary act of their former owners or by law as well as free colored persons who were in the country at the commencement of the rebellion and are now residents therein or who may return within six months from the 19th day of july 1866 and their descendants who reside within the limits of the cherokee nation shall be taken and deemed to be citizens of the cherokee nation
1928715 cherokee slaves frequently reacted to their status by running away exhibiting defiance stealing and malingering runaway slaves who frequently headed back east were sometimes hunted with dogs in order to identify their property some cherokee masters branded their slaves many slaves had no last names others took their masters names some never knew their parents others were sired by their masters or members of their masters family black women were sometimes sold for refusing to become pregnant some masters sought obedience by regularly taking one or more of their slaves to witness hangings black women were usually expected to do the same work as men they were lashed and ran away just as the men did some slaves became drivers and overseers mothers were sometimes sold away from their children a few slaves purchased their freedom

1928734 mereka tidak bangga dengan islamnya bagi mereka islam hanyalah sebuah tradisi malah ada yang berani menggadaikan keislamannya hanya agar bisa berganti kewarganegaraan
1928735 jika orang jerman ditanya apa yang mereka ketahui tentang islam maka mereka akan jawab islam identik dengan yang berbau arab jadi persis seperti sebuah simbol operasi dalam matematika islam arab mereka belum tahu kebesaran islam yang sebenarnya
1928736 aku tinggal di sebuah rumah mewah dengan ibu dan ayah tiriku
1928737 kala itu aku punya segalanya rumah mewah mobil uang dan berbagai macam jenis mainan canggih
1928738 ceritanya satu hari aku ikut kawan kawan pergi berenang nah saat melompat ke kolam aku terpeleset dan jatuh tidak sempurna akibatnya punggungku mengalami retak berat dan kepala berbenturan hebat dengan dasar kolam cederaku cukup parah hingga ayah segera melarikanku ke rumah sakit
1928739 nak janganlah banyak bergerak sedikit saja salah bergerak bisa menyebabkan cacat nantinya
1928740 operasi berjalan selama lima jam dan aku siuman selepas 3 hari saat terjaga tangan kananku sulit digerakkan namun entah mengapa aku merasa orang yang paling bahagia di muka bumi ini bahkan kepada dokter kuberitahukan bahwa aku tidak peduli dengan cedera yang kualami aku justru bahagia allah masih mengizinkanku hidup
1928741 dokter mengatakan aku harus tinggal di rumah sakit selama beberapa bulan
1928742 kecil memang tempatnya hingga aku musti tidur di dapur tapi itu tidak masalah bagiku aku merasa bahagia sangat bahagia persis seperti kala terjaga dari siuman di rumah sakit selepas kecelakaan hebat itu
1928743 aku bisa maklumi karena mereka hanya tahu islam dari media yang cenderung memojokkan islam
1928744 perubahan itu tentu saja tidak serta merta secara halus dan perlahan aku melakukan dakwah di kelas tentu saja bukan dengan ceramah agama sikap dan tingkah lakulah yang banyak membantu mereka mengenal islam percaya tidak kini aku bahkan punya ruang shalat khusus padahal akukah satu satunya siswa muslim di sekolah itu
1928745 mereka baru tahu ternyata islam punya adab atau tata tertib dalam hidup yang menarik bagi mereka islam tidak ekslusif tidak mengelompokkan diri dalam kelompok kelompok khusus seperti di sekolahku ini
1928746 tujuan aku buat film adalah untuk menunjukkan kepada kalangan non muslim bagaimana islam yang sebenarnya jauh dari apa yang ditampilkan media selama ini mudah mudahan film film itu bisa mencerahkan pandangan mereka
1928747 bibel adalah rangkaian kata inspirasi seorang lelaki yang berasal dari tuhan
1928748 where were always open 24 hours a day and always plenty of free parking
1928749 aku belajar agama dari kelompok yahudi orthodok di sinagog rumah ibadah kaum yahudi red demikian pula pendidikan formal juga di sekolah orthodok
1928750 belakangan sejak kenal internet aku jadi suka chating dari situlah bisa kenalan dengan berbagai macam kalangan suku dan agama
1928751 aku menaruh perhatian sangat spesial dengan islam kami saling bertukar info tentang tuhan nabi moral dan nilai nilai agama perlahan aku jadi tahu banyak tentang islam ternyata islam adalah agama yang penuh damai begitupun aku belum bisa menghilangkan imej buruk tentang islam misal ketika kudengar ada serangan teroris sama seperti yang lainnya aku menuding islam itu ekstrem
1928752 dari diskusi itu aku yakin islam juga mengajarkan respek damai dan toleransi
1928753 entah mengapa pandanganku sangat cocok dengan pandangan islam aku bahkan menduga kitab perjanjian lama misalnya telah banyak diubah diubah semata mata untuk kepentingan materi
1928754 hal menarik lainnya yang membawaku makin condong ke islam adalah kebenaran ilmiah yang ada dalam al quran kandungan ilmiah al quran luar biasa misal quran menceritakan bagaimana kejadian manusia yang berawal dari sperma manusia asal mula kehifupan manusia sebagaimana diceritakan dalam al quran itu jauh sebelum ilmu pengetahuan ditemukan
1928755 al quran juga menyatakan bagaimana gunung gunung dibentuk dan berbicara tentang lapisan atmosfir ini semuanya hanya beberapa dari begitu banyaknya penemuan penemuan ilmiah yang telah ada dalam al quran 1400 an tahun yang lalu jauh sebelum penemuan penemuan ilmu pengetahuan saat ini inilah salah satu kunci atau faktor yang menghantarku menemukan kebenaran dalam kehidupan
1928756 sungguh sangat sulit bagi mereka jika tahu aku telah berganti keyakinan jujur saja keluarga dan sanak famili semua sayang padaku apa reaksi mereka kala mengetahui anak laki laki kesayangannya telah masuk islam karena itu sementara waktu aku tak bisa leluasa memperlihatkan kehidupan islam secara sempurna dalam kehidupan harian namun aku bersyukur kepada allah diberikan kekuatan hingga tetap bisa menunaikan shalat lima waktu dengan lancar khusus shalat saya berjuang untuk tidak meninggalkannya
1928757 paling kurang aku bisa tetap memelihara keyakinan pada allah beberapa hal lain secara fisik lumayan sulit mengekspresikannya di khalayak ramai
1928758 aku belum mendapatkan kesempatan untuk mengucapkan syahadah dengan disaksikan khalayak ramai meskipun begitu aku telah bersyahadah di hadapan yang maha menyaksikan yakni allah swt nanti ketika umurku sudah cukup dan dianggap dewasa untuk bepergian sendirian maka aku berniat untuk melangkah ke mesjid insya allah hal terpenting saat ini adalah meningkatkan kualitas diri iman
1928759 semuanya demi dan untuk allah aku berharap sepanjang waktu yang ada bisa mengerjakan apa yang allah maui dari hamba nya
1928760 keluarga saya menyusun opini bahwa saya sudah keluar dari yahudi saya diperingatkan dengan memeluk islam kehidupan saya akan sulit karena islam bukan bagian dari amerika dikatakan mereka dengan ber islam maka saya akan diasingkan dari keluarga dan masyarakat
1928761 jujur saja pada masa itu saya belum begitu kuat menghadapi serangan dan tekanan seperti itu hingga jatuh sakit bahjan saya berencana berhenti dari kuliah selama dua tahun saya berada dalam perawatan medis khusus
1928762 kejadian itu pada tahun 1975 ketika pertama kali pendaftaran mata kuliah menggunakan sistem komputer waktu itu saya melakukan registrasi sebuah mata kuliah setelah mendaftar saya pun berangkat ke oklahoma untuk urusan bisnis
1928763 saya ini gadis pendiam bagi saya berdiri di depan kelas adalah hal yang sangat menakutkan tentu saja membatalkan mata kuliah tidak mungkin lagi sudah sangat terlambat tidak hadir sama sekali selama kuliah juga bukan pilihan yang tepat sebabnya saya menerima beasiswa bila nilai saya jatuh beasiswa bisa dicabut
1928764 saya tak menduga di kelas itu banyak sekali wanita arab berjilbab
1928765 saya terangkan tentang neraka bagaimana mereka akan dibakar dan disiksa jika tak ikut ajaran kristen lalu saya terangkan yesus cinta mereka dan yesus mati disalib untuk menebus dosa dosa pengikutnya jadi kita musti ikuti dia
1928766 anak anak arab itu kok belum tertarik juga dengan kristen saya putuskan untuk mencoba cara lain yakni saya coba pelajari kitab mereka untuk membuktikan bahwa islam agama salah dan muhammad bukan nabi
1928767 sungguh tanpa saya sadari ada perubahan kecil dalam keseharian saya tapi itu sudah cukup mengganggu pikiran suami biasanya saban jumat dan sabtu kami sering pergi ke bar atau menghadiri pesta tapi saya tidak begitu suka lagi bahkan berhenti makan babi dan minum minuman keras
1928768 waktu itu dalam sangkaan saya suamilah yang memaksa istri misal untuk memakai jilbab
1928769 dia berujar saya sudah siap jadi seorang islam saya kontan menangkal pernyataannya itu dengan menyebut saya orang kristen selama ini saya hanya coba mengkaji bukan mau masuk islam begitu kata saya malam itu
1928770 akhirnya keesokan harinya dengan disaksikan abdul aziz dan tiga temannya sayapun bersyahadah saat itu 21 mei 1977
1928771 saya meninggalkan pengadilan dengan hati yang hancur anda bisa bayangkan bagaimana hati seorang ibu dipisahkan dari anak anaknya
1928772 nenek berusia 100 tahun ketika menerima islam persis setelah itu dia meninggal dunia masya allah nenek meninggal dengan membawa buku amalan yang penuh kebajikan ke akhirat
1928773 saya sangat gembira menjadi seorang muslim islam adalah hidupku islam adalah irama hatiku islam adalah darah yang mengalir di sekujur tubuhku islam adalah kekuatanku islam telah membuat hidupku sangat menyenangkan tanpa islam aku tak berarti apa apanya andai allah memalingkan wajah nya dariku sungguh aku tak bisa bertahan hidup
1928774 wanita muslim tidak dibatasi dalam berkarir oleh agamanya begitupun bagi saya profesi terbaik adalah menjadi seorang ibu karena para ibulah yang membentuk generasi masa depan
1928775 maaf mas saya mau nikah sama mas karena kehendak orang tua di islam hukumnya anak harus nurut sama orang tua saya sudah taat tetapi rupanya saya mau di kristenkan maaf mas bagi saya lebih baik kehilangan mas dari pada harus kehilangan iman islam besok setelah sholat subuh antarkan saya kembali ke orang tua
1928776 tidak aku tidak akan berbuat sekasar itu lagi terhadapmu aku berjanji didepan tuhan kau bebas dengan agamamu bahkan kau bebas membaca kitab sucimu tadi malam kitab itu telah aku baca isinya luar biasa dan benar mutlak tapi maaf aku masih belum yakin bahwa islam agama yang benar aku akan menyelidiki
1928777 kalau islam yang benar maka aku akan masuk islam tetapi kalau ternyata islam yang salah atau keliru maka kamu haarus masuk gereja
1928778 ya tuhan tolonglah saya berilah petunjuk kepada saya kalau memang benar yesus itu tuhan tetapkan hati saya akan tetapi kalau bukan tolong beri saya petunjuk kepada siapa saya harus menyembah
1928779 bagiku bahkan terlalu lamban sekian lamanya aku terombangambing antara kebenaran dan ketidak benaran aku sudah tak sanggup lagi membohongi diri sendiri
1928780 mari saya bimbing masuk islam disaksikan oleh allah seluruh malaikat nabi dan rasul termasuk junjungan kita nabi muhammad saw coba tirukan asyhadu alla ilahaillallah wa asyhadu anna muhammadar rasulullah
1928781 terlalu gila kamu biaya ayah habis banyak karena kamu ini berarti kamu telah mengkhianati cita cita orang tua sekarang aku perintahkan kamu pulang kembali ke malang dan kembali ke gereja
1928782 tidak ayah saya sudah menyatakan masuk islam dan saya sudah berjanji mati bersama islam
1928783 terlalu gila jadi kau sudah benar benar hendak meninggalkan gereja
1928784 baiklah kalau kamu sudah tidak bisa diatur lagi kamu tidak usah mengaku orang tua di sini keluar dan jangan menginjakkan kakimu lagi di rumah ini

1929084 so now i have determined to do good again to jerusalem and judah do not be afraid these are the things that you shall do speak the truth to one another render in your gates judgments that are true and sound do not plot evil against your neighbor and do not love to swear falsely i hate all this
1929085 this could play an interesting role in the cover up debate
1929086 the weekend in rotterdam is a smoking gun in the case
1929087 it was kind of a regular duty for me i must have seen him twice cause it was his job to pick up the visa two weeks after the application i still remember the adress of the embassy kalashnaya perulok at number 6 guess ive spoken to him for ten minutes not a nice guy he was rude reluctant the kind of person who lays in his chair enough reasons for me to keep the conversation short and formal
1929088 off course i remember my first thoughts after i heard of the tragedy in dallas when i heard the man they caught was lee harvey oswald i immediately recognized that name off course that was a shock i told my supervisor star busman immediately about it but i cant remember if someone ever came back to me with questions
1929089 according to a dutch official source the dutch charg in moscow issued a transit visa to oswalds wife on may 13 1962 there is no record of her having actually transited the netherlands
1929090 in the pension that night the sheets were so clean that marina was affraid to lie down
1929091 interestingly lee put holland on the list of countries he wanted to visit again he just as i liked the dutch people
1929092 basically i stayed in my cabin while lee went to the movies and they have different games there i dont know what he did there
1929093 we worked behind a desk with 5 or 6 men and believe me none of us had managed to remember oswald when we heard his name in the news after the tragedy in dallas he was in our office for a simple transaction off course no one would remember that
1929094 i am not aware that the arrb did anything with what i said on the subject as the file belonged to a private business and that may be a tricky area for investigators especially regarding companies who promise to protect the privacy of their customers
1929095 they had a charming waiter a handsome young man whose name was pieter half russian and half dutch he knew a few words of russian and wanted to know all about marina but lee was suspicious of him dont tell him anything you dont have to he warned marina its no accident that they gave us a russian speaking waiter marina ignored his warning to the extent their languages would allow she chatted openly with pieter and she dicovered that his last name was didenko or something close to it
1929096 on wednesday june 13 1962 the maasdam slid into its pier in hoboken new jersery the oswalds were packed and waiting below tense and nervouw throughout the voyage lee literally jumped when they heard a knock at the door of their cabin he stepped back whiled around and stood confronting the door it was their waiter pieter he had come to say goodbye shyly he showed marina a photograph of the french girl he was meeting in new york when he left and the door had closed behind him marina sensed the tension seeping out of her husbands body he had been expecting the police

1929100 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
1929101 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
1929102 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
1929103 finally oswald had written k42000 384 1 2 dinner room 384 jelisavcic the name jelisavcic has never been explained neither as room 384 did oswald have dinner with jelisavcic
1929104 the late mikhailo jelisavcic was born in raska montenegro in 1912
1929105 yes these are good theories jelisavcic could have had his office in the metropol hotel at room 384 alexei tolstoy a frenchman who was the air france representative in moscow had an office on the 3rd floor too the only puzzling thing to me is that oswald spelled jelisavcic correctly he was a terrible writer
1929106 funny you dont seem to entertain the idea that he was working for kgb since most of them did how else do you think he got room in the metropol
1929107 although the detour by brussels costs a little bit more i believe the added convenience of the ready made shelter arrangement justifies this route

1929124 our own red cross experience with ivan was so positive that we decided to volunteer
1929125 volunteering is a nice way to do something for someone else while enjoying our golden years
1929126 the people of the gulf coast hold a special place in our hearts we were here providing assistance during hurricanes ivan dennis and katrina
1929127 making a connection to those in need and helping just one person who needs your help makes this job worth it
1929128 many people have contacted us and asked how they can help the red cross assist the storm victims
1929129 the best way to help us deliver service to those in need is to make a financial contribution to the disaster relief fund
1929130 many of our volunteers didnt wait to be called after the tornado touched down they called us and said they were ready to work
1929131 we also received red cross volunteers from other chapters in the southeast including alabama and mississippi
1929132 our teams are continuing to visit neighborhoods throughout the day to assess damage and provide emergency assistance to any families that were impacted by this storm

1929145 all work and no play makes jack a dull boy
1929146 what in the hell could that have to do with peta
1929147 i dont mind having a conversation with a guy who seems to have his finger on the pulse and having a conversation with him and talking with him and seeing if he can push me a little bit and get my mojo back
1929148 i didnt feel i fell off but i felt i was a little bit out of touch with the things i should be thinking about i needed to get a little more focused and close to my people and closer to the street
1929149 we havent worked together for months now but 50 helped me set the fun i got loose ive been really just in the lab but he helped me set the tone i had fun getting loose again it was competitive cause we made records together records that may or may not make the album all types of hidden records he pushed me now my vertical is back and i can dunk on all of them imma dunk on them so crazy

1929156 lets just give the emotions and let him put it to music and by the way i passagiata can we use something like this to tie the days together
1929157 un equipo de gente brillante puede tomar las peores decisiones y sentirse tranquilos
1929158 cuando se re ne un grupo de personas inteligentes en una organizaci n se sienten invulnerables y tienden a la estupidez colectiva
1929159 yo no estaba de acuerdo con la forma en que se aumentaron los precios
1929160 pero advert que solo yo me opon a y siendo el m s joven pens que podr a estar equivocado por eso no insist y me plegu a lo que dijeron los dem s
1929161 si todos est n de acuerdo el equivocado debo ser yo
1929162 un modo de pensamiento que emprenden las personas cuando se involucran profundamente en un grupo cohesivo cuando la tendencia de los miembros a la unanimidad supera su motivaci n para evaluar en forma realistas acciones alternas
1929163 si nuestros gerentes se ponen demasiado corteses yo introduzco el desorden
1929164 yo me desespero si presento una idea y todos est n de de acuerdo me pongo a pensar que no todo puede ser tan formidable trato de encontrar a alguien que disienta conmigo para que podamos enriquecer la decisi n
1929165 regresar en 15 minutos y para ese tiempo espero que alguien no est de acuerdo conmigo y me lo haga saber
1929166 en los meses siguientes a la invasi n me reprochaba amargamente por haber guardado silencio durante aquella crucial discusi n en el gabinete presidencial la nica forma en que puedo explicar por que no hice m s que unas t midas preguntas en esos momentos es que el impulso de opinar lo contrario se anulaba por las circunstancias favorables a la invasi n
1929167 disentir no significa tener aversi n as como desacuerdo no quiere decir irrespeto
1929168 mi supervisor me considera m s capaz de lo que yo me creo por eso realizo mi trabajo mejor de lo que yo pensaba hacerlo
1929169 la mayor parte de lo que llamamos gerencia consiste en crearle dificultades a la gente para que cumpla con su trabajo
1929170 todas las operaciones empresariales pueden reducirse a tres palabras gente producto y utilidades la gente est primero si no logra motivarla no ser mucho lo que pueda hacer con las otras dos
1929171 nuestro personal est en primer lugar despu s los clientes y luego los accionistas puede sonar raro pero no podemos superar las expectativas de nuestros clientes a no ser que excedamos las de nuestro personal primero nuestra nica ventaja competitiva sustentable es la calidad de nuestros trabajadores
1929172 siempre hay que tratar a nuestros empleados exactamente como queremos que ellos traten a nuestros mejores clientes
1929173 nos quejamos de los trabajadores que no tienen ning n compromiso con la compa a y convenientemente ignoramos el hecho de que la mayor parte de las compa as no hacen ning n compromiso hacia los trabajadores
1929174 la eficiencia de la administraci n japonesa es consecuencia de la motivaci n del personal obrero
1929175 en el jap n se hace el amor con la empresa a la que uno pertenece mostrar la menor muestra de incompetencia ser a como proclamar el adulterio en el lecho conyugal
1929176 entre m s ganancias usted comparta con sus empleados m s crecer n las utilidades de su empresa
1929177 porque la forma como la gerencia trate a sus asociados es exactamente igual a la forma como ellos tratar n a los clientes y si los asociados tratan bien a los clientes stos regresar n una y otra vez y es all donde realmente residen las utilidades de la empresa no en forzar con publicidad cara a que entren a su tienda a extra os que s lo compran una vez satisfacci n lealtad y clientes fieles son el coraz n de los espectaculares m rgenes de wal mart
1929178 lo m s importante es ser admirado por el personal que usted dirige y para ser admirado por ellos es necesario que tenga la capacidad de apreciar el valor de esas personas
1929179 un grupo importante de investigadores est sacando a la luz evidencia de algo que los defensores de la calidad del clima laboral saben desde hace d cadas que las personas que ejecutan objetivos de negocio son m s que ovejas de un reba o motivarlos puede tener resultados casi m gicos en los estados financieros de las empresas
1929180 la salud financiera de continental mejor con la misma rapidez que el nimo de sus empleados
1929181 era extraordinario a la hora de motivar a las personas
1929182 algunos gerentes agravan el problema cuando va mal el negocio apelan al refugio de los tontos es decir reducen la publicidad los programas de desarrollo administrativo y los trabajos de adiestramiento en ventas estos son frutos del p nico es un reto a la mentalidad l gica descifrar el tipo de ideas que contribuyen a decisiones tan miopes como estas si la publicidad es necesaria cuando las cosas van bien obviamente es m s importante cuando las cosas van mal
1929183 un rey cuyos capitanes siempre est n de acuerdo con l obtiene consejos mediocres
1929184 un capit n inteligente nunca mata al huno que le lleva malas noticias mata al que nos se las lleva
1929185 la lecci n fundamental es que disentir no significa tener aversi n desacuerdo no quiere decir irrespeto
1929186 las jd no pueden darse el lujo de tener conformistas un conformista es aquel que consistentemente modifica su punto de vista para adaptarlo al nuestro
1929187 no necesitamos asesor as ni estudios de ning n tipo porque actualmente andamos bien si un d a tenemos problemas no dudaremos en llamarlo
1929188 lo dif cil es hacer cambios cuando las cosas est n funcionando bien uno tiene que empezar antes de que las tendencias a la ca da resulten evidentes
1929189 despu s del seminario el doctor bueno solicit a stan rapp que le brindar asesor a en mercadeo en forma constante fue un matrimonio entre dos hombres con mentes similares no pas mucho tiempo antes de que todo el grupo de administraci n de amil adoptara el concepto de maximarketing como una estrategia corporativa central
1929190 yo no puedo dejar las cosas como est n aunque est n bien
1929191 las empresas se equivocan cuando no empiezan a hacer el benchmarking antes de sentirse amenazadas
1929192 el doctor bueno ha vivido obsesionado con la idea de aprender y ense ar son las claves del xito de su negocio y de su vida personal actualmente dedica al 90 de su tiempo en actividades de aprendizaje ense anza y motivaci n pasa dos meses cada a o tomando cursos asistiendo a seminarios y visitando otras compa as a mediados de los 80 tom dos cursos agotadores en la harvard business school uno sobre administraci n de programas para due os y otros sobre manejo de la mercadotecnia estrat gica
1929193 esta misma actitud de aprendizaje continuo se promueve en todos los niveles de su organizaci n cada tres meses todos los empleados deben leer un libro reciente sobre administraci n y discutir formas de aplicar nuevas ideas a sus propias operaciones

1929201 studies show that most consumers buy new furniture every seven years
1929202 think about it how long has it been since the last time you bought new furniture seems about right doesnt it
1929203 well if laurie says its the best prices around of course im going to shop there
1929204 the worldwide span of capitalism no longer depended on the accumulation and control of capital in the financial sense through mass media and pop culture it was enchaining them not through outright poverty but by stuffing their heads with name brands and celebrity puffery alchemizing them into mindless consumers

1929206 she would come knock at my door early in the day while the morning doves were still singing her anklet had tiny silver charms and bells that sounded like an ice cream bicycle in a dream by that sweet music i could always anticipate her knock
1929207 in the first half we probably had the better of them and they hung in we were two or three goals up at half time when it could have easily been five or six
1929208 we were missing a lot of goals and the game could have been done and dusted
1929209 certainly we have no fear coming out here but there is still a long way to go in the season
1929210 the first half we were down but in the second we played the better football so it evened up either way
1929211 a lot of the games we have had this year they have been big margins so we havent had close games or been forced to come from behind thats proved to us if we get in that situation we can do it
1929212 i am an employee of the b amp n in carrollwood and i have a paystub but it is from october can you still take it

1929220 o ne of the hallmarks of totalitarian ideologues is the use of the big lie a virulent attack on a defenseless group and then a categorical denial turning victims into executioners and executioners into victims
1929221 i have never supported the brutal expulsion of all palestinians i have said repeatedly that the expulsion of the palestinians is immoral and impracticable
1929222 under some circumstances expulsion is not a war crime i dont think that the expulsions of 1948 of nearly a million palestinians were war crimes you cant make an omelet without breaking eggs you have to dirty your hands moreover if he israeli prime minister ben gurion was already engaged in expulsion maybe he should have done a complete job i know that this stuns the arabs and the liberals and the politically correct types but my feeling is that this place would be quieter and know less suffering if the matter had been resolved once and for all if ben gurion had carried out a large expulsion and cleaned the whole country the whole land of israel as far as the jordan river it may yet turn out that this was his fatal mistake if he carried out a full expulsion rather than a partial one he would have stabilized the state of israel for generations
1929223 i am completely unaware that zionism ever aimed to rule the middle east zionism simply wanted to establish and maintain a miniscule jewish state in the land of israel palestine the patrimony of the jews conquered by savage muslim arab invaders
1929224 israel has been threatened by iran with destruction and the iranian nuclear project appears to have israel as its target
1929225 something like a cage has to be built for them there is no choice there is a wild animal there that has to be locked up in one way or another
1929226 barbarians who want to take our lives at the moment that society is in the state of being a serial killer it is a very sick society it should be treated the way we treat individuals who are serial killers
1929227 every intelligence agency in the world believes the iranian program is geared to making weapons not to the peaceful application of nuclear power
1929228 everyone knows that such measures economic sanctions have so far led nowhere and are unlikely to be applied
1929229 never advocated a genocidal attack on iran with the aim of killing 70 million iranians
1929230 irans leaders would do well to re think their gamble and suspend their nuclear program barring this the best they could hope for is that israels conventional air assault will destroy their nuclear facilities to be sure this would mean thousands of iranian casualties and international humiliation but the alternative is an iran turned into a nuclear wasteland
1929231 israeli nuclear threat morris has pre determined the result israel will have to engage in a genocidal nuclear assault on iran
1929232 new political space is being created for the public airing of more moderate views on middle east policy
1929233 the powerful lobbying group whose hawkish right wing leadership has often defied both the views of the broader u s jewish community and the policies of israeli governments
1929234 zionism is a colonizing adventure and therefore it stands or falls by the question of armed force there is no other ethic it is important to speak hebrew but unfortunately it is even more important to be able to shoot or else i am through with playing at colonization to the hackneyed reproach that this point of view is unethical i answer absolutely untrue as long as there is the faintest spark of hope for the arabs to impede us they will not sell these hopes not for any tasty morsel because this is not a rabble but a people a living people and no people makes such enormous concessions on such fateful questions except when there is no hope left until we have removed every opening visible in the iron wall
1929235 mr president dont push as further than we are prapared to go because if we must well use all the weapons at our disposal
1929236 make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue and virtue with knowledge and knowledge with self control and self control with steadfastness and steadfastness with godliness and godliness with brotherly affection and brotherly affection with love for if these qualities are yours and are increasing they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ for whoever lacks these qualities is so nearsighted that he is blind having forgotten that he was cleansed from his former sins
1929237 i think it right as long as i am in this body to stir you up by way of reminder since i know that the putting off of my body will be soon as our lord jesus christ made clear to me and i will make every effort so that after my departure you may be able at any time to recall these things
1929238 for the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing but to us who are being saved it is the power of god
1929239 i will destroy the wisdom of the wise and the discernment of the discerning i will thwart
1929240 courage is almost a contradiction in terms it means a strong desire to live taking the form of readiness to die he that will lose his life the same shall save it is not a piece of mysticism for saints and heroes it is a piece of everyday advice for sailors or mountaineers it might be printed in an alpine guide or drill book this paradox is the whole principle of courage even of quite earthly or quite brutal courage
1929241 o rthodox theology has specially insisted that christ is not a being apart from god and man like an elf nor yet a being half human and half not like a centaur but both things at once and both things thoroughly very man and very god

1929246 kandi you dont have to go with me im a big boy i can find my way
1929247 la riserva scritta che abbiamo presentato pu apparire disdicevole sembra quasi che sia stata fatta perch abbiamo perso una partita non assolutamente cos la gara di mercoled noi labbiamo persa perch il nettuno ha giocato molto meglio ed ha vinto con pieno merito non abbiamo da accampare alcuna pretesa rispetto alla partita il discorso un altro e va ben oltre vogliamo sapere se linterpretazione del regolamento che ne stata data riguardo la posizione di costatini sia giusta o meno lo vogliamo sapere per la regolarit del campionato il bbc grosseto ora scriver una lettera al procuratore federale chiedendogli una indagine disposta presso i competenti uffici e chiedendo inoltre che questa indagine sia rapida visto che si stanno giocando i playoff
1929248 la nostra interpretazione del regolamento chiara prosegue il numero uno del club maremmano la circolare attivit agonistica per il 2008 dice che i giocatori che vengono schierati a roster dalle varie squadre debbono essere presenti almeno una volta entro la fine del girone dandata 31 di maggio senza specificare il motivo perch un giocatore assente prima di quella data questo regolamento vale per tutti i tesserati non soltanto per i nuovi tesserati faccio presente anche che chi va a giocare allestero dopo aver fatto alcuni mesi nel campionato italiano non pu pi giocare nella ibl per il resto della stagione pertanto inesatto scrivere che panerati e lucati attualmente in america giocheranno con noi se eventualmente andremo in finale
1929249 il discorso molto semplice costantini alla data del 31 maggio non mai stato nel roster del nettuno e non poteva esservi perch squalificato fino al 30 di giugno
1929250 il reclamo deve essere formalizzato mediante linvio allufficio di codesto giudice di deduzioni inerenti al reclamo stesso entro le ore 10 del giorno successivo a quello di svolgimento della gara
1929251 nella mattinata di gioved siamo andati in banca per fare il bonifico e quando abbiamo inoltrato il tutto alla federazione era passato da 10 minuti il termine ultimo
1929252 una maniera diciamo furba per non prendersi responsabilit perch il problema non nasce adesso noi del grosseto ma anche altre societ avevamo gi chiesto in federazione di darci uninterpretazione sul tesseramento di costantini e la federazione non ce lha voluta dare costringendoci a ricorrere alla riserva scritta cosa che potrebbero poi fare altre societ nelle prossime settimane
1929253 non esatto precisa claudio banchi esiste un precedente e riguarda un giocatore che era del grosseto david francia nel 2006 quando termin la squalifica di due anni per doping gli fu impedito di rientrare in campionato perch la sua squalifica terminava il 17 agosto 2006 e allepoca il termine ultimo per andare in campo ed essere presenti in campionato era il 30 giugno cosicch la federazione ci disse che non poteva essere utilizzato non lo facemmo giocare
1929254 nel caso riguardante costantini ho la sensazione che da parte degli organi federali ci sia una tutela del giocatore mi pu anche stare bene per dovr essere uguale per tutti quanto meno si chiarisca il regolamento perch lapplicazione attuale del regolamento non gli permetterebbe di scendere in campo

1929454 since the second world war and the beginning of the atomic age the consciousness of the creative writer however detached has been confronted with the specter of the totalitarian state the growing poverty and helplessness of western europe and the threat of an inconceivably destructive war which may annihilate civilization and mankind itself clearly when the future of civilization is no longer assured a criticism if american life in terms of a contrast between avowed ideals and present actuality cannot be a primary preoccupation and source of inspiration for america not europe is now the sanctuary of culture civilizations very existence depends upon america upon the actuality of american life and not the ideals of the american dream to criticize the actuality upon which all hope depends thus becomes a criticism of hope itself
1929455 ive got nothing to do and im doing it tomorrow
1929456 obviously if you are reading this then i have died in iraq i kind of predicted this that is why im writing this in november a third time just seemed like im pushing my chances i dont regret going everybody dies but few get to do it for something as important as freedom it may seem confusing why we are in iraq its not to me im here helping these people so that they can live the way we live not have to worry about tyrants or vicious dictators to do what they want with their lives to me that is why i died others have died for my freedom now this is my mark
1929457 nobody is interested in solutions if they dont think theres a problem given that starting point i believe it is appropriate to have an over representation of factual presentations on how dangerous it is as a predicate for opening up the audience to listen to what the solutions are and how hopeful it is that we are going to solve this crisis
1929458 there is unmistakable evidence that saddam hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years
1929459 saddam hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process
1929460 there is no doubt that saddam hussein has invigorated his weapons programs in addition saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer range missiles that will threaten the united states and our allies
1929461 how close is the peril of iraqi wmd today or at most within a few months iraq could launch missile attacks with chemical or biological weapons against its neighbors albeit attacks that would be ragged inaccurate and limited in size within four or five years it could have the capability to threaten most of the middle east and parts of europe with missiles armed with nuclear weapons containing fissile material produced indigenously and to threaten u s territory with such weapons delivered by nonconventional means such as commercial shipping containers if it managed to get its hands on sufficient quantities of already produced fissile material these threats could arrive much sooner
1929462 iraq is automatically an imminent threat to the countries that surround it because of the possession of these weapons
1929463 i agree with president bush he has said that saddam hussein is evil and he is hussein is a vicious dictator and a documented deceiver he has invaded his neighbors used chemical arms and failed to account for all the chemical and biological weapons he had before the gulf war he has murdered dissidents and refused to comply with his obligations under un security council resolutions and he has tried to build a nuclear bomb anyone who believes in the importance of limiting the spread of weapons of mass killing the value of democracy and the centrality of human rights must agree that saddam hussein is a menace the world would be a better place if he were in a different place other than the seat of power in baghdad or any other country
1929464 theres no question that saddam hussein is a threat yes he has chemical and biological weapons he is as far as we know actively pursuing nuclear capabilities though he doesnt have nuclear warheads yet if he were to acquire nuclear weapons i think our friends in the region would face greatly increased risks as would we
1929465 i t is incontestable that on the day i left office there were unaccounted for stocks of biological and chemical weapons we might have destroyed them in 98 we tried to but we sure as heck didnt know it because we never got to go back there
1929466 other countries possess weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles
1929467 when former president bill clinton was here recently he told me was absolutely convinced given his years in the white house and the access to privileged information which he had that iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction until the end of the saddam regime
1929468 he will use those weapons of mass destruction again as he has 10 times since 1983
1929469 iraq is a long way from here but what happens there matters a great deal here for the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face
1929470 at its core bitch slap follows three bad girls a down and out stripper a drug running killer and a corporate powerbroker as they arrive at a remote desert hideaway to extort and steal 200 million in diamonds from a ruthless underworld kingpin
1929471 bitch slap is a post modern thinking mans throwback to the b movie exploitation films of the 1950s 70s as well as a loving sly parody of the same inspired by the likes of dragstrip girls faster pussycat kill kill kung fu nun and the pantheon of blacksploitation films bitch slap will mix girls guns outrageous action and jaw dropping visuals with a message dont be naughty

1929473 he is a little branch person who goes for a jog one day and is mistaken for an ordinary stick by various other people and animals who do things to him that you would do with a stick with him there is a happy christmassy end to the story i enjoyed the story i enjoy illustrating less when the story is set in reality there was a great variation of different scenes to draw
1929474 i think the impact of the pictures is more immediate and probably easier to take in then the stories or their meanings i find that younger children can enjoy looking at the gruffalo book without even understanding whats going on it varies who people see as the creator
1929475 the more that you read the more you will know the more that you learn the more places youll go
1929476 ive often wondered how another illustrator would have drawn the gruffalo

1929479 publishers in germany are less concerned about what a book should look like they seem to have less preconceived notions of what is suitable for children

1929502 he himself saw it this way that god spared him life was preserved for him he was not killed in the camps he was not killed in the army or by cancer concurrently he was a witness he was born in 1918 born at the same time as the revolution his life mirrored took place in parallel with the life of after the revolution he was an unprotected grain in that movement and subject to the wild squalls of soviet history that he experienced no less than any denizen of that country yet he did not perish while so many others perished he felt it a duty to speak for them to what he had seen for many years he feared greatly he would run out of time and that is why he did not spare himself worked tirelessly and without ceasing for some years now he feels a great sense of liberation and that he has fulfilled in time the chief purpose of his life

1929555 let no man say when he is tempted i am tempted of god for god cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death

1929658 si supieras todas las fuerzas internas que han terminado por agotarme todas las locuras que me han pasado por la cabeza soy ante todo hombre de fantas a amigo del capricho y de lo deshilvanado

1929662 ayer estuve espantosamente triste con una de esas tristezas que ten a en mi juventud y para librarme de las cuales hubiera sido capaz de tirarme por la ventana
1929663 flaubert conserv tonter as que pose an la fragancia del recuerdo muchos a os despu s de la muerte de su madre todav a ped a a veces su chal y su sombrero y entonces se sentaba un rato a so ar con ellos
1929664 adivino el porvenir es que la int tesis se yergue sin cesar ante mis ojos nunca vi a un ni o sin pensar que ese ni o terminar a por convertirse en viejo ni una cuna sin recordar una tumba la contemplaci n de una mujer desnuda me hace so ar con su esqueleto por eso los espect culos alegres me ponen triste y los espect culos tristes no me afectan gran cosa lloro demasiado por dentro para derramar l grimas por fuera
1929665 no quisiste creerme cuando te dije que era viejo s que lo soy por desgracia pues todo sentimiento que a mi alma llega se agr a igual que el vino cuando lo introducen en recipientes ya muy usados

1929667 prefiero no tener descendencia mi oscuro apellido se apagar conmigo y el mundo seguir su camino igual que si dejara alg n descendiente ilustre me gusta la idea de la nada absoluta axioma es la vida la que nos consuela de la muerte y es la muerte la que nos consuela de la vida
1929668 me gusta rodearme de recuerdos de igual modo que no vendo mis trajes viejos a veces subo a verlos al desv n donde los guardo y recuerdo los tiempos en que a n estaban nuevos y en todas las cosas que hice cuando los llevaba
1929669 la faceta rid cula que veo en el amor siempre me impidi entregarme a l he deseado en ocasiones seducir a una mujer pero con s lo pensar en el aspecto extra o que en esos momentos deb a de tener me entraban ganas de reir tanto es as que mi voluntad se derret a al fuego de la iron a interior y dentro de m cantaba el himno de la amargura y de la irrisi n
1929670 el contemplar una vida que una pasi n violenta de la ndole que sea ha vuelto miserable es siempre algo m s instructivo y altamente moral eso rebaja con una iron a aullante tantas pasiones banales y man as vulgares que uno queda satisfecho al pensar que el instrumento humano puede vibrar hasta ese extremo y subir hasta tonos tan agudos
1929671 no son las grandes desgracias las que crean la desgracia ni las grandes felicidades las que hacen la felicidad sino el tejido fino e imperceptible de mil circunstancias banales de mil detalles tenues que componen toda una vida de paz radiante o de agitaci n infernal
1929672 me dedico al arte porque me divierte pero no tengo fe en lo bello
1929673 me da miedo ser fr o seco ego sta y dios sabe sin embargo lo que en estos momentos siento dentro de m
1929674 quisiera mandarte nicamente palabras dulces y tiernas de esas suaves como un beso que algunos saben decir pero que en mi caso se quedan en el fondo del coraz n y expiran al llegar a los labios si yo pudiera cada ma ana tu despertar se ver a perfumado por una olorosa p gina de amor
1929675 es la hora en que me quedo solo y mientras los dem s duermen abro el caj n donde guardo mis tesoros

1929677 ser posible que hasta me reproches el inocente afecto que siento por un sill n si te hablara de mis botas creo que tambi n te pondr as celosa
1929678 lo que me sorprende es que debajo de esas cr ticas se note un odio contra m contra mi persona un prejuicio denigrador
1929679 la diferencia que ha existido siempre entre mi modo de ver la vida y el de los dem s ha hecho que me encerrase no bastante por desgracia en una spera soledad de la que nada lograba hacerme salir me han humillado tantas veces he escandalizado y hecho gritar tanto que he terminado desde hace ya mucho tiempo por reconocer que para vivir tranquilo hay que vivir solo y poner burletas en todas las ventanas por miedo a que el aire del mundo llegue hasta uno
1929680 por muy uniforme que sea tu vida por lo menos tienes algo que contarme pero la m a es un lago un estanque quieto donde nada se mueve en donde nada sobresale cada d a que pasa se parece al anterior puedo decirte lo que har dentro de un mes dentro de un a o y considero esto no s lo sabio sino afortunado
1929681 tengo el defecto de haber nacido dotado de una lengua especial cuya clave s lo yo poseo
1929682 no estoy con nadie en ning n sitio no soy de mi pa s y puede que tampoco del mundo aunque muchos me rodeen sigo estando solo por eso los huecos que dej la muerte en mi vida no aportaron a mi alma un nuevo estado de nimo sino que acentuaron ese estado yo estaba solo por dentro y ahora estoy tambi n solo por fuera
1929683 amo mi trabajo con un amor fan tico y pervertido como un asceta el cilicio que le rasca el vientre
1929684 he cavado mi agujero y en l me quedo poniendo gran cuidado en que reine siempre la misma temperatura dentro
1929685 a veces tengo grandes hast os grandes vac os dudas que se r en en mi cara en medio de mis satisfacciones m s ingenuas pues bien no cambiar todo eso por nada pues me parece en conciencia que cumplo con mi deber que obedezco a una fatalidad superior que hago el bien que estoy en lo justo
1929686 estoy roto aturdido como despu s de una larga org a con un aburrimiento de muerte tengo un vac o inaudito en el coraz n yo que hace poco me hallaba tan tranquilo tan orgulloso de mi serenidad y que trabajaba de la ma ana a la noche con un rigor implacable no puedo leer ni pensar ni escribir
1929687 ya no hay artistas como los de anta o de aquellos cuya vida y alma eran el instrumento ciego del apetitio de belleza rganos de dios mediante los cuales se probaba a s mismo su existencia para ellos el mundo no importaba nadie supo nada de sus dolores se acostaban tristes todas las noches y contemplaban la vida humana con una mirada de asombro igual que nosotros contemplamos un hormiguero
1929688 el vicio de la accidia tiene tres clases la primera es una cierta amargura de la mente que no se consuela con nada alegre ni edificante se alimenta de hast o y abomina la compa a humana esto es lo que el ap stol llama tristeza del mundo que fabrica muerte produce inclinaci n a la desesperaci n hura a y desconfianza y a veces conduce a sus v ctimas al suicidio al verse oprimidas por una aflicci n irracional tal tristeza sale a veces de una impaciencia previa a veces del hecho de que se pospone alg n deseo o se frustra y otras veces de la abundancia de humores melanc licos en cuyo caso compete al m dico m s que al sacerdote el prescribir el remedio
1929689 mi juventud ha pasado la enfermedad nerviosa que me dur dos a os fue la conclusi n de la misma el broche su resultado l gico para haber tenido lo que tuve era preciso que algo anteriormente pasara de manera harto tr gica para mi caja craneana
1929690 si he sido duro es porque estoy enfermo dolorido amargado la vida me desloma como un trote demasiado duro que destroza las ri ones el nico momento en que no sufro es cuando estoy solo los mejores afectos con frecuencia me irritan desmesuradamente
1929691 me comprender s hasta el final soportar s el peso de mi tedio mis man as mis caprichos mis des nimos y mis col ricas mudanzas
1929692 yo soy el oscuro y paciente pescador de perlas que bucea en los bajos fondos y vuelve con las manos vac as y la cara azulada una atracci n fatal me empuja hacia los abismos del pensamiento me lleva al fondo de esos precipicios interiores que jam s se agotan para los fuertes
1929693 dices que me analizo demasiado pero a m me parece que a n no me conozco lo suficiente cada d a que pasa descubro algo nuevo viajo por dentro de m como por un pa s desconocido pese a haberlo recorrido ya cien veces
1929694 caminaba con la rectitud de un sistema particular hecho para un caso especial lo hab a comprendido todo en m lo hab a separado clasificado tanto es as que aquella ha sido la poca de mi existencia en que m s tranquilo me he encontrado mientras que todos por el contrario pensaban que era el momento de compadecerme
1929695 no he recibido del cielo un temperamento optimista nadie percibe en mayor grado que yo lo miserable que es la condici n de la vida no creo en nada ni en m siquiera lo que no es corriente
1929696 expongo las cosas cronol gicamente en el mundo de los estudiantes de los vividores de los blasfemos y los fumadores dice usted fumador pase fumo refumo y sobrefumo cada vez m s por la boca y por el cerebro blasfemo a n es algo cierto pero juro tan por dentro que lo poco que se oye debe perdon rseme en cuanto a lo de estudiante me humilla d nde diablos ha visto usted que tenga yo o haya tenido aspecto de estudiante oh mi vida de estudiante no desear a a mi enemigo si tuviera uno ni una sola de esas semanas y all es claro donde me convert en un vividor bonito vividor consume m s quinina que ron y sus org as son tan ruidosas que no se sabe si est vivo en su propia ciudad en la ciudad donde naci y reside
1929697 el elemento pat tico ha venido a asentarse en lo que a mi respecta sobre todas las superficies alegres y la iron a planea por encima en todos los elementos serios as pues el sentido en el que t dices que me gustan las bromas no es cierto ya que donde puede encontrarse la comicidad cuando todo es c mico
1929698 es bueno e incluso puede ser hermoso el re rse de la vida con tal que se viva hay que colocarse por encima de todo y por encima de uno colocar su esp ritu es decir la libertad de la idea declaro imp o todo l mite a sta
1929699 yo me r o de todo hasta de lo que m s me agrada no existen cosas hechos sentimientos o personas por los que no haya pasado inocentemente mi bufoner a como un rodillo de hierro de esos para dar lustre las piezas de pa o
1929700 no me cuentes m s lugares comunes como que es el dinero lo que me ha impedido ser feliz que si hubiera trabajado me encontrar a mejor c mo si bastara ser mozo de boticario panadero o comerciante de vinos para no aburrirse en este bajo mundo

1929800 er bestaat al veel onderzoek naar hoe je een doorsneedepressie behandelt het gaat meestal om mensen die niet al te ernstig ziek zijn en lichamelijk niets mankeren de ernstigste depressies zeker bij ouderen worden in de onderzoeken vrijwel uitgesloten mijn ouderen mankeerden allemaal iets vari rend van lichte bloedarmoede tot ernstige vormen van kanker
1929801 opvallend weinig mensen kregen last van bijwerkingen tussen beide middelen was amper verschil in effect al knapten de deelnemers die het tricyclische middel nortrilen kregen net iets meer op dat beide middelen ongeveer evenveel effect hadden bevestigt wat we eigenlijk al langer weten er is nog nooit n antidepressivum uitgesprongen
1929802 je valt nog veel meer door kalmerings en slaapmiddelen zoals valium dat zijn pure spierverslappers van de 81 deelnemers aan mijn onderzoek hebben er twee een heup gebroken vervelend maar het had veel erger kunnen zijn als je mensen niet voor een depressie behandelt overlijdt 10 procent na verloop van tijd als gevolg van lichamelijke uitputting zelfmoord et cetera
1929803 maar dat besef is nog lang niet overal zo veel huisartsen en therapeuten hebben nog het idee dat depressie bij ouderen moeilijk te behandelen is en dat ze er maar mee moeten leren leven
1929804 die mythe is hardnekkig toch schrijven huisartsen doorgaans eerst een modern middel in een lage dosering voor dat kan weinig kwaad maar als die behandeling niet aanslaat zou de volgende stap een ouderwetser tricyclisch antidepressivum zijn dat kan onder andere als bijwerking hebben dat de hartslag omhoog gaat en het hartritme verandert er moet daarom vooraf een hartfilmpje worden gemaakt maar de huisarts heeft vaak de faciliteiten niet hij kan iemand doorverwijzen naar een artsenlab of cardioloog maar dat gebeurt lang niet altijd je kunt dus zeggen dat depressieve ouderen die bij de huisarts komen vaak niet adequaat worden behandeld uit angst voor bijwerkingen
1929805 maar mijn ervaring is dat ze alles vertellen mits je er goed naar vraagt het is ook vaak onze schroom ernaar te vragen maar een goede dokter vraagt d r dat vind ik het interessante van ouderenpsychiatrie ouderen hebben een heel leven achter de rug en verschillen daardoor onderling meer van elkaar dan jongeren ik zit vaak te puzzelen is er naast de depressie misschien ook sprake van dementie of spelen ook lichamelijke aandoeningen een rol
