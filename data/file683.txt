6830060 hes always had that somewhere between independence and renegade streak

6830067 thats the most fun ive had since my last interrogation
6830068 i am a black criminal and i have performed deeds of an air pirate
6830069 he had to carry a different burden than most of us and he handled it beautifully
6830070 he didnt need any coping mechanism thats just built into him
6830071 hells bells we were having monday night at the movies tuesday night at the movies wednesday night at the movies featuring john mccain
6830072 we only had the facts half right but john said nobody knew the difference
6830073 as good as any preacher that ever stood at a pulpit
6830074 wasnt a turning point in me as to what type of person i am but it was a bit of a turning point in me appreciating the value of serving a cause greater than your self interest
6830075 that if you put your country first that everything will be ok
6830076 people dont remember how ugly the pow mia issue was
6830077 i heard people scream in his face holding him responsible for the deaths of pows
6830078 everyone knows about his temper his inability to get along with people
6830079 only an a would put together a budget like this
6830080 you are or you arent hes a very straight shooter
6830081 theres nothing unbalanced about it it always makes sense it helps him get the job done
6830082 nobodys going to recruit him to be a zen master
6830083 johns performance over 20 years shows a man who people seek out to do business with because they know hes effective
6830084 he could mock you he could needle you he could belittle you he did it to me on a couple of occasions
6830085 he always said if the opportunity arises again i would love to try it again
6830086 but it wasnt like a dream he couldnt live without
6830087 he put the campaign on his back and climbed up a mountain alone
6830088 he appears to be something different than what he was
6830089 i dont think you get to be 70 years old and then fundamentally change
6830090 mccains gyrations have more to do with figuring out his own party than anything else hes had to sublimate for obvious reasons
6830091 theyre drinking the kool aid that somehow i have changed positions on the issues all i can say is that we all grow we all grow wiser and we all refine our positions
6830092 hes attracted like a moth to the flame to the hard things

6830099 minor political parties inability to gain traction in the united states does not reflect natural facets of our national character
6830100 rather our legal system imposes formidable barriers to minor parties electoral viability the use of plurality voting the candidate with the most votes gets the only prize and single member districts in congressional and most state legislative elections drives voters to coalesce around only two electoral options marginalizing any candidate who lacks a major party brand a better fairer structure of political competition would give minor parties a legislative platform and a chance to supplant one of the major parties
6830101 first amendment constraints on campaign finance regulation under which government may substantially restrict the amounts of political contributions but not of campaign expenditures ensures that only the democrats and republicans with their broad bases of financial support can compete effectively
6830102 in addition federal regulators do not require broadcasters to provide equal time to minor party candidates
6830103 the legal entrenchment of the two major parties has solidified a centrist political order
6830104 proponents of bipartisanship insist that our political culture lacks moderation the polarization of democratic and republican elites has forced the sensible center from its rightful position of political dominance
6830105 denied the keys to government minor parties can take intellectual and rhetorical chances
6830106 they can operate as policy laboratories developing proposals that may attract few initial adherents but eventually penetrate the core of political consciousness the progressive party exemplified this function at the turn of the last century agitating for minimum wages graduated income taxation and numerous other social economic and political reforms that eventually became cornerstones of our law
6830107 we are headed into a time when a confluence of changes are going to lead to a perfect storm making us finally realize that our health care system needs a major overhaul
6830108 as the elderly population doubles between now and about 2030 projections are that we will see at least a doubling of the costs of the federal and state health and retirement programs
6830109 we are headed into a time when a confluence of changes are going to lead to a perfect storm making us finally realize that our health care system needs a major overhaul
6830110 as the elderly population doubles between now and about 2030 projections are that we will see at least a doubling of the costs of the federal and state health and retirement programs
6830111 that will likely be when the perfect storm hits but if we miss it then we will likely have missed all the storm clouds for the foreseeable future
6830112 while attention focuses on these two major trends other storm clouds are brewing
6830113 a long term care crisis looms grows and receives little attention despite problems with the affordability quality and access to long term care these problems will only become much worse as the aging population doubles by 2030
6830114 much attention also has been paid to the problems of financing social security but the financial problems of the social security program pale in comparison to the burden of the medicare and medicaid programs on our economy
6830115 there are already shortages of nurses and open nursing positions are sometimes filled by the expensive practice of recruiting migrant nurses into communities
6830116 added to this problem now are reports of shortages of other health professionals including therapists social workers health aides and even some categories of physicians
6830117 overall we continue to worry about the general quality of health care as well as the problems of health disparities as the inequities of our economy and culture flow into the health care system

6830129 health care half truths too many myths not enough reality
6830130 the key is how much is the break its no good if anyone has to come up with more than 5 percent of their income or if they buy insurance that when you read the fine print actually barely covers a doctor visit and no tests more than seven in 10 people who are uninsured work and continue to work and so the ability to be covered between jobs is vital automobile accidents dont just occur when people are working
6830131 the problem with our health care system isnt that we have too much or too little competition but that we have the wrong kind of competition
6830132 the structure of health care delivery has to change consumer driven health care wont work
6830133 the googlization of everything how one company is disrupting culture commerce and community and why we should worry

6830145 it is you can hardly go anywhere in st paul that you dont see someone you know which is the great thing about it i think
6830146 if you were one of these guys when you got to town youd literally walk up to the first police officer you saw and introduce yourself
6830147 you would have to promise you would not commit a crime in the city limits of st paul you could kill anyone you wanted in minneapolis and you did

6830155 the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results
6830156 operations research offers a powerful set of tools that have been used successfully in everything from world war ii to wal mart style logistics planning these tools ought to be used to increase the success of existing programs and to help expand access to hiv care and treatment in resource limited countries
6830157 for example operations research could help with the planning of a national drug distribution system or with predicting the demand for services at local clinics and the best ways to staff them
6830158 to date hiv treatment scale up has appropriately focused first on policy level issues such as program initiation and costs and secondarily on operational level issues
6830159 now that many programs are in place the potential gains from improved planning are great especially given the high cost of antiretroviral drug therapy
6830160 the analysis suggested that implementation of such a program could allow the government of rwanda to scale up hiv treatment without overburdening its existing health care system
6830161 the unique advantage of operations research is that it gives us the ability to evaluate and optimize outcomes of various scenarios such as determining the best approach for the management of lab equipment repair without impacting patients
6830162 once we have the evidence for a new approach a good case can be made that it should be implemented as policy although any initiative should take into account the environments in which the projects are to be carried out with all necessary ethical cultural and political considerations
6830163 placing greater emphasis on long term strategic planning and increasing the attention and resources directed to capacity building for sustainability
6830164 while laudable progress has been made the great majority of hiv patients are still under treated or untreated
6830165 we feel that operations research provides one of the tools to make sure progress continues
6830166 this area of research and specifically this and other projects led by drs hupert and xiong shows how fields such as the engineering sciences can contribute to solving medical and public health problems
6830167 the sympathy inherent to a close relationship with a victim extends to other victims leading benefactors to prefer charities that help those suffering from the misfortunes that have affected their friends and loved ones
6830168 so friendship with a victim does not simply make people more sympathetic rather it directs their sympathy to others with the same misfortune as their friend or loved one
6830169 if as our results show a relationship created in the lab in a few minutes can significantly increase giving then surely a charity can inspire a connection between a victim and a benefactor through its solicitations

6830224 i have always wanted to have an iphone because i am a gadget guy and i like new technology this represents the best in new technology i have a macbook an ipod and now i have an iphone 3g
6830225 i have been waiting for it for a year it is very useful for myself and it is very cool
6830226 filipinos are very tech savvy and a good portion of the population is also very fashionable and practical because of the things that you can do with an iphone it will become very popular we are coming out with it before the peak of the christmas season so that people can start using it
6830227 i like driving this track it is different to other street circuits we have had and yesterday when i walked it i thought it would be fun today just confirmed that impression for me
6830228 there are some very quick parts and almost everywhere there is a lot of room it is maybe similar to some of the north american circuits used in the past
6830229 they have done a really good job we have got off to a good start but it is too early to say where we are in relation to the opposition i think overtaking will be difficult as always
6830230 i hope i dont need to worry about it so i am concentrating on getting the best position for qualifying
6830231 considering the dustiness of the track we made a very promising start on the set up this morning we were able to go faster on each run without changing too much and had a good baseline for the afternoon session
6830232 in p2 this afternoon our adjustments were again spot on but the sheer volume of traffic meant that it was difficult to confirm immediately our final set up changes i think we are in pretty good shape and i am looking forward to saturday
6830233 the track was very green this morning which meant there was little point in making big changes to the car
6830234 but we made some in the afternoon and they seemed to pay off i felt the car was working well by the end of the session and the balance was good
6830235 this is a good start to the weekend for us all and i must say that it is a great circuit
6830236 i was really excited to go out there and give usain his third world record
6830237 one of the most challenging economic and policy environments in memory

6830342 instead of living up to the commitments it made to be allowed to host the olympic games the chinese government is using the olympics as a justification to crackdown on peaceful human rights activists censor foreign and domestic journalists and displace chinese individuals and families who have no legal recourse to protest the seizure of their homes or their land
6830343 from media reports we are now learning that the chinese government designated protest zones are a ruse for china to suppress dissent and imprison individuals who speak out against chinas policies
6830344 for instance wang xiuying and wu dianyuan two women in their late 70s have been sentenced to re education through labor for applying to hold a legal protest over the seizure of their homes for redevelopment
6830345 re education through labor is a brutal and arbitrary system of imprisonment where the recipient has no right to due process counsel or even a hearing
6830346 another individual ji sizun a self described grassroots legal activist from fujian province also applied for a permit for a legal protest
6830347 he was arrested on august 11 for asking for a permit
6830348 the international community must shine the spotlight on the ordinary indignities and lack of legal and human rights protections that chinese citizens face every day
6830349 world leaders attending the olympic games should use this opportunity to press chinas leaders to live up to the commitments made before being awarded the olympic games i call on the chinese government to respect the freedom of its own citizens both during the remaining few days of the olympic games and after they have concluded

6830510 there were rumours that the building would be demolished for a new library
6830511 when we evaluated the site it was clearly of heritage value to the area and obviously at risk as it is not listed on the citys heritage register so it was included at the last minute as one of our top 10 sites
6830512 it was part of the very earliest settlement of vancouver and provided housing for many people who worked in the downtown and in the port area
6830513 they didnt take a look at the complex and say two old heritage houses and a character building
6830514 the people who live in heatley block the majority feel very passionately about wanting to stay there
6830515 its got tons of character and it was well kept by the owners
6830516 the way this purchase was done it was very much below the radar
6830517 what came out of that was to place a library as close as possible to strathcona elementary school
6830518 and also no heritage buildings would be demolished in order to build a new library

6830573 that is what we tried to do we did get seven wickets in the second game and fought hard all the way because of the attacking options
6830574 it is a tough one but i think we played the right balance in dambulla
6830575 we will look at the pitch conditions and then make a decision we know that in dambulla batsmen had to take on the responsibility and try and get through the initial hours play that was crucial

6830623 at home workers have more free time and disposable money for recreation and vacation time than clock punchers and americans at large
6830624 because time consumption is associated with emotional experiences thinking about donating time reminds people of the happiness achieved through helping others
6830625 we argue that thinking about time activates goals of well being and beliefs involving personal happiness in contrast thinking about money suppresses such emotional goals and instead activates goals of economic utility and beliefs about attainment of such goals
6830626 this paper has important practical implications for both profit and non profit social organizations interested in cultivating ways to more effectively raise funds
6830627 i have become very concerned with the possibility that this administration may have violated federal law by using the resources of our intelligence agencies to influence domestic policy processes or opinion
6830628 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
6830629 he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
6830630 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
6830631 according to recent allegations in your capacity as the former cia deputy director of clandestine operations and chief of the near east division you were tasked by former cia director george tenet to create the false letter and may even have seen the white house stationery on which the false letter assignment was reportedly written
6830632 given your reported direct knowledge of these events i am requesting that you contact judiciary committee staff as soon as possible to set up a time to discuss your involvement and knowledge of the allegedly false letter

6830637 i feel honoured and privileged just to be part of the silver ferns unit so to be captain is just the icing on the cake
6830638 which is always a bit of a nerve racking thing when youre at trials and she really put it to me and asked if it was something i wanted to do i would never turn down that opportunity
6830639 ive still been doing my own training when you get to my age you dont stop otherwise you might seize up
6830640 the advice to me has been that it should be a postal referendum and my latest advice is that it will take until about mid next year to organise such a referendum properly
6830641 should a smack as part of good parental correction be a criminal offence in new zealand
6830642 it has been a long battle to assert the right of all new zealanders to be heard on this controversial issue
6830643 quite frankly in a democracy it should not require so much effort the referendum should be held at this years election
6830644 none of the reasons being given by the prime minister for delaying it make any sense at all and are simply a tactic for her to try to avoid this being an election issue
6830645 they put an enormous amount of effort time and money into it so it is not a surprise
6830646 we will continue to engage in the debate it is all part of the process of changing the culture of violence in this country
6830647 the fact that these people are so determined to change the law back again just gives us more of an opportunity to educate people as to why we shouldnt be able to legally hit our children
6830648 there is no such offence in new zealand law as smacking there never was and there isnt now there is an offence of assault on a child
6830649 ive heard national mps out and about basically dog whistling to the christian right
6830650 this one she just got out and it was just really unfortunate we just have our fingers crossed that its still alive and hopefully found somewhere warm and some food source we dont know what itll find at this time of year
6830651 its not like trying to find a horse or trying to find a sheep or something like that theyre up trees or inside bushes theyre just so mobile

6830654 kilpatrick is a superdelegate to the democratic national convention next week in denver
6830655 weve talked about our depth onto the ball carrier and our accuracy in the passing aspect of the game and its something weve just got to work harder at
6830656 sometimes though shifting the ball to the wing is not necessarily where the space may be and even if you do get it there you sometimes find the wrong people catching and passing in those areas
6830657 weve got to improve our phase play in our attack so that we can get momentum were probably missing out on a few opportunities by just being too flat in our attack which means were getting shut down too easily
6830658 weve been working on a few things to fix that like having a few dummy runners and also adjusting our depth so that we can get the ball into space
6830659 i think kicking is really important at this level of the game if you can put pressure on the opposition through a kick its a real asset to an attacking team if teams are going to be running all day theyre pretty easy to shut down because everyone can tackle
6830660 we cant get too carried away because i dont think auckland showed us as much as they could we were definitely excited and we definitely celebrated that night but you cant rest of your laurels in this competition and if we dont do the business against taranaki it last weeks win will have been wasted
6830661 sometimes i wanna be at peace so bad that i wish myself off of the earth
6830662 i was at a point where i kinda felt like i wanted to kill myself
6830663 white people have things like therapy black people have liquor stores and weed

6830665 hey bro you need some help you dont need to feel this way
6830666 80 of those who get treatment for depression get better yet quite sadly only 25 percent of those who need help get it
6830667 the treatment this country favors is to quarantine us in jails and prisons or to wait for the conditions to run their courses in us the carriers until we die out
6830668 hey bro its cool i know you are hurtin and i think you should get some help
6830669 ele glitter me falou que seu julgamento no vietn pa s condenado por praticamente todas as organiza es de justi a e direitos humanos como sendo um sistema de justi a injusta e julgamentos pol ticos foi uma farsa uma par dia da justi a
6830670 ele n o teve um julgamento justo e no momento devido isso ser tratado com maiores detalhes
6830671 weve got the bulk of our revenues still coming out of new zealand so i think the next obvious step is to try and take that across the tasman
6830672 were in an environment now where everybody is being ultra careful in making sure the numbers work cost of funds are higher what were really looking to do is find the right opportunities at the right price
6830673 why do our football teams perform so poorly count how many soccer pitches we have
6830674 investment from the government and from the society more broadly must rise year by year so that olympic sports receive full support in training nutrition medicine and technology
6830675 partly as a result of the below par performances of some of the worlds top athletes
6830676 gave chinese athletes confidence and showed them they can make it to the top

6830681 maar het is niet aan ons en dat vindt de nederlandse internetgemeenschap ook om daarin echt op te treden
6830682 this year weve had about 55 to 60 people enter and weve still had to turn some away due to being at capacity
6830683 we are probably going to have to find somewhere even bigger next year
6830684 at the start it was just a couple of mates mucking around we started getting serious about five years ago
6830685 i like the painting and building but at the end you play with it rather than it just sitting on the shelf
6830686 people have been so generous giving all sorts of items to help out and its definitely not just those involved in rallying and motorsport
6830687 to win in malaysia would be mind blowing the scholarship offered there is worth over a million dollars its not possible to finance something like that in new zealand so i will certainly be giving it my best shot
6830688 every little detail helps and i want to be totally prepared as best as i can to do the job
6830689 its hard to ask people to support you when many have been generous already but several people approached dad and i asking how they could help me so the evening and auction seemed the be the best way
6830690 should a smack as part of good parental correction be a criminal offence in new zealand
6830691 if you dont discipline when they are up to mischief you can end up with anarchy
6830692 as a father i used it as an absolute last resort and it hurt me more than it hurt them
6830693 i am a teacher and i do not see that smacking children is a good option
6830694 the question is too simplistic and quite ridiculous it really depends on what sort of smack a light smack never hurt anybody
6830695 none of the reasons being given by the prime minister for delaying it make any sense at all and are simply a tactic for her to try and avoid this being an election issue
6830696 she will not drown out the voice of the people and should realise there is no point further angering everyone by delaying the inevitable
6830697 just in terms of sheer organisation i dont think that is possible
6830698 its not our role to stop companies failing its up to management and directors to run the company properly and effectively
6830699 its our role to ensure they are complying with the trust deed and prospectus and offer documentation
6830700 our role is monitoring we are not a policeman or a judge its the role of regulators and the companys board
6830701 as long as the company is complying with their trust deed there is little we can do
6830702 we are entitled to rely on those certifications from directors and there are severe penalties for directors that lie to trustees which involve fines of up to 300 000 and up to five years in prison
6830703 unless weve got reason to believe otherwise we are entitled to rely on those from directors
6830704 we have quite onerous levels of responsibility as trustees and that is something we take very seriously so we are not going to be light handed in our approach
6830705 we have a big build on crude stocks and my educated guess is that there were ships that did not offload when tropical storm edouard came and then unloaded last week with
6830706 trading so far for the first half of the 2009 financial year has been very positive assisted by back orders we held at the beginning of the new financial year as well as particularly strong demand for our respiratory and acute care products
6830707 for the full year at current exchange rates we now expect to achieve an operating profit of approximately double the first half
6830708 there were tears in the girls eyes it was very emotional
6830709 they will be the best quality in town by a country mile
6830710 if the u s government allows fannie and freddie to fail and international investors are not compensated adequately the consequences will be catastrophic
6830711 if it is not the end of the world it is the end of the current international financial system
6830712 vlm airlines is honoured to receive this prestigious award which is a powerful endorsement of service from the people that really matter passengers we are dedicated to providing the highest levels of service and strive continually to set new standards
6830713 this award is particularly pleasing in that it demonstrates quality of service and service clearly matter to customers on short haul services vlm airlines were strongly supported in this survey category and were frequently singled out for the high standards of staff service they deliver the award is very much a recognition of the those customer facing staff
6830714 we are coming apart at the seams in every sense
6830715 nearly two months to have a pair of trousers mended which had been torn by a not completely screwed down screw on a jump seat meanwhile alitalia is back in the news with plans of new cuts they want to make but i have already made my cuts
6830716 once again we are short of cutlery so i am hard at work washing re washing and drying
6830717 there is a meal missing either it wasnt loaded or there are more passengers than we had booked
6830718 the undercarriage is nude without mudguards the plane can only fly if it doesnt rain we are fine until the end of september but only in the south nothing to put security at risk
6830719 if one is not in line with the norms and dictates alitalia does not take off
6830720 international statistics confirm that alitalia is one of the most secure airlines in the world
6830721 perhaps aviator az does not take into account the delicate situation in which we find ourselves

6830736 the advice to me has been that it should be a postal referendum and my latest advice is that it will take until about mid next year to organise such a referendum properly
6830737 should a smack as part of good parental correction be a criminal offence in new zealand
6830738 it has been a long battle to assert the right of all new zealanders to be heard on this controversial issue
6830739 quite frankly in a democracy it should not require so much effort the referendum should be held at this years election
6830740 none of the reasons being given by the prime minister for delaying it make any sense at all and are simply a tactic for her to try to avoid this being an election issue
6830741 they put an enormous amount of effort time and money into it so it is not a surprise
6830742 we will continue to engage in the debate it is all part of the process of changing the culture of violence in this country
6830743 the fact that these people are so determined to change the law back again just gives us more of an opportunity to educate people as to why we shouldnt be able to legally hit our children
6830744 there is no such offence in new zealand law as smacking there never was and there isnt now there is an offence of assault on a child
6830745 ive heard national mps out and about basically dog whistling to the christian right
6830746 i feel honoured and privileged just to be part of the silver ferns unit so to be captain is just the icing on the cake
6830747 which is always a bit of a nerve racking thing when youre at trials and she really put it to me and asked if it was something i wanted to do i would never turn down that opportunity
6830748 ive still been doing my own training when you get to my age you dont stop otherwise you might seize up
6830749 if it aint broke dont fix it is the ioc mantra
6830750 weve talked about our depth onto the ball carrier and our accuracy in the passing aspect of the game and its something weve just got to work harder at
6830751 sometimes though shifting the ball to the wing is not necessarily where the space may be and even if you do get it there you sometimes find the wrong people catching and passing in those areas
6830752 weve got to improve our phase play in our attack so that we can get momentum were probably missing out on a few opportunities by just being too flat in our attack which means were getting shut down too easily
6830753 weve been working on a few things to fix that like having a few dummy runners and also adjusting our depth so that we can get the ball into space
6830754 i think kicking is really important at this level of the game if you can put pressure on the opposition through a kick its a real asset to an attacking team if teams are going to be running all day theyre pretty easy to shut down because everyone can tackle
6830755 we cant get too carried away because i dont think auckland showed us as much as they could we were definitely excited and we definitely celebrated that night but you cant rest of your laurels in this competition and if we dont do the business against taranaki it last weeks win will have been wasted
6830756 this one she just got out and it was just really unfortunate we just have our fingers crossed that its still alive and hopefully found somewhere warm and some food source we dont know what itll find at this time of year
6830757 its not like trying to find a horse or trying to find a sheep or something like that theyre up trees or inside bushes theyre just so mobile
6830758 sedimentation nutrient enrichment toxic pollution and faecal contamination are all serious problems
6830759 the levels of e coli in both rivers are not considered suitable for recreation
6830760 if e coli is in there above critical levels then that indicates there could be all sorts of things in the water which could cause gastroenteritis and other infections
6830761 if the water is contaminated any amount could cause health problems
6830762 i have noticed that a lot of our members are getting stomach problems i get them quite regularly
6830763 my doctor asked me if i had been to a third world country i said i had been paddling on the lower avon he said that would do it
6830764 you have water that can splash in your mouth or if you have a drink bottle in the canoe it can drip onto your mouthpiece
6830765 when you become ill it certainly upsets your performance for a while its quite debilitating
6830766 sometimes people ask if they should swim in the river we tell them thats not a good idea
6830767 they will continue to be degraded and the consequences of that are less biodiversity and the endgame is that it is going to be a very lonely place for us if theres no other sorts of animals around
6830768 there wont be any of the pretty things for us to go and look at
6830769 when you wash your car think about the water and where that water goes run off from your roof where does that go its all about thinking about that water and what happens to it
6830770 at all times private boylan has shown the highest degree of jungle craft
6830771 he has remained cheerful and reliant in all operations despite the physical and mental strain he undergoes as a leading scout on anti terrorist operations
6830772 it might be the blood of my ancestors still flows through my blood because i enjoyed going out there in the jungle
6830773 there was more received posthumously than those left alive thats how long we have been waiting im glad to be alive to receive it i am very proud to receive this for my kids
6830774 the conflicts are often referred to as the forgotten wars its a conflict many people in new zealand have forgotten about but let me tell you the malaysians havent forgotten about it they are very very thankful they had allies like us
6830775 you dont get an mid for nothing so its important we have this ceremony today to recognise that performance on operations we have a very proud history
6830776 well im here anyway and i dont have to anything other than start hitting things
6830777 go and find 8 of this plant for no reason
6830778 this is like a gold for me after what ive been through and i wouldnt have said that before
6830779 i hope i dont wake up grumpy but it is such a relief
6830780 it would have been nice to have a medal but ive already got one and there are some insanely competitive paddlers out there who havent
6830781 i was thinking i could sneak a gold out there
6830782 i wasnt really looking i just had my head in my own boat and i felt if i looked across it wouldnt boost my confidence
6830783 i just wanted to finish my race and put in as much physically as i could that was reflected with 100m to go when i got the wobbles
6830784 im going to chill and reconnect with the wider perspective of life
6830785 the last four years have been so intense and there is a little bit more to life than that
6830786 ive hammered myself 24 hours a day seven days a week for four years so its taken its toll i need to take some time out and hopefully comeback with a healthier approach to the game
6830787 we got to the final 100m and i thought this is the olympics and put more effort into every stroke but we fell apart in that final 100m and other crews came through on the inside
6830788 i just sort of sat there and a few tears rolled down my face
6830789 it just happened so quick and in the race that can change your life
6830790 i had a bit of a scream back when i got up and noticed that my back wheel was taco ed that was the end of my lap there
6830791 to have someone else ruin my race for me thats the most disappointing thing i dont know what to think right now im a bit down on it all really
6830792 i think bmx has added a different demographic to the whole olympic tradition i dont know if people were ready for it or expecting it but this is a really exciting course and a lot of people were entertained so mission accomplished
6830793 with all the hype leading up to it we needed to perform and put on a great show
6830794 if we didnt do that then it would kind of just die
6830795 but i think we put on a great show and we showed everyone that the sport is really awesome and hopefully well be back in 2012 in london putting on an even better show
6830796 its gold or nothing she pushed the pace but as the 19 year old world champ careered around the final corner home straight looming rider and bike were parted and reade hit the deck
6830797 ive cut my shoulder open it sounds like the usual monday morning injury inventory of former rugby league legend mark graham
6830798 the advice to me has been that it should be a postal referendum and my latest advice is that it will take until about mid next year to organise such a referendum properly
6830799 should a smack as part of good parental correction be a criminal offence in new zealand
6830800 it has been a long battle to assert the right of all new zealanders to be heard on this controversial issue
6830801 quite frankly in a democracy it should not require so much effort the referendum should be held at this years election
6830802 none of the reasons being given by the prime minister for delaying it make any sense at all and are simply a tactic for her to try to avoid this being an election issue
6830803 they put an enormous amount of effort time and money into it so it is not a surprise
6830804 we will continue to engage in the debate it is all part of the process of changing the culture of violence in this country
6830805 the fact that these people are so determined to change the law back again just gives us more of an opportunity to educate people as to why we shouldnt be able to legally hit our children
6830806 there is no such offence in new zealand law as smacking there never was and there isnt now there is an offence of assault on a child
6830807 ive heard national mps out and about basically dog whistling to the christian right
6830808 this one she just got out and it was just really unfortunate we just have our fingers crossed that its still alive and hopefully found somewhere warm and some food source we dont know what itll find at this time of year
6830809 its not like trying to find a horse or trying to find a sheep or something like that theyre up trees or inside bushes theyre just so mobile
6830810 while the country is affected by a number of socio economic challenges we find it inappropriate for government to finance some activities that are neither national priority nor interest such as the trip that has been undertaken by the emakhosikati to his majesty the king children aides bodyguards and their maids we are demanding that the minister of finance show us the budgetary line for covering the costs of the emakhosikatis trip
6830811 with this march we want to drive home the point that we people who are living with hiv aids are not happy about the way our money is being used
6830812 right now we have hiv patients who cant afford to take their medication because they cant afford food wfp world food programme and other donor agencies cant keep up with the demand for food
6830813 we cant afford a shopping trip when a quarter of the nation lives on food aid
6830814 the queens have to look radiant and that is why they have to go and buy quality for the big day they were being spoiled
6830815 those given the money do not even contribute a cent to the money they are looting
6830816 we are against the idea of public funds being used in a questionable way by people who are not employed and do not bring any revenue to the countrys coffers
6830817 i have never heard of women marching all i know is that a woman has to seek permission from her husband to register her disagreement with whatever was happening in society but not for her to march that is un swazi
6830818 after the democratic national convention ends there will be hundreds of marijuana cases all showing up at the same time
6830819 its certainly not our function to vote on suspending laws for a certain period of time
6830820 if something occurs in front of us were going to act
6830821 trading so far for the first half of the 2009 financial year has been very positive assisted by back orders we held at the beginning of the new financial year as well as particularly strong demand for our respiratory and acute care products
6830822 for the full year at current exchange rates we now expect to achieve an operating profit of approximately double the first half
6830823 we had to organise another way off the mountain if there had been an emergency or an accident we wouldnt have been able to leave it could have been a disaster
6830824 we will still be forking out a lot for this its just another blow for us after topec was burgled in february
6830825 because it is so isolated the area lends itself to that kind of behaviour and its forever getting hammered
6830826 we find burnt out cars cars pushed down into gullies and dropped diesel toilets get vandalised and i think boyracers have donut competitions up there as well
6830827 we find new damage or cars at least once every fortnight its a hell of a cost to us and it gets worse in summer because its warmer and there are more visitors to target
6830828 those kind of people dont seem to have any respect for anyone
6830829 state house tenants have obligations under their tenancy agreements with housing new zealand
6830830 one of them is that tenants live in the state home provided to them
6830831 if they do not need to live in the home we will give it to someone else who does
6830832 weve tried every avenue weve tried a lot of friends but theres no one else
6830833 i want housing new zealand to give me back my house
6830834 theres a 63 year old heart patient and myself thrown out on the street sleeping in a car and i dont think its a fair go
6830835 it gets cold you cant get comfortable and im cold and shaking and it feels to me like im going to have a big turn
6830836 i dont like invading other peoples privacy either i want my own space
6830837 we had everything in there we thought it would all be gone but not all was lost
6830838 were devastated but well get on and order replacements some things might arrive straight away and some things might take months but we start again in the first week of october
6830839 i checked when the hall was burning and premiums were paid up until 2005 but i havent been able to find anything beyond that
6830840 its not guaranteed they will get the grant but were willing to accept applications these are exceptional circumstances
6830841 i understand a couple of things might be salvageable but i dont hold much hope
6830842 a terceira vez que poso nua estou muito feliz porque um conceito diferente do que se tem visto nas revistas masculinas sou toda natural de f brica
6830843 agora ser o s ensaios com celebridades eu sou a primeira dessa nova fase com novos conceitos de ensaio de entrevista totalmente reformulada
6830844 our decision making under pressure wasnt good we made too many mistakes and lost our composure
6830845 we had the winning of the game but let it slip
6830846 we need all 15 players on the park with players out your defensive line is stretched and the effort takes its toll
6830847 theyre a very strong side the way they played against auckland was very good it was one of the better performances of the air new zealand cup this season
6830848 theyre a young side but very talented most have come through the new zealand age group system
6830849 now is the time to turn things around its 80 minutes and anything can happen well certainly go into this contest with a belief to challenge canterbury across the board
6830850 we were so patriotic when we were there on the streets
6830851 hes happy to do three or four days per week and then celebrate life with me that is the way to go
6830852 i just woke up one day looking at my husband and i said i dont know but i have a very strange feeling i have to go to new zealand he said why new zealand i said i dont know
6830853 they wanted me to start straight away but i had a holiday planned
6830854 he carried my suitcases up to the room he didnt leave me in the hotel reception he took everything to the room he made sure i had everything i need he opened the fridge door to see if there was water or not otherwise he would go and buy some for me
6830855 people were helping me carrying me from the hospital to work to groceries to work to everywhere i felt so good and so important
6830856 when you leave your husband behind to pack everything and you dont know really when he is going to come and how many things he is going to forget in calgary and you are here starting a new job new responsibility it was a little bit stressful and without these peoples help i would not be here today
6830857 it was raining it was a little bit too cold for me because the southerly winds were blowing i was surprised i didnt see any penguins at the corner it was so damn cold
6830858 right now we are renting a house that was built in 1930 and we are suffering a little bit but it is a good suffering because we cuddle more and we have a romantic evening almost every night when the fire is on and good wine helps you know
6830859 everybody says oh this weather it just recently happened i dont think so its a country surrounded by water its winter its raining
6830860 we love eating fresh fish anytime we want this is something i will never take for granted
6830861 as soon as i open my mouth that i am romanian somebody says a lady here in new plymouth has just finalised her papers adopting a boy from romania
6830862 second question how do you like kiwiland how do you like it i love it
6830863 i will never ever know by heart whole rules because i think they make them as they go
6830864 you dont have to drive hundreds of kilometres to find something outstanding its at your door
6830865 you know where the wind is coming from the smell
6830866 the scent reminds me of medieval times lovers bringing to female lovers a little gift of appreciation i am very touched by this
6830867 you can love somebody in so many ways and you have a word for the different ways but in english you say i love you and you assume everything
6830868 as soon as i open my mouth the accent you can hear it is bloody strong and i am happy about that im not ashamed im romanian great people great history
6830869 i was tired of lies of black market that was something which i could not cope anymore with because i knew a decent life didnt require that
6830870 i was earning very pathetic wages the only thing on my mind was to leave romania and go to work in a decent environment and a decent country
6830871 i said you never ask first and second i didnt want to impose
6830872 police officers need to be safe from offending like this when they are carrying out their duty
6830873 there are a lot words i could use right now to describe how im feeling about it but you couldnt print them
6830874 its just a reminder to shop keepers who are selling spray paint to make sure they sell to people who are over 18
6830875 there is parity in this game ive always known the rest of the world is catching us up
6830876 175 000 to 180 000 fans came through the softball gate more than in atlanta in 1996 and athens in 2004 but short of sydneys record of 197 000
6830877 vehemently disagrees that state regulatory actions or inactions support this position
6830878 porque saben que cuando estas leyes comienza a funcionar ser para beneficio del pueblo
6830879 estaban en manos de los capitalistas y ahora pasar al pueblo
6830880 they will be the best quality in town by a country mile
6830881 it therefore falls on the journalistic fraternity to evolve institutional checks and safeguards that are specific to the electronic media
6830882 yes but the ute is based on the commodore while hilux isnt based on a camry
6830883 im gonna sit on the porch and pick on my old guitar
6830884 now heres something youve never ever seen before which i think is the only one in the world
6830885 they found that if you leave somebody laying in bed for a fortnight before you start making limbs they think aaah im going to be like this for the rest of my life and so we used to get them up the next day and have things ready for them
6830886 ten thousand or more people a year is a lot of visitors
6830887 which is like asking a blind man to paint a picture
6830888 a better job can be done when you see the patient rather than just a name on a piece of paper
6830889 grizzly bear is my favorite band in the whole world
6830890 radiohead avait il y a quelques mois et conjointement avec la cha ne de cartoons anyboom
6830891 you learn to have a lot patience while youre excavating once you know youre going to find something you get so excited and just want to get down to it but you have to keep the technical aspect in mind
6830892 the fact that we got five weeks of lab experience in addition to the fieldwork experience is great it gave us a look at everything it would be so rewarding to see some of our artifacts in an exhibit someday i just love archaeology
6830893 this is a great honor for me ive always had a passion for teaching and that matches well with what grand valley strives to achieve
6830894 this is my ninth year here and from day one ive always been impressed with everyones commitment to the student at grand valley its a powerful synergy and it helps keep me excited about my teaching
6830895 professor grissom has been an inspiration to undergraduate students in computer science at grand valley
6830896 whats more he has made his insights and best practices in the classroom accessible to others through scholarship on teaching and learning that is highly acclaimed in his field professor grissoms positive impact extends far beyond the local arena and grand valley is fortunate indeed to have him as a faculty member
6830897 this award meant so much to me i felt very honored to not only receive the award but also that my athletic director nominated me
6830898 i love interacting and working with students in the training room and at their athletic events
6830899 it is rewarding to see an athlete return to competition after an injury and to see all of the emotions and hard work they go through in order to return
6830900 they told me about the program and their career i loved sports and i knew that i was not going to be a professional basketball or softball player and i thought this would be a great career to stay involved in athletics
6830901 i had a great experience at grand valley but i dont think i would be where i am today without doug woods he was the softball coach as well as the head athletic trainer at the time he was a great teacher coach mentor and he always offered very valuable advice
6830902 the conference is basically three days of people reading papers on their current research my paper deals with the smells and odors discussed in martials poems for martial and the romans a persons ability to perceive and evaluate smells was a sign of his cultural sophistication ideally having a good smell should mean that you are sophisticated but in martials poems the people who smelled good were often those who were trying to cover something up

6830913 it can do anything good or anything bad to the tribes and the indian people as citizen indians
6830914 by cushioning the first round economic impact of the financial stress we hoped also to minimize the risks of a so called adverse feedback loop in which economic weakness exacerbates financial stress which in turn further damages economic prospects
6830915 intended to mitigate what have been at times very severe strains in short term funding markets and by providing an additional source of financing to allow banks and other financial institutions to de leverage in a more orderly manner
6830916 was severely complicated by the lack of a clear statutory framework
6830917 it all depends upon the discussions i will be having with the senior upa leaders

6831047 because of the security gains that have been realized since the president ordered five additional brigades and marines into iraq last january

6831070 operations research offers a powerful set of tools that have been used successfully in everything from world war ii to wal mart style logistics planning these tools ought to be used to increase the success of existing programs and to help expand access to hiv care and treatment in resource limited countries
6831071 for example operations research could help with the planning of a national drug distribution system or with predicting the demand for services at local clinics and the best ways to staff them
6831072 to date hiv treatment scale up has appropriately focused first on policy level issues such as program initiation and costs and secondarily on operational level issues
6831073 now that many programs are in place the potential gains from improved planning are great especially given the high cost of antiretroviral drug therapy
6831074 the analysis suggested that implementation of such a program could allow the government of rwanda to scale up hiv treatment without overburdening its existing health care system
6831075 the unique advantage of operations research is that it gives us the ability to evaluate and optimize outcomes of various scenarios such as determining the best approach for the management of lab equipment repair without impacting patients
6831076 once we have the evidence for a new approach a good case can be made that it should be implemented as policy although any initiative should take into account the environments in which the projects are to be carried out with all necessary ethical cultural and political considerations
6831077 placing greater emphasis on long term strategic planning and increasing the attention and resources directed to capacity building for sustainability
6831078 while laudable progress has been made the great majority of hiv patients are still under treated or untreated
6831079 we feel that operations research provides one of the tools to make sure progress continues
6831080 this area of research and specifically this and other projects led by drs hupert and xiong shows how fields such as the engineering sciences can contribute to solving medical and public health problems
6831081 its almost the perfect storm when people get sick they cannot get a timely appointment with their primary care provider and they have to wait for hours to be seen in a crowded emergency department

6831193 focus on the financial conditions of individual institutions in isolation
6831194 risk concentrations that might be acceptable at a single institution could be dangerous
6831195 in warning against excessive concentrations or common exposures across the banking system regulators need not make a judgment about whether a particular asset class is mispriced
6831196 have a way of migrating to other financial firms or markets
6831197 the expectations of the public would have to be managed carefully
6831198 default by a major nonbank financial institution is judged to carry significant systemic risks
6831199 in this regard the recent decline in commodity prices as well as the increased stability of the dollar has been encouraging if not reversed these developments together with a pace of growth that is likely to fall short of potential for a time should lead inflation to moderate later this year and next year
6831200 viol nuestras tradiciones al ejecutar movimientos excitantes mientras cantaba en marina
6831201 the occ is essentially saying that if banks cant trick or cheat consumers they wont be able to offer credit
6831202 it is outrageous that the federal regulator overseeing the banking industry is so out of step with the needs of millions of americans unfairly trapped in debt by abusive credit card practices
6831203 better disclosure of unfair practices is not real consumer protection
6831204 consumers should have the confidence of knowing that their interest rates wont skyrocket if the bill or payment gets lost in the mail
6831205 the occs argument that credit will dry up unless banks can engage in questionable lending practices sounds eerily similar to the arguments made by the mortgage industry right before the current foreclosure crisis
6831206 the mortgage meltdown demonstrates the importance of ending abusive lending practices when warning signs arise we urge the federal reserve board to adopt these critical protections against unfair credit card practices
6831207 the day my mama socked it to the nehalem valley
6831208 445 726 acres of vested property out of 643 140 acres ended up in encroachment across the country
6831209 grabbers gabbled up more than two thirds of vested property as the government lost control over the lands as the custodian and its long line dithering blocked anti encroachment efforts
6831210 we all know how important it is for a city to have green spaces these are often not noticed until they are uprooted and a high rise built when i visited shanghai in april i was amazed to learn that 38 percent of this incredibly expensive land was devoted to green space and parks both of which are used on a daily basis the boost in green space construction in the city adds fresh elements to urban life with a return to nature improves peoples living conditions and helps them lead more healthy lives as a gardener i know how important it is to have trees and flowers and grass we just cannot live in a concrete jungle the percentage of green space in peoples living environment has a positive association with the perceived general health of residents green space seems to be more than just a luxury and consequently the development of green space should be allocated a more central position in planning
6831211 the way they play against us and that pitching it should keep them in every game
6831212 im hoping were going to find out why theyre in fourth place in the al east every time we play them its not been fun
6831213 he threw a lot of strikes got deep into the game
6831214 we have to start stringing together some wins we cant just keep winning one here losing one there weve got to get on a streak here hopefully that can start friday night
6831215 we have to do better if we want to play in october
6831216 weve seen him make plenty of catches like that and im glad he didnt make it
6831217 my shoulder tightened up a little bit but im not coming out of the game because of something like that
6831218 it should be fine im not planning on missing my next start
6831219 its just as frustrating but the good thing is we won this game
6831220 n o existe solu o como esta no brasil o post social funciona como um publicador de conte dos em portugu s

6831222 in a dream you saw a way to survive and you were full of joy
6831223 i wonder did your brother ever meet little al who used to run a record store in greenwich village
6831224 ive never been on a team that has hit like this been on this kind of stretch
6831225 youre going to lose some tough ones but what really matters is what you do after that
6831226 its all about starting pitching and wednesday our starter had a tough outing
6831227 the bottom line is the model tells us how much growth the child has made and whether that growth is good enough to meet state standards
6831228 i stayed back and was getting ahead of the hitters i wasnt trying to make the ball move i was just trying to throw the ball and let it move by itself
6831229 my entire career depends on me getting off this list
6831230 i probably wont be able to get a job anywhere else in the world having this mark that im on this list
6831231 it is quite clear when the government does something that takes away not just your job but your occupation your career they have to provide you with some means to clear your name
6831232 i have no idea why i am on the list and theyre not telling officially that im even on the list
6831233 unfortunately it is a problem that is shared by countless individuals who have no connection to terrorism have no connection to crime and dont belong on this list
6831234 the problem with what the government is doing is that they really dont care about innocent casualties
6831235 we served in a war and theyre thumbing their noses at us basically and that makes me feel really sad about this situation

6831242 we knew people were writing about it everywhere now we want to win a couple more
6831243 theres no laying down in the game of baseball youve got to always be on your toes and be ready
6831244 it was definitely a start youve got to forget about
6831245 its very rare that you get the opportunity to add a pitcher like greg even one time let alone twice
6831246 hes one of the greatest pitchers of all time and weve already seen what he can add to a team both on the field and in the clubhouse
6831247 he studies hitters and he told me how he pitches to them
6831248 he gave me a couple tips during the game based on what he saw guys doing both times it worked believe it or not
6831249 every guy in that room knows we can hit better
6831250 hay que ser honesto y aceptar que son mejores que nosotros
6831251 son un gran equipo quer amos estar a menos de 20 puntos pero al final perdimos muchos intentos de triple y ellos las met an la diferencia pudo haber sido de diez puntos
6831252 ustedes lo vieron jugar estaba lastimado y con dolor pero no es una lesi n que represente un peligro es un jugador duro que puede soportar el dolor
6831253 se le suma el hecho de que estados unidos tiene un equipo con una capacidad t cnica y atl tica formidables tienen lectura del partido son solidarios y siempre se reparten la pelota
6831254 tuvimos que duplicar el esfuerzo y luego lo pagamos con la fatiga
6831255 estados unidos saca ventaja de todo eso por su gran rotaci n
6831256 una sensaci n muy grande por el car cter del equipo argentino me siento orgullo de ellos
6831257 para m era el jugador m s determinante en este torneo

6831261 but i feel as though i didnt actually pick them they somehow picked themselves each one surfaced from deep down in my earliest memories and affections and kept me company with late night relentlessly seductive guitar grooves
6831262 the surprise is that it seems to put a smile on everyones face
6831263 if you cant be a good example be a horrible warning
6831264 me alegra mucho estar nuevamente con ustedes los atletas que han merecidamente conquistado el honor de llevar la bandera nacional a la competencia deportiva m s importante del mundo
6831265 me llena de satisfacci n el nombrarles representantes de m xico en los juegos paral mpicos beijing 2008 y sabemos muy bien que pondr n muy en alto el nombre de m xico
6831266 hace poco menos de un a o me reun con ustedes para celebrar los grandes triunfos que le dieron a m xico en los juegos parapanamericanos en r o de janeiro conf o en que su participaci n en la paraolimpiada va a ser igualmente exitosa
6831267 nuestros mejores representantes deportivos porque cubren a m xico de gloria y dar como los grandes atletas que son todo de s en la competencia
6831268 admiramos su capacidad para superar la adversidad para poner siempre la mirada sobre el nuevo reto y alcanzar nuevos triunfos
6831269 como dijo bien juan ignacio reyes de nataci n sa es la actitud que necesitamos para construir el m xico que necesitamos un m xico ganador y de ganadores una visi n que inspira nuestro compromiso con ustedes y nuestra responsabilidad con el bien com n de los mexicanos
6831270 por eso el gobierno federal est y estar con ustedes con miras a su participaci n ol mpica hemos apoyado a su esfuerzo respondimos a una demanda justa de nuestros deportistas paral mpicos al crear por primera vez en la historia un programa de becas especial para ustedes
6831271 hemos apoyado con casi 30 millones de pesos para el entrenamiento de nuestros atletas para estos juegos paral mpicos
6831272 s bien que adem s de destinar recursos hay muchas tareas que debemos atender s que se necesita dar mucho mayor apoyo al deporte en todas su reas
6831273 se necesita mayor promoci n para que podamos detectar talentos mayor difusi n para que la gente practique m s el deporte requerimos m s infraestructura para que m s mexicanos practiquen el deporte de manera cotidiana
6831274 mientras los mexicanos no hagamos del deporte una pr ctica cotidiana no podremos alcanzar los lugares que m xico merece por el tama o de su poblaci n y la juventud de su gente
6831275 una manera de combatir la inseguridad es precisamente rescatando espacios p blicos y abriendo oportunidades para el deporte para los j venes abriendo alternativas para la pr ctica del deporte como un sano esparcimiento como un instrumento de disciplina personal y de formaci n f sica y espiritual adecuada
6831276 para lo cual tenemos que ampliar de manera decidida las capacidades para la pr ctica del deporte en las escuelas los barrios y rancher as por razones de desarrollo personal y humano por razones de seguridad de saludad tendremos que hacer del deporte en m xico una pr ctica cotidiana accesible para todos
6831277 precisamente es as como combatimos no s lo a trav s de la persecuci n de los delincuentes sino tambi n a trav s del combate a las causas sociales de estos problemas que queremos superar
6831278 estoy seguro que juntos podemos transformar a m xico en un pa s m s ordenado justo y seguro con la participaci n activa de todos los mexicanos
6831279 sabemos que ustedes pondr n muy en alto el nombre de m xico sabemos que ondear la bandera nacional y que con ustedes entonaremos nuestro himno cuando su esfuerzo sea coronado con el xito con el triunfo
6831280 todo m xico estar con ustedes estaremos sigui ndolos y alent ndolos desde aqu en su esfuerzo que ser coronado con el xito enhorabuena y a poner a m xico en el medallero

6831288 we continue to put ourselves in position day in and day out to win games
6831289 we have a good team we have good chemistry a lot of things are really working in our favor right now
6831290 it was a big win for us were really confident weve been able to find a way to win ballgames that is something we werent doing early in the year
6831291 i didnt feel like i had to pitch around anything
6831292 more than anything were throwing the ball better were pitching better here at home and thats a big part of it
6831293 there has been no definite determination of what adams role is except that hes due to pitch friday
6831294 well get him ready to go and then see where he fits in the best
6831295 i expect to go out there and compete and do very well im snapping the ball as hard or harder than i have all year
6831296 i wanted to come off a bad outing and get a good win
6831297 if you cant be a good example be a horrible warning
6831298 after an extensive evaluation we decide that it is in our best interest to move our business forward and allow other major players in the oil industry to enjoy the benefits that have been almost exclusive to our client for well over a decade our newest version of ssi was developed in conjunction with real pipeline schedulers from around the world to fulfill all their requirements for scheduling a pipeline
6831299 high performance gloss coating suitable for concrete steel and other commonly used building materials features include high build low odor non yellowing white and fade resistant colors easy cleanup and stain abrasion chemical and moisture resistance good exterior performance
6831300 im not going to say i wasnt thinking about ichiro being on deck
6831301 hes a finesse guy and the combination of nerves and working on three days rest probably had something to do with him not locating it as well as when hes relaxed
6831302 he just wasnt in the strike zone often and when it was it was in the wrong location
6831303 weve played well on the road the last few times out we won five games wed like to win them all but well take our five and go home
6831304 i have to sit down and figure it out its one thing after another its stressing me its no fun right now i feel like im letting my team down
6831305 the big thing in the major leagues and its something im learning you have to capitalize on the chances you have the more we start doing that the better off were going to be
6831306 i think hes in a lot better place than when he joined us
6831307 i just think he fatigued a little bit in the sixth inning
6831308 what happened in 06 is in the past im not thinking too much about the no hitter i just want to stay out there more innings seven eight nine innings
6831309 i made one mistake i guess thats what it comes down to
6831310 it put a little length between us and l a
6831311 weve got to get ourselves back on the winning track right now and do whatever it takes to win ballgames we cant worry about how it puts us in the standings weve got to win
6831312 voy a presentar en la fiscal a dos pruebas que tengo poseo dos correos electr nicos no s si tendr n toda la veracidad del caso la fiscal a se encargar de investigar si eso es as o no
6831313 l es aut nomo de decir lo que quiera pero primero debe tener las pruebas contundentes de lo que va a denunciar si son pruebas contundentes que la justicia legal ordinaria y deportiva operen contra cualquiera de nosotros a los que se les compruebe algo
6831314 que me vuelvan a multar pero tiene que haber una depuraci n del arbitraje
6831315 es m s la firmaron todos los rbitros del pa s que est n en desacuerdo con tantas cr ticas malintencionadas de muchas personas
6831316 llegamos a un punto en que ya merecemos respeto reconocemos que s nos equivocamos pero como est n las cosas va a llegar el momento en que un hincha va a tomar represalias contra los rbitros
6831317 as como no nos gusta que los equipos veten rbitros tampoco vamos a estar de acuerdo con que los jueces determinen vetar a los equipos
6831318 hoy partimos con el pie derecho pero evidentemente es demasiado temprano como para establecer c mo nos comparamos con la oposici n
6831319 la puesta a punto de hoy no es mala pero todav a hay mucho margen para mejorar
6831320 el primer d a fue dif cil para todos especialmente en los puntos de freno
6831321 pero hemos mejorado el autom vil carrera a carrera y ahora estamos en posici n de estar entre los seis primeros clasificados y conseguir puntos en las carreras

6831517 we believe the six principles are clear and already implemented
6831518 we have a presence of so called russian peacekeeping forces at key georgian choke points that will control economic life it will control humanitarian activities thats why clarifications are so important

6831559 after the olympics the reform effort that has been stalled by the pressures of hosting a major international event could be restarted
6831560 if those freedoms can be extended to chinese journalists that could be one of the positive results of the games

6831562 china was trying to send a message to the outside world that it was willing to take measures to open up but internally the main concern was preserving stability and i dont think that after the games that will change so much

6831626 the europeans have to hope that these shales will do for them what eastern shales have done for the u s gas supply which is to boost the main supply that is coming from the gulf of mexico
6831627 that would reduce the prices the russians were able to charge the final consumers in europe
6831628 huge interest not just from locals but also from as far away as canada and australia

6831661 which is more important the number of houses cindy mccain owns or the number of houses obamas friends have blown up
6831662 in an attempt to make something stick barack obama has re aired his dirty laundry with convicted felon tony rezko that led to a highly questionable land deal rezkos dirty dealings are well documented and his relationship with barack obama goes back 20 years
6831663 attack cindy she owns the homes i thought he said the wives were off limits
6831664 obama engaged in deal with convicted felon to get deal on house that had four fireplaces and a wine cellar
6831665 two years ago obama bought a mansion on the south side in the kenwood neighborhood from a doctor on the same day antoin tony rezkos wife rita rezko bought the vacant lot next door from the same seller the doctor had listed the properties for sale together he sold the house to obama for 300 000 below the asking price the doctor got his asking price on the lot from rezkos wife
6831666 on the same day obama closed on his house rezkos wife bought the adjacent empty lot meeting the condition of the seller who wanted to sell both properties at the same time
6831667 later the obamas bought a 10 foot by 150 foot piece of the lot for 104 500 an appraisal put the value of the strip at 40 500 a spokesman said but obama considered it fair to pay one sixth of the original price for one sixth of the lot
6831668 a federal jury today convicted developer antoin tony rezko of corruption charges for trading on his clout as a top adviser and fundraiser to gov rod blagojevich rezkos guilty verdict on 16 of 24 corruption counts could have broad repercussions for blagojevich who made rezko a central player in his kitchen cabinet it could also prove a political liability for u s sen barack obama who once counted rezko as a friend and fundraiser as the likely democratic presidential nominee heads into the general election campaign against republican john mccain the jury convicted rezko of wire and mail fraud money laundering and aiding and abetting bribery he was acquitted of attempted extortion
6831669 when obama and his wife michelle a hospital executive decided to move with their two young girls from their hyde park condominium they chose a spacious three story georgian revival home on a tree lined street in the kenwood neighborhood not far from the university of chicago the owner had listed the house nearly 100 years old with four fireplaces and a wine cellar and an adjacent lot as separate parcels
6831670 as a state senator barack obama wrote letters to city and state officials supporting his political patron tony rezkos successful bid to get more than 14 million from taxpayers to build apartments for senior citizens
6831671 obamas letters written nearly nine years ago for the first time show the democratic presidential hopeful did a political favor for rezko a longtime friend campaign fund raiser and client of the law firm where obama worked who was indicted last fall on federal charges that accuse him of demanding kickbacks from companies seeking state business under gov blagojevich
6831672 the letters appear to contradict a statement last december from obama who told the chicago tribune that in all the years hes known rezko ive never done any favors for him
6831673 for the first time sen barack obama put a figure friday to the amount of campaign contributions that indicted political fund raiser tony rezko raised for the senators campaigns and the number about 250 000 was far more than he previously acknowledged
6831674 wed obama and rezko continue to have lunches or breakfasts wed talk about politics wed talk about family
6831675 in terms of other than lunch or breakfast he and i had socially michelle and i probably had a couple of dinners or two or three dinners with rezko and his wife during the course of this six or seven or eight years
6831676 barack and michelle obama visited their home in lake geneva once for the day

6831683 when people in this worn looking city near pittsburgh lament how the sagging economy is slowly crushing them some are also quick to add how much hillary clinton could help them
6831684 with that in mind i believe that the best candidate for philadelphia is the one who has not only ideas but the skills to implement them is willing to embrace change while also working in collaboration with us at the local level is experienced and willing to extend a helping hand and possesses both good judgment and a profound sense of social justice based on those criteria ive made my decision on which candidate i support i have endorsed senator hillary clinton hillary clinton has an impressive 35 year record of fighting on behalf of working families and children fighting for universal health care for every american and has a comprehensive plan to end the war in iraq and restore our standing around the world but most importantly she has a strong commitment to revitalizing our urban centers and i believe that under her leadership our american cities will rise again the hillary clinton agenda for revitalizing philadelphia and other major metropolitan areas is called leave no city behind and it creates a vital partnership between our efforts here in philadelphia and the efforts of the federal government
6831685 pledging to work her heart out if elected president democratic candidate u

6831736 presiden memang tidak bisa lagi memberikan toleransi apa pun terhadap praktik korupsi dan kepada para koruptor yang telah merugikan negara yang ditunggu oleh rakyat sekarang adalah tindakan nyata dan dukungan konkret presiden yang tak akan menoleransi tindakan korupsi yang dilakukan siapa pun apakah itu kelompoknya keluarga para menteri atau teman sejawatnya
6831737 tetapi mereka belum diganti karena itu pemerintah bisa dinyatakan belum free and clean tudingan korupsi masih menyelimuti kabinet

6831743 bagaimana caranya agar batu bara ini bisa dinikmati secara prioritas oleh masyarakat sumatera selatan salah satunya ya dengan membangun pembangkit listrik berbahan bakar batu bara di sumsel setidaknya ini bisa membantu persoalan krisis listrik di wilayah setempat
6831744 saya berpesan agar rencana pembangunan pltu di mulut tambang segera direalisasikan jangan sampai wilayah sumatera selatan yang kaya akan suplai batu bara ini justru tidak bisa menikmati hasil dari pengolahannya minimal dengan adanya pembangkit di sumsel hal ini bisa membantu suplai defisit pasokan listrik
6831745 jalur baru lain dibangun secara patungan dengan pt kereta api dengan investasi rp 6 39 triliun
6831746 untuk meredam itu saya mendesak pemerintah pusat segera mengesahkan rancangan undang undang pertambangan sehingga akan ada aturan baru yang memberikan kejelasan sektor dan iklim investasi
6831747 jangan menambah birokrasi yang justru menghambat pembangunan presiden meminta gubernur bupati wali kota dan dprd memerhatikan ini

6831754 operational costs for tin producers have jumped by about six times in the last few years as the oil price has surged and indonesia removed fuel subsidies

6831779 there is no evidence that defendants should have known that it could have controlled sykes behavior offsite or that it should have recognized the necessity of doing so

6831781 despite the fact that sykes had informed fedex kinkos that he had a prior conviction for conduct equivalent to statutory rape defendants could not foresee that hiring sykes as a production manager a position that does not entail intimate contact with members of the public or vulnerable individuals would gain access to a familys home and the opportunity to sexually abuse a child

6831909 one of the most challenging economic and policy environments in memory

6831912 intended to mitigate what have been at times very severe strains in short term funding markets and by providing an additional source of financing to allow banks and other financial institutions to de leverage in a more orderly manner
6831913 was severely complicated by the lack of a clear statutory framework

6831927 we are fortunate that the competition finished before typhoon nuri hit hong kong
6831928 the measure of success is not whether you have a tough problem to deal with but whether its the same problem you had last year

6831956 we had faced liquidity crisis after the terrorist attack in usa in 2001 then the banks had provided the pledge loan of tk 1800 crore against the 20 per cent stock lot of the frozen food items if the banks come forward to provide the loans the export will increase this year
6831957 the price of the frozen food items dropped by one us dollar per pound in recent time in the market besides the production cost of per pound of frozen food items increased 30 to 40 cent it is not possible for us to continue production if we fails to get bank loan
6831958 we needed three lakh tonnes of raw materials but we got only 50 000 to 52 000 tonnes of raw material as most of the farmers have stopped their production due to the liquidity crisis for this reason the frozen food items export declined last year

6831967 if the kindle reaches a critical mass amazon will have the ability to tell publishers that if they want their books available on the kindle they will have to sell them to amazon for 6 or less
6831968 particularly for the brandname authors publishers have to pay a very high price for that content
6831969 it would be difficult for publishers to go back to their authors and say give me a better price for your books
6831970 and in this day and age many of the larger publishers have already sweated out as much expense out of those cost areas as they possibly can so theres not very much room left at all for them to do that

6831979 were saying were not going inside that freedom cage and we expect to be able to go to the pepsi center were going to push that limit
6831980 no american should be put inside of a cage and told thats where theyre free
6831981 theres a section of re create 68 that are more militant minded than other sections but weve agreed that we are going to tamper down our militancy and act in a nonviolent way because right now nonviolence is the best weapon afforded to us
6831982 violence is a fools game all it does is destroy the message
6831983 weve said this time and time again do not blame us for the confrontational situation that is being created by this government and this local administration we have tried everything we can to make our protests as legal and as nonviolent as possible but the city has taken every step they can to make this a confrontational situation
6831984 we dont want this confrontation we want to be able to exercise our rights as peacefully as possible but when theyre creating a situation where theyre training every day for violence when they have the national guard put on call to come out and surround the pepsi center you ask me about confrontation you should be asking the city about it
6831985 vermonters are struggling with the effects of the national economic downturn and now more than ever they need a leader who understands that raising taxes is the wrong direction to go
6831986 speaker symington has supported at least 11 tax increases on working families while she continues to keep her personal finances secret the one thing shes been very open about is her support for higher taxes

6832004 our biggest concern has been trying to figure out how bobby jr and amanda are going to react as time passes
6832005 we say that their mommy and daddy are angels we try as best we can to let them know that even though they may not be able to see mommy and daddy right now they are right here and always with them
6832006 its not time to tell bobby and amanda why they cant see their parents theyre angels we say its hard to see angels but theyre always here always right beside you watching over you every minute mommy and daddy see you all the time
6832007 no they dont really understand still in their eyes sometimes you can see they know something isnt right

6832038 when a republican wears a little american flag lapel pin what is he trying to say
6832039 why did the vietnamese shoot down john mccain and put him in prison for five years he seems like such a nice guy
6832040 mccains sacrifice had nothing to do with protecting the united states he was sent to vietnam along with hundreds of thousands of others in an attempt to prop up what was essentially an american colony south vietnam which was being run by a dictator whom we installed
6832041 that had we taken the war to the north and made full consistent use of air power in the north we ultimately would have prevailed
6832042 is it morally right to drop bombs and missiles in a heavily populated area where hundreds if not thousands of civilians will perish
6832043 because johns father was the naval commander in the pacific theater he was exploited with tv interviews while wounded
6832044 i can verify that john has an infamous reputation for being a hot head he has a quick and explosive temper that many have experienced first hand folks quite honestly that is not the finger i want next to that red button

6832070 the second estimate of second quarter uk gdp clearly increases the already strong chances that the economy will fall into recession over the coming quarters
6832071 the economy now looks set to grow by just 1 2 percent or so this year with a very strong chance of a technical recession in the second half and things will be considerably worse in 2009
6832072 the uk like other economies is seeing the consequences of globally high commodity prices as well as the uncertainty in the credit markets
6832073 the governments priority is to guide britain through these challenging times while also supporting those hit hardest as a result of these global factors
6832074 follows downward revisions to the growth in output of the production construction and services industries
6832075 we continue to expect a technical recession in the second half of the year and the mpc to respond with the first in a series of rate cuts in november
6832076 we judge that the risks of an earlier move have risen
6832077 with gdp flat in the second quarter and further signs of slowing activity a contraction in the third quarter is now highly likely
6832078 as a result the risks to medium term inflation are likely to subside giving the the scope to cut interest rates sooner than they may have thought possible

6832094 where did the georgian president get his information that the united states would be militarily intervening given that mccain claims to talk to saakashvili every day and given a string of grandiose pronouncements by mccain and his handlers regarding georgia is it possible that he misled saakashvili

6832203 we affirm the district courts decision and adopt its opinion in stoltie v california reported at 501 f supp 2d 1252 c d cal 2007 except for section iii c as to which we express no view as the state acknowledged at oral argument even the state appellate court misunderstood the confused and confusing explanation of reasonable doubt provided to the jury by the trial judge this error led it to apply in an unreasonable manner clearly established supreme court law regarding reasonable doubt sullivan v louisiana 508 u s 275 1993 cage v louisiana 498 u s 39 1990 overruled on other grounds by estelle v mcguire 502 u s 62 1991 in re winship 397 u s 358 1970
6832204 we therefore conclude that under the circumstances in a county severely overburdened by criminal cases which had already abandoned traditional civil trials in deference to the policy of criminal case precedence under section 1050 subdivision a it was a proper exercise of discretion for the trial court to refuse to divert its remaining judicial resources to try the two misdemeanor cases which are the subject of these appeals
6832205 the trial judge pointed out that in compliance with section 1050 subdivision a riverside county was no longer hearing any traditional civil trials two or three years earlier the court would occasionally close down a civil department to meet an emergency but the rising backlog in criminal cases had completely eliminated all civil trials

6832253 photos of the steel evidence about how the buildings collapsed the unexplainable collapse of wtc 7 evidence of thermite in the debris as well as several other red flags are quite troubling indications of well planned and controlled demolition
6832254 why would all 47 stories of wtc 7 fall straight down to the ground in about seven seconds it was not struck by any aircraft or engulfed in any fire an independent investigation is justified for all three collapses including the surviving steel samples and the composition of the dust
6832255 wtc 7 building could not have collapsed as a result of internal fire and external debris no plane hit this building this is the only case of a steel frame building collapsing through fire in the world the fire on this building was small amp localized therefore what is the cause
6832256 the first known instance of fire causing the total collapse of a tall building
6832257 tons of molten metal was found 21 days after the attack
6832258 steel doesnt begin to melt until 2 700 degrees which is much hotter than what these fires could have caused
6832259 there are holes in this story that you can drive a truck through
6832260 dr steven jones found it in the dust that landed in the entire area of lower manhattan and he finds it in the chunks of previously molten metal from the towers
6832261 nist said that wtc 7 fell at 40 slower than free fall speed but it collapsed a lot faster than it would have if the structural supports were not all blown away at the same instant 40 slower isnt very impressive thats like arguing that a rock falling through concrete 40 slower than a rock falling through the air is perfectly normal

6832304 the main goal of amnesty internationals delegation currently in georgia is to collect personal testimonies to establish whether human rights violations have been committed in the course of the conflict in georgia and whether they are still being committed we aim to release a report documenting abuses on all sides following further research by amnesty international in north ossetia
6832305 one of the most pressing concerns right now is the living conditions and treatment of refugees and internally displaced people
6832306 amnesty international is also concerned by reports of indiscriminate and occasionally targeted bombings resulting in civilian casualties including the use of cluster bombs
6832307 amnesty international is insisting on prompt thorough independent and impartial investigations into all alleged violations of international human rights and humanitarian law and standards
6832308 we are trying to identify eyewitnesses of events during which human rights violations could have been perpetrated we go to hospitals and centres for internally displaced people idps and seek information from them about their experiences
6832309 in georgia we have also had contacts with senior government officials humanitarian and human rights non governmental organizations ngos and international organizations
6832310 amnesty international is also sending delegates to north ossetia in russia to collect testimonies from refugees who fled the georgian military advance and to speak to russian government officials
6832311 here in tbilisi we are speaking to people who have been injured themselves or witnessed others being killed or abducted
6832312 we have to be extremely careful when addressing them some of these victims of the conflict are reluctant to talk at all remembering and reliving what had happened is too much for them others speak to us on condition of anonymity as they are afraid of reprisals against themselves or against relatives they have left behind on the other hand there are people who want to let the world know what has happened and why in all these cases we are speaking to victims of human rights violations
6832313 so far we have been in georgia only the authorities here at all levels are assisting us in our work we have not had the opportunity to visit the conflict zone as the access to this area is still severely restricted by the presence of russian controls
6832314 there are about 150 000 idps and refugees from the present conflict in georgia about 30 000 people fled to north ossetia and some to other parts of the russian federation
6832315 about 100 000 displaced people are living in and around the capital tbilisi
6832316 the real problem has been with people who have been left behind in the areas where the hostilies took place these people are at risk as humanitarian aid does not always manage to get through to them though the looting and attacks on villages have decreased in the last few days and humanitarian aid is beginning to get through
6832317 throughout the mission we have heard stories of human suffering
6832318 milf units that targeted villages have engaged in serious violations of international law and should be held to account
6832319 but experience from around the world shows that the deployment of civilian militias can set off a chain of reprisals and only increases the danger facing civilians
6832320 all sides to this conflict should step back from the brink and demonstrate their commitment to avoid harming civilians the milf must control its forces and the philippine government should take responsibility for the security of all peoples in the philippines regardless of religion or ethnicity
6832321 we have to protect ourselves the military could not warrant our safety they come late
6832322 the recent violent attacks by milf elements have of course shaken many of mindanaos residents who have every right to demand greater protection
6832323 many people in mindanao are terrified of a return to a period when armed muslim insurgents and christian vigilante ilaga groups attacked civilians with impunity

6832375 the future of the coalition government is linked to the restoration of all judges sacked by musharraf
6832376 there is no comparison between the civil war and now
6832377 this is just a small group with no political reason to justify what they are doing we cannot reconcile with them the government needs to be firm and to reorganize its military and intelligence agencies
6832378 theyre using tactics from iraq and afghanistan theyre using the internet for recruiting and cellphones to explode bombs
6832379 theyre told by the government that a military crackdown is underway yet they cant believe what theyre seeing they say reconciliation attempts have done nothing theyre scared that the war of the 1990s will come back
6832380 even if this group is only 100 or 200 strong they can cause great damage and fear with five or 10 suicide bombers we have to ask why in 2008 some of our young people are going into these radical groups
6832381 these terrorist gangs are seeking through attacks against civilians to loosen the net closing around them as security forces drive them to the wall
6832382 but the whole civil society and politicians in all cities are condemning these acts which we think have links to international terrorists
6832383 these small groups have nothing to do with algerian politics

6832386 we have to worry about the security situation now we should not play down the terrorist menace as the authorities are doing

6832395 theres no reason for us to be disappointed because weve been having a great olympics
6832396 maybe it was russias destiny to get the gold medal you never know what god is meaning
6832397 your search has finally come to an end relax you just found what you were looking for
6832398 seems like your ready couldve swore you were ready to go all the way it seems like your ready
6832399 thanks for being an awesome coach and putting up with my attitude ill always come to your office for help because i know youll side with me anyway one love
6832400 you cant just ship things halfway across the world just to have strawberries all year you have to eat seasonally
6832401 as a musician you can go out there and say i do drugs and drive fancy cars and make kids think thats cool
6832402 what jack and kim and company are doing is the most thoughtful and effective and committed environmental tour thats ever been done
6832403 what theyre doing with the education on the ground the greening of the tour the fan outreach with all at once and the contributions theyre giving its really unprecedented
6832404 seemed a great fit for me because its so fun to find great groups doing great work in communities
6832405 its an inspiring place to be focusing your energy on finding groups doing good work in their own community and bringing them into a network and then plugging in the fans and other people
6832406 a promoter in germany told me that over the years theyve seen so many crazy things on riders like pick out the red m amp ms
6832407 but he thought that at least this was something in the end that seems positive for everyone
6832408 in 2005 the entire attitude in the industry has changed
6832409 now major venues and promoters are rushing to be as green as they can so when the envirorider comes along its really valuable to them it gives them the tools and resources to achieve that
6832410 but because of the finite space and how far away we are it just heightens it
6832411 you have such a higher respect for food when you see it from the beginning
6832412 you dont want to throw away anything you cherish that piece of food
6832413 you have such a higher respect for food when you see it from the beginning
6832414 you dont want to throw away anything you cherish that piece of food
6832415 there are so many lessons weve learned in the garden
6832416 its better to teach hands on about food than from a text book
6832417 especially with increased fuel costs you cant just ship things halfway across the world just to have strawberries all year
6832418 i feel like farm to school solves a whole lot of problems were facing now
6832419 its such a rapid and best solution to so many things
6832420 for us to go out and make a positive change in the music industry has a more positive effect than me just staying home and doing nothing if after we leave people go forward with the connection we help to make while were there that makes touring worth it it makes me feel like we do leave a place better than before we showed up
6832421 at that age when theyre figuring out the way theyre going to approach the world
6832422 doing a show like this gets the kids talking about sustainability it shows them that its not a dorky thing to think about
6832423 thats why it works theyre doing this because its the right thing to do and they want to have a positive impact this is not about jack johnson
6832424 its an understated under promised and over delivered approach to environmentalism jacks the anti politician hes not promising anything hes just doing it hes putting his money where his mouth is
6832425 as a musician you can go out there and say i do drugs and drive fancy cars and make kids think thats cool
6832426 were finding success in terms of connecting with people regardless of whether they live on the coast or whether they surf
6832427 everyone just loves the beach everyone is concerned about ocean pollution what theyre searching for is something they can do

6832429 it was really inspiring to see the environmental world and the world of music coming together
6832430 we were able to connect with a lot of people i just love that face time with people and we had lot of good genuine conversations jack really did a lot for us
6832431 jack really made it simple and accessible for people it was about being the greenest you can be wherever you are in that spectrum just try to take it to the next little step
6832432 i think thats important because everyone is in a different situation not everyone is gonna get a hybrid
6832433 ive never been treated better as a volunteer group or felt like i had as much value
6832434 it not only worked its still working as a result
6832435 the only way it continues to get better 20 years from now is to pass it to the next generation
6832436 its being passed around among other tour managers and other bands
6832437 this is my hope that it gets disseminated and becomes the de facto standard
6832438 environmental riders have been steadily increasing during the last year both in the frequency we see these and in the quality of them
6832439 however this was the most complete ive seen so far it covered all areas of the tour and challenged us to think about what we were doing
6832440 it has been quite a change and setup costs were fairly expensive but it will prove to be a savings in the long run both financially and environmentally
6832441 our entire staff truly thinks and does things more consciously
6832442 this year i see more and more artists asking and requiring earth saving measures at their concerts
6832443 i also see the audiences respecting and appreciating the new rules of living

6832454 the diesel version is overwhelmingly easy to drive thanks to its tremendous torque which is available over an even broader rev band it outperforms the petrol powered car in terms of controllability over challenging terrain as well as when accelerating out of corners and along high speed straights with the right set up it would be comfortably faster

6832456 we continue to buy volvo because of their inherent reliability weve been operating them for over 10 years and weve found them to be the best truck for the job hartshornes are just around the corner and always give good service which makes for a smooth operation
6832457 we went for the volvo 8x4 configuration as it can carry more water on board and the engine driven pto can operate both the jet stream pump and the vacuum recovery system

6832534 the usda does not have oversight of animals including big cats kept as personal pets it is up to the state to impose restrictions
6832535 any way you look at it from ensuring the well being of animals to public safety all agencies involved are failing miserably
6832536 we just keep list of caged predators and wild animals in the county as far as regulating we dont do that
6832537 were not prepared for private citizens owning tigers ive never understood what wed do if we had a major escape our officers arent going to get out there and use a taser to deal with a 400 pound tiger thatll just make him mad

6832545 the eccentric club in london with its clock running backwards i wished they would have me as a member so i could meet all my old friends again
6832546 the clubs name is a long established and reputable brand its famous members of the past were those who had shaped the british culture into what it is now its history is inseparable with that of britain itself
6832547 as a meeting point to many great and original minds pioneers of thought in artistic literary theatrical scientific legal and political circles providing an amicable environment for their recreational and creative pastime as well as a testing ground for the novel and controversial theories and approaches to the issues equally important to the british society and the entire mankind
6832548 british eccentricity is a reluctance to be bound by social spiritual scientific political esthetical or any other limitations and an everlasting desire to explore every manifestation of life around us for the benefit of gaining personal experience and translating it through various mediums such as art business science social events to the others to the society and in particular other individuals which are seeking new knowledge and experience and are ready to perceive it
6832549 the eccentric club once an important institution in the british society closed down in the mid 1980s is about to make a daring comeback to the london clubland on 29th of august

6832553 fluctuations in the balance sheet size of security broker dealers the financial sector that includes investment banks appear to signal shifts in future real activity better than the larger commercial banking sector
6832554 two of our injuries wykes and brown have occurred during training sessions so they could have happened at any time
6832555 its just the nature of the game that you are going to have injuries from time to time overall ive been delighted with the way the team has conducted itself and the tour will prove to be very beneficial for the team going forward
6832556 were anticipating a full strength northampton team to run out tomorrow which will provide us with yet another good test for our young squad
6832557 the brand of football we have played on this tour has been very positive weve seen some young players come through and put their hand up to remain with the squad for the super 14 season
6832558 being a good forward is based on technique desire and aggression not size or weight or stomach size
6832559 i think its pretty important for this crew as far as looking to take a step up or a step forward
6832560 so far throughout the season i think we have made progression and improved
6832561 obviously we were pretty disappointed as a group how we went in auckland so for us its a good opportunity to prove to ourselves and obviously to everyone else that we have taken a step forward
6832562 im very hopeful we can show that we can do that
6832563 i think thats a good thing theres a lot less baggage amongst this crew at the moment
6832564 we possibly saw that in our first match against the all blacks a 34 19 win a while back and hopefully we can see that over the next few matches
6832565 when someones talking youre getting a lot of eyes directed straight at you and intensity as far as contests at training
6832566 thats a good thing and weve just got the positive mindset to put ourselves under as much pressure as you can at training and to execute under those pressures
6832567 theyre a side that have the world champion tag so theres still an underlying confidence with that
6832568 it wasnt too long back when they secured that amazing 32 30 victory in dunedin
6832569 i think south africa are an extremely proud nation and especially at home we are expecting a significant battle in front of us on saturday
6832570 when you play at even newlands and especially at joburg and pretoria those venues theyre on top of you and its like a cauldron and the crowd can be at times quite hostile
6832571 whereas at kings park absa stadium theres still a massive crowd but they dont feel as though theyre suffocating you
6832572 it was a long time ago and ive got great memories about that whole trip that whole era really
6832573 so now its hopefully time to implant some new ones
6832574 being a good forward is based on technique desire and aggression not size or weight or stomach size
6832575 really we are just going to back ourselves to play and whichever defenders on him just back him in to do the best job they can
6832576 there will be no emphasis on keeping it off him specifically or trying to change hawthorn in the way they want to play
6832577 if he kicks his 100th goal and were 18 goals to six up i think our boys wont be too fussed
6832578 hes a good defender a very good player and thats why we back him in
6832579 im sure theyre aware that at some stage theyll be on them because theres only one darren glass and theres franklin and roughead so theyll both get opportunities on either one at different times
6832580 they are looking forward to it its a huge challenge and thats what motivated young people should be looking for
6832581 they know how big a task it is i dont need to motivate them to know they have to be at their absolute best to compete with them
6832582 give us bryce gibbs marc murphy and chris judd and i would maybe consider it and matthew kreuzer
6832583 being a good forward is based on technique desire and aggression not size or weight or stomach size

6832620 he looks so frail i hope he doesnt get sick when he called after reaching beijing he told us the food they had didnt suit him he wanted his dal sabzi he said he could not stand the non veg food on display and was missing his vegetarian meals but that didnt stop him from winning did it
6832621 he knew at a very young age that wrestling was his calling i remember threatening him with dire consequences if he didnt study but it was practice that he was interested in
6832622 we were happy the way sushil was playing but suddenly when he lost the first bout i got disappointed we started crying but then news came that hopes for bronze were still alive
6832623 his grandfather would have been the happiest person in the country today if he were alive i knew he would win his grandfathers dream has finally come true today
6832624 the villagers hope he will get them gold in the commonwealth games
6832625 slow growth the rest of the year and possibly an economy grinding to a halt
6832626 if theres a second half recovery itll be the second half of 2009
6832627 the recent decline in gas prices isnt enough to overcome all the negative momentum thats been building up
6832628 well we have a slew of housing data due to print next week and that should weigh heavily on the dollar

6832644 making the policy more restrictive would create the perception that migrants or migration are negative
6832645 whatever policy the government comes up with now it must have public support citizens need to understand why the government is taking a particular position on migration
6832646 after extensive discussions and frank exchange of views the board resolved not to send our team at this time to pakistan to participate in the icc champions trophy
6832647 we respect the right of the pakistan cricket board to stage the tournament and we would urge the icc to reschedule the tournament as soon as possible
6832648 this was a difficult decision but it was the right one there is nothing more important than the safety of our national team
6832649 we appreciate all the efforts of the icc task team the pakistan cricket board the pakistan authorities and the security consultants
6832650 being a good forward is based on technique desire and aggression not size or weight or stomach size
6832651 wed love to be a lot more consistent theres no doubt about that
6832652 but i think if we had the answer as to why we wouldve done it already and wed be a lot higher up on the table
6832653 i think were renowned for the fact were going to try some things and things arent going to for us all that time
6832654 we just need to have the strength of mind to know to keep going and to keep building away
6832655 i think in the past weve made the mistake when things go against us we tend to try and play catch up footy and touch football rather than building the pressure and building a game again
6832656 its something we need to learn from and there s no bigger test than this week
6832657 its going to be a really tough test for us and well be able to see where were at and if were any chance of making this top eight
6832658 being a good forward is based on technique desire and aggression not size or weight or stomach size
6832659 im not saying bad liverpool teams ever won the league of course they didnt but maybe a few years ago you could afford to carry a few players
6832660 i dont think thats possible now every position has got to be filled by a top player if you want to win things on a consistent basis
6832661 the fact that the manager hasnt bought in loads of new players shows he has faith in the squad it hasnt changed much at all from last season
6832662 the year before last we finished with 68 points and last year we got 83 which represents a big step up we can all learn from the mistakes we made last year and hopefully go one step better this time
6832663 we need to put fire in anelka tell him look anelka you are very good maybe this will be the season for anelka
6832664 i need to work more on his head on his thinking in the field because he has good quality
6832665 we speak about it quite often neither of us started well and we used to say we wanted to leave
6832666 we can laugh about it now because we have both reached 100 games
6832667 tottenham fans are no exception to any others they support the team and get behind the side
6832668 if a player is on form if he knocks in a couple of goals then im sure anyone who booed him last week will soon be getting behind him and cheering him
6832669 being a good forward is based on technique desire and aggression not size or weight or stomach size
6832670 over the last seven weeks weve conceded more points than nearly anyone in the comp so i think the defensive group needs to really improve but also collectively we need to really be doing a lot of pressure through our midfield so the ball is not getting delivered through
6832671 we are under no illusion that defensively some players have been struggling
6832672 that is going to be a huge area for us tomorrow night and if we are any chance of winning the game our defensive group really has to stand up
6832673 its been a problem all year lapses in concentration teams have been able to score very heavily in ten minute periods as were shown last week against geelong
6832674 i will look to play next year i still feel really good in my body
6832675 i think we are at a delicate stage we have played a lot of young guys and got a few more games into them
6832676 a lot of our senior guys in some respects more are key position players so it will be an interesting transition
6832677 that will be resolved at the end of the season but all were focused on is the next couple of weeks and the finals campaign and the rest will look after itself
6832678 collectively weve definitely got a point to prove regardless of whether you are out of contract or youre old or youre young
6832679 i think everyone is sort of on notice at the moment the way that we have been playing is unacceptable and not up to the standard we really require of each player
6832680 being a good forward is based on technique desire and aggression not size or weight or stomach size
6832681 it is one of those things ive been used to in the past
6832682 at a test level i look back at when i first had my debut run on in 2000 there was probably about four or five months between playing football
6832683 thats the nature of what weve got in australian rugby not much football between test and super 14 football
6832684 and again last year at the world cup there wasnt much football before then
6832685 it is something i have a lot of experience with so its not too much of a concern
6832686 i feel physically very good i have been training well and obviously been involved with the test team for the last eight or nine weeks
6832687 he probably wasnt that hopeful through super rugby that he was going to get any more international rugby
6832688 hes a really good team man and hes a bloke whos been around for a while
6832689 hes experienced and hes obviously really going to relish getting the opportunity to start a test match again and theres a window of opportunity for him and reserve brett sheehan now
6832690 i said earlier in the year i was surprised to be a part of the squad given the fact i am heading overseas my age and a lot of those factors
6832691 its been great to be involved again the opportunity has presented itself to start and thats a great feeling
6832692 probably some of that criticism was well justified years ago so were just working hard at the moment and over the last two years to rectify that
6832693 during the tri nations and i havent played a lot of it but our scrum has been going well not great but fairly well
6832694 being a good forward is based on technique desire and aggression not size or weight or stomach size

6832698 id get e mails from all these guys and id have no idea who they were
6832699 swimmer summer sanders a four time medalist in barcelona says that having a guy in your room was grounds for being sent home but the big e mail tease was okay some of my girlfriends would email basketball players she recalls and the women would offer the u s dream team private tours of the village with enticing e mails like see if you can handle the heat of the village because were so cool charles barkley was spotted in the village and one swimmer recalls that curiously he really seemed to know his way around
6832700 i couldnt sleep one night my wife got mad at me so i just got up went out and sat in my chair got a piece of paper out and listed all of our players
6832701 same thing at linebacker and just said this is how its got to be reamers got to go play sam hightowers got to play will lorenzo should be an end let these two noseguards battle it out and lets go play
6832702 its one of those get the best players on the field deals
6832703 with him at end we have three guys that have some experience playing end and with cody and chapman playing nose we felt like we could afford to do that i think both those guys can hold the point in the middle they both have to sustain and improve as pass rushers but those two guys can certainly complement each other especially if we can get effective performance out of both of them
6832704 punting wise i worked on my technique shortened my strides up
6832705 my first two years i was overstriding a lot trying to overpower the ball but i learned it was form and my leg will take care of the power so i shortened my strides up
6832706 ive gotten a lot better trying to improve on that
6832707 i try to stay out of them black jerseys i think they treat you worse over there than they do on the field
6832708 with far reaching executive power while completely stripping the president of the authority to appoint or remove those members or otherwise supervise or control their exercise of that power
6832709 the executive power shall be vested in a president of the united states of america
6832710 vesting government agencies with coercive power over the citizenry and simultaneously depriving the citizenry of any ability to control or check those exercising such potentially tyrannical authority is precisely the fundamental threat to the liberty and security of the governed that separation of powers principles were designed to prevent

6832718 this is an opportunity to discuss issues with the irb face to face
6832719 there are a number of technical matters wed like to raise but there are two issues we want to straighten out
6832720 wed like to discuss our request to meet referees in the company of opposition coaches before test matches and correct the suggestions that we have failed in our duties to provide refereeing reports to the irb
6832721 we have enormous sympathy for referees who in some cases have had to manage blowing as many as five different sets of laws this season
6832722 its only natural that wed want to talk to them about interpretations in such a complex environment
6832723 it travelling will always favour them australia and new zealand
6832724 they gain a day but we lose a day when we fly there then you also have to play for financial reasons on consecutive saturdays
6832725 we know we need to win both games with bonus points but again we wont be throwing the ball around all over in the game
6832726 being a good forward is based on technique desire and aggression not size or weight or stomach size
6832727 were happy to talk to them about potential relationships with our sponsors but weve made it clear there cant be any exceptions to the salary cap rules
6832728 were just introducing him to our sponsors which is really the only measure we can do
6832729 sometimes there are sponsors willing to get on board with them but its very important that we dont make an exception to the rules
6832730 theres potentially an opportunity to do that next year but we need to look at the overall budget before we agree to that
6832731 being a good forward is based on technique desire and aggression not size or weight or stomach size
6832732 a lower exchange rate will be beneficial in a year or so to tourist numbers but the industry will also have to cope with higher travel costs and slower growth in most source countries
6832733 its really all about focusing on staff culture which in return reflects back on the quality of the work

6832748 there has been some movement of forces but whether or not that is an indication of a withdrawal or just a repositioning of forces is a bit difficult to determine at this point but those movements remain minor
6832749 the russians have finally begun to move their forces out of georgia but they have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations under the ceasefire agreement
6832750 we call on russia to adhere to that agreement fully and we want to see them adhere to it and move those forces out as soon as possible

6832757 i think thats probably realistic we have to win all our games if we want to make the eight
6832758 you cant get too far ahead of yourselves and if we dont win this saturday our seasons over its all finished
6832759 theres still a long way to go and at the moment were coming 12th so weve got a lot of work to do
6832760 theres obviously a lot of expectation on us as a club
6832761 parramatta they have a lot of supporters and seem to get a lot of criticism in the media at the moment
6832762 no matter if were winning or losing people sort of want to criticise us but thats all well and good
6832763 our fans expect a lot of us and they tend to be pretty harsh on us at times
6832764 but we expect a lot of ourselves as well and were disappointed with our season but at the moment were still in there with a chance
6832765 theres a bit of excitement building now and weve got a little momentum over the last couple of weeks but weve got to keep that going
6832766 being a good forward is based on technique desire and aggression not size or weight or stomach size

6832785 tons of molten metal was found 21 days after the attack
6832786 steel doesnt begin to melt until 2 700 degrees which is much hotter than what these fires could have caused

6832788 investigators said they did consider certain so called conspiracy theories reported cnn
6832789 alternative theories are really none of them have been found to be credible
6832790 under the circumstances it is difficult to avoid the impression that the cia and other intelligence agencies defended themselves against the dangers of attack from the bush administration through a process of self censorship

6832827 if a week is a long time in politics then 100 days has to be an eternity it must certainly seem so to brian cowen as he surveys the wreckage that now surrounds him i suspect that he prays to god every day to send him dr whos time machine to whisk him back to may 8th and a chance to start all over again
6832828 then brian cowen enjoyed huge public and media approval and was received in his home county as a conquering hero
6832829 the taoiseach with the reputation of a bruiser now looks more bruised and beaten than rocky
6832830 the mumblings of the cowen loyalists in defence of their hero ring hollow not least because he is as much the culprit as the casualty of the circumstances that now threaten to overwhelm him
6832831 in fact in july 2007 a ucd professor morgan kelly wrote a compelling article clearly setting out the imminent dangers associated with the scale of property based lending by irish banks
6832832 over a crucial period of time brian cowen was in denial and it affected his judgement in a way that was fatal both to himself and the country
6832833 with an election to win brian cowen postponed any remedial action in his budget for 2007 and astonishingly went on a year later to present a further budget for 2008 with no recognition of gathering clouds
6832834 the irish people have little reason to be confident of his capacity to handle the immediate and present dangers that face our county both the harsh economic outlook and the political consequences of the lisbon rejection
6832835 after denial comes bluster ministers are like the new orleans officials who denied there was anything wrong until the water was up to their necks
6832836 the cowen loyalists cry out that ireland is uniquely well placed to weather the storm
6832837 in the dail debate during the last week of the session i explicitly asked brian lenihan to comment on what dan obrien of the economist intelligence unit had written about the irish fiscal scenario
6832838 and the lisbon result continues to cast a dark shadow on the taoiseachs style and capacity to lead
6832839 fianna fails carefully crafted reputation for competent economic stewardship in is tatters
6832840 when you lose credibility you also lose the benefit of the doubt and the ghosts of the past come back to haunt you
6832841 i believe we are at a quite critical juncture the plates are moving
6832842 politics and government are always at the mercy of events and leaders continually struggle to control and shape them
6832843 if cleopatras nose had been shorter would the whole face of the world have been changed
6832844 so is history made by ordinary human factors and actions or is it determined by deeper currents which individual effort is powerless to hold back or propel forward
6832845 all this can help to explain the astonishing reversal of fortune to which brian cowen has succumbed these past 100 days
6832846 the seeming surge in ff popularity was a gesture of hope rather than conviction in the subsequent euphoria ff forgot the underlying fragility of its position and failed to get a grip on the vulnerable state of the countrys finances

6832876 will now try to wordsmith the nsg guideline on india to the point of being meaningless and force a decision at the next nsg meeting
6832877 it is vital that the nsg states agree to guidelines relating to india that are unambiguous and clear at a minimum the nsg make clear that nuclear trade with india shall be terminated if it resumes testing for any reason if india cannot agree to such terms it suggests that india is not serious about its nuclear test moratorium pledge

6832899 we want to make sure gordon brown is fully briefed about this ahead of the closing ceremony
6832900 i am appalled than anyone should be arrested and sentenced to imprisonment without trial simply for speaking out about tibet

6832957 it does affect my chest with suffering asthma i tend to get very croaky

6832959 what we werent aware of was the damp had got worse over a period of time
6832960 me levantaba un cuarto para las siete y terminaba en la noche s lo paraba cuando a la casa llegaban visitas

6832962 devu lvete a per o si no esa guagua va a nacer debajo del puente
6832963 nada asegura que ocurra una situaci n como la del hospital pero tampoco este caso es algo sistem tico
6832964 creo que el trato discriminatorio se da con los pobres en general y no es s lo con los extranjeros eso ya escapa al ministerio es injusto juzgar a todo el sistema por este caso
6832965 a veces una due a de casa va y echa a una chica peruana no le paga las imposiciones porque cree que es ella quien tendr a que incurrir en los gastos m dicos si la ni a queda embarazada si conociera el tema del sistema de salud sabr a que es el sistema p blico el que paga esos gastos por el contrario le anula el contrato desconociendo tambi n que eso no se hace de forma unilateral
6832966 esa chica despu s va a al consultorio le piden carn para atenderse y no tiene
6832967 chile no es un pa s xen fobo pero existen hechos discriminatorios hay pr cticas que permiten creer que lo sucedido en el hospital san jos es una tendencia que puede aumentar
6832968 me fui a casa con las manos en la panza pas el tiempo me vi con un doctor particular y dijo que ten a s ntomas de aborto luego me atendieron en el hospital me han pedido una ecograf a tras otra cuestan 15 mil pesos a n no me han dado hora en el hospital san borja y el trato ha sido muy malo cuando me dijeron que probablemente ten a que dar a luz ah me dio mucho susto porque mi cu ada tuvo a ah sus dos hijos y me cont que pari entre s banas sucias y enfermeras que la trataban de pendeja cada vez que gritaba

6832972 i would be surprised if we dont know what happened fairly quickly
6832973 we knew the risks of launching payloads on a first of a kind rocket
6832974 the unique fabric of our states history is represented in many forms
6832975 it is important to protect legendary landmarks like the settles hotel that provide a glimpse into the proud history that has made the lone star state an international travel destination
6832976 we gotta get this shoveling done cant get the car out of the yard so im hoping we dont get anymore do you know anything i dont know
6832977 feel around for lumps bumps tenderness anything along these lines
6832978 there is a lot of responsibility a lot of demands its fast paced and thats what i liked
6832979 so the best bet is to get the baby out of you now
6832980 i noticed i wasnt happy at work i lost my will to do a lot of things that interest me like art and schoolwork i worked very hard during college i was very involved in clubs i noticed that my will to do things just diminished tremendously
6832981 patients with parkinsons disease lack a sufficient amount of dopamine this brain chemical allows us to produce smooth coordinated movements like moving your arm up and down
6832982 there is rigidity which makes it very difficult for the patient to move like theyre moving in a vat of tar there is a resting tremor that is characteristic in one arm or leg
6832983 patient and outreach services from rochester general hospital the women youre about to meet offer a very personal approach to the serious problem of being uninsured

6832986 dhs has allowed an extension for completion of this project
6832987 original date for completion was december 31 2008 new date for completion is march 31 2009
6832988 we believe that these measures may possibly allow for a more cost effective project
6832989 no formal decision has been made by customs and border protection to change the targeted completion date for the project in question
6832990 we understand hidalgo county may be exploring options for cost savings as is cbp but we remain committed to completing our goals by the end of the calendar year
6832991 the costs have risen just dramatically since the start of this thing
6832992 its very difficult to tie down suppliers for an extended length of time
6832993 based on our recent experience in hidalgo county we estimate that the cost of a similar project in your area would exceed the cost of cbps standard fence design
6832994 when six year olds or people who think cats are replacements for people name their pets
6832995 oh god how can you eat here the food is terrible

6833000 i announce to you the good news of the martyrdom of my friend sheikh abu khabab al masri and his pious comrades
6833001 this is a 15 year scandal born of ignorance and inertia
6833002 we now know that millions of women might have been spared hiv unwanted pregnancies and empowered themselves in the process if they had access to this simple method
6833003 the female condom is 18 times more expensive than a male condom its obvious why women are not using it more
6833004 we can be almost assured those people are going to be using it
6833005 the female condom is the only method that women have to protect themselves it has been embraced in many countries and cultures it works and it is cost effective
6833006 political leadership and funding are needed now no more excuses
6833007 for now im setting aside school but i definitely wanna go back because it is very important to me
6833008 im almost finished with my major over there in canada so i would rather finish what i started
6833009 science books math books i try to read to keep my mind active
6833010 yung me being a daughter to him at siya being a father to me ngayon lang nagsisimula na nagka anak ako when i was younger i questioned bakit hindi kami tugma
6833011 pero ngayon parang its just the right time parang naka plan naman everything hindi mo rin mara rush kung kelan matututo ang isang tao ngayon it came tapos na ko dun sa expectations ko pero ngayon naman siya nagpapakita ng attention
6833012 alam naman niyang kaka start ko lang sa work ulit nare realize ko nga na sobrang magastos maging nanay
6833013 that is his passion pero sinasabihan ko siya na huwag mo na lang kalimutan yung essentials
6833014 i told you she was good sure hope e remembers us little folks when she makes it big time
6833015 i told you she was good sure hope e remembers us little folks when she makes it big time
6833016 when examined as a whole i find it impossible to believe that there is simply no way to reduce spending within the system of higher education the
6833017 the top 452 university system employees all make more than the governor who receives 140 000 a year
6833018 this is like the ultimate youve got striking youve got grappling youve got weapons anything goes
6833019 it gives you the idea of really finding out what martial arts are like not just doing pretty forms
6833020 when i face someone with a stick i get hit and i hit him everything else all the little things the bills the reports are gone
6833021 it makes me feel alive i have never felt better than when i am doing this
6833022 its about developing it in a healthy way before it discharges inappropriately
6833023 its like these extreme experiences where they drop a group of three or four guys without food and water into the middle of the wilderness and they have to survive for four or five days and they come out feeling like they are brothers
6833024 we are here to test ourselves and test each other but the default assumption is that we are going to care for each other
6833025 oddly enough what i feel is love honestly i wish i could find a church with the same spirit of support and love
6833026 youve put yourself through an experience that most people would go out of their way to avoid
6833027 i told you she was good sure hope e remembers us little folks when she makes it big time
6833028 that was more than 20 years ago and people still say hey i saw the saturday night live skit
6833029 we do it because we love it and theres enough satisfaction in it for us
6833030 if some people think its dorky well they dont have to watch it
6833031 theres something about the breath holding that makes the lactate acid come on a little sooner
6833032 our country is very focused on football basketball and baseball
6833033 when we go to people go nuts for synchro a venue like this one here would be sold out wall to wall for the world championships when we go to europe its the same way its really only the americas
6833034 the playful part the death and then the rebirth at the end we were trying to show every kind of emotion
6833035 it needs to be visible from very far away there cant be a lot of stuff on it just one idea thats really big it also depends on whether youre indoors or outdoors you sparkle a whole lot more outdoors than indoors
6833036 its hard not to get upset about things you cant control
6833037 its that first impression if you didnt have the most amazing deck pose i dont think that would really make a difference but a lot of times youre setting up a theme or a mood while showing some flexibility or strength its just a bonus deal
6833038 we perform to music and if you have music you have art but today all my muscles ached were completely numb except for the ones in my brain so i dont know how they could kick us out of the olympics
6833039 iosif te rog frumos sa ma intelegi nu pot sa spun nimic acum dar voi iesi in una din zilele saptamanii viitoare si voi face unele prezizari
6833040 its a long convoy there must be more than 40 vehicles
6833041 it was not clear that one could say with any certainty that a substantial withdrawal was taking place
6833042 the road down from the roki tunnel which leads into south ossetia looks completely clear with just a few civilian vehicles
6833043 i announce to you the good news of the martyrdom of my friend sheikh abu khabab al masri and his pious comrades
6833044 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing
6833045 this is not intended to be a mere discussion of violations of law that have occurred
6833046 it is rather intended to be a planning conference at which plans will be laid and necessary organizational structures set up
6833047 ernest hemingway once wrote the world is a fine place and worth fighting for i agree with the second part
6833048 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
6833049 we are recognized as one of the premier arts and crafts schools in the country our intention is for the school to continue
6833050 that was more than 20 years ago and people still say hey i saw the saturday night live skit
6833051 we do it because we love it and theres enough satisfaction in it for us
6833052 if some people think its dorky well they dont have to watch it
6833053 theres something about the breath holding that makes the lactate acid come on a little sooner
6833054 our country is very focused on football basketball and baseball
6833055 when we go to japan people go nuts for synchro a venue like this one here would be sold out wall to wall for the world championships when we go to europe its the same way its really only the americas
6833056 the playful part the death and then the rebirth at the end we were trying to show every kind of emotion
6833057 it needs to be visible from very far away there cant be a lot of stuff on it just one idea thats really big it also depends on whether youre indoors or outdoors you sparkle a whole lot more outdoors than indoors

6833060 we perform to music and if you have music you have art but today all my muscles ached were completely numb except for the ones in my brain so i dont know how they could kick us out of the olympics
6833061 mark patton is certainly no buford pusser and roane county is not a stage for walking tall
6833062 is possibly engaging in a pattern of what could be viewed as harassment by targeting off duty law enforcement officers for traffic stops
6833063 we had a strong case that silence is not acceptable
6833064 when i came from my country i didnt think id win both
6833065 i just thought id be a good competitor in both events now that i have it im quite satisfied the major objective was to win
6833066 the pace was quite slow from the beginning i had the feeling that if i went from the beginning i would lose
6833067 i tried to win the race but with those three laps left i got hit in the leg
6833068 i got bumped i started to have pains in the lower side of my right leg i tried to make the best of my race it influenced my speed and i was limping a little bit so sometimes things just happened im not happy with the bronze
6833069 i saw something on a blog and i think you have to go to the person who wrote that and interview him ill leave it at that
6833070 we are very pleased to welcome benoit into our organization
6833071 he has done a very good job in developing a winning program in gatineau and he has also experienced great success for
6833072 benoit is a coach that is respected throughout hockey for his ability to get the most out of his players
6833073 it has become very difficult in these troubled times to distinguish between satire and actual news stories my office has been inundated with people complaining and panicking about stories that have no basis in truth
6833074 most people in the united states are not very bright
6833075 even i have trouble telling apart some of those satire things from real news events
6833076 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances
6833077 wont admit it but he loves when jason kidd gets into foul trouble it gives him a chance to put chris paul into the game
6833078 they need to settle down and start taking high percentage shots
6833079 ive done nothing but study pro basketball for the last six years
6833080 a lot of guys cover nba games sitting at the top of the stands
6833081 i dont know if you have more of an advantage sitting in the rafters or watching it on tv
6833082 hes a hard guy to coach because hes so thorough that it forces you as a coach to be just as thorough as he is
6833083 he knows as much as you do or has seen as much as you have seen
6833084 former giants linebacker carl banks was like that but it was a little different position he was maybe watching one guy the tight end or the tackle on his side but tom as the quarterback is responsible for a lot more than that
6833085 it got to the point in the season where they werent even running routes
6833086 they were just running where the people werent it was very obvious if you look at their tapes nobody gets open that much you just dont not if you just call a play
6833087 we did that a whole lot practically the whole season and even in the super bowl
6833088 not everything but a lot is off what your quarterback tells you to do you see this tom sees this i know what hes thinking this is where the ball is going
6833089 brady just sees the same thing i see so its just a matter of us executing it the same way
6833090 its both people understanding the game and understanding coverages and how to attack coverages
6833091 it wont take long for us to be on the same page again
6833092 we gave him time to be what he can be
6833093 its a big step for him but its a big step for a lot of them its a very contentious race
6833094 itll either make him run better or worse one or the other maybe hell run real big sometimes that happens and thats why were running him
6833095 we were disappointed he didnt win the jim dandy but it was a good effort
6833096 when we lead him over were going to lead him over with confidence
6833097 when poor judging happens to you youre told to shut up and not say anything because of what will happen to you or what will happen to the sport
6833098 if this is truly what taekwondo is about maybe taekwondo shouldnt be in the olympics maybe they should fix it
6833099 unacceptable could mean anything from we didnt file the papers properly to we didnt use the right color pencil
6833100 under the wtf competition rules we should have been notified about the decision the criteria the methodology used what evidence was presented and what referees were reviewing it we were not
6833101 we were threatened not to protest at this event i think that needs to be said we were made to sign a document not to protest for the betterment of taekwondo it was a very big thing there was a table you went up to the table and you signed the document you signed it in front of the secretary general of the wtf and you gave him the document
6833102 it is not an agreement i would call it a resolution
6833103 a resolution on fair play it was do your best to ensure fair play and judging appealing is up to them its their right and their rule they can appeal
6833104 participants in wtf olympic coach seminar adopt resolution on fair play
6833105 respect and accept the judgment and decisions of the refereeing and technical officials in all taekwondo competitions
6833106 the wtf wanted everybody to have more self control and if they want to make a protest take the correct procedure actually not to jump up and down and make a ruckus raise a lot of noise
6833107 take the correct procedure to go about it file the complaint and then theyll decide
6833108 wtf officials dont think about the repercussions until after they make a mistake
6833109 they know the power we have as a family and bringing limelight to our sport
6833110 there are bad calls all the time this is one of the times that it happened to me it normally doesnt but it happened it sucks
6833111 our involvement would be to ensure the vibrancy and sustainability of this building and the area around it to be an anchor for sports and entertainment on the west side of the city
6833112 the lifestyle is changing you have more and more middle class coming out cities are looking for landmark sites where you have sports venues to bring in more modern events
6833113 we think that in the next five six years many more cities will have facilities like we have in beijing
6833114 people are anticipating there will be more opening in this industry and then hopefully the system will change too hopefully that will be a good opportunity for us and the chinese basketball association to figure out more innovation in this area
6833115 that might initially involve greater sharing of the nbas expertise in other areas from coaching to nutrition and marketing
6833116 it seems only natural that we would expand that cooperation
6833117 i never would have imagined actually going through with a campaign for elected office now i am inspired and i believe this is something that i can do
6833118 when i came from my country i didnt think id win both
6833119 i just thought id be a good competitor in both events now that i have it im quite satisfied the major objective was to win
6833120 the pace was quite slow from the beginning i had the feeling that if i went from the beginning i would lose
6833121 i tried to win the race but with those three laps left i got hit in the leg
6833122 i got bumped i started to have pains in the lower side of my right leg i tried to make the best of my race it influenced my speed and i was limping a little bit so sometimes things just happened im not happy with the bronze

6833162 many pensions belong to working class people without other savings who will be counting pennies in their retirement for these people keeping up with the price of eggs is very important and investing in equities over the past decade has turned out to be a pretty gruesome decision im not sure if its possible for a pension fund to benchmark a food basket but there are lots of fund managers out there who are responsible for the life savings and wellbeing of people who are going to spend their retirements living on low incomes such managers might well want to start spending less time looking at absolute returns and more time keeping an eye on the cost of living and how it might be hedged

6833175 the greek cypriot side has most recently put forward the return of guzelyurt as a precondition
6833176 however the turkish cypriot side always fails to put forward preconditions
6833177 if the turkish cypriot people will lose everything it has following a settlement which is if turkeys effective guarantee will be removed and limited only to the right of intervention than that agreement will not constitute a settlement
6833178 administered by citibank the chicago gsb international loan program is available to returning students as well as new students entering the school in september

6833181 students will be able to borrow up to 150 000 and have 20 years to repay payments can be deferred to begin six months after graduation the universitys arrangement with citibank is for one year beginning next year we expect to offer our international students a choice of several loan programs from multiple lenders

6833192 we support local ngos that provide health care for iraqis through training of health professionals it is very important that mental health becomes fully integrated into the primary health they provide
6833193 because of these courses we will be able to raise awareness on mental health problems in general most of our doctors approach patients in a purely medical way
6833194 your problems dont come from the medicine but the stress and troubles in your life

6833203 if you can grasp a straw of hope you can extrapolate that maybe an end is getting nearer
6833204 o ur reading of this speech is that bernanke is dovish and has no intention of raising rates in the near term
6833205 would have been gone long ago as private companies but they are too big to fail with government backing something will happen soon but they cant be bailed out by the private sector
6833206 the approach will basically measure the amount of data throughput in your modem
6833207 during a time when were mirroring a state of congestion what it would do is de prioritize some of the data requests from the very heaviest users at the time who were contributing the most to network congestions
6833208 still even in that de prioritized state its going to be faster than a typical dsl connection
6833209 discriminatory and arbitrary practice unduly squelches the dynamic benefits of an open and accessible internet and does not constitute reasonable network management
6833210 for the first time in internet history we say goodbye to the era of collaboration that served the internet community and consumers so well for so long and we say hello to unneeded regulation and all of its unintended consequences

6833217 create as large a repository as possible of real time metrics data from windows pcs all over the world whos running what and how its performing
6833218 the study monitors only a very small sample from an unknown number of sources
6833219 these users are not necessarily representative of windows vista users as a whole
6833220 per our longstanding practice allowing downgrade rights enterprise customers and purchasers of windows vista ultimate or windows vista business editions can choose to downgrade to windows xp professional if they feel they need more time to get ready for windows vista
6833221 may downgrade in the short term but with an eye toward upgrading later
6833222 we found that 65 percent of the boxes pre loaded with vista were still running it and the rest were running windows xp
6833223 either manually wiped the drive and installed xp or paid the vendor to uninstall vista and install xp it blows you away that people will pay not to have the default operating system
6833224 getting metrics about your pc is not the kind of thing grandma would want to do

6833243 when the siblings were adolescents in the 1960s she said hed put us at the correct distance and angle to fire a rifle at a cadaver from the barn roof to demonstrate the lone gunman theory she said
6833244 the kennedy family asked dr lattimer to examine x rays photographs and other materials from john f kennedys autopsy
6833245 his conclusion that oswald was the sole shooter was front page news and his research stimulated a burst of collecting that included the acquisition of a brick from the texas school book depository a swatch of leather from kennedys car in dallas and lee harvey oswalds letters to his mother and marine corps target practice score book
6833246 what exactly was he planning to do with 2 865 bicycles
6833247 bicycles that police say mr kenk either stole or arranged to have stolen
6833248 the jumbled collection of bicycles suggests that mr kenk is the unofficial world champion of bicycle thieves
6833249 but as he awaits trial next month on 58 charges related to theft and drug possession the biggest mysteries of all are mr kenks motives and his ultimate plan for the armada of steel rubber and aluminum he amassed
6833250 was playing the commodities markets waiting for another spike in metals prices before melting down the bicycles
6833251 was so crammed with bicycles and bike parts that a fire department rescue squad had to remove the upper floor windows and lower the bicycles by rope

6833254 the synth is actually looking to present your photos in relation to each one and to do that its finding the key data points in each photograph and then trying to map them into additional photographs
6833255 so to have a good synth you need to have pictures that overlap so you can then use the synther to construct that virtual world
6833256 youll be able to ask queries of that image what is that place where is that place how good is the food there
6833257 i think friends are going to be using this when they go to gigs and events and festivals taking photos from different angles and perspectives and then montage those together to create a wonderful 3d browseable panorama
6833258 if microsoft are really clever theyll then integrate photosynth with virtual earth they can ask people to take photos of their community of their towns and cities and then send in the photos
6833259 then microsoft have got those raw resources that they can use to turn into 3d cities
6833260 compiling that with seadragon technology allows you to quickly receive your information over the web so you can view those photos not just quickly but in a 3d setting in relation to each other
6833261 i am confident that people of delaware county can see through the facade and understand this for what it is and has been all along a character assassination in the finest tradition of delaware county politics and revenge and retribution for my attempts to clean up the justice system here in delaware county

6833286 it does me no injury for my neighbor to say that there are 20 gods or no god it neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg
6833287 we expect no interference with our ability to deliver humanitarian assistance
6833288 our society is run by insane people for insane objectives i think were being run by maniacs for maniacal ends and i think im liable to be put away as insane for expressing that thats whats insane about it
6833289 those 80 85 who did not fire did not run or hide in many cases they were willing to risk great danger to rescue comrades get ammunition or run messages but they simply would not fire their weapons at the enemy even when faced with repeated waves of banzai charges

6833457 me llama mucho la atenci n esta propuesta de fragmentar la tica en privada y p blica
6833458 bueno nunca es tarde para aprender imag nese un gobierno poniendo la otra mejilla ante la agresi n de otra naci n claramente existen las categor as en cuanto a tica se refiere
6833459 en primer lugar me llama la atenci n en un defensor del capitalismo ya que para ellos la sociedad es un amontonamiento de individuos por tanto como consecuencia l gica la sociedad debe tener la misma tica que el individuo
6833460 totalmente vil el comentario no merece respuesta que lo dignifique
6833461 pensar que hay una tica para el individuo de amor y hermandad y una totalmente opuesta para los dirigentes de la sociedad ser buena ex gesis o ser esquisoide a mi me parece que m s que ex gesis es darle un barniz teol gico a una idea pol tica que implanta la pena de muerte como argumento de vida
6833462 su pensamiento est mal planteado usted contrapone individuos con individuos lea bien lo que escribi y va a notar su error yo contrapongo la tica individual con la tica del estado o del gobierno ambas se rigen por diferentes par metros b blicos adem s no soy ex geta para ello se debe estudiar largo y tendido
6833463 pablo asevera que jes s est hablando al individuo y no a la sociedad organizada veamos cuando jes s dice o steis decir no cometer s adulterio pablo no tendr inconvenientes en asegurar que esa tica es para el individuo y para la sociedad toda

6833465 cuando jes s dice o steis decir no jurar s en falso pablo no tendr inconvenientes en asegurar que esa tica es para el individuo y para la sociedad toda
6833466 por supuesto que tengo problemas nunca he visto una sociedad jurar la ha visto usted y no me venga con la jura de la independencia tampoco podemos imponer esta tica personal o mandamiento para el cristiano en todos los integrantes de la sociedad nada en el serm n del monte va dirigido a los que no son disc pulos de cristo punto invalidado
6833467 cuando jes s dice oisteis que fue dicho ojo por ojo venganza pablo no tendr inconvenientes en asegurar que esa tica en contra de la venganza es para el individuo y para la sociedad toda
6833468 como usted ve no aplico dos m todos hermen uticos diferentes como pens usted mucho menos soy culpable de practicar eis gesis algo que la gente de su tendencia sabe hacer muy bien para distorsionar las escrituras yo podr a haber refutado su primer intervenci n haciendo alusi n directa a la falta de observaci n suya sobre cu l es el contexto de los vers culos que cit s lo con observar todo el contexto del serm n del monte hubiera bastado para anular su seudo argumento es obvio que jesucristo no est hablando de la pena de muerte ni de las guerras a decir verdad en ninguna parte de la biblia se condena la pena de muerte m s bien se apoya usted deber a refutar nuestros argumentos en lugar de saltar a otra cosa
6833469 muy manso m s que todos los hombres que hab a sobre la tierra

6833510 disparaging remark that communities are terrorized by ice immigration raids

6833512 but its quite another to berate ice law enforcement officers who are risking their lives to enforce the laws passed by congress
6833513 these gestapo comments cross any line of decency and are an affront to the men and women at this agency who perform their sworn duties often at great personal risk
6833514 most troubling irresponsible comments like these vilifying law enforcement officers can have a significant impact on officer and public safety

6833524 thats really reconstruction its for infrastructure its not just because of the hostilities
6833525 to date the cancer data in the seas trial plus the interim data from ongoing trials should not prompt patients to stop taking vytorin or any other cholesterol lowering drug
6833526 w e are concerned that the analysis of vytorin data conducted by sir richard peto may not be as independent as expected given that his clinical trials service unit is conducting the study of heart and renal protection sharp trial of vytorin also funded by merck schering plough and or the joint venture
6833527 theres a body of medical literature that says those very plant sterols can inhibit the growth of cancer

6833533 a commitment to the installation of solar hot water heating systems on public buildings is also part of the program
6833534 solar b c will provide 10 000 to 20 000 in funding to five communities to be used for solar hot water related initiatives
6833535 essentially theyd like that area to join city of kelowna and they want the city to do a study of the tax impact the city had previously reviewed such a submission and decided they didnt want to do a study at that point the city learned the province wont provide funding for a study so theyd be on their own

6833540 some of the very large boats are so bad if you are sitting on your balcony or patio and they go by on the other side of the lake youll have to stop your conversation because you cant hear its that loud
6833541 its an issue for a huge number of people the website basically says we are asking the fine be drastically increased and at a second offence the boat be impounded and not allowed back in the water until the exhaust is permanently fixed
6833542 as i understand it it only adds about a 5 increase so if people werent allowed to do it it isnt going to have any appreciable effect on the enjoyment of the boat
6833543 the fine is just 115 a lot of those boats spend that much on gas in an hour so its not a significant fine as far they are concerned the rcmp do their best but they dont have the resources to enforce properly
6833544 we also have to realize that these things have been sitting in the water for the past 50 years so its not like were introducing them to a foreign body
6833545 the prime concern would appear to be a little bit of turbidity as they land on the bottom of the lake i suspect that we do far more damage to okanagan lake with our milfoil program than will be done by these pontoons

6833721 i dont need any face time with sen obama i need sen obama to do what he needs to do

6833806 with the entropy of information on rise the fulcrum of decision making has shifted to one scenario amongst many
6833807 and the ioc and fig should take measures to make sure the issue is put to rest one way or another we believe the ioc is moving in that direction we hope they follow through and hope for a quick resolution
6833808 you shouldnt regard this as some kind of formal investigation
6833809 simply there have been questions on the table and discrepancies alluded to the ioc simply wants to do due diligence and work with the international federation to 100 percent clarify this situation and put it to rest
6833810 the eligibility of the athletes has already been investigated and cleared by the international federation

6833815 and said he was acting in the name of 12 000 persecuted jews
6833816 had entered a new radical phase in anti semitic activity
6833817 a very reliable private source one which can be traced back to the highest echelons of the ss leadership that there is an intention to carry out a genuine and dramatic pogrom in germany on a large scale in the near future
6833818 they say a man is entitled to a trial by a jury of his peers and a mans kinsmen rally around him when he is in trouble but no kinsman of herschels can defend him the nazi government has announced that if any jews anywhere in the world protest at anything that is happening further oppressive measures will be taken they are holding every jew in germany as a hostage therefore we who are not jews must speak speak our sorrow and indignation and disgust in so many voices that they will be heard this boy has become a symbol and the responsibility for his deed must be shared by those who caused it
6833819 deplored the fatal shooting of an official of the german embassy by a young polish jew of seventeen
6833820 protested energetically against the violent attacks in the german press against the whole of judaism because of this act
6833821 rejected all forms of violence regardless of author or victim
6833822 indignantly protested the barbarous treatment inflicted on an entire innocent population
6833823 being a jew is not a crime i am not a dog i have a right to live and the jewish people have a right to exist on this earth wherever i have been i have been chased like an animal
6833824 had an exceptionally intimate relationship with the little jew his murderer
6833825 the idea that such a highly thought of representative of the
6833826 he refuses to give a non political character to his act by saying for example that he assassinated vom rath because he had had money quarrels with him following homosexual relations yet such an attitude in regard to the murder of vom rath is necessary in order to save the jews of the third reich whose lives are becoming more and more precarious in regard to the prosperity their health their futures etc if only he would deny the political motives of his crime and assert that he had only personal vengeance in mind vengeance as a victim of homosexuality the nazis would lose their best pretext for exercising their reprisals against the german jews who are victims of his fit of madness and now of his obstinacy
6833827 but as a defender of gruhnspahn shouldnt you protect not only the interests of your client but his honour as well
6833828 honour honour what is the honour of that absurd little jew in the face of the criminal action of hitler what does the honour of grunspahn weigh in the face of the destiny of thousands of jews
6833829 prevent through force of threats the f hrer and reichschancellor from the conduct of their constitutional functions
6833830 grynszpan has invented the insolent argument that he had a homosexual relationship with vom rath that is of course a shameless lie however it is thought out very cleverly and would if brought out in the course of a public trial certainly become the main argument of enemy propaganda
6833831 i am having lots of work preparing the grynszpan trial the ministry of justice has deemed it proper to furnish the defendant the jew grynszpan the argument of article 175 the german law against homosexuality grynspan until now has always claimed and rightly so that he had not even known the counsellor of the legation whom he shot now there is in existence some sort of anonymous letter by a jewish refugee which leaves open the likelihood of homosexual intercourse between grysnpan and vom rath it is an absurd typically jewish claim the ministry of justice however did not hesitate to incorporate this claim in the indictment and to send the indictment to the defendant this shows again how foolishly our legal experts have acted in this case and how shortsighted it is to entrust any political matter whatever to the jurists
6833832 first known instance of fire causing the total collapse of a tall building
6833833 obviously designers and engineers will be thinking of their buildings as they consider our report and theyll take appropriate action

6833845 he is going to have discussions with his north korea counterparts no plans to meet with officials of any other country in new york
6833846 obviously they are going to talk about the six party talks obviously recent discussions about the verification package which we have been calling on the north koreans to produce
6833847 i dont have any inkling myself at all but obviously sung kim is going to assess where things are with north korea in his conversations with north korean officials
6833848 the us government wants to see this verification package as soon as possible so that we can move forward with this delisting

6833885 when we celebrate birthdays and wedding anniversaries we are imitating other religions something that our prophet peace be upon him warned us against

6833897 arguably as the bigger more cost efficient stores move out the poor increasingly are likely to find themselves choosing between traveling farther to purchase nutritious competitively priced groceries or paying inflated prices for low quality processed foods at corner stores
6833898 stores pricing and location decisions in most instances are guided by competitive factors rather than any bias against the poor or their neighborhoods
6833899 the research findings suggest that viewers donated because they felt an obligation to do so people expect self or social censure if they dont help when they feel empathy for a person or organization they care about

6833907 the sympathy inherent to a close relationship with a victim extends to other victims leading benefactors to prefer charities that help those suffering from the misfortunes that have affected their friends and loved ones
6833908 so friendship with a victim does not simply make people more sympathetic rather it directs their sympathy to others with the same misfortune as their friend or loved one
6833909 we suggest that public health campaigns will be more successful if they attend to how behaviors act as markers or signals of identity
6833910 the two girls make out hardcore rolling around in a bed it was a really hot scene
6833911 operations research offers a powerful set of tools that have been used successfully in everything from world war ii to wal mart style logistics planning these tools ought to be used to increase the success of existing programs and to help expand access to hiv care and treatment in resource limited countries
6833912 for example operations research could help with the planning of a national drug distribution system or with predicting the demand for services at local clinics and the best ways to staff them
6833913 to date hiv treatment scale up has appropriately focused first on policy level issues such as program initiation and costs and secondarily on operational level issues
6833914 now that many programs are in place the potential gains from improved planning are great especially given the high cost of antiretroviral drug therapy
6833915 the analysis suggested that implementation of such a program could allow the government of rwanda to scale up hiv treatment without overburdening its existing health care system
6833916 the unique advantage of operations research is that it gives us the ability to evaluate and optimize outcomes of various scenarios such as determining the best approach for the management of lab equipment repair without impacting patients
6833917 once we have the evidence for a new approach a good case can be made that it should be implemented as policy although any initiative should take into account the environments in which the projects are to be carried out with all necessary ethical cultural and political considerations
6833918 placing greater emphasis on long term strategic planning and increasing the attention and resources directed to capacity building for sustainability
6833919 while laudable progress has been made the great majority of hiv patients are still under treated or untreated
6833920 we feel that operations research provides one of the tools to make sure progress continues

6833938 practical atheism is not the denial of the existence of god but complete godlessness of action it is a moral evil implying not the denial of the absolute validity of the moral law but simply rebellion against that law
6833939 during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the word atheist was still reserved exclusively for polemic the term atheist was an insult nobody would have dreamed of calling 20
6833940 to put forward the idea as some apologists rashly do that there are no atheists except in name but only practical atheists who through pride or idleness disregard the divine law would be at least at the beginning of the argument a rhetorical convenience or an emotional prejudice evading the real question
6833941 the pejorative associations of the term its vagueness and later the tendency of religious apologists to define atheism so that no one could be an atheist
6833942 all children are born atheists they have no idea of god
6833943 the man who is unacquainted with theism is an atheist because he does not believe in a god this category would also include the child without the conceptual capacity to grasp the issues involved but who is still unaware of those issues the fact that this child does not believe in god qualifies him as an atheist
6833944 the absence of theistic belief without a conscious rejection of it
6833945 the central religious practice of the vedic aryans was sacrifice and sharing of the sacrificial meal with each other and with the many supernatural beings or devas in sacrifice the gods could be propitiated
6833946 although no doubt of high antiquity the hymn appears to be less of a primary than of a secondary origin being in fact a controversial composition levelled especially against the
6833947 though materialism in some form or other has always been present in india and occasional references are found in the vedas the buddhistic literature the epics as well as in the later philosophical works we do not find any systematic work on materialism nor any organised school of followers as the other philosophical schools possess but almost every work of the other schools states for reputation the materialistic views our knowledge of indian materialism is chiefly based on these
6833948 the higher ones intelligence or education level the less one is likely to be religious or hold beliefs of any kind
6833949 1 the doctrine or belief that there is no god 2 disbelief in the existence of a supreme being or beings
6833950 1 a disbelief in or denial of the existence of god or gods including the existence of the christian jewish and muslim god b the doctrine that there is no god or gods 2 godlessness immorality
6833951 atheists are people who do not believe in a god or gods or other immaterial beings or who believe that these concepts are not meaningful some atheists put it more firmly and believe that god or gods do not exist
6833952 the broader and more common understanding of atheism among atheists is quite simply not believing in any gods no claims or denials are made an atheist is just a person who does not happen to be a theist
6833953 the average theologian there are exceptions of course uses atheist to mean a person who denies the existence of a god even an atheist would agree that some atheists a small minority would fit this definition however most atheists would strongly dispute the adequacy of this definition rather they would hold that an atheist is a person without a belief in god the distinction is small but important denying something means that you have knowledge of what it is that you are being asked to affirm but that you have rejected that particular concept to be without a belief in god merely means that the term god has no importance or possibly no meaning to you belief in god is not a factor in your life surely this is quite different from denying the existence of god atheism is not a belief as such it is the lack of belief
6833954 atheism however casts a wider net and rejects all belief in spiritual beings and to the extent that belief in spiritual beings is definitive of what it means for a system to be religious atheism rejects religion so atheism is not only a rejection of the central conceptions of judeo christianity and islam it is as well a rejection of the religious beliefs of such african religions as that of the dinka and the nuer of the anthropomorphic gods of classical greece and rome and of the transcendental conceptions of hinduism and buddhism generally atheism is a denial of god or of the gods and if religion is defined in terms of belief in spiritual beings then atheism is the rejection of all religious belief
6833955 atheism is ostensibly the doctrine that there is no god some atheists support this claim by arguments but these arguments are usually directed against the christian concept of god and are largely irrelevant to other possible gods thus much western atheism may be better understood as the doctrine that the christian god does not exist
6833956 if you look up atheism in a dictionary you will find it defined as the belief that there is no god
6833957 atheism is commonly divided into weak and strong weak atheists have no faith simply because the feeling is not there strong atheists conclude from existing evidence and arguments that gods do not exist
6833958 unlike agnosticism which leaves open the question of whether there is a god atheism is a positive denial
6833959 atheism is the position that affirms the nonexistence of god it proposes positive belief rather than mere suspension of disbelief
6833960 nonbelief has existed for centuries for example buddhism and jainism have been called atheistic religions because they do not advocate belief in gods
6833961 lots of people in the west misunderstand buddhism especially its sic general lack of any divine figures they dont realize that for many buddhism is essentially an atheistic religion people in the west are accustomed to religions all being theistic so the idea of an atheistic religion is almost incomprehensible
6833962 in modern indian languages stika and n stika generally mean theist and atheist respectively but in sanskrit philosophical literature stika means one who believes in the authority of the vedas or one who believes in life after death n stika means the opposite of these the word is used here in the first sense in the second sense even the jaina and bauddha schools are stika as they believe in life after death the six orthodox schools are stika and the c rv ka is n stika in both the senses
6833963 the atheists rejection of belief in god is usually accompanied by a broader rejection of any transcendental reality for example an atheist does not usually believe in the existence of immortal souls life after death ghosts or supernatural powers although strictly speaking an atheist could believe in any of these things and still remain an atheist the arguments and ideas that sustain atheism tend naturally to rule out other beliefs in the supernatural or transcendental
6833964 atheism and atheist are words formed from greek roots and with greek derivative endings nevertheless they are not greek their formation is not consonant with greek usage in greek they said atheos and atheotes to these the english words ungodly and ungodliness correspond rather closely in exactly the same way as ungodly atheos was used as an expression of severe censure and moral condemnation this use is an old one and the oldest that can be traced not till later do we find it employed to denote a certain philosophical creed
6833965 when people say that atheism is a faith position what they tend to think is that since there is no proof for atheism something extra faith is required to justify belief in it but this is simply to misunderstand the role of proof in the justification for belief a lack of proof is no grounds for the suspension of belief this is because when we have a lack of absolute proof we can still have overwhelming evidence or one explanation which is far superior to the alternatives
6833966 this short hymn though linguistically simple is conceptually extremely provocative and has indeed provoked hundreds of complex commentaries among indian theologians and western scholars in many ways it is meant to puzzle and challenge to raise unanswerable questions to pile up paradoxes
6833967 as the subject of the hymn is creation typified and originated by the mysterious primeval sacrifice cp x 90 praj pati the creator is said by s yana to be the deity the r i is yaj a sacrifice praj patis son
6833968 atheism had its origins in ancient greece but did not emerge as an overt and avowed belief system until late in the enlightenment
6833969 to view atheism as a way of life whether beneficial or harmful is false and misleading just as the failure to believe in magic elves does not entail a code of living or a set of principles so the failure to believe in a god does not imply any specific philosophical system from the mere fact that a person is an atheist one cannot infer that this person subscribes to any particular positive beliefs ones positive convictions are quite distinct from the subject of atheism while one may begin with a basic philosophical position and infer atheism as a consequence of it this process cannot be reversed
6833970 one cannot criticize religious dogmatism for long without encountering the following claim advanced as though it were a self evident fact of nature there is no secular basis for morality
6833971 among the many myths associated with religion none is more widespread or more disastrous in its effects than the myth that moral values cannot be divorced from the belief in a god
6833972 one can have immoral laws as well as moral ones what is required for just laws is for the legislature and judiciary to act within the confines of morality morality is thus the basis upon which just laws are enacted and enforced it is not constituted by the laws themselves
6833973 the euthypryo dilemma is a very powerful argument against the idea that god is required for morality indeed it goes further and shows that god cannot be the source of morality without morality becoming something arbitrary
6833974 more profoundly it is an odd morality that thinks that one can only behave ethically if one does so out of fear of punishment or promise of reward the person who doesnt steal only because they fear they will be caught is not a moral person merely a prudent one the truly moral person is the one who has the opportunity to steal without being caught but still does not do so
6833975 it is easy for the religious believer to think that they can avoid choice just by listening to the advice of their holy men it is usually men and sacred texts but since adopting this attitude can lead to suicide bombings bigotry and other moral wrongs it should be obvious that it does not absolve one of moral responsibility so although the idea of individuals making moral choices for themselves may sound unpalatable to those used to thinking about morality deriving from a single authority none of us can avoid making such choices
6833976 in a world riven by ignorance only the atheist refuses to deny the obvious religious faith promotes human violence to an astonishing degree
6833977 people say that since the atheist can never know for sure that there is no life after death for example it is foolish for them to not believe in it at best they should suspend belief and be agnostic but this policy would be reckless since to apply it consistently you would also have to be agnostic about any issue on which there was a possibility that you could be wrong because there is no absolute certainty and it is possible that evidence might arise to show you are wrong but who seriously claims we should say i neither believe nor disbelieve that the pope is a robot or as to whether or not eating this piece of chocolate will turn me into an elephant i am completely agnostic in the absence of any good reasons to believe these outlandish claims we rightly disbelieve them we dont just suspend judgement
6833978 many people think that atheists believe there is no god

6833989 but as for the final its true were in good form but there are no real favourites in a final where anything can happen if you believe the script we shouldnt have any problems however we still have to produce it where it matters out on the pitch with our football thats the only thing we should be thinking about
6833990 wed had a couple of games against them that hadnt gone at all well for us wed been hoping to be able to beat them and we were in the kind of form to do just that but we never imagined wed beat them so emphatically

6833994 i was on a rampage i hated myself i hated you referring to the jury

6833997 the primary obligation for journalists is to seek the truth and report it as fully as possible
6833998 at the same time journalists have an obligation to recognize potential harm that can be caused by using certain types of information
6833999 were meeting on a regular basis and were talking about how much of this information to get out there so its representative of the story that the jury is getting
6834000 so in a general sense that is the balance reporting as much truth as possible as meaningfully as possible as professionally and still minimizing harm through respectful fair professional coverage
6834001 we have a duty as journalists to report the news as we see it and we wont go graphic and we wont go over the top but if we ignore the story as some people suggest we should and just wait until the jurys decision is in and report that then the harm that were doing there is that were pretending that these kinds of things dont happen and people like joseph duncan dont exist

6834166 we did go to very great lengths as every farm does to estimate the number of people you need every day and we had that number of people
6834167 our problem was that those people around 80 were incapable of picking to the minimum rates because they were either excessively drunk the night before or they were unemployable people
6834168 those that we can recruit particularly in early may june and july before universities break up in the eu are those that tend neither to be able to get a job or come with a vodka bottle
6834169 one got off the bus with three fingers and weve got to try and pick enough kilos an hour to marks amp spencers standards to be able to pay the minimum wage and it just didnt stack up

6834176 we now have the opportunity to get involved with the rss consultation process which could dramatically affect the number of houses to be built within the bath if we are to stop government indifference towards local circumstances then its crucial that bath residents take this opportunity with both hands i hope the public will make their voice heard either directly to the consultation or by getting in touch with me
6834177 we raised this issue with the secretary of state some time ago and she pointed us towards the consultation process however the deadline is approaching so its important we act now

6834364 it would have been nice to have a medal but ive already got one and there are some insanely competitive paddlers out there who havent
6834365 i was thinking i could sneak a gold out there
6834366 i wasnt really looking i just had my head in my own boat and i felt if i looked across it wouldnt boost my confidence
6834367 i just wanted to finish my race and put in as much physically as i could that was reflected with 100m to go when i got the wobbles
6834368 im going to chill and reconnect with the wider perspective of life
6834369 the last four years have been so intense and there is a little bit more to life than that
6834370 ive hammered myself 24 hours a day seven days a week for four years so its taken its toll i need to take some time out and hopefully comeback with a healthier approach to the game
6834371 we got to the final 100m and i thought this is the olympics and put more effort into every stroke but we fell apart in that final 100m and other crews came through on the inside
6834372 and that there was interest from chelsea however robinho himself has kept quiet on the issue at least in public until today
6834373 its not for money my personal objective is to be the best player in the world and that is not going to happen at real madrid thats why ive set myself the target of playing in the english premiership next season
6834374 i think my time at real madrid is at an end i hope that the management reaches agreement with chelsea to resolve my situation as soon as possible
6834375 ive never missed a training session at real madrid ive trained every day and i will continue to do so whether i play or not against valencia in the spanish supercup this sunday i dont know mainly because if i dont have a good game people can say its because my mind is elsewhere to avoid those kinds of comments its better for schuster to pick other players

6834402 for far too long the rules of the financial services industry have been tilted in the interests of companies and consultants not the millions of american workers who are deeply worried about saving enough for a secure retirement
6834403 now the bush administration is proposing to further tip the scales towards special interests by opening the door to conflicts of interest among the very consultants purporting to offer unbiased investment advice and potentially allowing companies to reap windfall profits at the expense of americas workers

6834410 its a very sad day its a very emotional day
6834411 was ich hier richtig mag ist die tatsache dass keiner die strecke kannte also absolut gleiche bedingungen f r alle hier zeigt sich wer schnell lernt und sich in den kurs reindenkt vor dem qualifying sagte mein ingenieur zu mir fahr auf pole den auftrag habe ich erf llt jetzt hoffe ich auf ein gutes rennen vor diesem wochenende war meine beste startposition ein siebter platz nat rlich bin ich froh dass ich jetzt mal von ganz vorn losfahren kann
6834412 ab der vierten runde bekam ich starke bremsprobleme das lag garantiert an der unglaublichen hitze die hier herrscht auf der strecke musste ich den bremspunkt entsprechend fr her setzen das kostete nat rlich zeit ich habe meinen fahrstil entsprechend ge ndert in der letzten runde hat dann doch noch mal alles zusammen gepasst und ich schob mich auf startplatz zwei f r das rennen am samstag vor
6834413 nach meinem unfall im freien training fuhr ich im qualifying etwas verhaltener ein stadtkurs erfordert von einem fahrer eine besondere konzentration wenn man so dicht an einer mauer vorbeif hrt sp rt man schon eine aufregung was mir wirklich hilft ist mein starker teamkollege das schafft einerseits druck aber anderseits profitieren wir sehr von der gemeinsamen datenanalyse marco und ich vergleichen uns nat rlich das pusht uns beide

6834423 we are studying a number of options and are open to all possibilities which could include buying lehman
6834424 kdb had said it would consider buying a stake in lehman
6834425 it seems like kdb internally decided to stop the talks given that it had not kept the government posted further
6834426 financially kdb will not have a problem buying a majority stake in lehman as the u s banks market cap has fallen sharply over the months

6834440 its good to be at this point we have waited four years for this
6834441 maybe he stepped on someones foot but it wasnt jumping
6834442 we gave away the first quarter and we paid a very expensive price for that
6834443 after that it was an uphill battle especially after ginobilis injury we didnt do what we planned and you cannot afford that against a team like the usa
6834444 but were going to tell them the world were taking over forever forever
6834445 weve had great success this year so were not going to be ungrateful and complain
6834446 im hoping to continue to do this through 2012 i hopefully can get another medal
6834447 in recent days additional questions have resurfaced and in the interests of laying the matter to rest and in response to a request from the international olympic committee the fig has now asked the chinese gymnastic association to submit further documents testifying to the birth dates of the gymnasts
6834448 on receipt of these documents the fig will forward its conclusions to the international olympic committee it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
6834449 there have been questions that have been on the table and discrepancies that have been alluded to by certain parties
6834450 the ioc is wanting to do its due diligence and work with certain parties to 100 percent clarify this situation and put it to rest thats whats in the process of being done
6834451 i think theres a great concern and i think its a concern out of fairness for the individual athletes on the american team whether or not its fair to them that the athletes were under age
6834452 we really have a concern for the integrity of the competition on both sides if theyre of age they should be exonerated and if theyre not we would hope it would be put to bed
6834453 ill talk to them theyre a pretty good group of guys theyre not a group of guys that i need to motivate a whole lot
6834454 the victory doesnt mean that the korean team is stronger than the japanese team and when two strong teams meet each other an important factor is luck
6834455 and i think we are luckier than the japanese today
6834456 i think this team represents whats good about team sports
6834457 the sum of their hearts is greater than the individual aspects of the team
6834458 they are a great team and have gold medal experience but the way we are playing no one will stop us
6834459 we have not beaten serbia in six or seven years but today we were able to pull this one out
6834460 its been a long time since we contended for an olympic medal and were shocked
6834461 we knew we could do it but to be here is unbelievable we have nothing to lose
6834462 we were all very disappointed that we could not put the ball in the goal we have to play better against montenegro to win a medal this is a bad day for us
6834463 theyre a great team and im sure well see a lot of them in the future
6834464 i couldnt agree more about the company were in i feel like i dont belong up here on top of the podium i just feel honored im on the stage with them and i couldnt be happier

6834576 four countries have now decided against coming to pakistan i probably shouldnt bracket the other three england australia and new zealand with south africa as they have yet to announce their decisions but from what we are hearing they will probably do the same
6834577 rescheduling is a problem because of the tight international calendar involving all teams and every board is aware of this and we have been preparing very hard to make the champions trophy a safe and successful event
6834578 south africas decision is all the more disappointing for us because they came to pakistan last year and were satisfied with the level of security we provided them on the tour
6834579 we shifted a match from karachi to lahore on one occasion to ensure best security for them pakistan cricket has been going out its way since 9 11 to accommodate and ensure touring teams are given state level security
6834580 the icc is trying hard to assure all teams that conditions are safe to play in pakistan and a teleconference of the executive board is to be held on sunday south africa should have waited until then
6834581 titans 63 inch giant tires continue to run with success
6834582 these tires have surpassed each standard weve set for them and we expect only the best from our products our otr tires with our new patent pending design and manufacturing technology run cooler and stronger
6834583 we continue to increase production everyday on these big daddy 63 inch tires and plan to roll out 57 inch otr tires this year as the video taken in the oils sands shows even with a load over 400 tons the tires run great the rumors of failed tires and performance that have been circulating are false as viewers can see these big daddy tires are great our agricultural business also continues to grow it may be to our competitors dismay but titan is looking forward to a great 2008 with even more success to follow in 2009
6834584 this is in no way a reflection on our workforce they have been doing an outstanding job
6834585 unfortunately the power plant that luminant operates has not been reliable over the past year the cost of power resulting from luminants inability to consistently operate the sandow unit 4 has forced us to make this decision were continuing to speak with luminant to see if we can secure competitive power to ease the impact on everyone involved and we have been forced to seek damages and other relief from them through ongoing litigation

6834587 i was exhausted to keep plugging away and not fall off it was tough
6834588 cuba are a great team with some great players they hit our pitching mistakes they hit them over the fence
6834589 i recently asked my 10 year old daughter if she wanted to see the latest video on barack obama
6834590 today our weekend got off to a good start but obviously it is far too early to say where we are compared to the opposition
6834591 overtaking it will be difficult as always i hope i dont need to do it by getting the best position in qualifying
6834592 the set up we have found today is not bad but there is still plenty of room for improvement
6834593 they were two enjoyable sessions with the lap times tumbling bit by bit as the drivers lapped and got confidence in the track layout
6834594 the track surface is still very dirty and it is easy to make mistakes which can lose you precious tenths to do a good lap time you have to be perfect
6834595 i like the track theres a nice atmosphere and i have to say the organisers have done a good job
6834596 today it was important that we find a good base set up immediately and we managed to do that
6834597 it was important to get off on the right foot and we did
6834598 we had prepared a baseline set up for the f2008 and it seems to be about right which meant that right from this morning we could work on improving it
6834599 both drivers are reasonably happy with the handling of the car
6834600 now we have to analyse all the data we have gathered to work out how to move forward in terms of getting the best performance
6834601 today the track has been very dirty which was in fact predictable
6834602 one of the most effective protective measures any company has against these types of occurrences is a well developed enterprise wide records and information management program
6834603 not only do the policies and procedures have to be in place and well documented
6834604 by now the message should be clear companies that collect sensitive consumer information have a responsibility to keep it secure information security is a priority for the ftc as it should be for every business in america
6834605 when political sleaze starts bubbling up youll almost always find jim inhofe nearby
6834606 certainly no banker with any judgment would lend him inhofe money
6834607 for 35 years in political biographies engagement announcements and alumni directories inhofe said he graduated from the university of tulsa in 1959 with a degree in economics
6834608 im really proud to say that in the recorded history of our family weve never had a divorce or any kind of homosexual relationship
6834609 when political sleaze starts bubbling up youll almost always find jim inhofe nearby so it is no surprise that inhofe was a key player in the scandal that dethroned richard roberts at oral roberts university

6834612 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6834613 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6834614 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba

6834618 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6834619 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6834620 unfortunately my hopes about the georgian russian ceasefire agreement seem tove been wrong i havent been missing the idea that half an hour could see my world ruined with nuclear war nor have i been missing the old enemies from my childhood nor am i trying to sell fear in this post we survived the last cold war just fine and theres less to fear this time i think the biggest diffeence is that this time we know mads sustainable longterm against this kind of opponent mad as it seems in my post on cold war and crabcakes i noted that the key thing driving the cold war was soviet aggressive expansionism the democracies that were the centers of our side have done plenty of evil and stupid things but our side was letting go of empires while the soviets were expanding theirs its ironic given the communist rhetoric of imperialist pigs that in turn dates from when it was true back then we were imperialist powers and communists hadnt yet taken over anywhere at this point it seems pretty clear to me that the russians are being aggressive expansionists again they came up with stupid ultranationistic reasons to justify cyberwar against another small neighbor state estonia russia has historically felt estonia should be part of their empire fortunately theyve joined nato and enjoy the same kind of security guarantee that we gave western europe in cold war i so all they can do now is look wishfully and try and provoke them to do something as stupid as what georgias done
6834621 its become clear that russian claims about severe destruction of tshkinvali and georgian ethnic cleansing were propaganda more like normal sad levels of war deaths and destruction than like the severe destruction of of tshkinvali and russias been claiming and the local hospital in tskhinvali only recorded 40 dead instead of the 2100 dead russia claimed mostly to the point theyve already broken their agreement on withdrawing their second unilaterally given deadline is here and the signs of movement appear to be patrols not departure read the article not the contradictory headline so their promises would seem to be stalling for time
6834622 of course now alas the pentagon will regain its political coalition for stupid expensive weapons since itll have somebody to point to as a competitor in that kind of weapon how is modern russia stacking up as a competitor vs the old ussr the biggest difference is that they have far less foreign turf that theyre occupying the biggest result is that that means a smaller age of world population on their side that means less labor and fewer strategic spots will it even be a bipolar world when china and india are developing quickly and have substantial nuclear forces of their own

6834627 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6834628 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6834629 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6834630 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6834631 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6834632 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6834633 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6834634 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6834635 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6834636 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6834637 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6834638 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6834639 if you told me at the beginning of the year that i would score 50 goals i probably would have laughed
6834640 but as the season progressed and it became reality i stayed focused and confident the whole season
6834641 i just wanted to play the same way the same style
6834642 i knew i would be successful but how successfully showed through my statistics i tried to play a simple game play the same way every night
6834643 he dedicated himself to training hard and dropped weight and really got himself into really good physical condition
6834644 now you talk to the icedogs coaching staff he sets an unbelievable example for the rest of the team hes a workaholic
6834645 that was the main factor when i first came to junior from aaa
6834646 i was probably around 220 pounds but it was all baby fat none of it was good i learned very quickly in my first ohl camp and my first coach greg gilbert said youre not going to be a good hockey player with that weight and conditioning
6834647 in the last two years hes seen guys he played with being drafted
6834648 we had on our team the one year patrick osullivan and he had great habits on ice and off ice another guy we had was daniel carcillo and he was the same thing days off hed be skating hed be one of the hardest workers in the gym hed see the guys working and think if i want to get to the national hockey league i have to pay attention to off ice training
6834649 youd like to think a kid is always going to have a jump in production year after year so i did expect a jump
6834650 but i didnt think hed be a 50 goal scorer in the ohl we saw some intriguing qualities we saw he could put the puck in the net i did some homework on him and if you go back in the past he had been a scorer in minor hockey so he has run numbers in the past it didnt surprise me his production increased but not that much
6834651 he could always score goals ive seen him first hand as he played minor hockey goal scorers never really lose their touch and he proved it
6834652 he always was around the puck or always 6 10 feet from a teammate for support out number guys
6834653 when im breaking out im down low wheres my centerman wheres their defenseman pinching however he did it he displayed to me great hockey sense and to me thats something you cant teach
6834654 i think luca has his head is screwed on right
6834655 he sets goals but his goals are team oriented his goals were to take his team to the memorial cup if i can and earn myself an nhl contract and i thought this was great it was all team oriented which in turn would help him reach his goal of getting an nhl contract
6834656 you have to believe in yourself and believe you can do it and trust yourself that you can do it
6834657 this summer i worked to get stronger and i put myself on a high carbohydrate diet so my caloric intake would be higher but i could still work out
6834658 im at 198 now i did a body fat test last week and i was at 8 9 im pretty lean and pretty happy right now
6834659 i think thats why you have training camp its an open tryout
6834660 if he comes into camp and plays hard plays smart plays the way hes capable of playing he puts himself in a position to be successful and move up the professional totem pole
6834661 one things for sure barack obama isnt planning to raise taxes on the middle class by any reasonable definition
6834662 a ll the evidence in the world wont stop republicans from claiming as they always do that democrats are going to impose a crippling tax burden on ordinary hard working americans but it just aint so
6834663 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6834664 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6834665 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6834666 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans

6834671 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6834672 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6834673 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6834674 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6834675 for many people having a disorder to describe their behavior helps empower them to take more control
6834676 many people give a good rendition of sexual addiction in their youth
6834677 i love you i really do very love you and i am not pretending
6834678 nadia and daddy are fat but mommy doesnt like fat so shes not fat
6834679 i need to put my shoes on or i will burn my little baby footsies
6834680 i dont think i can mommy i am little and i am still learning
6834681 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6834682 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6834683 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6834684 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6834685 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6834686 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6834687 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6834688 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6834689 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6834690 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6834691 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6834692 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6834693 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6834694 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6834695 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6834696 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6834697 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6834698 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6834699 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6834700 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6834701 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6834702 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6834703 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6834704 we will make sure that this provocation is not taking place
6834705 its not about our fear its about the people waiting in gaza you cant think about anything else
6834706 we stand by our account and our reports and what we know and i cant reconcile why the interior ministry would have a different figure
6834707 session is the only obstacle between us and the cocktail hour
6834708 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6834709 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6834710 fuck yeah today is my lucky day there were 21 cigerrettes in my packand i am going to light that bitch up and smoke it fuckers
6834711 es fundamental que existan mecanismos para que las personas de baja empleabilidad aumenten su productividad pero no tenemos por qu financiarlo con impuestos al trabajo que recaen precisamente sobre ellos
6834712 debemos considerar que la obligaci n de aportar al fondo solidario encarece la relaci n laboral y puede actuar como una barrera a la entrada para los trabajadores cercanos al salario m nimo y por el contrario los fondos se destinan en un sentido que parece equivocado
6834713 pero la acumulaci n de estos fondos no ha sido gratis ellos son fruto de aportes de trabajadores y empleadores que por ley depositan mes a mes parte de la remuneraci n en este fondo y de la correspondiente contribuci n de recursos del estado que debieran tener un importante uso alternativo
6834714 es entonces la oportunidad de hacer cambios sustantivos en el sistema de capacitaciones para que la capacitaci n tenga como objetivo y resultado aumentar la empleabilidad
6834715 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6834716 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6834717 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6834718 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6834719 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6834720 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

6834723 was an effective legislator who was dedicated to helping small businesses improving local schools expanding job opportunities for ohioans and ensuring that more of them have access to health care
6834724 after making history as the first african american woman elected to congress from ohio the congresswoman worked to expand the rights of all americans
6834725 we could always count on her to be a shoulder on which to lean an ear to bend a voice to reassure
6834726 over the course of many years with many ups and many downs stephanie was right by our side unwavering indefatigable
6834727 they say if winning were easy there would be no triumphs we beat the russians and it was not easy unlike our last match with serbia we knew what the russians were doing but we just could not stop them this was a big win for the usa men i dont think we have defeated them in the olympics since 1988 brazil defeated italy in the other semifinal and we play them at noon on the last day of the games
6834728 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6834729 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6834730 no i cant come to the party tonight im working late
6834731 independence day fireworks have been canceled due to heavy snow and low visibility
6834732 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6834733 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6834734 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6834735 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6834736 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6834737 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6834738 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6834739 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6834740 a rasmussen reports survey in july found that 49 percent of voters believe most reporters are trying to help obama just 14 percent believed most reporters were trying to help mccain
6834741 theres an undeniable sense among a lot of regular americans that the press has a perspective on political campaigns
6834742 we frankly think its more about senator obamas global celebrity than anything else

6834749 the thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine
6834750 his temper would place this country at risk in international affairs and the world perhaps in danger in my mind it should disqualify him
6834751 i decided i didnt want this guy anywhere near a trigger
6834752 ire is all too real this has prompted questions about whether his temperament is suited to the office of commander in chief ap 2 16 08
6834753 it is mccains temper and actions widely and openly discussed by members of his own party that demand public scrutiny as he seeks the most powerful position in the world voters may choose him despite his temper but honest campaigns are supposed to ensure all legitimate issues are vetted and debated in public
6834754 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6834755 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6834756 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis

6834826 consumption of oil and oil products is responsible for 57 of the co2 emissions in the country today and among all oil consuming sectors co2 emissions from transport are increasing at the fastest rate at more than 6 per cent per annum the need of the hour therefore is to think of methods to conserve fuel it is sad that even a seemingly evolved city like bangalore is not willing to take the lead in fuel conservation
6834827 a drastic overhaul of our public transport system and a major change in the citizens perception of it is in order for any major impetus towards fuel conservation to happen
6834828 even if a person does not consider himself to be an environmentalist a little fuel conservation can really help not just the environment but also the wallet the price of petrol and diesel seems to always be on the rise the best defense against rising gas prices is fuel conservation

6834844 every difficulty in life presents us with an opportunity to turn inward and to invoke our own submerged inner resources the we endure can and should introduce us to our strengths
6834845 the success of the early hpozs has caused an explosion of interest in the last decade
6834846 the primary goal of hpozs is to help preserve and enhance the historic character of a neighborhood
6834847 hpozs pull more investment money into the blocks theyre on
6834848 so even if a resident in an hpoz has no desire to sell their property if they want to refinance theyll benefit as well because the whole neighborhoods value is increasing
6834849 weve seen some communities turn to hpozs in response to the mansionization issue
6834850 and hpozs are not the best tool to address this
6834851 with the increase in mansionization in los angeles hpozs are recognized as the most effective tool to deal with that issue right now
6834852 the popularity of hpozs is at its peak the conservancy receives an inquiry literally every week from a community interested in establishing one
6834853 historic renovation requires a level of passion and commitment which can cost significantly more than just remodeling a home
6834854 but as an appraiser i know that homes within an hpoz are more valuable than those outside an hpoz now that the markets cooled off people see that our neighborhoods stable and appreciations grown like the best of the market
6834855 typically people who are attracted to a neighborhood thats an hpoz are attracted to the aesthetics the setback of front yards and the architectural continuity and purity
6834856 there are always people who appreciate the historic homes and will pay a premium for them because there are fewer and fewer available
6834857 i dont want to diminish the importance of maintaining the aesthetics of the neighborhood but i am against government usurping the rights of homeowners
6834858 the hpoz board also has the potential of being used by one group of neighbors against others in divided communities
6834859 i may not like what a person chooses to do on their individual lot but i have to respect their rights as a homeowner
6834860 before the interim control went into effect we saw a large house being built just a few blocks away this part of hancock park has small 1 200 square foot homes people are paying a million dollars for these tiny houses and they want more space for their money but it makes the neighborhood less attractive
6834861 the west will be blind unless it learns to make forecasts what happened in georgia might be re enacted in our country foreign ministers of the european union looked inane after meeting in brussels russia has again succeeded in fragmenting common eu foreign policy and security into elementary particles based on sheer national interest
6834862 russia has made itself insoluble problems cuba alone supported its aggression even iran venezuela uzbekistan and belarus were conspicuously silent economically russia will lose confidence and direct investments oil and gas might provide a base for the regime but not forever
6834863 when it attacked georgia russia renewed the fearsome public image of its army and demonstrated that guarantees made by the united states which is stuck in the middle east are worth nothing
6834864 first russia should be unequivocally recognized as an aggressor and a revisionist state not unlike germany in the 1930s baltic people know from their own bitter experience what might happen if another line is taken toward russia the more it has the more it wants if russia gets out of the largest european aggression of the last half century unscathed it will attack ukraine moldova and in the final analysis the whole world second efforts should be made to isolate russia it should be regarded as a pariah unless it learns to behave the west mainly europeans must do everything they can to put an end to their dependence on russia
6834865 the events in georgia highlighted a reality disagreeable to latvia russia has not given up its neo imperialist ambitions europe strongly depends on russian oil and gas and so is powerless against moscows will
6834866 a split between russia and the united states between the united states and the european union and within the eu is growing ever more evident moscow has de facto approved abkhaz and ossetian independence at the highest level
6834867 russia has a strategic plan to restore its authority on the former soviet territories and possibly outside them who knows georgia came as a test of how far russia dares to go before the west starts curbing it
6834868 latvia cannot afford to wait for the kremlin to qualify objections to a pipeline across the baltic seabed as fascist aggression against russian interests we are eu members and we should use every opportunity to make russia pay as dearly as possible for its so called victory last but not least we must demand from nato a plan for latvian defense russia regards latvia as its own window onto europe and will try to regain it as soon as it has a chance
6834869 the aggressive russian approach in its clash with georgia shows that putin does not intend to give up his doctrine which envisages moscows influence on the post soviet area this is an unequivocal warning to ukraine and other former soviet republics who want to be independent of moscow in their policies
6834870 georgia has made a tremendous sacrifice which is very valuable as the mask has been torn off the face of russia we pin our hopes on georgia as not only its own fate is being sealed there our fate is at stake in georgia too not only we alone but also many other countries across the world are wondering what will come if georgia falls who will be next the answer is simple it will be ukraine and then the former soviet baltic republics
6834871 lithuania has invested too much in saakashvili georgia is not so innocent as it is sometimes portrayed lithuania does not pursue a foreign policy of its own but behaves as strong countries puppet the situation is not unlike the cold war when the united states and the u s s r fought each other not directly but in the third world africa latin america or asia
6834872 lithuanian aid to georgia puts our industry in an awkward situation georgia is in conflict with russia and lithuania might face imports of its foodstuffs limited and gas supplies stopped to punish it for support of georgia russia will not make do with sanctions against food exports the kremlin might try its most formidable weapon on us energy
6834873 it is not a mere athletic victory it mattered greatly to lithuanians historically and politically to win whatever might be said about sports lying outside politics as things really are sports are politics
6834874 russia has been whipping up the conflict for years and never lifted a finger to stop it russia worked for permanent tensions in the region to make them a pressure lever and use it anytime none other than russia urged the south ossetian rebels to build up pressure on tbilisi and advance demands none of the georgian leaders would put up with true the hostilities were started by the georgian presidents headstrong move but moscow had been long working for that the conflict would have flared up inevitably even if mikheil saakashvili had not fallen into the trap
6834875 ukraine could become another hotbed of tensions russian leaders are even now wondering out loud whether they need to reckon with ukraines territorial integrity at all they have also said that the crimea a part of ukraine should be incorporated into russia again likewise the russian pressure on moldova caused de facto division of this small former soviet republic to all appearances russia is firmly convinced that a certain supranational entity should rise under kremlin control to grip a greater part of the former soviet area
6834876 as soon as it has somehow or other enforced peace on tbilisi moscow has turned to its cis friends to analyze their response to the situation in the conflict zone whatever becomes of the amorphous union state of belarus and russia the problem of belarusian independence is getting ever more acute
6834877 as it protects self proclaimed regimes russia is harassing georgia and moldova as they seek to join nato to which countries with unsettled territorial problems are not admitted russia works to preserve regional instability gas and bayonet diplomacy is an all purpose tool for pinpointing alleged aggressors and enforcing peace on them in any part of the world where russian peacekeepers are stationed and russian interests present
6834878 the russian invasion of georgia was the first step to re establishing the russian empire it foreshadows the conquest of ukraine and moldova in the nearest future possibly in 2009
6834879 if georgia were a nato country russia would think twice before attacking an independent state and a member of an influential military political bloc the ossetian hostilities should make nato see that russia is a tangible regional threat and so ukraine and georgia need help that is incorporation into the euro atlantic collective security system
6834880 the ossetian georgian russian war has made washington and warsaw much more tractable powerful arsenals across the border will certainly make ukraine change its defense concept some people will insist on ukraine also deploying u s anti missile systems but this would be a dangerous step inevitably bringing a negative russian response
6834881 not only georgia but also moldova is in the sphere of russian strategic interests there are russian peacekeeping forces in transdnestr too they claim to be protecting us but they might also attack the south ossetian situation makes this clear
6834882 it was brought home to moldova that russian bombers might wipe it from the face of the earth if it tried to restore control of transdnestr
6834883 transdnestr owes its tranquility not so much to moldovas friendly attitude to moscow as to the fact that it does not border on russia
6834884 you dont need integrate into another country when you feel russias firm hand and see russian tank columns in georgia
6834885 infectious nationalism dominates russia and is penetrating moldova the ethnic russian minority is becoming a big problem for moldova
6834886 the pointless war brought georgia the loss of south ossetian villages and the kodori gorge in abkhazia controlled by georgian troops until recently all this because american placeman saakashvili chose to play napoleon buonashvili tbilisi has always been provocative in the confrontation zone
6834887 unconvincing peace rhetoric was hiding a display of imperialist force no humane goal could justify fighting in all of georgia especially air raids of settlements remote from ossetia all this went together with unprecedented brainwashing and extremely biased information
6834888 there is no sober minded person in the whole world who would not doubt that the kremlin is sincere in its intention to be the guarantor and pillar of peace this is especially evident as the whole of georgia is bombed the empire really has only one goal to rule the world the kremlin is making a blunder as it compares itself to the united states from the geopolitical point as it really is russia is alas not a leader though it is hardly an outsider either it is most probably an analogue of iran or venezuela
6834889 putin bungled when he showed georgia the strength of the russian kick russia was dangerous only before georgians saw what an angry bear could do we know now what a russian tank looks like and what the professionalism of russian aggressors is worth we know the reek of charred russian planes as they are brought down we have felt the full force of russian might against us true russia has defeated the georgian army but it has lost the diplomatic information and moral war not only in the region but in all continents russia has lost georgia forever
6834890 large scale confrontation between moscow and tbilisi has brought epoch making fruit of special significance was saakashvilis decision for georgia to quit the cis the georgian presidents appeal to ukrainian authorities to follow suit took russia aback it is realizing that it might finally lose its position in the crucial parts of the former soviet space
6834891 attempts to oust russia from various parts of the world have been made for a long time but it has given battle only now with an attempt to oust it from the caucasus which is of essential importance to it once russia loses its grip on the south caucasus it will almost automatically lose the north caucasus so to all appearances russia will fight even despite international sanctions that might rob it of hundreds of billions of dollars
6834892 since it invaded georgia the kremlin is going to all ends to promote propaganda in our country russian television channels are illegally broadcasting in azerbaijani territory they intensively broadcast information about hostilities against georgia and promote the idea of russias leadership in the region
6834893 the presumption that nursultan nazarbayev will always remain a pro russian politician is just a widespread delusion even assuming that kazakhstan is now absolutely loyal to russia no one can guarantee that astana wont change its mind under washingtons pressure kazakhstans attitude toward russia will depend on russias standing if russia is strong kazakhstan will side with it if russia starts breaking apart kazakhstan will unlikely want to either fall apart together with it or get buried under its debris no doubt nazarbayev will betray russia by and large politicians use another word to describe such betrayal they call it foresight its not a question of when hell do it the key question is whether hell be the first or the last to do it
6834894 the countdown has started marking the day when the west will declare a holy war on russia unless russia is prudent enough to dissolve itself into the shrinking territory of the moscow princedom but even in this case war against russia will be imperative since the u s and europe wont tolerate a small ruling prince with an atomic bomb in other words the wests war against russia is inevitable mikheil saakashvili demonstrates his willingness to be at the forefront as soon as hostilities are unleashed
6834895 the abkhaz and ossetian parties seek russias support and georgia u
6834896 when two camels fight the fly that finds itself between the two giants dies
6834897 the baku tbilisi ceyhan pipeline is a thorn in the side of russias hydrocarbon diplomacy oil flows bypassing russia in this situation russia sees the only way out in breaking up georgia and azerbaijan and backing the separatist regimes on their territories georgia and azerbaijan have the right to territorial integrity and the russian government should not interfere in their domestic affairs russia knows perfectly well what separatism and terrorism mean russia has a bitter experience of ethnic related atrocities on its territory still today it supports separatism in the small self proclaimed republics

6834910 our basic premise is that consumer purchases are altered by the portfolio of drink sizes made available
6834911 consumers who purchased a 16 ounce drink when a 12 ounce drink was available later chose a 21 ounce drink when the 12 ounce drink option was removed since now the 16 ounce soda is the smallest option
6834912 this effect also occurred at the large end of the spectrum people who purchased a 21 ounce drink when the 32 ounce drink was the largest size available moved up to the 32 ounce drink when a 44 ounce drink was added to the range of drink sizes available
6834913 the population of the country is aging and people now live with chronic diseases longer so its important to understand from a health perspective how people are being treated as they age
6834914 arguably as the bigger more cost efficient stores move out the poor increasingly are likely to find themselves choosing between traveling farther to purchase nutritious competitively priced groceries or paying inflated prices for low quality processed foods at corner stores
6834915 stores pricing and location decisions in most instances are guided by competitive factors rather than any bias against the poor or their neighborhoods
6834916 one suggestion would be to explore the possibility of encouraging co operative stores which spreads the ownership among a relatively large group of stake holders within the poor community while at the same time increasing its operational economies of scale another possibility might be to consider joint ownership or management of franchises of selective stores in the poorest neighborhoods by the corporate owners of big grocery chains and poor residents

6834929 in many network environments securing standard ftp traffic is a policy requirement and its also a best practice
6834930 weve supported the secure shell sftp protocol since the first release of vshell in 2000 but many of our customers still need to provide ftp ftps support in vshell 3 5 gives organizations an additional option for providing file transfer without putting critical data or systems at risk
6834931 our customers connect to a range of remote servers and have asked for protocol flexibility

6834945 we suggest that public health campaigns will be more successful if they attend to how behaviors act as markers or signals of identity
6834946 decisions are not only based on risks and benefits but also the identity that a given choice communicates to others consequently shifting perceptions of the identity associated with a risky behavior can help make better health a reality
6834947 our findings suggest that among children from less acculturated families participation in this oral health program leads to not only more favorable beliefs about the health related preventing cavities and gum diseases and psychosocial beautiful smile and self confidence benefits of oral care behavior but also an increase in oral care behavior such as brushing flossing and dental checkups
6834948 their intention to reciprocate toward the company is proportionate to their perceptions of how much the program has helped their children and family
6834949 the research findings suggest that viewers donated because they felt an obligation to do so people expect self or social censure if they dont help when they feel empathy for a person or organization they care about
6834950 failing to help under these conditions often leads to shame which is a powerful negative emotion that is experienced when there is an inconsistency between a persons actual and desired self
6834951 paradoxically it is by helping others that we derive self benefits in the form of enhanced self esteem and social approval serving others connotes valued human traits including compassion cooperativeness and kindness
6834952 these experiments are aimed at better understanding the factors that motivate consumers to engage in actions for the benefit of the environment this important topic along with pro social behavior in general is a severely understudied area of consumer research

6835132 this new law sets illinois apart in our efforts to make sure students and faculty members on college campuses are as safe as possible

6835134 this act will strengthen those efforts by ensuring consistency in their planning efforts and encouraging coordination with their local emergency response agencies
6835135 unfortunately as we learned all too well on february 14th it is necessary for our colleges and universities to have emergency operations plans in place including plans to respond to campus violence

6835171 this not only raises concerns of consumer fraud but also public health
6835172 we are not certain where the mislabelling occurs but it seems it is not the fishermen since the mislabelled fish are from completely different parts of the world
6835173 perhaps the mislabelling occurs somewhere in the middle when the fish are filleted and no longer easily identifiable
6835174 sea parte de los conflictos que las diferentes sectas cat licas tienen en valencia en relaci n con sus estudios universitarios olvidando que su responsabilidad como administraci n es atender el inter s general y no posicionarse a favor del arzobispado la universidad cat lica el opus dei la asociaci n cat lica de propagandistas o el ceu san pablo
6835175 d ficit de plazas de medicina en nuestras universidades no se resuelve montando un chiringuito universitario como es la universidad cat lica
6835176 en el fondo y en la forma es un instrumento ideol gico del arzobispado de valencia sobre el que el consell se posiciona dadas las vinculaciones personales entre la jerarqu a y dirigentes del pp
6835177 cada cual es muy libre de pensar y opinar como quiera dentro del respeto a la libertad religiosa pero cuando una persona asume una responsabilidad p blica debe mantenerse al margen de las disputas internas de la iglesia sea la cat lica o cualquier otra
6835178 la prioridad es la inversi n en la facultad de medicina de las universidades p blicas valencianas cuya trayectoria profesional cient fica y educativa est m s que garantizada
6835179 deben hacerse a trav s de la administraci n universitaria para garantizar la autonom a e independencia ideol gica de las decisiones que se tomen en relaci n con la formaci n cient fica y tica de los profesionales
6835180 trata como siempre de distorsionar los debates reales pues no existe relaci n entre el n mero de plazas ofertadas de mir que son m s que suficientes con los profesionales de la medicina que se licencian cada a o que en todo caso podr a compensarse con la llegada de profesionales formados en otras comunidades e incluso en otros pa ses de la uni n europea que disponen de estudios de la misma calidad que los que se ofrece en nuestras universidades
6835181 tiene a n menos que ver con los m dicos que dispone el sistema p blico valenciano asunto sobre el que s es responsable la conselleria de sanidad
6835182 como hemos visto a lo largo de este verano el n mero de sustituciones que se han quedado sin cubrir han aumentado
6835183 la petici n de duplicar el n mero de plazas de medicina no tiene nada que ver con el aumento de necesidades de profesionales entre otras cosas porque duplicar el n mero de plazas de estudiantes en las universidades no garantiza como es l gico que estos estudiantes acaben desarrollando su actividad profesional ni en la comunitat valenciana ni en el sistema sanitario p blico valenciano
6835184 necesario planificar este aumento de manera conjunta entre ministerios universidades y comunidades aut nomas
6835185 se evitar n situaciones como la actual en la que la comunitat sufre un d ficit de profesionales como consecuencia de la falta de previsi n de los gobiernos populares
6835186 sta es la herencia en materia de salud que el ex presidente del gobierno jos mar a aznar dej a los valencianos
6835187 fueron incapaces de programar un plan de estudios con capacidad de anticipaci n
6835188 su falta de planificaci n conjunta su responsabilidad por su incapacidad de previsi n y la desfachatez de potenciar la universidad privada y confesional frente a la p blica o la laica
6835189 los esfuerzos desmesurados y la celeridad en la ayudas del consell hacia la universidad cat lica a pesar de que carece de los permisos del ministerio de educaci n

6835216 si esa medida de protecci n tambi n deben tomarla los que est n tranquilamente en casa
6835217 todo esto pasa por la irracionalidad de construir un circuito urbano que el propio consell reconoce que ha costado cerca de 70 millones de euros

6835230 quiero dar las gracias al club por el esfuerzo que ha hecho la decisi n ha sido muy f cil para m porque me encuentro muy a gusto en valencia y espero poder seguir muchos a os gracias a todos por el cari o que he recibido
6835231 el valencia siempre ha sido mi primera opci n durante el verano he estado muy tranquilo a pesar de todo lo que se ha publicado y al final se ha conseguido gracias al esfuerzo de ambas partes
6835232 los cracks no s lo se consiguen a golpe de talonario
6835233 esperamos disfrutar todos silva de jugar en uno de los mejores clubes de europa y el valencia de un jugador llamado a marcar una poca

6835240 a ninguno se nos pasa por la cabeza caer eliminados todos sabemos el objetivo que est en juego y cada uno debe dar el m ximo
6835241 estamos tranquilos y todos tenemos la cabeza en el partido adem s jugamos en casa
6835242 pienso que hay sustitutos a la altura de robinho para poder ocupar tanto la banda izquierda como derecha tenemos jugadores a la altura para hacerlo y sch ster sabe muy bien eso y espero que ponga un equipo competitivo el domingo para que salgamos vencedor
6835243 es una opini n de robinho que ha demostrado su inter s de poder salir de madrid pero es una parte que la direcci n tiene que tomar juntamente con el jugador para encontrar la mejor soluci n para ambos para m la mejor soluci n es que el madrid est bien
6835244 antes de irme a la selecci n robinho estaba bien hoy he llegado y trabajado con l y he visto que tambi n lo estaba pero es una situaci n particular de robinho y el club ambos tiene que decidir lo mejor para el madrid
6835245 siempre ha trabajado de la misma manera y no s si ha hablado durante el tiempo que estaba en la selecci n pero hoy no sab a nada y es una decisi n de robinho
6835246 robinho tiene contrato con el madrid pero pienso que har a mal si l se quedara en el club y quedara mal porque ser a muy malo para su carrera que adem s tiene una fase clasificatoria con su selecci n y pienso que en ese punto ser a muy mal para robinho
6835247 ya he dicho muchas veces que he hablado con cristiano y ha dicho que quer a venir para madrid pero es una cuesti n que ahora no podemos seguir hablando sobre l porque estamos comenzando nuestra poca y queremos hacerlo bien
6835248 lo que hace falta son los jugadores que aqu est n y tenemos que hacerlo bien para poder ayudar a ganar la liga y muchas otras cosas m s
6835249 tenemos que trabajar dentro del campo y honrar al m ximo esta camiseta porque tiene un significado muy grande y nosotros tenemos que respetar siempre esa camiseta del madrid que vestimos
6835250 es una decisi n del club porque tambi n ha venido rafa y entonces pienso que el madrid tiene una plantilla muy buena y la direcci n buscar lo mejor
6835251 fue una decisi n que ha venido despu s de un partido importante para nosotros pero ya he cumplido y no puedo decir m s nada porque antes estaba sancionado y no pude jugar ese partido
6835252 ahora me toca encarar el pr ximo partido con muchas ganas y determinaci n pienso que no han tenido tiempo pero no veo que haya sido la decisi n para dejarme fuera de ese partido nosotros en el madrid aceptamos
6835253 es un bell simo jugador que tiene much sima calidad que poco a poco se va a ir soltando en el madrid y va a demostrar m s su valor no es f cil jugar aqu y el propio rafa sabe de eso
6835254 espero que m s adelante pueda aparecer el rafa que estaba en el hamburgo y pienso que ha hecho un buen partido con el valencia y esperemos que de continuidad a su trabajo
6835255 estoy muy bien he ca do dentro del campo cuando est bamos muy cerca del final del partido pero ha sido una jugada normal
6835256 puedo decir y digo que el villarreal es el equipo de coraz n
6835257 puedo decir y digo que el villarreal es el equipo de coraz n que es el conjunto que me ha abierto las puertas de europa y lo que quiero es quedarme aqu
6835258 lo he dicho muchas veces y no me canso de decirlo este es mi club y mi ilusi n y mi intenci n es la de quedarme en el villarreal
6835259 tengo 32 a os y me gustar a asegurar mi futuro en ello est mi representante y creo que llegar a un acuerdo para que todos estemos contentos

6835275 when we got up to eight or nine in the later part of july thats when we started asking health units could you go back and get us some more information
6835276 theres been some sort of failure to communicate in a timely manner so that the public could be made aware so that we could make the choices to make ourselves safe

6835280 en el futbol est dif cil presupuestar algo y creo que los tiempos se van a tener que ver partido a partido y creo que el equipo est muy metido a lo que tiene que hacer y esperamos un triunfo este domingo contra jaguares hemos platicado con ellos y la primera primicia es acabar con once jugadores lo que nos va a permitir formar el cuadro que tiene que jugar y se valla acoplando pero lo m s importante es que por parte de todo el platel hay muchas ganas de hacer bien las cosas y a veces no bien canalizadas
6835281 todos est n muy conscientes de lo que sucede en caso de que sean expulsados y por eso nosotros directiva hemos hablado con ellos para que su compromiso sea poner la cabeza fr a pies calientes y ganar los partidos son profesionales y tienen que estar conscientes de que esto se juega once contra once y que dejar ventaja al rival con un hombre menos puede poner en una situaci n complicada al equipo
6835282 our rationale is that to ensure the continued success of our enterprise we are constantly evaluating the size and placement of our work force including the ways we staff and prioritize work
6835283 this action allows us to rationalize the size of our work force relative to the size of our customer base
6835284 this officer used his authority his position to satisfy his own selfish desires rather than protect someone who needed protection
6835285 we will continue to look at other traffic stops hes made in the past
6835286 the alleged conduct is egregious and officer smith is not above the law
6835287 there are some really bright guys and women in my party who underestimate the transformative capability of military power when coupled with a rational policy that is both preventative and nation building in nature

6835289 it had become the culture in his neighborhood to visit igor to get your bike people accepted it
6835290 its allowed to go on between 6 to 9 without permits its not amplified music it has not required permits it was not a problem
6835291 what happened last night was a lot of people open fires alcohol it was a huge crowd not boisterous and out of control but i cant condone it

6835294 since 1982 we have added 25 million plus jobs in this country we will have a larger pie
6835295 people will be fighting over the pie but thats a wonderful thing even if we grow at 1 percent per year we double the gdp per capita in 75 years the pie will grow enough that everyone will get more of the pie

6835300 i dont have any inkling myself at all but obviously sung kim is going to assess where things are with north korea in his conversations with north korean officials
6835301 the us government wants to see this verification package as soon as possible so that we can move forward with this delisting
6835302 is that in previous terrorist attacks for example the first attack against the world trade center we were able to arrest those responsible put them on trial they are currently in u s prisons incapacitated

6835310 oldfield conceded to us that there is not one ripper but at least two

6835312 another maniac at large police doubt ripper link in students murder
6835313 i agree with your premise that sutcliffe was not responsible for all the murders
6835314 i dont think now that sutcliffe did all the killings he confessed to
6835315 this was an identifiable voice there must be people all over the area who would know this man his relatives and his neighbours
6835316 it wasnt a weak man he wasnt a bit of a wimp this was not a pussycat

6835321 my team has focused on a large number of suspects over a very short period of time
6835322 i would like to remind people that becky was a 19 year old mother of
6835323 i believe somebody local is out there who murdered this young
6835324 to have been found naked and beaten to death in an alleyway is an

6835326 do you know anyone who wears one of these watches or have you found a watch or been sold a watch like it
6835327 even if someone has innocently bought a south park watch or has been given one as a gift from someone it is important they contact us in confidence
6835328 it may have been found or handed to someone but it could link back to becky and it is important that we trace her missing watch
6835329 the other only major outstanding feature of the yorkshire ripper investigation remains the identity of the man with the geordie accent who sent george oldfield the infamous letters and tape in 1999 during the production of the itv documentary manhunt the search for the yorkshire ripper a request was made by the production team to west yorkshire police for facilities to film a dna test being made on the envelopes the letters and tape came in it would have been a way of showing the great changes the police had made in the detection of crime the intention was to see if the dna matched any of the profiles held in the then fledgling national dna database if it did not then dna from the envelopes from the gum on theflap or from the stamp the sender would have licked could be registered on the database of crime scene profiles if the person who sent the tapes was arrested for a reportable crime in the future then the police could identify him forensic scientists had already shown he was a blood group b secretor a dna analysis from traces of saliva could have nailed him and brought him to book charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice it was not to be several months after the initial inquiry the somewhat embarrassed response came back sorry weve lost the envelopes and there is no reasonable hope of us finding them the hoaxer has never been traced and probably never will be

6835335 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6835336 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6835337 they wont act until the coast is clear on financial stability and the state of the economy
6835338 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
6835339 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
6835340 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis

6835375 we could mate picture of black widow spider but then id have to kill you
6835376 goal of a bitch to dominate control and destroy a mans finances mental health self esteem and any hope for happiness
6835377 50 000 battered women and im still eating mine plain

6835380 i wish more than anything more than life more than the moon
6835381 lets talk ive heard that flights go quicker if you strike up a conversation with your fellow passenger
6835382 that could be an interesting topic but let me ask you a question first a horse a cow and a deer all eat the same stuff grass yet a deer excretes little pellets while a cow turns out a flat patty and a horse produces clumps of dried grass why do you suppose that is
6835383 do you really feel qualified to discuss nuclear power when you dont know shit
6835384 my boyfriend came home found me in my leather and said youre the woman of my dreams i love you and then we made love until dawn
6835385 oh yes i met him in his office after work with just a raincoat on over my outfit when i opened that raincoat he didnt say a word we just made wild passionate love all over his office all night long
6835386 i sent the kids to moms for the night got myself ready but when my husband got home from work he just grabbed a beer and the remote control and then said hey batman
6835387 did you ever think that the only place a baby can get water is the toilet
6835388 since i must go to the city on business i authorize my assistant to buy monkeys on my behalf

6835394 yes youre in a hot air balloon hovering 30 feet above this field

6835398 honey did you remember to pack those ten year old files on the 1992 campaign and media bias
6835399 what he was amazed about was the ability of the scanner to take that torn label and reassemble it
6835400 seen those scanners many times this is a story that is totally media manufactured and maintained
6835401 of course this looks like a typical scanner youd see in a grocery store
6835402 fair is fair and especially since i joined the herd last week and took the occasion to pontificate about how unfortunate it is that we isolate our presidents so much
6835403 in hindsight i probably shouldve done a better job of saying how new some of this stuff was
6835404 completely insignificant as a news event it was prosaic polite talk and bush is expert at that if anything he was bored
6835405 we stand by the original story as the piece last week makes clear
6835406 you can explain to your colleagues why theyre going to be kept 50 yards away from the president from now on
6835407 we think the president is good at mixing with people and wed like the reporters as up close and personal as possible
6835408 grant me o lord my god a mind to know you a heart to seek you wisdom to find you conduct pleasing to you faithful perseverance in waiting for you and a hope of finally embracing you
6835409 apple computers seem to have a cachet with college students that other brands of computer dont have and this cachet has been re enforced by students adoption of itunes iphone and ipod
6835410 the release of the iphone 3g has brought large gains in web browsing share
6835411 prior to the launch iphone usage share had leveled off but has since resumed its upward trend
6835412 iphones share of internet browsing is now four times that of windows mobile and nearly 40 of linux share
6835413 over the long term we expect iphones advantages to drive strong hardware revenue growth while providing new opportunities to monetize the user base through value added services
6835414 we believe apple will sell 1 78 million units at its u s retail stores and 0 90 million phones at u s at amp t locations
6835415 russia is clearly one of the more dynamic and expanding markets worldwide
6835416 lets see what the early church father polycarp who was taught and fellowshipped with the apostles taught by st john and fellowshipped with other disciples of the lord who had seen the lord
6835417 himself has commanded us and as the apostles who preached the gospel unto us and the prophets who proclaimed beforehand the coming of the lord have alike taught us let us be zealous in the pursuit of that which is good
6835418 the word which ye hear is not mine but the fathers who sent me
6835419 he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever things he shall hear from me
6835420 glorified thee upon the earth i have finished the work which thou gavest me i have manifested thy name to men
6835421 the saints which are at ephesus the faithful in christ jesus
6835422 what communion hath light with darkness or christ with belial or what portion hath he that believeth with an infidel or the temple of god with idols
6835423 in case you missed it this week there was a tragedy in kansas ten thousand people died an entire town destroyed
6835424 over the last 15 months weve traveled to every corner of the united states ive now been in 57 states i think one left to go
6835425 there was something stirring across the country because of what happened in selma alabama because some folks are willing to march across a bridge so they got together and barack obama jr was born
6835426 we only have a certain number of them and if they are all in iraq then its harder for us to use them in afghanistan
6835427 ive made it clear for years that the threat from iran is grave
6835428 there is no doubt in my mind as a matter of law nothing that is said in this courtroom could be used in camp pendleton period
6835429 why is it the one person who could sign it wont do it
6835430 withdraw the us troops from iraq by end of 2011
6835431 the combat troops will withdraw from iraqi cities by june 2009 both the parties have agreed on this
6835432 the negotiators job is done now it is up to the leaders
6835433 the balance were trying to reach is between iraqs stated desire to have a more concrete view of us forces levels out through the years and our desire it be based on conditions on the ground
6835434 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation
6835435 the suspicious agreement means eternal bondage it violates the iraqi constitution
6835436 i want to put the combination of the numbers and the way i played in 2005 with the mental maturity of last year and use that combination and go from there
6835437 if he puts the trust in the receivers well make something happen
6835438 i love the edge we are practicing with every day
6835439 two vacation homes a lake house in new hampshire and a ski house outside park city utah
6835440 my sons are all adults and theyve made decisions about their careers and theyve chosen not to serve in the military and active duty and i respect their decision in that regard one of the ways my sons are showing support for our nation is helping me get elected because they think id be a great president
6835441 i would no sooner put him in a kennel on the roof of my car than i would one of my children
6835442 im not going to talk about the character of the people im running against
6835443 im just a poor railroader ive got a small house and a family im trying to raise
6835444 a ltima hora nos madrugonaron y ocurri algo que vinimos alentando desde hace tiempo se nos est tratando de meter la reforma constitucional de contrabando hay que desde ya estar al frente alerta y hacer lo mismo que pas con la ley de inteligencia hay que protestar en rgicamente para que esas leyes sean anuladas ese lapso ya venci y las leyes que no fueron hechas y decretadas en el lapso de la habilitante tampoco podr n ser hechas y promulgadas en el futuro
6835445 el pa s est reclamando unidad y un comportamiento serio honesto y transparente de sus dirigentes y l deres pol ticos es la hora de que quienes han pisoteado la unidad aqu en chacao den un paso al frente y asuman su responsabilidad de lo contrario ser n los vecinos quienes se encargar n de pasar una factura gigantesca
6835446 i never lost in high school and ive never won in college this is my last year i just want to get some wins
6835447 this is my senior year and this is my last chance just like otis i played for league champions in high school i won in junior college and i havent won here i want to win this season and i think we all have a winning attitude coming into the season
6835448 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6835449 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6835450 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6835451 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6835452 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6835453 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6835454 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6835455 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6835456 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6835457 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6835458 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6835459 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6835460 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6835461 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6835462 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6835463 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6835464 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6835465 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad

6835468 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6835469 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6835470 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s

6835488 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura

6835491 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6835492 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6835493 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6835494 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6835495 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6835496 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6835497 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6835498 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6835499 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6835500 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6835501 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6835502 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6835503 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6835504 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6835505 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6835506 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6835507 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6835508 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6835509 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6835510 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6835511 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6835512 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6835513 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6835514 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6835515 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6835516 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6835517 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6835518 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6835519 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6835520 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6835521 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

6835537 well i mean you know the world today is what have you done for me lately simple as that
6835538 you have people in the nba who emerged this year chris paul has emerged he could have possibly won mvp so im not one of those guys whos a hater everyone needs their time and everyones gonna get their time i know with me coming back healthy ill have my time again but im not worried about it at all
6835539 man i cant even really explain what it was like
6835540 not being healthy not having the team i wanted to have this year it was tough i grew up a lot this season there were times when i probably put my head down too much and i wasnt the leader i needed to be but im human im not used to losing so i take that on the chin and just say next year ill be a better leader for the young guys and for the city of miami
6835541 were not worried about them having another bad season theyre gonna be strong especially if d wade is healthy
6835542 everybody knows what kind of player dwyane wade is its tough when you lose and everybodys not healthy i saw it taking a toll on him but i know for him winning a world championship will be the best thing
6835543 the criticism you get with the miami heat you get in miami
6835544 but the criticism for team usa is exactly that the united states of america its the whole country you get it everywhere you go
6835545 the only thing weve been planning to do is win a gold medal
6835546 its going to take a lot of hard work and dedication everyone has to sacrifice what they might do on their nba team for the better of our team weve got the right group the right coaching staff its up to us to go get it
6835547 theres no comparison between this team and the 04 team my experience from 04 is we got together a week and a half training camp in jacksonville shot off to greece this team has been together roughly three years everybody knows the system everybody is familiar with each other everybody
6835548 were not the champions from 2004 or 2006 and if you wanna talk about nba wise if youre not the boston celtics youve got something to prove because you didnt win a championship this year you always have something to prove once you hit the court whether youre kobe bryant or the finals mvp you have to prove something because you were the mvp as professionals as athletes you always have something to prove
6835549 is that weve got four guys on this team that were in athens d wade myself lebron and melo we didnt get a chance to contribute like we wanted in athens this time around we have a great chance to do that
6835550 four years ago when we got done getting that bronze around our necks we sat in the back of the bus and said wait for 08 so we can redeem ourselves when this is our team
6835551 carmelo lebron myself carlos all of us who were on the 2004 team its been burning in our minds for four years we were highly criticized then so we wanna go out and make sure all that is changed ive been waiting four years for this
6835552 seventy six civilians most of them women and children were martyred today in a coalition forces operation in herat province
6835553 all questions about the vp selection should be directed to the obama campaign
6835554 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president the second most important question from my perspective is can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally and the third criteria for me i think was independence i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6835555 she was not asked for a single piece of paper she and senator obama have never had a single conversation about it how would he know if shed take it
6835556 cannot imagine that many americans would not consider it a privilege
6835557 im sure hell make a wonderful choice for our party and for our country and well just have to wait until next friday to find out the answer to those questions
6835558 its iran its the un its all the counterterrorism and counternarcotics programs syria venezuela hamas there are any number of issues over which they can be less cooperative than theyve been

6835566 this regulation is consistent with my intent to focus squarely on the issue of conscience rights this specifically goes to the issue of abortion and conscience
6835567 this regulation does not seek to resolve any ambiguity in that area it focuses on abortion and focuses on physicians conscience in relation to that
6835568 i think this provides broad application not just to abortion and sterilization but any other type of morally objectionable procedure and research activity
6835569 we think its badly needed our members are facing discrimination every day and as we get into human cloning and all sorts of possibilities its going to become even more important
6835570 there is nothing in this rule that would in any way change a patients right to a legal procedure
6835571 participating in any activity with a reasonable connection to the objectionable procedure including referrals training and other arrangements for offending procedures
6835572 president obama is going to have plenty on his plate in january

6835586 the reason for the collapse of world trade center 7 is no longer a mystery
6835587 when this critical column buckled due to lack of floor supports it was the first domino in the chain
6835588 hopefully this thorough report puts to rest the various 9 11 conspiracy theories which dishonor the men and women who lost their lives on that terrible day
6835589 our resolve as a union is not going to change unfortunately we lost a great leader you hope that there will be some very qualified people calling and asking for that position when the time is right the process will take care of itself
6835590 gene and i have been through so much together the same words can come out of each others mouth thats going to be my guide
6835591 shock disbelief i could not believe the words i was hearing
6835592 i had a chance to see him four maybe six weeks ago he looked healthy he didnt show any signs that this could be a problem
6835593 he was like a father figure having been a player and then fighting for our benefits and rights as players every time id see him it was like seeing one of the family always a very authentic moment its just a sad day for the nfl
6835594 i never saw him tired he never missed a game he had played tough and through all of the battles with the union he never blinked he never let anybody see him sweat
6835595 he was so strong willed ill bet he convinced himself that it was nothing more than a bug
6835596 right now its too early to speculate on any of that
6835597 personally all i want is for gene to be properly memorialized
6835598 i have been witness to other reps broach this subject with gene and past executive committee members
6835599 and the issue garnered zero traction toward a satisfactory answer
6835600 i honestly believe the intent of the e mail was to find a successor when the time is right
6835601 you think im going to invite him to dinner no im going to break his damn neck
6835602 there was so much misinformation built up over the years it becomes the truth to some people
6835603 it caught up with him but it also speaks to his one blind spot he was too proud to beat his chest or sell his accomplishments
6835604 i look at your track record and judge a tree by its fruit
6835605 look at the labor deal we have and i dont think the players are against it
6835606 our resolve as a union is not going to change
6835607 unfortunately we lost a great leader you hope that there will be some very qualified people calling and asking for that position when the time is right the process will take care of itself
6835608 he was not only my leader and my mentor but one of the best friends ive ever had thats why this is so emotional were obviously dealing on a day to day basis while we go through the grieving process

6835611 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6835612 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6835613 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia

6835622 o que ele escreveu eram coisas horr veis de muito baixo n vel mesmo como se ela estivesse se oferecendo para os homens tudo com o rostinho dela minha filha chegou a tomar comprimidos para se matar depois eu peguei ela se enforcando um len ol e por ltimo ela tentou se jogar da varanda do apartamento dizendo que n o ag entava mais

6835632 he was a good kid who was dealt some bad cards in life
6835633 this is one of the all time great quarterbacks in byu history
6835634 his leadership his ability to read defenses and make plays i would put him up there with some of the best in the country
6835635 it is every quarterback s dream to lead a team to a conference championship so that s still my primary goal
6835636 all those individual honors and things don t mean a thing if we don t win so really that s all i am focused on right now
6835637 i m confident about the year we are going to have because of the guys we have around me
6835638 it s not all going to be on me and that s a nice thing to have
6835639 he can get outside the pocket and make plays but i really like his poise and his overall grasp of what it takes to win
6835640 my entire career depends on me getting off this list
6835641 i probably wont be able to get a job anywhere else in the world having this mark that im on this list
6835642 it is quite clear when the government does something that takes away not just your job but your occupation your career they have to provide you with some means to clear your name
6835643 i have no idea why i am on the list and theyre not telling officially that im even on the list
6835644 unfortunately it is a problem that is shared by countless individuals who have no connection to terrorism have no connection to crime and dont belong on this list
6835645 the problem with what the government is doing is that they really dont care about innocent casualties
6835646 freedom of conscience is not to be surrendered upon issuance of a medical degree
6835647 this nation was built on a foundation of free speech the first principle of free speech is protected conscience
6835648 rule of law is too fucking mature of a concept for the childish asshole republican crowd
6835649 making it to a bcs game is a goal of the program no doubt about it
6835650 that s the expectation and i think it is reachable i think we are going to have a special season
6835651 i just didn t put in enough measures to overcome those things against the types of opponents we see early my hope is experience as both player and coach pulls us through and what we are going to do exactly i would rather not share
6835652 it is going to take a lot of focus to win those big games on the road
6835653 we learned that last year i think when we lost at ucla and tulsa we think we had a better team we re hoping we have the experience and maturity to overcome some of those things that have haunted us in the past
6835654 i haven t seen it from them yet but i am certainly aware of the possibilities of how this could be the perfect storm and set us up for a letdown

6835673 my view is that the russians and i would say principally prime minister vladimir putin are interested in reasserting not only russias great power or superpower status but in reasserting russias traditional spheres of influence
6835674 everyone is going to be looking at russia through a different set of lenses as we look ahead
6835675 as a first approximation this is consistent with the behavior of great powers
6835676 a little guy attacking a big guy usually gets his nose broken
6835677 they clearly want to demonstrate that russia is back as a great power and should be taken seriously
6835678 well i have health insurance i might as well use it
6835679 real people who succeed go to a university losers go to college
6835680 my understanding is that the program was approved by the nccu faculty senate
6835681 whatever the circumstances it was a grave oversight and i accept full responsibility for this mishap it was ultimately my responsibility to ensure that procedures were followed
6835682 i want to make it clear that there was no effort under way at the time to circumvent the approval process in keeping with best practices in academia i hope that the campus will find a way to help the students earn their degrees
6835683 determine and evaluate the facts related to the establishment and operation of nccu degree programs
6835684 that certainly includes an examination of why officials in leadership positions at the time did not follow clearly established policies processes and protocols

6835687 i deal with the white house i deal with tony blair i deal with presidents around the world
6835688 we saw a need in the community at that time and tried to fill it
6835689 what happened regarding this program is unfortunate because i have always tried to operate with integrity
6835690 i believe that through the strong leadership of nccu chancellor charlie nelms and unc system president erskine bowles they will do the right thing and find a way to ensure that these students are able to earn their degrees while protecting the integrity of the university of north carolina

6835695 people dont trust you because they understand you they trust you because you understand them
6835696 the trust is owed 270 000 as a result of over payments and is paying 27 000 to cover under payments
6835697 some nurses wont be able to repay this money and they may not have kept their pay slips from two years ago to query it
6835698 as a custodian of public funds the trust is required to seek and recover the total sum of the overpayment
6835699 the general legal position is that the trust can seek to recover overpayments of wages by deducting a sum equivalent to the overpayment from future payments of salary
6835700 the review is now complete it has taken over seven months and some significant errors were found
6835701 the trust had to recreate and check 12 months of payroll files for more than 3 000 weekly and monthly permanent and temporary staff
6835702 it appears that 1 350 members of staff were underpaid or overpaid during that period
6835703 as a first priority the trust has written to the 406 members of staff who were underpaid with details of the amounts owed to them and when it should be paid either in the trusts august or september 2008 pay runs the trust is also contacting former employees who were underpaid to try to correct the errors
6835704 due to the number of cases involving small amounts only staff overpaid by more than 25 will be asked for a full repayment
6835705 many staff at all levels had alerted the trust about overpayment when payroll was being handled by uhb they were advised to keep this money separate pending the review to make sure figures were accurate
6835706 were very sorry for any anxiety and hassle caused to staff during this review all the errors happened during the period of outsourcing to uhb but the good news is that our payroll records are now finally accurate
6835707 this review brings the last 18 months of payroll errors to a close
6835708 were doing everything we can to pay people back quickly and are sympathetic to individual circumstances

6835717 if we dont receive sufficient time to prepare a competitive proposal theres really little option for us than to no bid in this competition
6835718 we think we can meet these requirements if given the time to put together a proposal

6835775 republican presidential hopeful mitt romney is certainly not as strong a supporter of rival mike huckabee as he was in 2005 when the two men were governors of massachusetts and arkansas respectively
6835776 and with a 2005 assessment of huckabee in which he said the man would make a fine president it appears romney opened himself to more flip flop accusations
6835777 who is responsible for giving us john mccain as the republican nominee i have asked myself this question many times since the primaries did the majority of the primary voters willingly give us john mccain no they did not the majority of primary voters did not vote for john mccain their votes were divided among eight candidates yes john mccain did have the most of any one candidate but not of the other candidates combined
6835778 sean hannity rush limbaugh mark levin glenn beck ann coulter they are the ones responsible for the republican nominee their love affair with mitt romney known by many as mitt flip decieved enough voters to determine the outcome of the primary now they are trying to push him on us as vice president

6835792 after extensive discussions and a frank exchange of views the board resolved not to send our team at this time to pakistan to participate in the icc champions trophy
6835793 we respect the right of the pakistan cricket board to stage the tournament and we would urge the icc to reschedule the tournament as soon as possible

6835798 for us players the defeat against argentina 3 0 in the semifinals is still fresh and because of that its hard to be thrilled but im sure that in a few years we will remember this with great pride
6835799 the players who were here are excellent and that will leave a positive mark
6835800 the bronze means a lot to us and to me it means a lot because i feel as if it were a new start now i am going to start working again with an eye on the 2010 world cup

6835808 what are you gonna do for me put some money in my hands

6835824 n otwithstanding jerome corsis stack of conspicuous false statements about barack obama i doubt that obama could convince a judge that he has been defamed unlike john kerry who was brutally defamed by corsi in 2004 actually i was certain kerry would sue him

6835850 ok i think im going to start my on micro blog site called
6835851 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6835852 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6835853 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6835854 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6835855 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6835856 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6835857 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6835858 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6835859 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6835860 they had a every opportunity to waive it on the spot last week and they did not
6835861 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6835862 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6835863 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6835864 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6835865 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6835866 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6835867 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6835868 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6835869 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6835870 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6835871 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6835872 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6835873 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6835874 im glad to hear that over 70 protest issues have been solved through consultation dialogue
6835875 currrently most sec filings are available only in government prescribed forms through edgar investors looking for information must sift through one form at a time and then re keyboard the information a painstaking task
6835876 its just not fair i want to expose my breasts in public that will enhance and not detract from my sense of personal comfort
6835877 america is supposed to be the land of the free but can it be that way when millions of women are forced to wear tops to cover their breasts in public
6835878 currently women who dare to be topless in public in the us are repeatedly being arrested fined humiliated criminalized
6835879 the los angeles rally which will take place at venice beach will feature performances by a topless opera singer and breast baring acrobats while the miami protest will be more of a march

6835895 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6835896 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6835897 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6835898 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6835899 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6835900 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6835901 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6835902 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6835903 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6835904 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6835905 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6835906 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6835907 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6835908 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6835909 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6835910 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6835911 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6835912 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6835913 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6835914 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6835915 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6835916 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6835917 recently experienced a systems issue which impacted our ability to process customer transactions resulting in the delay of some of those transactions
6835918 when necessary certain customer transactions were managed manually at branches and at our call centers to minimize interruption of customer service
6835919 while most all of the impacted systems are now up and running we are still working through the remaining recovery efforts importantly customer funds have always remained secure and we will work with our customers to address any issues this may have caused them
6835920 while we do not discuss specific details of our banking systems we can assure our customers that keys systems are strong theyre redundant with multiple fail overs as backup and they are tested continually in rigorous drills
6835921 further these systems have survived and performed perfectly throughout the midwest power outage and an assortment of other technological and environmental challenges including major water leaks
6835922 they have proven themselves under a variety of conditions in addition to strong systems we have robust business continuity practices which we test regularly
6835923 we can certainly empathize with the folks at hsbc because our dependency on technology makes no financial institution immune from internal system problems
6835924 we are very confident in our banking technology as it meets or exceeds industry standards and requirements however we do also maintain a sharp focus to ensure our back up plans are just as robust
6835925 we have strived to create a solid recovery plan that focuses on having us up and running 24 to 48 hours as a proactive measure we have recently invested in an enhanced recovery plan which is intended to reduce down time to mere minutes
6835926 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6835927 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6835928 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6835929 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6835930 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6835931 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6835932 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6835933 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6835934 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6835935 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6835936 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6835937 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6835938 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6835939 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6835940 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6835941 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6835942 what we think of when we think of god is the most important thing about us
6835943 most importantly it offers an opportunity for kids at a younger age to start getting involved in the sport of hunting
6835944 there is a lot of bonding that goes on between fathers and sons and hopefully this will start to capture some of these kids at a younger age and get them involved in the hunting tradition
6835945 the sooner you can teach a kid about gun safety or gun handling the less chance that kid is going to learn it the wrong way on his or her own time
6835946 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6835947 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6835948 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6835949 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6835950 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6835951 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6835952 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6835953 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6835954 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6835955 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6835956 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6835957 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6835958 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6835959 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6835960 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6835961 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6835962 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6835963 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6835964 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6835965 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6835966 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6835967 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6835968 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6835969 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6835970 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6835971 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6835972 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6835973 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6835974 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6835975 this is a planning took where all things are going
6835976 it was great of the president to speak about the issue
6835977 when he speaks in this manner to the bishops it will energise the resolve against homosexuality
6835978 under our current system of safety and soundness regulation supervisors often focus on the financial conditions of individual institutions in isolation
6835979 an alternative approach would broaden the mandate of regulators and supervisors to encompass consideration of potential systemic risks and weaknesses as well
6835980 these reviews help increase the safety and soundness of individual institutions but they may also identify common weaknesses and risks that may have implications for broader systemic stability
6835981 a pair of kerouacs armed with sharpies and erasers and righteous indignation
6835982 discovered a hand rendered sign inside that i regret to report contained a few errors
6835983 i was reluctant to disfigure the sign any further still i think i shall be haunted by that perversity emense in my train whistle blighted dreams tonight

6835992 i am the only flaviano that is when the world loses me it loses the only one of me and it will be a great loss
6835993 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is sic going to solve the sectarian violence there
6835994 overall violence is down at least 80 percent since the surge began and ethno sectarian violence the kind that seemed to be sucking iraq into all out civil war in 2006 is down by over 90 percent
6835995 by and large whats left of the insurgency is just trying to hang on
6835996 as we have surged into neighborhoods to protect the iraqi people earning their trust and benefiting from their help violence has dropped and locals have turned against the jihadists
6835997 the iraqi people are going about their business and business is thriving it is so more and more i see it in places i could not go even six months ago
6835998 the simple fact is that sending in over 20 000 additional troops isnt the answer in fact its a tragic mistake
6835999 it wont end the violence it wont provide security it wont turn back the clock and avoid the civil war that is already underway it wont deter terrorists who have a completely different agenda it wont rein in the militias
6836000 the group will focus on education religion and social justice
6836001 its like squeezing a water balloon you squeeze it in one place it bulges somewhere else
6836002 the surge was designed to give the iraqi government time to take steps to ensure a political solution
6836003 the united states is now winning the war that two years ago seemed lost
6836004 in baghdad parks are filled every weekend with families playing and picnicking with their children

6836062 there are a lot of details that have to be worked out
6836063 the announcement that was pulled from e3 at the last minute much to bungies annoyance after having a count down on their website that ended with no announcement being made but it seems that you can not contain the truth it will come out if you like it or not an expansion is coming to halo 3
6836064 how i went from brixton to squalor in six easy steps
6836065 well we told 10 different stories everyone knew we were lying
6836066 he lied on national tv so a defense attorney now could say how do we know youre not lying now
6836067 there have been some threats made to them for both civil and criminal prosecution
6836068 there are a lot of details that have to be worked out
6836069 one of the purposes of our research is to develop better designs for precast concrete buildings
6836070 this is really important to our industry because well be able to develop structures that can resist natures most difficult loads including earthquakes
6836071 we conducted tests from lower seismicity all the way to higher seismicity and shook the building stronger and stronger each time with a higher intensity
6836072 since that time we have been working to come up with designs that will make these structures survive a northridge earthquake or stronger
6836073 we are only able to perform physical experiments on that one structure but if we can show that our models capture important response properly we can run hundreds of earthquake simulations a year for the cost of a graduate student a fast computer and a software license which at around 50 000 is substantially less than the costs of these kinds of tests
6836074 the englekirk center is very important to the research community and to the industry because it has an outdoor environment where we can perform large scale tests that cant be done anywhere else in the world
6836075 i recently challenged my colleagues to step up to the plate and help me provide the resources our candidates need to compete in races across the country it has become clear that my call has gone largely unanswered
6836076 i have had no choice but to decrease the total budget of our ie unit it is still my hope that my republican colleagues will engage in this election and help match what the democrats are doing if they do i will adjust our budget accordingly
6836077 we fully plan to have the funds necessary to run a very aggressive campaign
6836078 i really think its funny that senator obama wants to get into a debate on housing he is not exactly poor either
6836079 hijacked by a relatively small few the gop of today bears no resemblance to lincoln roosevelt or eisenhowers party or many of the other republican administrations that came after
6836080 like mainstream newspapers alternatives are confronting surging competition from web based media outlets for both news and arts information
6836081 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
6836082 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
6836083 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
6836084 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
6836085 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
6836086 i did say that ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
6836087 i want someone who is not in it just because they want to have their name up in lights or end up being president i want somebody who is mad right now that people are losing their jobs and is mad right now that people have seen their incomes decline
6836088 my sense is that theyre going to make a very good decision however they chose theyll make a very wise pick
6836089 eight continuous years of trouncing on womens reproductive rights and playing politics with science has obviously not been enough for this administration as its parting gift to women across this country todays release of the administrations proposed rule shows just how out of touch this administration really is with women and their families the sweeping scope of this regulation would be detrimental to our health care system it goes beyond a womens right to choose to have an abortion even beyond a womans right to contraception this proposed rule could impact everyones access to health care at the whim of anyone involved with providing care including a trainee is this administration really saying that if a doctor objects to a patient receiving dialysis that patient needs to find another treatment center this is unconscionable

6836100 one of the organisers of the olympic ceremony of the opening ceremony call me and said that i had been selected to be one of the flagbearers this would be the first time that only women would carry the olympic flag 5 women representing 5 continents and 3 olympic gold medal winners my first question was naturally what was i going to wear

6836103 my head was actually under the damn flag all the cameras were of course on sophia that was fortunate for me because in most press photo i appear too although often between sophias legs a place where most men would love to be the best four minutes of my entire life were those in the olympic stadium my husband is offended when i say this although i explain to him that what we do in private usually takes less than four minutes so he shouldnt take it personally
6836104 80 of all refugees and displaced people in the world are women and girls
6836105 i was born in ancient times at the end of the world in a patriarchal catholic and conservative family no wonder that by age five i was a raging feminist although the term had not reached chile yet so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me
6836106 once when my daughter paola was in her 20s she said to me that feminism was dated that i should move on we had a memorable fight feminism is dated yes for privileged women like my daughter but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world who are still forced into premature marriage prostitution forced labour they have children that they dont want or cannot feed they have no control over their bodies or their lives they have no education and no freedom they are raped beaten up and sometimes killed with impunity for most western young women of today being called a feminist is an insult feminism has never been sexy but let me assure you that it never stopped me from flirting and i have seldom suffered from lack of men feminism is by no means dead it has evolved if you dont like the term change it for goddess sake call it aphrodite or venus or bimbo or whatever you want
6836107 although women do 2 3s of the worlds labour they own less than 1 of the worlds assets
6836108 the poorest and most backward societies are always those that put women down yet this obvious truth is ignored by governments and also by philanthropy for every dollar given to a womans program 20 dollars are given to mens programs
6836109 women working together linked informed and educated can bring peace and prosperity to this forsaken planet men run the world and look at the mess we have
6836110 for real change we need feminine energy in the management of the world we need to nurture the feminine energy in men im talking about men with young minds of course old guys are hopeless we have to wait for them to die off

6836160 nos ltimos meses me debrucei neste problema reuni os melhores t cnicos de sa de
6836161 i don t think that most chicagoans are really aware that this law is as foolish as the anti foie gras law that was recently rescinded
6836162 residents need to be aware that we have specific rights including the right to have the dog we want of the breed we want and the right to keep it intact as long as we are responsible
6836163 i have always voluntarily altered my dogs and cats for a variety of reasons
6836164 in the good old days the choice of when to neuter my animals was always left up to my family and myself not the government
6836165 the reality is that it will have no effect on these problems instead it will create some serious public health concerns cause many animals to be denied necessary health care and will trample on the personal property rights of conscientious pet owners
6836166 if a dog becomes a danger then confiscate it and fine the owner
6836167 there are both positive and negative affects accrued from sterilization
6836168 it appears that benefits outweigh risks however there are many breed and individual dog variants suggesting that professional judgment is required to determine whether and when to neuter spay pets
6836169 i am working with several national dog organizations such as the international kennel club and i am supporting the illinios state veterinary medical association and the chicago veterinary medical association in opposing this proposed law
6836170 i am also working closely with several hobby breeders to rally the public to our cause the bottom line is that testicles don t bite people untrained dogs owned by idiots bite people educate the dog and the owner and dog bites don t happen
6836171 then i say the earth belongs to each of these generations during its course fully and in its own right the second generation receives it clear of the debts and encumbrances of the first the third of the second and so on for if the first could charge it with a debt then the earth would belong to the dead and not to the living generation then no generation can contract debts greater than may be paid during the course of its own existence
6836172 i canceled all of my appointments so that i could be at city hall when the doors opened
6836173 i was so angry that bob barker a man who is not a resident of chicago and who by his own admittance has absolutely no knowledge of dogs was allowed to be the first speaker i live in chicago i work in chicago and i lost a day s wages so that i could make my government work for me and bob barker a d list celebrity stole my chance to speak to my elected officials
6836174 the constitution forbids the passage of laws that limit one s right to life liberty and property
6836175 therefore any mandatory spay or neuter law is unconstitutional because it violates your unalienable right to keep your property as you wish
6836176 the only method that has reduced the killing of shelter animals is education of the dog and cat owner
6836177 this ordinance may seem like a quick fix for aldermen seeking solutions to challenging problems
6836178 but the reality is that it will not fix the problems they are looking to resolve this ordinance will however create a nightmare for those who have to abide by it veterinarians police officers animal control officials public health providers and honest law abiding taxpayers laws should be designed to solve problems not create more
6836179 commemorate the 14 fishermen of gaza who have been killed by the israeli navy over the past four years as they were fishing off their coast and the 34 american sailors killed aboard the us liberty attacked by israeli fighter jets and submarines for 75 minutes on june 8 1967
6836180 all ships bound for any israeli mediterranean port are hereby advised to approach the israeli coast only through the assigned corridors marked on the navigational chart ba 2634 all traffic along the israeli coast nne ssw must follow within the coastal route also marked on chart ba 2634 all vessels navigating within israeli territorial waters 12nm are advised not to exceed a maximum speed of 15 fifteen knots
6836181 our mission is to expose the illegality of israel s actions and to break through the siege in order to express our solidarity with the suffering people of gaza and of the occupied palestinian territory as a whole and to create a free and regular channel between gaza and the outside world israel claims that since the disengagement in 2005 it no longer occupies gaza however the international committee of the red cross and other international human rights organizations reject this claim since israel still exerts effective control over gaza as an occupying power israel has a responsibility for the well being of the people of gaza under the provisions of the 1949 fourth geneva convention israel has abused its control and responsibilities by wrongfully obstructing vital supplies and humanitarian assistance to the people of gaza as israel s 41 year occupation of the west bank and gaza strip defies international consensus and because israel has grossly violated its obligations we do not recognize israel s right to stop us outside its own territorial waters which we will not be approaching to remove any security pretense that israel may raise we have had our boats inspected and certified by cypriot authorities that they carry no arms or contraband of any kind we have invited israeli foreign minister tzipi livni to join us on our voyage and in fact the israeli ministry of foreign affairs has itself told us the israeli government assume s that your intentions are good
6836182 defense officials favor forcefully blocking two boats which a group of u s based activists plan to sail to gaza to protest what they call the israeli siege on the strip haaretz has learned according to the foreign ministry israel is within its rights to use force against the seafarers this situation has prompted defense officials to hold a series of discussions they said allowing the ships to reach the gaza coastline could create a dangerous precedent but the israel navy has not yet received any instructions on how to treat the vessels a position paper by the foreign ministrys legal department says israel has the right to use force against the demonstrators as part of the oslo accords which names israel as responsible for gazas territorial waters an official in jerusalem said the foreign ministrys paper means that security forces could detain the vessels upon entry to gazas territorial waters arrest the passengers and haul the ship to israel where the detainees could be interrogated
6836183 the navy has been ordered to turn back two boats carrying 44 pro palestinian foreign activists who are attempting to break the siege of gaza the jerusalem post has learned officials said the navy had a number of options in dealing with the boats which have set out from crete en route to gaza via a stop over in cyprus israeli officials said sunday that the mediterranean waters around gaza fell under israeli sovereignty due to an agreement with the palestinian authority gaza has also been declared a combat zone giving the navy the legal right to patrol the sea around the strip the officials said the boat journey was largely a publicity stunt the israeli officials said adding that its organizers were hungry for international and israeli media attention
6836184 to deliver 200 hearing aids to a palestinian charity for children and hand out 5 000 balloons israeli officials said the delivery was illegal but they have refused to publicly say what the response would be if the activists tried to break the blockade however the jerusalem post has learned that the navy has been ordered to turn back the boats larudee said it was highly unlikely the navy would fire on the boats to stop them but he said the group expected israeli authorities to intercept the boats and arrest those onboard larudee said the group would contest any arrests in court on the premise that israel committed kidnapping
6836185 we are human rights activists invited to visit gaza by our palestinian partners and each of us has vowed to do no violence in either word or deed if israel chooses to forcibly stop and search our ships we will not forcibly resist such a search will be under duress and with our formal protest after such a search we fully expect the israeli navy to stand aside as we continue peacefully to gaza if we are arrested and brought to israel we will protest and prosecute our kidnapping in the appropriate forums it is our purpose to show the power that ordinary citizens of the world have when they organize together to stand against injustice let there be no doubt the policies of repression against the civilian population of gaza represent gross violations of human rights international humanitarian law and constitute war crimes the goal of our voyage is to break the illegal siege on the people of gaza as a step toward ending the israeli occupation of palestine
6836186 in fact the result of your action is that you are supporting the regime of a terrorist organization in gaza an organization dedicated to non recognition of the state of israel and its right to exist in this protest voyage to gaza you seek to remove legitimate pressure on the hamas government and to violate the conditions of the international community therefore we cannot cooperate with your efforts we would like to point out that the area to which you are planning to sail is the subject of an advisory notice that has been published by the israeli navy which warns all foreign vessels to remain clear of the designated maritime zone off the coast of gaza in light of the current security situation we have received information that you are planning to bring humanitarian aid to the gaza strip we would like to bring to your attention that the transfer of humanitarian aid to israel is effected at present through agreed upon channels and the israeli authorities will ensure that the shipment reaches its destination via the land crossing points we will be happy to assist you in this endeavor if your intentions are good please choose this way if you do not intend to deliver the humanitarian aid via israel this proves that your goal is political and constitutes the legitimization of a terrorist organization
6836187 although the gaza strip has a long mediterranean sea coastline it has no seaport that would enable palestinians from the gaza strip to conduct foreign trade by sea without going through israeli ports the idea of constructing a seaport for gaza was discussed in almost all agreements reached by israel and the palestinians as part of the peace process the sides recognizing the great importance of gaza port for palestinian economic growth and for increased palestinian trade in the declaration of principles signed in september 1993 the parties agreed for the first time to establish a joint committee to set the guidelines for implementing the idea after six years of foot dragging israel agreed in the sharm el sheikh memorandum signed in september 1999 to allow the palestinian authority to begin construction work on the seaport according to the memorandum the two sides agree that the gaza seaport would not be used at all before a joint protocol on the port is reached by the parties the parties have never signed such a protocol in the summer of 2000 work began on constructing the infrastructure of the seaport on the coast of gaza city the costs were funded by the donor states however in october the israeli air force bombed the building site in response to an incident in ramallah where a palestinian mob killed two israel soldiers following this the donor states ceased funding the project the work on the port stopped and has not recommenced
6836188 construction of a seaport can commence the goi government of israel will undertake to assure donors that it will not interfere with operation of the port emphasis added here the parties will establish a u s led tripartite committee to develop security and other relevant arrangements for the port prior to its opening the 3rd party model to be used at rafah will provide the basis for this work

6836236 what joy for those whose record the lord has cleared of sin whose lives are lived in complete honesty when i refused to confess my sin i was weak and miserable and i groaned all day long
6836237 well i suppose my sin is a lack of trust and a desire to control things so i confess that and ask that you would help me with those areas although i dont want to have to go through any sort of trial or circumstance to grow in those areas
6836238 oh oops i guess that is still me lacking in trust and desiring to control things huh

6836243 i am sure as sure as i can be of anything that is as sure as you can read any other mans state of mind the thing that prompted dick to want to do this thing and prompted me to want to do this thing was a sort of pure love of excitement or the imaginary love of thrills doing something different possibly the satisfaction and the ego of putting something over the money consideration only came in afterwards and never was important the getting of the money was a part of our objective as was also the commission of the crime but that was not the exact motive
6836244 they should commit a perfect crime a crime so intricate and complicated that planning and calculating its flawless execution would be a challenge they should kidnap a child he proposed and to increase the intricacy of the crime they should demand a ransom from the childs parents the money was important not for its own sake but to magnify the complexity of the crime it was to be a brilliant crime he mused one that would shock chicago with its daring they would obtain the ransom dispose of the body and leave no clues behind the police would never catch them

6836246 although the leopold loeb case was one of the most infamous murders of the twentieth century historians have largely ignored it
6836247 no one had yet written a book that considered the episode in its complexity and intricacy
6836248 to recapture the drama of the events that it describes
6836249 were fully responsible for their actions and should be treated accordingly it was foolishness to absolve them of blame for their misdeeds
6836250 the criminal did not freely choose wrongdoing rather factors outside his or her conscious control acted to determine criminal behavior there was no such thing as individual responsibility imprisonment was futile and even counterproductive it served no purpose either as a deterrent or as a punishment
6836251 the trial of nathan leopold and richard loeb would be a contest between two charismatic individuals darrow who had built his reputation by defending unpopular causes and crowe the most competent and energetic states attorney in a generation and there would be a second contest a contest between opposing philosophies of crime and punishment which one would triumph
6836252 the statute provides that evidence may be offered in mitigation of the punishment and we shall ask at such time as the court may direct that we may be permitted to offer evidence as to the mental condition of these young men to show the degree of responsibility they had and also to offer evidence as to the youth of these defendants and the fact of a plea of guilty as further mitigation of the penalties in this case
6836253 needed only to persuade the judge that they were mentally ill a medical condition not at all equivalent or comparable to insanity to obtain a reduction in their sentence and darrow needed only one reduction from death by hanging to life in prison to win his case
6836254 the court is moved chiefly by the consideration of the age of the defendants
6836255 life imprisonment may not at the moment strike the public imagination as forcibly as would death by hanging but to the offenders particularly of the type they are the prolonged suffering of years of confinement may well be the severer form of retribution and expiation

6836351 the xrl module is a fantastic tool you can get information out of the system in a format that you can work with and there is no need to re key any information it is fast accurate intuitive and easy to use
6836352 environmental issues are at the heart of wdcs work so the ability to save paper was another benefit of pegasus xrl there is no need to print off pages upon pages of reports instead we can e mail excel spreadsheets taken from xrl and using pivot tables the recipient can drill down into the transactions and view what they want when they want this also saves us a lot of time and the bacs functionality is much better than opera 16 which we used to use and this makes life easier
6836353 we have found that xrl gives us the ability to interrogate the financial system enabling us to track vat from invoices through vat control accounts and back to nominal ledger accounts this helps us with our partial vat recovery and ensures irrecoverable vat is charged to the correct activity and the use of the xrl upload facility saves us time by importing large journals directly from excel we save time and avoid input errors by not needing to re key information
6836354 there are benefits to using modern solutions like opera ii in addition to saving time and paper we have benefited from improved reporting and analysis
6836355 opera ii gives us better control saves time and allows easy access to business information to enable informed decisions to be made
6836356 with profile we have received much more than a computer system we have found that the people at profile are very approachable and responsive we have a good relationship with them and are hoping to continue to build on it
6836357 working with profile has brought us many more benefits that just a financial system pegasus xrl has helped us to make huge operating cost savings allowing wdcs staff to concentrate on delivering our core objectives efficient effective and value added a real partner in delivering our vision

6836382 number three irony gate americans for prosperity one of the many corporate funded lobbying groups working hand in hand with big oil and the administration and other people who make more money the more there is doubt that there is global warming this group was to have town hall meetings tonight and thursday in florida to spread its word about global warming alarmism
6836383 he called us a corporate front group which is pretty outrageous
6836384 we had 200 and something people at an event last night yesterday evening in ft collins colo i dont think those folks consider themselves corporate insiders all those families and folks that were out
6836385 this announcement from the group quote the august 14 fort myers town hall and august 21 west palm beach town hall will be rescheduled as a result of tropical storm fay
6836386 its ironic that guys like him and global warming extremists will use any weather event whether its a hot spell whether its a hurricane or a tropical storm or a hailstorm or a snowstorm anything any weather event theyll try to tie it to their pet cause which is ideological extremism at its worst

6836389 you often hear politicians talking about protecting our pristine coastline our coastline is not pristine
6836390 our coastline is the most oil polluted coastline in the united states
6836391 the natural seeps dont garner as much attention as oil spills but theyre much more pollutant
6836392 the amount of oil seeping from the ocean floor since 1970 equals more than 31 times the amount of oil spilled in 1969
6836393 there is significant evidence oil extraction can reduce reservoir pressure and seepage pollution

6836417 if my art is considered a mix of eastern and western styles i prefer to view it as a natural result during my student time of artistic training i had training in both chinese and western art skills and i studied the histories of both i have tried many different methods such as chinese traditional painting oil painting printmaking illustration mixed media and 3d animation all these experiences naturally improved my style it is possible to elaborate on the eastern elements and western elements in my art or to deny that my art belongs to any style i always follow my intuitions

6836423 during my interviews with these individuals i always ask them why do you have these pictures time after time the answer is they arouse me and i masturbate while im looking at these pictures i absolutely did say that to the student body
6836424 i do not feel like i was picking on her or humiliating her i think i was just presenting information that every single person in that school at windsor colorado and cheyenne wyoming and beijing china have access to

6836499 sean hannity and george w bush are war propagandists who are more concerned with their bank accounts than conservative principles
6836500 we now know how much sean hannitys soul was worth
6836501 the fact that sean hannity still supports president bush and the war in iraq clearly shows that he is in the pocket of the white house and is most likely involved in operation mockingbird a cia program to influence domestic media in favor of government agendas
6836502 i used to support president bush and the war until i found out that we had been repeatedly lied to
6836503 anyone who still supports this president is either completely ignorant or a paid propagandist and sean hannity is not stupid

6836546 we still dont know how many assessors there will be and it is rumoured that there is a shortage of them
6836547 in terms of us as sales agents there is definitely a grey area when it comes to selling pubs as to whether or not we will demand the pub seller has an epc but we will endeavour to help them
6836548 our sales figures which cover the early summer period show that 2008 has been worse than 2007 with people cutting back on unnecessary expenses and another dreadful july and august weather wise we dont expect to see this trend alter
6836549 a good bank holiday weekend or an indian summer may tempt people out but if it stays as dull as we have seen it it is unlikely that consumers will want to front the expense of an evening out when they can stay at home with a bottle and save money
6836550 now we have a totally different social structure with a large proportion of jobs in the service sector so that drinking culture which kept the trade afloat in the early 90s has faded and our data suggests that people are already cutting down on going to the pub

6836555 superman didnt quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to
6836556 it didnt position the character the way he needed to be positioned
6836557 had superman worked in 2006 we would have had a movie for christmas of this year or 2009
6836558 but now the plan is just to reintroduce superman without regard to a batman and superman movie at all

6836562 the pc runs a little faster but i like the apple more
6836563 of course many things have changed at the restaurant but to me the biggest change has been the food culture in britain
6836564 back in the day you could count the number of great restaurants on one hand and the british public wasnt as sophisticated as it is today people didnt want to eat their steak rare and we had to fight to get our diners to embrace the french culinary culture
6836565 but things really have moved on and today britain has a fantastic culinary offering that is appreciated by the public
6836566 one highlight was moving le gavroche from lower sloane street in knightsbridge to upper brook street in mayfair in 1981
6836567 we closed up on saturday night at the old location and opened up on monday morning at the new restaurant serving drinks and canap s to 400 people that night we didnt lose a single day of trading
6836568 there were so many people on the streets watching a fireworks display in hyde park that our diners literally couldnt make their way to the restaurant
6836569 it was disappointing of course but we took it in our stride and continued to run the restaurant as we did before
6836570 there have been three starred restaurants in london such as chez nico and marco pierre white at the hyde park hotel that lost their stars and you never heard from them again le gavroches consistency over the past 41 years is second to none
6836571 the most important thing is that you please your customers which we did and they continued to come to le gavroche even after we lost the third star
6836572 who is michelin they dont pay the bills the customers do
6836573 when he got them he took the meat out of the shells and proceeded to eat them the shells that is
6836574 everyone in the restaurant was staring at him in disbelief
6836575 hed arrive at 12 30pm eat lunch and leave again at 1 15pm
6836576 when he got older in his 80s he started to suffer from alzheimers and on more than one occasion he came in for lunch at the usual time and then returned at 2pm because hed forgotten that hed already been in for lunch so we called his secretary put him in a taxi and sent him back home
6836577 when i first started at le gavroche there were no british waiters and 37 years on there still arent any
6836578 its usually people from the commonwealth or the continent who hold front of house jobs because british people seem to frown upon service unlike the continent in this country being a waiter isnt considered a real profession and its a real problem for the industry
6836579 i wont just sit around and do nothing after ive retired thats not the kind of person i am
6836580 i do plan on spending more time shooting which is my favourite pastime and i love being outdoors but ill still play a role at le gavroche as restaurant director alongside michel and albert roux and i will continue to be involved in the staff training
6836581 and if anyone in the industry needs my advice on staff training ill be more than happy to help out
6836582 my time at le gavroche has been fantastic and i couldnt have managed a better restaurant
6836583 i wouldnt have taken my pension if i wasnt 100 sure that i was leaving the restaurant in capable hands
6836584 i dont mind him being the captain of my football team but i dont want him running the country
6836585 you never can tell whether this town is about to collapse or take off
6836586 they are all too proper to say so but thats how it is they would rather have a woman than a black man
6836587 ive not voted for 45 years but this man gets my vote
6836588 so im giving four days a week of my holidays to help instead
6836589 weve already seen that obama can get 5 donations from them so there is no reason why they wont turn out to vote i give him a ton of credit for that
6836590 he mccain has always stepped away from the republican brand throughout his career
6836591 and tell me did he visit any injured american soldiers in hospital when he went to europe recently
6836592 i thought it was just going to be a couple of girls from the gym
6836593 im taking it one step at a time and enjoying the moment but its not out of the question
6836594 it is time for presidential leadership on these critical issues
6836595 unfortunately with oil still nearly 50 higher than just six months ago we had to review the current structure and revise elements that will afford our ability to remain both customer friendly and cost conscious
6836596 snuggles sin is fatigue fatigue and the inability to distinguish between your shoulder and a pillow
6836597 must continue to examine every aspect of our business and find new ways to improve our day today operations through efficiencies
6836598 the wave of patriotism hitting the airlines lately would be heart warming if not for the fact that all that seems to be motivating them is a desire to avoid any more bad pr
6836599 for the first time in ages i wasnt lugging around a heavy carry on and you know what it was wonderful we didnt have to worry if the were the right size and weight we didnt have to lug them throughout the terminal navigating a restroom with a carry on is never fun and we didnt have to line up at the gate extra early to be sure thered be room in the overhead bins what a sense of freedom
6836600 that information is totally false there is a healthy advance for the show and there is no chance of the run being shortened
6836601 by bringing attractive yet functional sculptures to our streets we are elevating the profile of cycling and we believe that more and more people will begin to think about cycling as a mode of transportation and not just a mode of recreation
6836602 regular bike riders have an eagle eye for our current bike racks but these nine installations will capture the attention of all new yorkers
6836603 it was important to me that these new racks be the same thickness and material as the existing racks to help identify them as practical bike racks and not just modern art
6836604 the locations about as perfect as one could imagine wall street for the dollar sign and bergdorfs for the giant high heel

6836607 if someone had said to me a spacecraft had landed on the meadows last night i would have said well i heard it
6836608 this record takes all the different styles weve created in the past and glues them together into one cohesive sound
6836609 there are elements of what weve done before on this record but were more concerned with moving forward than looking back bella morte fans old and new are gonna love this one
6836610 its less schizophrenic than our other releases weve created something completely new here by combining elements of what weve done in the past
6836611 ive really opened myself up on this album pushed myself harder than ever before
6836612 i listened to so many different genres of music everything from metal to goth hip hop to indie so ive gathered a diverse collection of influences along the way and ive matured as a vocalist and a lyricist quite a lot over the years
6836613 we would like our publicist rey to make us very very wealthy then we will take him out for a nice dinner maybe two nice dinners
6836614 honestly fans should expect the best damned show on the planet
6836615 theyre not going to just take a hose to the torch here maybe 5 000 people with squirt guns
6836616 i came to these games with stratospheric expectations and theyve been exceeded
6836617 its pathetic a record in futility a lot of our field athletes just suffer from the i made the team syndrome rather than being able to peak again for the games
6836618 im not an expert on anything here and i live and breathe sports i wish i had a broader view of the world but i dont
6836619 they got dozens of text messages saying your mom just ate a scorpion on television
6836620 wasnt a good time to forget to wear a sweater under my wetsuit
6836621 i vowed at an early age to escape and live there
6836622 other than still having working vocal chords its how excited i get to do this
6836623 hes got to learn a lot you just cant go out there and fling it and be reckless
6836624 you might see some ugly picks early on hell have to commit himself a lot more this year than he ever has
6836625 hes going to do very well with the jets hes going to have a huge impact on that team
6836626 the only reason brett should have stayed retired would have been if he lacked a desire to play but the end is rarely gracious for any player regardless of position or years of service
6836627 that first month of the season will be really difficult for him personally
6836628 to make a big change like that and come in and energize the team and lead the team to success if anyone can do it hes the man
6836629 i cant think of a quarterback of his stature that has ever had to make this type of transition
6836630 with a team thats trying to get to the next level you need someone to come in and make them believe they can get there brett can do those kinds of things
6836631 what a brilliant business move for the jets whatever he does this year will be an upgrade for the jets at that position
6836632 spending behind the united states presidential election and around the beijing olympic games should continue to boost 2008 revenues
6836633 levels of activity in 2008 should match those seen in 2007 and there are significant new business opportunities
6836634 the prospects for 2009 remain less certain particularly if the united states and western european economies continue to be impacted by the financial crisis and commodity price increases
6836635 in addition the new united states president will have to wrestle with twin fiscal and budget deficits in early 2009 and post the olympics chinese growth may slow due to inflationary particularly food price concerns and the impact that a weakening united states economy has on the rest of the world
6836636 position the group very well to weather any economic slowdown
6836637 despite these shorter term uncertainties the prospects for trading performance improvements at wpp remain good

6836641 if we dont receive sufficient time to prepare a competitive proposal theres really little option for us than to no bid in this competition
6836642 we think we can meet these requirements if given the time to put together a proposal
6836643 we would meet up at nicks house in beachwood canyon and play songs around the circle with four singers we just naturally started singing harmonies and this sound reminiscent of the country rock sound of the 70s began to develop that we all really loved

6836648 you add a little color to each one and when youre done it looks like venetian plaster you use the darkest one first and work from there you really cant mess this up if you think youve made a mistake you can just smooth over that and start again
6836649 you put the skinny masking tape on the wall to create the stone or brick pattern you want and then you just add colored joint compound to about a quarter inch thick but dont put the layers on too quickly or it will crack
6836650 to the extent that theyre nationalized theyre not going to default on their debt or derivative obligations
6836651 i think most parties would look at it as the u s government stepping in and guaranteeing the obligations of fannie and freddie
6836652 to that extent a counterparty to a derivatives contract with fannie and freddie would take great comfort in that
6836653 i remembered the case and the body features were the exact same
6836654 i said i believe i know who committed the crime
6836655 patients are interested in whether hospitals are safe effective efficient and pleasing and have good service
6836656 theyre interested in all those attributes this one measure of mortality is a piece of that but its not the whole pie
6836657 theres just a lot more to the number than people often understand
6836658 im not sure knowing that is very useful to the public at this point
6836659 pneumonia mortality rates do not reflect the complete evidenced based measures related to pneumonia care
6836660 she worked so hard and gave everything she could im devastated wherever wed go wed speak of each other as brother and sister its an incalculable loss
6836661 i am going to miss her as a friend and colleague and her leadership will most certainly be missed by her constituents northeast ohio and the state as a whole
6836662 over the course of many years with many ups and many downs stephanie was right by our side unwavering indefatigable
6836663 it wasnt enough for her just to break barriers in her own life
6836664 she was also determined to bring opportunity to all those who had been overlooked and left behind and in stephanie they had a fearless friend and unyielding advocate
6836665 she was an effective legislator who was dedicated to helping small businesses improving local schools expanding job opportunities for ohioans and ensuring that more of them have access to health care
6836666 ive owned my ride for four years and it still puts a massive smile on my face every time i drive it
6836667 my mods are actually pretty minor compared to others because the cars so good to begin with
6836668 on our way to cornwall it told us to go across country and avoid the m25 but we decided to ignore it i wish i hadnt we were stuck for ages in a jam on the motorway but it chose a new route once we got off the motorway and we listened to it after that and never got lost
6836669 i still have everything stashed away to put this car back to 100 standard if i want to
6836670 my hobby is maintaining vehicles and i really love it plus i know that the jobs been done right
6836671 i wrap it in cotton wool during the winter and drive my backup
6836672 i meet hic staff at the shows and club meetings and they are real enthusiasts too so when im dealing with them for insurance they know what im talking about and can give me the right cover plus i get the discount for belonging to clubs
6836673 it appears that significant comprehensive reform would not begin until september 2010
6836674 i dont think i should have to wait any longer
6836675 im sure everyone who has one of these properties next door to them thinks theirs is the worst
6836676 i respect that but its not necessarily going to weigh in on the decision made
6836677 im trying to do it logically and efficiently so i can get them done
6836678 once they give me the list and the approval for the jobs im going to get right on them
6836679 its an eyesore for them so a lot of people are very pleased something is being done
6836680 they can do it with napalm for all i care

6836689 we call for opening up the debates the scope of discussion must be as broad and deep as the serious challenges we face as a nation we agree that vibrant debate is the heart beat of our democracy and our first amendment especially during an election year we recognize that smaller third parties and independents have traditionally played a vital role in our democracy including leading the charge for the abolition of slavery the womens right to vote and economic justice for workers and farmers we support opening up the debates beyond the two parties and the so called commission on presidential debates which is a private corporation co chaired by former chairman of the republican and democratic parties its time for our presidential debates to once again be hosted by truly non partisan civic minded associations
6836690 senator hillary clinton will be the headline prime time speaker and former virginia governor mark warner will deliver the keynote address on tuesday night

6836693 lovably croaky frontman robert suchan makes merry piano driven tunes about weekend shut ins and dying young swinging with the gallows humor of vintage elvis costello amp the cure
6836694 rollicking retro piano rolls and a decidedly seedy vibe add up to social life the feel good record of the year
6836695 fans take their songs to heart because they recognize themselves in the experiences stella relates in her lyrics by the same token they attract the sort of listeners for whom music is about something beyond just being popular sitting at the coolest table in the cafeteria or having the current flavor of the week cued up on your ipod
6836696 of the five years weve been in this band thereve been so many different trends that have come and gone
6836697 theres something to be said for just being yourself and doing what you love because you love it i think kids can see past it they can see that were just who we are
6836698 hometown pop punk favorites cruiserweight pack more emotional voltage into a single song than most emo bands manage their entire career
6836699 there are very few studies that show long term use is either safe or effective
6836700 the two most important facts about the new investment policy are that it significantly improves the probability the p b g c will be able to meet its obligations and that it does so while taking less short term and long term risk
6836701 if sixth graders in america took finance i could say to you that as every sixth grader knows diversification mitigates risk and this policy is substantially more diversified and that is why it has a lower standard deviation
6836702 diversification does reduce volatility but the risk of a wipeout in the economy can only be hedged by owning treasury bonds
6836703 so the big downside risk that really matters is not reduced by the greater diversification in the new portfolio smaller downdrafts yes lower volatility in normal times yes and much greater upsides yes no argument about the upsides it is the downsides where i do not see where they can say what they say
6836704 if we didnt match our liabilities but just sort of shot for the moon if you will the taxpayer would be providing portfolio insurance for our bets in the market
6836705 the new strategy is likely to produce higher returns on average over the long run but the strategy also increases the risk that p b g c will not have sufficient assets to cover retirees benefit payments when the economy and financial markets are weak
6836706 by investing a greater share of its assets in risky securities
6836707 p b g c is more likely to experience a decline in the value of its portfolio during an economic downturn the point at which it is most likely to have to assume responsibility for a larger number of underfunded pension plans
6836708 the point of this policy is to substantially increase the likelihood that we will be able to pay our bills
6836709 that person must believe we should be 100 percent invested in treasuries and leave congress to write the check that is moral hazard
6836710 not to get seduced by the lore of the high math high logic guys
6836711 is just used for labeling purposes it is not meant to suggest it is the worst possible case
6836712 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate

6836715 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
6836716 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
6836717 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure

6836723 how could the near east divine these childkind run its course
6836724 of his race and questions about his patriotism values and faith that republicans have already vigorously sought to raise and exploit

6836733 how could the near east divine these childkind run its course
6836734 how could the near east divine these childkind run its course
6836735 they play a part so they can get what they want
6836736 psychopaths play on the fact that most of us are trusting and forgiving people
6836737 psychopaths dont discriminate who it is they lie to or cheat
6836738 however im certainly not advocating a world where if someone lies once or twice you never speak to them again
6836739 jerusalem must remain the capital of israel and must remain undivided
6836740 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6836741 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6836742 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6836743 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6836744 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6836745 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6836746 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6836747 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6836748 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6836749 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6836750 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him
6836751 the most inexperienced ticket in the history of the world

6836753 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6836754 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6836755 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6836756 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6836757 behold i say unto you nay for ye have not come this far save it were by the word of christ with unshaken faith in him relying wholly on the merits of him who is mighty to save

6836761 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6836762 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6836763 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6836764 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6836765 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6836766 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6836767 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6836768 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6836769 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6836770 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6836771 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6836772 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6836773 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6836774 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6836775 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6836776 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6836777 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6836778 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6836779 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6836780 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6836781 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6836782 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6836783 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6836784 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6836785 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6836786 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees
6836787 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6836788 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6836789 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6836790 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6836791 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6836792 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6836793 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6836794 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension

6836809 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6836810 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6836811 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6836812 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6836813 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
6836814 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6836815 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6836816 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6836817 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6836818 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6836819 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6836820 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6836821 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6836822 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6836823 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes

6836829 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6836830 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6836831 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6836832 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6836833 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people

6836901 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6836902 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6836903 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6836904 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6836905 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6836906 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6836907 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6836908 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6836909 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6836910 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6836911 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program

6836918 the development and uptake of mobile data services will have a tremendous positive impact on economies like brazil russia india and china
6836919 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6836920 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6836921 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6836922 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6836923 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6836924 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6836925 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6836926 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6836927 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6836928 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6836929 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it

6837184 lodged between mechanics and biology technical beings are nothing but a hybrid enjoying no more ontological status than they did in ancient philosophy
6837185 dasien s death is what it cannot know and to this extent death gives to mine ness its excess death is not an event within existence because it is the very possibility of existence a possibility that is at the same time essentially and interminably deferred this originary deferral is also what gives dasein its difference to another
6837186 today machines are the tool bearers and the human is no longer a technical individual the human becomes either the machines servant or its assembler
6837187 the problem arising here is that the evolution of this essentially technical being that the human is exceeds the biological although this dimension is an essential part of the technical phenomenon itself something like its enigma the evolution of the prosthesis not itself living by which the human is nonetheless defined as a living being constitutes the reality of the humans evolution as if with it the history of life were to continue by means other than life this is the paradox of a living being characterized in its forms of life by the nonliving or by the traces that its life leaves in the nonliving
6837188 to know the essence of the machine and thereby understanding the sense of technics in general is also to know the place of the human in technical ensembles
6837189 if technics can be given its own finality this means that its thinking in terms of ends and means is no longer sufficiently radical
6837190 denaturalization will be self exteriorization the becoming self dependent self alienation the alienation of the originary the authentic in the factical the technical the artificial death constitutive of the mediacy of a social and differentiated world of objects and hence of subjects for from this points on it is only though its objects the objects it has that the self can define and thus is no longer itself
6837191 love is an interested and particular passion which risks bringing destruction to the human race making possible the opposite of that for which if seems to exist a terrible passion that braves danger surmounts all obstacles and in its transports seems calculated to bring destruction on the human race which it is really destined to preserve
6837192 with the advent of exteriorization the body of the living individual is no longer only a body it can only function with its tools
6837193 the individual develops three memories genetic memory memory of the central nervous system epigenetic and techno logical memory language and technics are here amalgamated in the process of exteriorization
6837194 promethia is the anticipation of the future that is of danger foresight prudence and an essential disquiet somebody who is promethes is someone who is worried in advance

6837198 not only the social elites but also the impoverished populations underwent conversions to protestant fundamentalism for instance in guatemala in an attempt to crush the popular insurgency of the 1960s and 1970s the military destroyed hundreds of mayan villages and deliberately targeted mayan spirituality including sacred sites and priests meanwhile numerous well financed politically conservative protestant sects moved in they divided community members into competing denominations and distanced them from both the cohesive mayan culture and catholicisms liberation theology traumatized by war and stripped of all that was viable in their lives many people embraced the new proselytizers hoping to find an understanding of what had happened to them some evangelical preachers declared that guatemalans suffered so much in the war because they had been living in sin or following the wrong religion protestant fundamentalism encourages people to accept their lot in life without protest and to focus instead on the afterlife many of the poor guatemalans feared that if they remained catholic they would be suspected of being sympathetic to the guerillas so they converted to the new protestant sects a once unified insurgent population was now preoccupied with sectarian divisions while denouncing sinful personal indulgences and dreaming of reward in the afterlife if any component of culture has proven useful as an instrument of elite social control in central america and elsewhere it is this fundamentalist religious proselytizing

6837220 his spencers agnosticism was almost entirely derived from the teaching of hamilton and mansel
6837221 denying that god can be known while affirming that god ought to be believed in
6837222 for if one knows something about reality then he surely cannot affirm in the same breath that all of reality is unknowable and of course if one knows nothing whatsoever about reality then he had no basis whatsoever for making a stament about reality it follows that total agnosticism is self defeating because it assumes some knowledge about reality in order to deny any knowledge of reality

6837235 ive known for years that resentments dont hurt the person we resent but they do hurt and even sometimes kill us unfortunately change and forgiveness dont come easily for me but any willingness to let go inevitably comes from pain and the desire to change changes you and jiggles the spirit gets to it somehow to the deepest hardest most ruined parts and then spirit expands because that is true in nature and it drags along the body and finally the mind

6837266 if i have omitted many of franciss sayings and deeds and if i have altered others and added still others which did not take place but which might have taken place i have done so not out of ignorance or impudence or irreverence but from a need to match the saints life with his myth bringing that life as fully into accord with its essence as possible
6837267 art has its right and not only the right but the duty to subject everything else to its essence it feeds upon the story then assimilates it slowly cunningly and turns it into legend
6837268 while writing this legend which is truer than truth itself i was overwhelmed by love reverence and admiration for francis the hero and great martyr
6837269 everywhere about me as i write i sensed the saints invisible presence because for me saint francis is the model of the dutiful man the man who by means of ceaseless supremely cruel struggle succeeds in fulfilling our highest obligation something higher even than morality or truth or beauty the obligation to transubstantiate the matter which god entrusted to us and turn it into spirit

6837304 while it is difficult to know for certain the tendency to believe in the paranormal appears to be there from the beginning
6837305 what changes is the content of the paranormal for example very few people believe in faeries and elves these days but as belief in faeries faded other beliefs such as belief in ufos emerged to take their place
6837306 it is an artifact of our brains desire to find cause and effect

6837313 well were you going to ask her about the window
6837314 i dont know i thought we were going to wait
6837315 yeah i guess we were but we arent going to learn anything that way and as long as great grandmother cant go out and work in the yard we probably wont get a chance to look out the window ourselves either
6837316 maybe we could take up one of those scrapbooks of hers and see if we can get her talking about great grandfather or something and just kind of slip into talking about the window
6837317 thats a good idea but that made me think of an even better one theres a scrapbook around here with pictures of their old house and that same stained glass window that great grandmother brought here when they moved
6837318 what are you seeing out of that blue pane thats making you cry
6837319 i thought you two had found out about the window
6837320 i was seeing great grandfather and remembering and missing him i do miss him very much sometimes come and lets sit down and talk great grandmother led the way to the couch
6837321 how did you know we figured out about the window
6837322 that wasnt hard kevin you two arent nearly as sneaky as you think you are
6837323 the way you insisted on playing in the front some of the strange remarks i got from the neighbors and the step ladder you insisted on storing under this very couch
6837324 while you two can be a handful at times you usually dont bicker quite so much or get into quite as much trouble as you have lately really kevin dangling by your tie
6837325 but how does the window work great grandmother i mean we saw the future the way things might be if people made other choices but then the other day we saw great grandfather from when he was sick and you see him in the window too
6837326 lets start with where it came from a long time ago
6837327 when my grandfather was a young man he worked as a glass maker
6837328 it took my grandfather and his apprentices a long time to get the order done because the colors had to be just so and it was hard to get the large sheets of glass just right without fancy modern machinery
6837329 the man said that if my grandfather would let him keep the glass he would make a magic window for my grandfather out of part of the glass
6837330 since my grandfather would be stuck with the special order otherwise he reluctantly agreed he thought that if nothing else he could sell the stained glass window and get back some of his money
6837331 a few weeks later the man sent word that my grandfather was to come and pick up his window i remember my grandfather telling me that when he first laid eyes on it he knew he had made the right decision it was truly a thing of beauty he said whether it was magic or not
6837332 then the man showed him the magic in the window
6837333 my grandfather tried out each pane as he was directed to and was amazed
6837334 my grandfather took the window and put it in his house and kept it
6837335 my grandfather made the blue piece part of a new window and soon discovered that although it was the only piece of glass left it seemed to have the properties of all of the pieces of the window combined he said that he thought the fire must have fused all the magic into that one piece
6837336 how many people know about it i mean besides us
6837337 my grandfather always let people find out about the window on their own i dont know why probably because it was such an unlikely thing that he didnt want people trying to steal it his children including my father knew of course but beyond that not everyone found out about it i did and one of my brothers a few of our cousins and so on your father figured it out too but you two are the only ones since him to know about the window
6837338 i should have known that you two would figure it out
6837339 that really does explain some of the comments ive received from people
6837340 and i think you two get the prize for the most creative use of the window of anyone in the history of the thing
6837341 yeah i mean even when we were trying to help other people it went wrong
6837342 thats probably because like the man who made the window said the future is such a changeable thing any action you take can make the future you saw change the window is good for amusement for making you thoughtful for remembering things but it wont really change things in a desired way
6837343 we tried to make the future go the way we wanted it to by using the window instead of thinking about what we were doing
6837344 yeah and we were trying to change things we didnt have any control over sometimes too instead of changing our own actions
6837345 i think the window taught you something very valuable children

6837359 moscow aug 21 reuters russian oil output growth is unlikely to exceed 2 2 percent next year and will slow to under 1 percent by 2011 the government said on thursday confirming earlier forecasts of a slowdown in production growth falling oil production in russia the worlds second largest crude exporter after saudi arabia has become a major concern for the government which relies heavily on export revenues the government quoted the economy ministrys updated forecast for russian economic development to 2011 as saying oil output could this year reach 492 million tonnes or 9 85 million barrels per day almost flat from 491 5 million tonnes or 9 87 bpd in 2007 this year a leap year has one extra day
6837360 one of the most challenging economic and policy environments in memory
6837361 rather than a peak we should expect an undulating plateau perhaps three or four decades from now
6837362 contrary to the theory oil production shows no signs of a peak oil is a finite resource but because it is so incredibly large a peak will not occur this year next year or for decades to come
6837363 we in opec do not subscribe to the peak oil theory

6837390 we seem to always perform in these circumstances but i know my guys are going to be extremely tired
6837391 this race is crucial and a lot of things can be decided
6837392 i need scott to fall back a bit theres still a good chance to catch him but as much as winning i need something to happen to him
6837393 i always enjoy racing at infineon and it would be a big boost to the team if we could win a couple more races before the season ends
6837394 it would be nice to score a victory here on a road circuit and i think its possible
6837395 i dont know the track but i can learn it pretty quickly i have scored a victory each of the last three years of champ car so it would be great to continue that and score one this season even with the added difficulty of being in a new championship

6837464 the spent nearly every weekend in the highlands the views were spectacular and we loved doing it together
6837465 cruach ardain was stunning but as we were about to make our way back down stuart suggested we take a different route
6837466 we soon realized our time was over running and it was getting dark the easiest thing to do was climb back up and take our first route down
6837467 but i started to feel ill and then i fainted the next thing i remember is waking up and finding i was lying on the ground i didnt know what had happened and i just started screaming
6837468 i couldnt hear anything and i was terrified i didnt know where stuart was
6837469 it felt like i was lying there for ages but finally i saw a helicopter and was taken to hospital
6837470 it is far too early to say where we are compared to the opposition
6837471 it is difficult to understand too much about our situation relative to the others
6837472 hopefully we can further improve the car overnight and be reasonably competitive for qualifying tomorrow
6837473 im confident that we can get back on the pace for qualifying tomorrow
6837474 blackburn rovers are delighted to announce that roque santa cruz has signed a new four year contract with the club running through until 2012
6837475 i dont think any player certainly not those two will be leaving
6837476 as a blackburn fan it would be a tragedy if they left so im sure the club wouldnt allow that
6837477 you could bid 30million for roque and im sure they wouldnt let him go in my opinion
6837478 roque is a tremendous player as is benni we are a club that is trying to achieve things ourselves and you couldnt let brad friedel david bentley and roque santa cruz go in the same season theres no way the club will let that happen
6837479 you can see why sometimes premier league managers dont let their players go if they are going to start playing them for 90 minutes
6837480 its always a worry you wonder if youll come back with a half a team im disappointed with some of the managers because they played some of my players for 90 minutes as in andre ooijer roque santa cruz and steven reid
6837481 i spoke to reidy and he feels fine but thats not the point hes had problems with his knees over the years
6837482 morten gamst pedersen played 45 minutes for norway and i havent got a problem with that but when you start playing them for 90 minutes in a friendly i think is absolutely ridiculous
6837483 i can understand it if its a world cup qualifier but not a meaningless friendly when its a friendly i think youve got to show a bit of appreciation
6837484 the league has just started they have had a hard pre season and now ive got six players who have played three games in a week which is unfair
6837485 youve seen it over the years even with the biggest teams that when players go away with their countries they struggle to perform on a saturday and weve got to make sure that doesnt happen to us
6837486 sometimes you can be selfish because they are your players but you have got to show some appreciation for them for the saturday and i think 45 minutes for a friendly is appropriate

6837574 news about swimming and diving was easily the most popular olympic subject accounting for nearly 40 of all the coverage in the first week of the games
6837575 gymnastics came next with 11 while track and field constituted another 10 no other competition came close to generating that much attention
6837576 swimmer michael phelps with his record setting eight gold medal performance was the focus of more than one quarter of all the stories studied generating seven times more media attention than the next most covered athlete
6837577 china and the olympics combined were the no 2 news story during the two weeks studied behind presidential campaign news due in part to the network that aired the games nbc devoted almost half of its newshole to those stories in that period roughly three times the amount of news coverage other outlets produced
6837578 next to michael phelps the next most covered athlete at the olympics was russian born american gymnast nastia lukin 4 the no 3 olympic newsmaker is 58 years old and long retired mark spitz whose record of seven gold medals in the 1972 olympics was topped by phelps accounted for 2 of the coverage in the first week of the games
6837579 coverage of the olympic games and china accounted for 14 of the newshole in the period from aug 3 17 the no 1 story the presidential election accounted for 23 the conflict in georgia was a close third behind the games at 13
6837580 relatively unique among thin films in that it has no intrinsic degradation mechanism
6837581 there are simply too many variables at this stage to provide an accurate forecast of a ramp these range from efficiency improvements to tool uptime to module certification
6837582 miasol s approach is to continuously sputter all of the seven layers of the solar cell in a single pass through a high throughput vacuum system our system is capable of processing more than 250 000 square meters of cell material per year based on 80 percent system uptime and the current two linear feet per minute line speed we are operating at

6837584 selenium presents the most significant challenge in any cigs manufacturing process insufficient selenium in cigs results in defects which reduce performance and selenium is extremely volatile at the high temperatures used to form device quality cigs absorber layers
6837585 prevents the loss of selenium and provides other more subtle benefits as well
6837586 highly flexible and controllable which allows us to explore many different options to optimize throughput and produce competitive manufacturing costs in a relatively low volume production facility compared to other methods

6837590 an ultrasmooth metal foil more than 20 times more conductive than stainless steel
6837591 has brought proven coating and printing know how from the chemical and flexible electronics industries to energy via a new class of nanostructured materials
6837592 the material ramp up is straightforward and our materials suppliers are major chemical corporations the main change will be moving to larger material widths and faster web speeds this will require process engineering but not significant innovation due to the nature of the printing process we expect that defects will be low and yields will be high
6837593 will provide its power plastic films and toppan will integrate the films with their products and market the final product
6837594 we enter the value chain for silicon solar cells near the very beginning at the basic raw material stage
6837595 nanograms process involves the direct deposition of a thick silicon film from a silane precursor much like thin film solar cells except that our films are 20 to 30 times thicker the crystal grain sizes in our films are more than 2 000 times larger than in micromorph crystalline thin film we expect these two film attributes will combine to enable much higher efficiency than can be obtained in a thin film cell
6837596 collapses the value chain for making high efficiency silicon solar cells since the films are deposited in a large area format the cell junctions and contacts are fabricated at the module scale eliminating many of the wafer handling steps required to string up an array of cells to make a module
6837597 we are also developing our junction and contact fabrication techniques on commercial multicrystalline wafers
6837598 our priorities are to demonstrate our product in a module prototype and build a pilot plant to demonstrate the process and its economics in 2008
6837599 all the solar market projections show continued massive growth over the next five years with volumes tripling new capacity will be needed and existing capacity will be retired the risk of nanograms process to an existing manufacturer today is that the efficiency and cost targets still need to be proven the reward opportunity is having the highest value product on the market

6837625 not just apple but its partners in india bharti airtel and vodafone will have to play their roles to perfection for their customers to enjoy the iphone
6837626 india is amongst the few markets where the partner telcos are spending huge sums training thousands of their employees to activate the iphone this is because unlike their western counterparts indian customers cannot be expected to activate the phone online
6837627 low internet and pc penetration is a roadblock here and even amongst those in metros and large cities who own pcs only a small minority have apples itunes on their systems the other catch is slow internet speeds which can frustrate users attempting to download itunes
6837628 its official vodafone will sell the 8 gb 3g iphone for 31 000 rupees 712 and the 16 gb model for 36 100 rupees 828 and this for a 3g model when india does not even have 3g services yet
6837629 the price of the 8 gb model in the us is 199 and 299 for the 16 gb model so is buying the iphone in india worth it or will the grey market rule who will buy the new iphone all those who had pre booked the ones who want to get the latest gizmo on day one of its official launch in india or the geeks who cherish anything apple
6837630 gee hp presarios must not be such sucky laptops after all
6837631 address any lingering doubts our customers may have about windows vista
6837632 i think microsoft has been quite up front about the gap between the publics perception of vistas capabilities and vistas actual capabilities the company earlier this summer admitted it needed to invest more resources into addressing lingering public perceptions that vista is a dog of a product that has failed to live up to its potential signing jerry seinfeld up as a spokesperson is an early step along this road
6837633 isnt so much a knee jerk reaction to this situation than it is a concerted effort by microsoft to shed its image as a stodgy marketer apple has its rock star ceo steve jobs who turns every major announcement into a cultural event microsoft has never had similar dna but that doesnt mean it cant take a stab at being a little cooler than it has been in the past
6837634 microsoft isnt in crisis mode just yet but the writing is on the wall for both of its major cash cow franchises windows and office the shift toward the web is putting pressure on microsoft to address market performance shortcomings more aggressively i would expect more high profile marketing announcements along the lines of the jerry seinfeld deal in the months to come as microsoft can no longer afford to trail the industry in terms of the punching power of its messaging

6837689 the higher commanders drawn from the aristocracy could never prepare for modern war because in order to do so they would have had to admit that the world was changing they have always clung to obsolete methods and weapons because they inevitably saw each war as a repetition of the last
6837690 of all the human beings i have ever known he rises in my memory as the one superb complete person he was at once soldier and poet statesman and artist always he was the gentleman wondrously gentle and a man to the bone that figure of a poised intent suffering masterful spirit tried alternately by desperate defeat and by tremendous triumph neither deterred by the one nor elated by the other will always stand before me as an ideal he had learned that the hope of heaven and the fear of hell are vulgar vices and that the superior man loves right for its own sake he was the arch type of the old high order of chivalric thinking of unshrinking living and of stoical dying other great men may come but such a great man as this we are not likely to see again

6837734 i thought i was a great driver and i had no problems
6837735 to my great surprise i found out i had known very little about driving thats when i decided i wanted to teach that course
6837736 i found the program so important that i stayed with it all these years
6837737 the goal of the aarp safe driving program is twofold to save lives and to safely extend the driving years of senior citizens the important word there is safety
6837738 back when i took the course in the 1980s 50 000 people every year were being slaughtered on our highways now its down to 42 000 which is still 42 000 too many
6837739 his course was extremely well received and extremely well done
6837740 what he really focuses on are the normal physiological problems of aging and he gives lots of really practical useful things to deal with that
6837741 afterward he said everybody should be taking this course that was his evaluation and thats been pretty standard with people who didnt know what it was all about and then took the class
6837742 when they see how many mistakes theyve made that gets peoples attention
6837743 what we try to do is make people aware of the fact that the car is a very dangerous instrument if a person is hit by a car its about the same as your car being smashed by a sherman tank
6837744 if you think about it if there are more people who drive safely there will be less people who end up in the hospital
6837745 i tell them we are married to our cars we cant imagine being without it

6837748 in addition the subject came up when i was interviewing for this job so its not something that i personally brought to the fore it had been on the minds of conscious caring adults in this school community who had identified the issue as something that clearly exists and that is unacceptable
6837749 it was clear to me that this school is very successful in meeting the needs of the students so i spent much of last year observing asking questions and confirming my impression that no major overhaul is needed now though id like focus more closely on the racial achievement gap a phenomenon that is extremely widespread and clearly evident based on the empirical data that are out there
6837750 unfinished business closing the racial achievement gap in our schools
6837751 the goals that we have in mind are 1 to help our teachers become more aware of the topic 2 to look at how one school tackled the issue and 3 to develop a common language along the way we need to examine a lot of data define what the racial achievement gap is here and ascertain how well know when weve successfully closed it
6837752 the middle school is just that a middle school its not a junior anything the expectations and rigor in both schools are demanding but theyre a little different here the high school for instance with about 900 students is larger its also less structured and the students have more blocks of free time so they need to learn how to manage that time
6837753 isnt easy we want to be sure for example not to schedule the school musical on the night before midterms
6837754 i had the opportunity to observe her teach a model lesson here
6837755 as someone who studied a little french in high school and college i was thrilled with her french her ability to connect with the kids and the rigor of her teaching
6837756 is one of our core academic resources but its so much more its where a lot of kids hang their hats during the day and barbara has the same sort of warm and magnetic personality that trish had and that was so effective
6837757 and a great sense of humor which is particularly valuable in her line of work
6837758 and these people are all ready to hit the ground running they also have incredible student centered values which are so important here
6837759 can you believe it it looks like hes faster than those nfl guys
6837760 ive made great progress since my rookie year in terms of understanding the game more and more and now i think im at the point im very comfortable saying that i can start in this league
6837761 this probably wouldnt be the best place to play but im also very comfortable here because im learning from one of the best in the game i love it here i have no idea whats out there for me
6837762 you probably didnt write it down and you think its biased
6837763 but ive seen a lot of football and there is no doubt in my mind that he can be that kind of guy for a long time you may think this is an exaggeration but i see a right handed steve young intelligence toughness mobility and athleticism
6837764 from his first day as a freshman to the day he graduated he never lost a competitive sprint ever
6837765 and hes a 4 7 guy look its not the sec but weve got guys that can run weve got cornerbacks running a lot faster than that and a guy like clifton dawson the ivys all time rusher but he just never let anybody beat him
6837766 having three brothers we were always banging on each other doing sports we were iron kids we did all kinds of triathlons and we played every sport it seems soccer swimming you name it swimming was neat because its something you were able to do by yourself
6837767 i think he can throw it all over the field
6837768 he can throw every ball and hes accurate hes got a lot of zip good touch
6837769 a lot of guys that they say have a great arm
6837770 hes made good decisions running with the ball there on the third down play for 21 yards was a huge play
6837771 jeff rowe had that same instance happen on second and 2 and tried to throw the ball to the flat and now were trying to convert a third down rather than running it take your lumps and get the first down and lets come back and play i see ryan make quick decisions like that
6837772 carsons scruffiness rubs off on everybody its more of his laziness than anything
6837773 hes one of the most down to earth guys ive met in this league considering how high his station is
6837774 and he could be such a bad guy if he wanted to be
6837775 theres a good amount of trust between us now in terms of stuff im seeing on the field with different plays and different coverages different blitzes
6837776 ive got to be his eyes on the sideline its one thing to hear it from a coach but to hear it from a player who knows what hes going through its important for him to have those different set of eyes
6837777 hes been a star his whole life ive been in the shadows
6837778 two thirds of me is thinking that this is great what a find i cant believe that arizona or arizona state isnt all over this kid
6837779 the other third of me is thinking maybe im missing something because wouldnt they be all over him
6837780 im not a big guy now but i was only 6 1 195 pounds when i was a senior i only got one offer
6837781 the minute i went to harvard i knew that was the place
6837782 he likes to sun in between the window and window pane
6837783 hes getting too big and would struggle now he put a hole in the screen not on purpose he was just trying to move his body and he fell out
6837784 i was out for about four hours and when i came home i couldnt find him anywhere
6837785 sometimes he hides but not usually for an entire day hes big so i usually find him anyway plus when i call him to eat hell come cause he loves to eat
6837786 they can take a fall there was no sign of any trauma around that area
6837787 it was hot for a while and i thought he could be ok but it could be an animal got him or someone picked him up
6837788 its a lot of work to raise an iguana to make him tame around other people
6837789 hes a free roaming iguana i didnt make him stay in the tank except to feed and go to the bathroom
6837790 im getting to feel like im not going to see him again
6837791 i did go to pet store but then i changed my mind

6837793 weve been able to maintain our program and staffing levels and that we still have the great wayland public education system
6837794 an administrative decision was made not to introduce any new curriculum this year the reconfiguration seemed to be enough to handle at the same time though well continue to support the staff on the new initiatives that have been implemented over the past three years and to build the new teams at each grade level
6837795 the kindergarten was housed at claypit hill and people loved having it all together so i cant imagine it will be anything but wonderful
6837796 like an early childhood center the teachers will be able to more easily share curriculum and support one another in their various activities
6837797 were looking into the possibility of getting buses for our kids to go over to loker later in the school year though so that this outreach can be continued
6837798 were not really anticipating any difficulties but well deal with any that come up on an as needs basis were anticipating a great start though realistically the nervous anticipation and excitement that accompany the beginning of any school year may be a little heightened this time around
6837799 something magical happens during the summer and the kids come in quite different from what they were in june so they automatically bring an air of excitement to each new year
6837800 that no student will be anonymous and that each one will leave here having felt cared for

6837816 our rationale is that to ensure the continued success of our enterprise we are constantly evaluating the size and placement of our work force including the ways we staff and prioritize work

6837818 eighty six percent of the respondents to the voice of the voter survey conducted by the herald journal and newschannel 7 indicated that they want stronger laws that channel development and protect neighborhoods
6837819 an overwhelming majority 71 percent also stated that they want county governments to enact zoning only 14 percent oppose zoning
6837820 but spartanburg county leaders have not responded not only have they refused to adopt any of the zoning models that have worked well in other areas of the state they have refused to significantly improve the countys existing land use ordinances

6837842 this is the second time ive written this article the first was an attempt to encapsulate my trip to bayreuth in a succinct and critical fashion with explanations of what i believed to be deep thoughts on the physical place its dubious history and the thick rope that binds them speaking of ropes and not only in terms of hanging myself i think i thought i was a norn a wagnerian mother time creature who lives in the earth in gotterdammerung sifting through the various threads of german history from the 19th century to today revealing to my poor readers striking similarities that can only be viewed through the passage of years blind and moaning cursing the fact that nothing ever changes well on re reading what id done i was quite disappointed well actually jorn my german boyfriend thanks guys in true berlin fashion wasnt really that impressed basically i sounded like an american teenager writing about his trip to europe back to mom in the mid west where everyone is still really excited about nascar and having won world war ii dont get me wrong its still important to mention the fact that in villa whanfried wagners old home which is now a museum dedicated to the festival there is not one single picture of adolf hitler who actually back in the day lived next door and tended to pop over quite a bit still speaking of pop for a pop musician even a rather sophisticated pop musician like myself tackling the third reichs connection to bayreuth is way out of my league and for this second attempt i will focus more on my impressions but dont worry i tend to get very impressed

6837868 prior to the fire and explosion a truck driver at the sunrise propane industrial gases murray road facility was engaged in a truck to truck propane transfer the practice of transferring propane directly from one tanker truck to another is prohibited in ontario

6837870 to cease and desist the truck to truck propane transfer procedure
6837871 this decision was based on a thorough review of the information currently available and the immediate nature of the potential hazards associated with operations at those particular sites

6837888 any decision to convene parliament will be a clear repudiation of the memorandum of understanding and an indication beyond reasonable doubt of zanu pfs unwillingness to continue to be part of the talks in short convening parliament decapitates the dialogue
6837889 article 9 of the mou signed on 21 july 2008 makes it clear that no party during the subsistence of the dialogue shall take any decision or measure that has a bearing on the dialogue save by consensus such a decision or measure includes but is not restricted to the convening of parliament or formation of a new government in the present case the mdc has not consented to the convening of parliament
6837890 a violation of the mou will have to be dealt with by the mediator
6837891 if president mugabe goes ahead to convene parliament appoint a new cabinet it means he is proceeding to violate the conditions of the mou which means he may have abandoned the basis for the talks but we dont know what his intentions are

6837899 create as large a repository as possible of real time metrics data from windows pcs all over the world whos running what and how its performing
6837900 the study monitors only a very small sample from an unknown number of sources
6837901 these users are not necessarily representative of windows vista users as a whole
6837902 per our longstanding practice allowing downgrade rights enterprise customers and purchasers of windows vista ultimate or windows vista business editions can choose to downgrade to windows xp professional if they feel they need more time to get ready for windows vista
6837903 may downgrade in the short term but with an eye toward upgrading later
6837904 we found that 65 percent of the boxes pre loaded with vista were still running it and the rest were running windows xp
6837905 either manually wiped the drive and installed xp or paid the vendor to uninstall vista and install xp it blows you away that people will pay not to have the default operating system
6837906 getting metrics about your pc is not the kind of thing grandma would want to do
6837907 contrary to the recent devil mountain software survey windows vista momentum is getting stronger and stronger
6837908 i bet they sneak away for a few minutes to watch the united states versus argentina 2008 olympics semi final basketball game today i would seriously on the one hand central bankers face the prospect of another round of housing related write offs and the need to intervene to keep markets liquid on the other hand we still have oil fed inflation in the system so my sense is they will issue a statement indicating that the major central banks stand at the ready to provide additional liquidity and take other measures to keep markets functioning
6837909 i would really like to see some european central bank comments from president jean claude trichet that hes ready to cut rates and that the greater risk in europe like the u s is toward recession demand in europe is slowing and if e u u s trade flows continue to decline that will prolong the recession hence ecb monetary policy is intrinsic to the recovery story
6837910 probably the most important item on their agenda after maintaining liquid functioning markets concerns long term interest rates they havent fallen due to banks reluctance to lend in order to repair their balance sheets housing faces a 2 3 year recovery period but well need long term mortgage rates for 30 year fixed loans to drift back toward 6 00 or 5 75 to speed housings transition back to health if monetary officials dont find a way to get long term rates to trend lower that delays the recovery
6837911 the first thing they need to do is get off the inflation obsession the ecb is the worst in this regard but the bank of england is close behind its as if some central bankers have operated in a vacuum and havent seen the economic slowdown around them the slowdown has been abrupt and if were not careful the recession is going to be longer and deeper than most expect three or four percent inflation is a concern but its mostly oil driven and its not the biggest concern when growth is at a standstill
6837912 i would put financial stability at the top of the list and by that i mean the bond and credit markets the markets will face two more adjustments ahead probably more mortgage write offs and some type of infusion for a cash strapped fre credit markets remain in distressed condition so central bankers will need to build up and ready hundreds of billions of dollars more in emergency credit to prevent markets from freezing again like they did at the start of the housing slump

6837927 its impossible to imagine that anyone in the cuban leadership would want to put their country in the bulls eye of another superpower showdown reminiscent of the missile crisis
6837928 the military talk seems to be bluster on moscows part
6837929 cuba has nothing to gain from a military relationship which would be high risk and out of character with the steady renovation of diplomatic relationships
6837930 as ive heard dozens of times over the years from cubans on the island the bolos russians are not to be trusted

6837941 obamas education began a life long relationship with islam as a faith and muslims as a community this has been a relationship that contains numerous question marks
6837942 there is a basic difference between islam and this form of democracy the basic difference is that in islam it is allahs law as expressed in the koran and the sunna that is the supreme law within the limits of which people have the right to legislate
6837943 no one can be a muslim who makes or freely accepts or believes that anyone has the right to make or accept legislation that is contrary to that divine law
6837944 examples of such violations include the legalization of alcoholic drinks gambling homosexuality usury or interest and even adoption
6837945 there is no doubt ellison was right about jefferson believing that wisdom could be gleaned from the muslim koran at the time jefferson owned the book he needed to understand everything possible about muslims because he was about to advocate war against the islamic barbary states of morocco algeria tunisia and tripoli

6838002 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6838003 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6838004 they wont act until the coast is clear on financial stability and the state of the economy
6838005 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
6838006 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
6838007 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis

6838031 we are obviously very concerned about reports that russia may be providing weapons weapons systems to syria
6838032 we have always said to the russians that these sales should not go forward they dont contribute to regional stability and again i urge them not to go through with these sales if there is an intent to go through with them
6838033 would endanger peace in the world not only in the middle east
6838034 i dont see any way the potential weapon sales can contribute positively to stability in the middle east

6838040 today our weekend got off to a good start but obviously it is far too early to say where we are compared to the opposition
6838041 the setup we have found is not bad but there is still plenty of room for improvement
6838042 the first day was difficult for everybody especially to get the braking points its very hard on breaks
6838043 we keep improving the car race after race and we are in a position now to be in the top six in qualifiers and in the races to get points
6838044 considering the dustiness of the track we made a very promising start on the setup this morning
6838045 we were able to go quicker on each run without changing too much and we took a very good baseline into the afternoon session were in pretty good shape and im looking forward to tomorrow

6838053 its a mystery to me why the japanese police would target three relatively minor crewmembers
6838054 as captain all sea shepherd crewmembers act in accordance with my orders all activities opposing the illegal actions of the japanese whaling fleet are my responsibility yet no charges have been filed against me this is absurd and makes no sense at all
6838055 the sea shepherd conservation society is not protesting whaling we are opposing illegal whaling in accordance with the principles of the united nation world charter for nature if our activities are illegal then the warrant would be addressed to me not to three non officer volunteers
6838056 they are just messing about really its a face saving political exercise
6838057 its for the japanese public more than anything else i dont think interpol will take it seriously
6838058 the police havent been in touch at all and im pretty sure they wont be

6838082 i dont have any inkling myself at all but obviously sung kim is going to assess where things are with north korea in his conversations with north korean officials
6838083 the us government wants to see this verification package as soon as possible so that we can move forward with this delisting
6838084 its like nails on a chalkboard when i hear that
6838085 i love to visit minneapolis but theres something about st paul thats charming and simple
6838086 it is you can hardly go anywhere in st paul that you dont see someone you know which is the great thing about it i think

6838088 you would have to promise you would not commit a crime in the city limits of st paul you could kill anyone you wanted in minneapolis and you did

6838303 while it is difficult to attract people to come here we are saying that the cost is lower to operate in cyberjaya we are already seeing a number of big names establishing a base here
6838304 when the fuel price went up they raised the prices of goods even when we told them not to
6838305 now that the fuel price is reduced they must make a similar change
6838306 this is the best deal for all malaysians and not just for those in permatang pauh
6838307 we promised the rakyat to reduce the price but if we wait until the end of the month to do it the price could rise and we wont be able to pass on the benefits
6838308 the rakyat has been impatiently waiting for me to announce it then the world crude oil price went up by us 5 rm16 50 and we decided not to wait any longer
6838309 otherwise the people will ask why we did not reduce the price when the world oil price was down

6838312 la poes a no se encuentra tirada en la calle ni es inspiraci n sino que se construye
6838313 los dos me parec an buenos poetas y ten a admiraci n por ellos pero yo era el m s joven de la generaci n del 60 y ellos deben haberme mirado como un cabro chico pero ninguno de los dos era poeta de mi total agrado en realidad no creo que haya un poeta de mi total agrado en ninguna parte del mundo el nfasis en el mentalismo de lihn me hace retroceder la imagen para m es lo fresco no el pensamiento teillier hizo una obra redonda pero la provincia nunca la he visto como positiva
6838314 creo que la antipoes a est rodeada de muchos mitos hay una visi n de que las cosas ocurren en sucesi n pero cuando le a a nicanor parra tambi n le a a pablo de rokha en general me atra an las im genes disonantes no tanto el lenguaje coloquial
6838315 acercarse a la muerte en vida es alcanzar una plenitud vital que la gente corriente no alcanza uno sencillamente entra a otra dimensi n y aunque sea pasiva ten s que salvar el pellejo como sea uno vive y la escritura viene despu s lo m s interesante de la muerte es la inc gnita que provoca qu cresta pasa all la concepci n del alma me parece muy dudosa ahora frecuento la idea egipcia y tibetana de la muerte
6838316 la muerte es otra existencia no m s los tibetanos dicen que hay muerte vida premuerte y postmuerte entonces la premuerte se puede preparar si uno quiere reencarnarse puede hacerlo las veces que quiera la misma pel cula sin acordarse de que la vio se r e o uno puede tratar de salirse entonces lea las instrucciones porque te vai a encontrar con un demonio de cuatro metros que tira fuego y lo que no ten s que hacer es cagarte de susto hay que enfrentarlo y seguir adelante
6838317 singapore is our major export market and based on our study the country has a solid construction market
6838318 we are suppliers for the worlds largest biodiesel factory and solar panel factory in singapore

6838357 this number 3 5 million could turn out to be inflated the operators could lose money because they took all risks upon themselves having failed to dictate terms to retail chains through which they will sell the iphones

6838401 the second estimate of second quarter uk gdp clearly increases the already strong chances that the economy will fall into recession over the coming quarters
6838402 the economy now looks set to grow by just 1 2 percent or so this year with a very strong chance of a technical recession in the second half and things will be considerably worse in 2009
6838403 the uk like other economies is seeing the consequences of globally high commodity prices as well as the uncertainty in the credit markets
6838404 the governments priority is to guide britain through these challenging times while also supporting those hit hardest as a result of these global factors
6838405 follows downward revisions to the growth in output of the production construction and services industries
6838406 we continue to expect a technical recession in the second half of the year and the mpc to respond with the first in a series of rate cuts in november
6838407 we judge that the risks of an earlier move have risen
6838408 with gdp flat in the second quarter and further signs of slowing activity a contraction in the third quarter is now highly likely
6838409 as a result the risks to medium term inflation are likely to subside giving the bank of england the scope to cut interest rates sooner than they may have thought possible

6838415 this proposed regulation is about the legal right of a health care professional to practice according to their conscience
6838416 doctors and other health care providers should not be forced to choose between good professional standing and violating their conscience freedom of expression and action should not be surrendered upon the issuance of a health care degree
6838417 many health care providers routinely face pressure to change their medical practice often in direct opposition to their personal convictions
6838418 during my practice as an ob gyn i witnessed this first hand but health care providers shouldnt have to check their conscience at the hospital door this proposed rule will help ensure that doesnt happen
6838419 thanks to a grant from the auto theft prevention authority aaa texas and hpd are able to offer this service at no cost to motorists
6838420 auto theft is down 25 percent so far this year due to the proactive steps that motorists along with hpd have been taking to protect their vehicles and vin etching is one of the best ways to protect your car
6838421 vin etching can make the vehicle far less desirable and much difficult to be disassembled at chop shops and the parts resold for more than the value of the car
6838422 aaa texas is very pleased to work with our friends at the houston police department to do what we can to prevent auto thefts aaa texas and hpd are offering this service at no cost while at least one car dealership in the houston area is charging its customers 200 00 to have it done

6838434 when we got home we went on the internet and found pictures exactly like what we saw
6838435 there were pictures of brown ones and black ones what we saw was a black sasquatch
6838436 we were a half to three quarters of a mile from the skiff lake sign in a densely wooded area when we came around a turn and saw a huge figure on the edge of the road it looked down towards us then it walked across the road ahead of us just about 250 meters away
6838437 we own hunting and fishing camps and in the last 22 years we have brought in and weighed over 150 bears and i have seen 15 or 16 live ones five this spring so i know a bear when i see one i know a bear can stand on its hind legs and move around but a bear cant walk on two legs the way this human like form did it crossed the road in three or four long steps swinging its long arms like a human
6838438 pitch black sleek hairy approximately 8 and a half foot sasquatch
6838439 we asked them if they saw what we saw and they said they did
6838440 they told us they were on their way home to saint john from their local area cottage they were as excited as we were
6838441 i know what we saw and i dont care if people believe us or not there are four of us who witnessed the same thing so why would we just make something like that up
6838442 we dont want to be involved in what we feel people will only think of as a hoax
6838443 if it was just someone dressed up they sure did a good job
6838444 i want somebody who is going to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policy making

6838465 cold war sentiment supported oil prices as tensions increased between the west and russia over the deployment of a us missile system in poland sparking fears of disruption to supply
6838466 in that statement she was requesting that he come out and give himself up
6838467 its like nails on a chalkboard when i hear that
6838468 i love to visit minneapolis but theres something about st paul thats charming and simple
6838469 it is you can hardly go anywhere in st paul that you dont see someone you know which is the great thing about it i think
6838470 if you were one of these guys when you got to town youd literally walk up to the first police officer you saw and introduce yourself
6838471 you would have to promise you would not commit a crime in the city limits of st paul you could kill anyone you wanted in minneapolis and you did
6838472 no money would be taken from academics there would be no taxpayer money it would be all private its a unique format thats never been done before in the united states
6838473 why on earth would i want to put any more money in a hedge fund now
6838474 qwant isnt just any hedge fun weve been working with mont bank to solve the credit crisis
6838475 weve had a team of top minds from the endower institute working on the problem for months theyve developed a completely new securitization model the lbs its a complete drop in replacement for the mbs nobody else know how to do this yet this is opportunity knocking
6838476 mortgage backed security the lbs is completely a whole new way of thinking about the problem none of the dangers of the mbs
6838477 none at all returns are guaranteed with volume this has nothing to do with homeowners or mortgages its a sure thing
6838478 oh well yeah sure its a securitized debt but theres no risk of default
6838479 well i dont want to get into the mathematics but you can trust me on this one some very smart people put this together
6838480 well sure i could give you a lecture but ive got a lot of calls to make so are you in or out
6838481 well ben i just have a few qustions a something backed security right
6838482 you want me to put it in a nutshell for you
6838483 these micro loans are made to eligible parties throughout the country in order to purchase diverse kinds of government debt instruments
6838484 no bonds are old hat were breaking new ground here
6838485 we deploy advanced computer modelling on complex statistical datasets to ensure a high overall rate of return
6838486 well theres always ratios of risk and return to be calculated for any investment
6838487 so this is some kind of investment with a it called beta
6838488 no correlation there either this is a total market beater
6838489 its the future and youve got the chance to get in on the ground floor now i think ive explained this to you pretty thoroughly im going to need your decision or ill have to move on
6838490 dont be small minded sir the numbers are good theres always a payout and we always get our cut
6838491 i dont care about the math im not putting money into that
6838492 look sir dont be afraid of a name sure i could
6838493 there are often collisions there and it is time something was done to make it safer and easier for drivers
6838494 we heard a bang on wednesday and i went straight out to see if i could help and i could see there were people trapped but people there said they had already called the ambulance
6838495 there needs to be a filter light for people turning right each way there is if you come from walton towards felixstowe but not if you come from the other directions
6838496 the traffic has increased enormously since we came here and i dont know what it will be like when they build the extra homes
6838497 we often see people trying to beat the lights i think people start to move before they should
6838498 we look at all the contributing factors identified in the police report it might be driver behaviour or speeding and the junction itself as part of our investigation
6838499 this could be the biggest car crash television moment of all time
6838500 he thinks its a big mistake and doesnt want anything to do with it but britney thinks it will help her custody battle for her sons
6838501 i wont comment on anything else until i introduce our running mate to the world
6838502 isolated just one milligram a very tiny amount from natural sources that were very difficult to grow
6838503 we needed to develop a concise and efficient synthetic route to make enough largazole for animal studies
6838504 my labs next task was finding the origin of lagarzoles biological activity
6838505 it could be a very good drug candidate for the treatment of various cancers
6838506 what we have here is a completely novel approach to combating illness
6838507 the sensors in bacteria are waiting for the right signal to initiate the expression of virulent genes
6838508 using led209 we blocked those sensing mechanisms and basically tricked the bacteria to not recognize that they were within the host when we did that the bacterial pathogens could not effectively cause disease in the treated animals
6838509 what makes this current study unique is that we showed the drug working in three different pathogens
6838510 only a few new antibiotics have reached the market in recent years
6838511 because led209 has never been used as an antibiotic its a completely different type of drug in addition its target qsec is also different from the current antimicrobial drug targets this study demonstrates that led209 has promise in fighting at least three pathogens and likely many more
6838512 what we have right now works really well for systemic infections and its very potent but we also need non absorbable molecules to treat noninvasive pathogens such as ehec which stays in the intestine
6838513 this is a critical national security program that has been plagued by technical design and development errors basic management blunders and poor government oversight
6838514 the program not only cant connect the dots it cant find the dots
6838515 the tragic events of september 11 2001 demonstrated that the united states needed greater integration across the intelligence community and improved information sharing to respond to evolving threats and to support new homeland security customers
6838516 nctc has developed innovative solutions including nctc online and terrorist identities datamart environment to increase information sharing and collaboration in support of the counterterrorism mission
6838517 the collapse of the railhead program appears to be the result of poor technical planning and design potential contractor mismanagement and inadequate government oversight
6838518 these same problems have emerged again and again on government programs as millions of dollars in taxpayer funding is squandered at some point the government needs to learn how to manage its technology programs so that they actually perform as advertised this episode is particularly disturbing since we are talking about the safety and security of 300 million american citizens
6838519 i have asked the inspector general to investigate this program thoroughly and recommend potential lessons learned for future government programs we cant just keep making the same mistakes again and again
6838520 if you see a bright flash duck under your desk and cover your head there has been a nuclear explosion
6838521 what in the world is that caterpillar doing on my brow
6838522 dad please dont ever send me here again all papa and gramma do is sit around with other old people and talk about what hurts and what doctor they went to this week i wanna come home

6838770 how can he be sorry when i was the i understand the 12th victim
6838771 i would talk in a monotone robot voice and repeat eyeballs before and after each sentence
6838772 we even created a back story for eyeballs the robot as having been a robbie the robot style rip off character that had starred in a series of bad 1950s sci fi b movies like eyeballs goes west and eyeballs meets the three stooges
6838773 i wondered what people might call this subculture of mechanical loser and thus shmobots was born
6838774 as i was coming up with shmobots it seemed like a natural fit to include eyeballs as a major character
6838775 69 5 is a bit of a wuss but generally pretty sweet
6838776 eyeballs the robot is a bit of a know it all and miles is their human pal

6838780 once it was done we met with a number of publishers and were offered many deals but we ultimately chose to partner up with boom because we felt that they really got what shmobots was about

6838795 there is speculation that we may be approaching an inflection point where the rate of technology advancements is accelerating at an exponential rate and machines could even overtake humans in their ability to reason in the not so distant future
6838796 our rationale is that to ensure the continued success of our enterprise we are constantly evaluating the size and placement of our work force including the ways we staff and prioritize work
6838797 this action allows us to rationalize the size of our work force relative to the size of our customer base
6838798 after careful review and consideration we are pleased to inform you that we have stopped collecting effective august 21 2008
6838799 this decision was driven by your direct and candid feedback and our continued commitment to you as our valued customers

6838801 we showed a little bit of growth in the hard market from 2004 2006 but now you see our premiums coming down and from 2006 where we wrote 1 3 billion weve now declined to 1 1 billion which is about a 15 decline thats the front edge of our soft market strategy
6838802 we are not going to write under priced business and we are not very focused on the top line we are really focused on your bottom line and if we need to get smaller to maintain our returns we are going to do that and well return the capital we are not using to wtm and it will be put to good use elsewhere most of the shrink in premiums is coming from the north american market where prices are declining more rapidly than europe and elsewhere the european market tends to be more stable
6838803 we had a fairly calm first half of the year so far and if we include a full catastrophe load in second half results which is the long term average catastrophe experience we can report a combined ratio of less than 100 for the year
6838804 the casualty business is the one that is actually shrinking probably most rapidly that was a 350 million business in the hard market and it is heading down to just north of a 100 million business next year
6838805 sirius has in its u s gaap books a 400 million deferred tax liability we dont ever expect to pay that deferred tax liability not a penny of it the swedish regulators dont require recordation of that liability in fact they count that money as capital and the ratings agencies count that money as capital but its not in our gaap net worth but when we look at sirius business however we think of that as quasi equity thats really a cheap source of leverage in that business
6838806 in accordance with provisions of swedish law sirius international is permitted to transfer up to the full amount of its pre tax income subject to certain limitations into an untaxed reserve referred to as a safety reserve which equaled 1 4 billion at december 31 2007 under gaap an amount equal to the safety reserve net of the related deferred tax liability established at the swedish tax rate of 28 is classified as shareholders equity generally this deferred tax liability is only required to be paid by sirius international if it fails to maintain predetermined levels of premium writings and loss reserves in future years as a result of the indefinite deferral of these taxes swedish regulatory authorities do not apply any taxes to the safety reserve when calculating solvency capital under swedish insurance regulations accordingly under local statutory requirements an amount equal to the deferred tax liability on sirius internationals safety reserve 398 million at december 31 2007 is included in solvency capital access to the safety reserve is restricted to coverage of aggregate losses and requires the approval of swedish regulatory authorities
6838807 weve got players coming in from all over the place into our business whether they are hedge funds or private equity using all different types of securities cat bonds sidecars we have used a couple of sidecars in the past ourselves many of these sources of capital have a lower cost of capital for the risk they are taking on than we do on our own balance sheet
6838808 thats a tough equation to win and rather than trying to compete with that in our present format we will have to become more and more competitive in those market sand use those tools
6838809 so over time i would expect and this will be gradual that wtm re will become more of a service company and less of a risk bearing entity and that will produce better and less risky returns and free up more of our capital for use at wtm

6838861 i always thought you had said you loved me then why was it that you tried changing me i thought you would understand by changing me you would not have the one who loved you the real me
6838862 nothing is good with me unless i have an asshole boyfriend to limit my potential and put me down
6838863 love her he did but also his own pride he had forgotten to love back his own bride
6838864 she gave him a thousand reasons to smile with her no agony lasted for more than a while
6838865 he told the student body that he took her information from myspace and showed it to a predator that was in prison and asked him what he would do with it
6838866 a complete lie certainly somebody misconstrued anything that i might have said in my career in having investigated child crimes and child abuse i have talked to predators who have had similar type pictures in their possessions not pictures of this particularl young lady or any other particular folks that i found at windsor high school
6838867 during my interviews with these individuals i always ask them why do you have these pictures time after time the answer is they arouse me and i masturbate while im looking at these pictures i absolutely did say that to the student body
6838868 i do not feel like i was picking on her or humiliating her i think i was just presenting information that every single person in that school at windsor colorado and cheyenne wyoming and beijing china have access to
6838869 its just ridiculous because everything the students are saying hes just saying the complete opposite
6838870 he started telling me that old guys were jacking off to my pictures and that i was pretty much asking to be raped
6838871 i have some apologies to make i dont want to apologize for the message that im trying to send because i am trying to educate kids in some of the dangers of the world that they work with every day
6838872 some of the ways that gay approached it offended embarrassed and are hurting some of our kids
6838873 my whole life ive really prided myself on being a christian girl and having this pure image
6838874 i dont go to parties or do anything like that he just completely ruined that reputation that i worked for he basically called me a slut and now i have people looking at me teachers look at me different
6838875 he kept on picking at her and picking at her and picking at her and everyone said thats harassment
6838876 officer gay chose it as an opportunity to take shaylahs pictures and her myspace and use it as an example of what not to do but then just really publicly humiliated her and mocked her
6838877 said nordic who coaches wrestling at the high school and football and track at windsor middle school
6838878 she left the auditorium in tears and busted out crying
6838879 he asked everybody there is shaylah nordic here so she raised her hand and then he went on to post the pictures and talk about it he said she was likely to be raped and murdered because how easy it was to access this stuff and how easy it was to get information
6838880 he said this is the perfect opportunity for somebody to do the same thing to this girl
6838881 so then he saw her leave the auditorium in tears and mockingly he said ill just call her and see if shell come back because i have access to all her information so i have her phone number right here so he called her from the stage after she left the auditorium in tears to come back to the auditorium he was just super harsh and very inappropriate
6838882 i totally support the intent of the assembly we talk to our kids about dangers of the internet especially posting pictures and stuff like that on there
6838883 i told mr porter that i know he wants to keep kids safe but this was not ok i dont know what to do im just kind of at a loss
6838884 where is the accountability if nobody is held accountable how do we know its not going to happen again

6838918 we are not waking them up its been a long time since brother has actually had a peaceful night when i woke up after keith attacked the villagers ben was crying silently as he watched the fire he couldnt sleep for weeks after it so we are going to let him sleep looks up at sara and hima got that you two
6838919 okay we can do that coatl kun you better listen to your master because you are alive we could use our illusionary jutsu on you and make you think you are melting
6838920 okay okay i get it we dont wake up sir ben but what about nee san
6838921 not her either she is most likely the reason why brother is able to sleep so soundly
6838922 what is going on we all woke up to loud crashes
6838923 i can see that none of you are completely dressed for battle even though you have your weapons out even master law has justin in its blade form
6838924 oh sorry about that i just wanted to get the hang of these lightning spells
6838925 it seems you found the element you are most in tune with so how long have you been practicing up until now
6838926 well i was out here before dawn i was training to store the mana i would need for these spells i also got the hang of using just the right amount of ki as well
6838927 if he wanted to he can now fire about fifteen of those spells he used against you master law without collapsing also he mastered a few fire spells as well thats why we were training near the river
6838928 whats wrong with you two you look like you just saw a chupacabra or something
6838929 youre wearing your new shirt and your hair is shorter
6838930 i gave him the hair cut after all if he wants to fight more effectively he needs less wind resistence
6838931 i also learned a few other elemental spells i have about 2 fire spells 3 water spells 1 earth spell 3 wind spells and about 6 electric spells oh reaper also found a scroll in the forest here that had a dark spell i also know that one
6838932 so overall you have learned fifteen spells not bad for a nights training but still some things need more time to master like right now because you used a lot of electricity you are now statically charge and pulling all our hair and making it stand up
6838933 i noticed that when he used that spell on you master law his hair stood up for a while before falling to the ground thats also a reason i cut his hair for him with it short no one can tell if he is storing electric power
6838934 well i have to say that i feel better now that i dont have that floor board stuck on my blade also why are the kunoichi half dressed trent coatl
6838935 its not that big a deal after all what about your master and ashley nee san
6838936 where did they go to and what is going on

6838942 at the same time that the national right to life committee has unearthed documents proving that barack obama repeatedly voted against a bill that would have protected children born alive after an attempted abortion illuminati pictures has released a video of an interview with a nurse who witnessed the very practice that obama protected while in the illinois senate jill stanek was a nurse at christ hospital in oak lawn illinois in 1999 when she discovered that babies born alive after failed abortions purposely were being left to die in the soiled utility room which says stanek is a room where biohazard materials and soiled linens are disposed of barack obama can play word games but at the end of the day his opposition was responsible for living babies being left out to die and that is indefensible concludes stanek
6838943 new documents just obtained by the national right to life committee nrlc prove that senator obama has for the past four years blatantly misrepresented his actions on the illinois born alive infants protection bill now the uncovering of the senate committee action report sheds new light on senator obamas four year effort to cover up his real record of refusing to protect live born survivors of abortion
6838944 in the original governing principles set forth in the declaration the right to life is one of three specifically identified inalienable rights the original documents both the declaration and the constitution make clear that the primary purpose of government at all times and in all situations is to protect those few inalienable rights if the philosophy originally set forth in the declaration of independence and subsequently secured in the constitution is rejected the belief that there is a god that he gives inalienable rights to man and that the purpose of government is to protect those rights at all times even when the states refuse to do so then there is no longer a unique american philosophy of government that will distinguish us from the rest of the world the founding fathers established federalism to preserve states rights but they also placed the protection of inalienable rights far above the level of states rights candidates who desire to lead the nation should follow the framers example and conform to the principles set forth in the declaration of independence and the constitution protecting life and marriage through the constitutional process those early leaders wisely provided
6838945 pro life is not a campaign slogan for me as president i will immediately work with congress to pass the sanctity of life act which would strip the appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court in all cases involving the life of an unborn child when that happens the unborn child would once again be declared a person under the law and cannot be harmed without due process of law appointing pro life supreme court justices will no longer give the republicans a phony rallying cry and the evil deeds of the u s supreme court on january 22 1973 will be set aside

6839013 the negotiators job is done now it is up to the leaders
6839014 the balance were trying to reach is between iraqs stated desire to have a more concrete view of us forces levels out through the years and our desire it be based on conditions on the ground
6839015 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation

6839028 to protect poor muslim from rich christians who buy their organs and vice versa

6839037 that system works in business and i think that could work at esdc the old structure had three co equals i didnt think that worked because there was no decision maker
6839038 we think this structure will work well and these are very talented people who will bring a new vitality to our economic development efforts
6839039 my first thought was to find out how much we spend on economic development
6839040 sarah thought telling jokes about her breakup would be a walk in the park but she was struck with a case of the jitters so severe she didnt know if shed be able to go on
6839041 sarah went to a comedian friend and told him she desperately needed some pot to calm her nerves
6839042 her timing was dead on and the audience responded well to the new material which did include a few bittersweet reflections on her breakup

6839046 but full credit to the team they worked their backsides off to get the car back out there each time in race one i locked up the rear brakes and went into hughes and i hold my hands up to that one it was my mistake and it wasnt intentional in any way
6839047 the car felt good in race two but we had a temperature warning light coming on and started to get gearbox issues coming down the gears so we had to come in
6839048 despite that ive still got a smile on my face because of all the support ive had my aim this year is to make a name for myself and we think we have done well to even get this far despite disappointments like this
6839049 hey some site has a new mp3 by the cool kids to download

6839052 most of the higher level people in the campaign still dont know
6839053 some of that strength in grain prices earlier this year was for real
6839054 as we go into the fall we know for example that the price of natural gas is going to go up an average of 20 per cent
6839055 for a family that means about a 260 a year increase which when looked at in grocery terms thats two or three weeks of groceries
6839056 its going to be quite difficult in the coming months in terms of their ability to put food on the table and to have a standard of living that is necessary
6839057 the rising price of gasoline energy food as well as tough economic times theyre coming together in a gathering storm
6839058 puts a few more steps into shopping looking around seeing what is the best bargain out there thats all you can do
6839059 hopefully the gas prices will level out a bit for the coming winter because thats always a problem too you cant get around as well
6839060 ive definitely rearranged what i buy where i buy and how i buy and i cant afford to drive the way i used to
6839061 public transit can be a blessing sometimes not as convenient but you do what you have to do

6839063 we do some work in first nations community sandy lake located about 700 kilometres northwest of thunder bay
6839064 gas prices are even higher there 1 70 a litre it just absolutely and ultimately reduces your mobility
6839065 given theres already high rates of poverty were extremely worried about conditions in communities in northwestern ontario
6839066 the north and rural regions certainly are finding it difficult
6839067 the people coming in that cant pay their hydro bills and their gas bills and so theyre being shut off is increasing if you cant pay that you cant get food
6839068 peanut butter and jam i dont have i dont have any canned meat on my shelf i dont have the canned pasta on my shelf because theyre 1 a can the peanut butter went from 1 60 up to 2 20

6839079 today our weekend got off to a good start but obviously it is far too early to say where we are compared to the opposition overtaking it will be difficult as always i hope i dont need to by getting the best position in qualifying the set up we have found today is not bad but there is still plenty of room for improvement

6839085 vincent is one of the outstanding talents in europe he understands the ambition of the club he understands where we want to take the club
6839086 we want to be a young vibrant team with energy and technical ability he comes into the category of the kind of young player we are trying to attract
6839087 the arsenic concentrations reported are worrisome but the risk assessment is complex
6839088 recent reports indicate increased fetal and infant mortality due to fairly low level arsenic exposure via drinking water
6839089 rice bran solubles are not the only way of getting nutrients to malnourished children
6839090 if aid agencies want to go down the bran solubles route why not wheat oat or barely bran solubles all these crops have ten times less total arsenic than rice and are just as nutrient rich
6839091 one would expect dietary supplements to be virtually free of unwanted substances like arsenic especially when aimed at children who are particularly vulnerable to arsenic
6839092 we totally agree with the overall message that it is important to set standards for inorganic arsenic in our food
6839093 rice bran solubles are being produced by commercial companies who profit from this commodity

6839151 as more of the student population gets access to broadband connections faculty at major universities are exploring how rich media and online interactivity can enhance supplement and even replace the classroom experience
6839152 broadband speeds have barely nudged over the past year and they remain a mere fraction of those found in other developed countries the group says slow internet connections hinder the growth of new technologies like telemedicine
6839153 a one year follow up on a study of social media adoption at 500 of the fastest growing companies in the us has found that familiarity with and use of blogs podcasting wikis online video and social networking has skyrocketed in 2008 to nearly double what it was in 2007

6839358 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6839359 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6839360 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6839361 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

6839369 the answer to that question is in my opinion yes and you should read the post to find out why

6839371 many people have died because of russias use of cluster munitions in georgia even as moscow denied it had used this barbaric weapon
6839372 many more people could be killed or wounded unless russia allows professional demining organizations to enter at once to clean the affected areas
6839373 highly dangerous unexploded bomblets now litter farms roads and pathways in shindisi and pkhvenisi
6839374 people remaining in these areas dont realize the dangers these submunitions pose and are at serious risk of injury or death if they handle or even approach the bomblets
6839375 we did not use cluster bombs and whats more there was absolutely no necessity to do so
6839376 we were playing with them as were the georgian soldiers
6839377 it was only when one of the bombs exploded after a soldier threw it that we understood that they were dangerous
6839378 there are so many of these lying around the fields are full of them
6839379 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6839380 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6839381 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6839382 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6839383 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6839384 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6839385 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6839386 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6839387 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6839388 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6839389 the pricing is getting back to where we were a year ago but the appetite for lending is diminished
6839390 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6839391 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6839392 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6839393 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6839394 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6839395 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6839396 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6839397 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6839398 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6839399 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6839400 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6839401 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6839402 officials will work very closely with federal and state agencies to investigate these claims
6839403 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6839404 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6839405 it wasnt too hot the players were enthused and they flew around we got a lot of things done on charleston southern so we are going in the right direction
6839406 they run a spread offense and they do a lot of zone blitzing and things like that which most people around the country do we cant take them lightly we have to make sure we are doing all of the things we need to do on defense and picking up the blitzes on offense
6839407 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6839408 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6839409 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6839410 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6839411 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6839412 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6839413 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6839414 who are open to doing something on the production side
6839415 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6839416 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6839417 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6839418 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6839419 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6839420 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6839421 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6839422 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6839423 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6839424 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6839425 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6839426 vendra la muerte y tendra tus ojos tus ojos rojos
6839427 well put a boot in your ass its the american way
6839428 theres a big part of america that really believes that there is a war on terrorism and that we need to finish up
6839429 so i thought it was beautiful the other day when obama went to afghanistan and got educated about afghanistan and iraq he came back and said some really nice things
6839430 so as far as leadership and patriotism goes i think its really important that those things have to take place and i think hes the best democratic candidate weve had since bill clinton and thats coming from a democrat

6839434 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6839435 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6839436 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6839437 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6839438 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6839439 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6839440 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6839441 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6839442 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6839443 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6839444 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6839445 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6839446 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6839447 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6839448 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6839449 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6839450 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6839451 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6839452 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6839453 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

6839465 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6839466 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

6839533 henri iv had been murdered by a jesuit called ravillac so there is black irony in the fact that by his own wish the king was buried by jesuits among the jesuits whom he had patronised and supported with such generosity the jesuits as already noted were the advisors and encouragers of the hapsburgs who like their jesuit mentors saw themselves as the champions of the catholic church and who were soon to plunge europe into three decades of hideous war in an effort ultimately unsuccessful to reclaim for catholicism all territories lost to protestantism
6839534 the seven dissenting protestant provinces in the union of utrecht were holland zeeland utrecht gelderland overijssel friesland and groningen without its city
6839535 the new regents first act was to require that all bohemian religious bodies should revert to the terms of their original foundation thus at a stroke returning all protestant churches to catholic control complete with their endowments and other property the bohemian protestants immediately rebelled
6839536 as these armies amassed frederick v arrived in prague with his german calvinist entourage to whom the bohemian lutherans took an immediate dislike sweden venice denmark and the united provinces of the netherlands had all recognized fredericks accession to the throne of bohemia as a way of thumbing a nose at ferdinand ii but they had no intention of sending troops to help him

6839569 los argentinos no creemos realmente en la igualdad ante la ley y no hemos incorporado en nuestra cultura la idea de que una prohibici n por s sola es suficiente para dejar de hacer lo que nos est vedado

6839573 its a web portal on top of our er studio repository er studio is our data modeling tool er stands for entity relationship you use it to reverse engineer oracle mysql db2 and microsoft sql server databases it would build a model for you and you can put it in the repository multiple data modelers can work on these at the same time and put in definitions or classify things by line of business the portal is allowing other developers dbas and business analysts to search that metadata
6839574 has been on the market since 1996 now based on popular demand weve come out with this portal to help data architects publish models on the metadata and the models they can take the portal and put their own reports into that anyone can log in and run reports and search the repositories if a developer is working on a specific table and they see a column name and they dont know what that means they can open the portal and ask the definition and see the data type
6839575 er studio has a lot of reporting capabilities you can dump things to an excel spreadsheet or as html the drawback is that theyre static they come out of the model once the model changes you need to regenerate the reports the portal really ensures everyone is coming to the single source of the truth

6839653 one of the formal complaints was made in relation to a series of particularly poisonous and nasty emails written by a sheffield based ucu activist called jenna delich that complaint was also dismissed on the activist list in order to support a boycott of israeli academics who is the former grand wizard of the klu klux klan and perhaps the most notorious racist and anti semite in the world the article itself was originally posted on an extremist conspiracy nut website but appears it is therefore reasonable to infer that jenna delich reads and takes her information on world events from neo nazis
6839654 christians ought to be the best we ought to show up early and stay late we ought to give our all and then some more and not ask for extras to be the best does not mean we become people of pride or arrogance this means we desire for people to see god therefore give our all so others will see god not us

6839720 tal vez sea la turbulenta expresividad de sus obras la que ha hecho de mar n un artista que ha trascendido los mbitos frecuentes de la escultura consiguiendo que el observador se entusiasme con su trabajo como raramente lo hace con alg n otro escultor
6839721 este gobierno tiene el firme compromiso de impulsar el arte y para ello continuar n buscando alianzas con diferentes gobiernos para traer obras representativas como la del escultor javier mar n que goza de un reconocimiento internacional

6839743 i hope the local democrats are doing more research than just reading the pot smokers magazine
6839744 in the last 14 months the ddn has run 9 articles based on misrepresentation and innuendo attacking my business even though i meet the highest standards for public disclosure and accountability its shameful
6839745 and because mrs turners business is that of communications and her web site is so complete in listing clients and core competencies i find it interesting that this subsidiary is never mentioned
6839746 it seems to represent at best a very serious error in judgment and quite possibly more than that
6839747 these projects have helped create jobs improve neighborhoods and build new roads
6839748 perhaps my opponent should identify the federal dollars she would like to give back

6839752 clearly in a couple of weeks he will be back to his best he has needed time to get fit after his injuries and it has been important to protect him
6839753 we talked about the players that we have how to progress and we both know it is important for the club that we work together
6839754 we are working really hard we are moving in the right direction and hopefully we can do something positive in the next few days
6839755 the talks were positive we cannot discuss names but we are now both working to improve our squad
6839756 there was no friction but some personal problems now things are more clear and that is positive it was a private conversation
6839757 i have had no word about arsenal wanting gareth barry and that is all i want to say on the subject other than that we are working towards improving our squad
6839758 likewise there has been nothing more on xabi alonso at the beginning of the summer we were looking at ways of raising money but now we are happy with xabi he is a very good player
6839759 the offer we had was not good enough so why would we want to sell him

6839792 he never got a fair trial and in due course that will be expanded upon
6839793 mr gadd wants through me to say to you that he did not commit the offences for which he was convicted in vietnam
6839794 it was a show trial and he had no opportunity to put his defence forward
6839795 ultimately he wants that to be tested if he can before the courts of this country

6839814 the initial three versions of engagement ads will allow users to make a comment give a virtual gift or become a fan of a brands facebook page directly within the ad people also can view recent friends who made comments gave a gift or became a fan both within the ad and as those actions are shared through news feed
6839815 to combat dismal click through rates of traditional social network advertisements these features emulate widgets and encourage users to increase member adoption viral growth and brand interaction

6839825 had superman worked in 2006 we would have had a movie for christmas of this year or 2009
6839826 but now the plan is just to reintroduce superman without regard to a batman and superman movie at all
6839827 along those lines we have been developing every dc character that we own

6839842 the idea behind the decision it is not articulated of course and perhaps not even consciously held may simply be that turnabout is fair play liberal judges have used loose construction to expand constitutional prohibitions beyond any reasonable construal of original meaning and now it is the conservatives turn
6839843 cannot discern any principles in the pattern of the supreme courts constitutional interpretations
6839844 the text of the amendment whether viewed alone or in light of the concerns that actuated its adoption creates no right to the private possession of guns for hunting or other sport or for the defense of person or property
6839845 i t is doubtful that the amendment could even be thought to require that members of state militias be allowed to keep weapons in their homes since that would reduce the militias effectiveness
6839846 the ratifiers of the amendment probably did think that the right of militiamen to keep and bear arms entitled them to keep their weapons in their homes

6839875 we in africa hold the bible as our authority for the christian life
6839876 this has happened to many other african countries and african churches our opinion and independence of mind is being choked by patronising generosity via the gifts of money that is manipulation and dehumanizing to think we will do what people want because they have money
6839877 we re affirm the resolutions made by the bishops of the anglican communion gathered at the lambeth conference in 1998 on issues of human sexuality as having moral force and commanding the respect of the communion as its present position on these issues
6839878 therefore as a body we deeply regret the actions of the diocese of new westminsterand the episcopal church usa which appear to a number of provinces to have short circuited that process and could be perceived to alter unilaterally the teaching of the anglican communion on this issue
6839879 to this extent therefore we must make clear that recent actions in new westminster and in the episcopal church usa do not express the mind of our communion as a whole and these decisions jeopardise our sacramental fellowship with each other
6839880 if his consecration proceeds we recognise that we have reached a crucial and critical point in the life of the anglican communion and we have had to conclude that the future of the communion itself will be put in jeopardy in this case the ministry of this one bishop will not be recognised by most of the anglican world and many provinces are likely to consider themselves to be out of communion with the episcopal church usa this will tear the fabric of our communion at its deepest level and may lead to further division on this and further issues as provinces have to decide in consequence whether they can remain in communion with provinces that choose not to break communion with the episcopal church usa

6839907 these were basically attacks intended to result in the social exclusion or humiliation of the speaker punctuated on occasion with profanity a nasty glare or even a solid punch to the arm
6839908 what did the big chimney say to the little chimney
6839909 the predominant verbal reaction to failed humor in our study was oriented exclusively toward attacking the speaker

6839913 the arsenic concentrations reported are worrisome but the risk assessment is complex
6839914 recent reports indicate increased fetal and infant mortality due to fairly low level arsenic exposure via drinking water
6839915 rice bran solubles are not the only way of getting nutrients to malnourished children
6839916 if aid agencies want to go down the bran solubles route why not wheat oat or barely bran solubles all these crops have ten times less total arsenic than rice and are just as nutrient rich
6839917 one would expect dietary supplements to be virtually free of unwanted substances like arsenic especially when aimed at children who are particularly vulnerable to arsenic
6839918 we totally agree with the overall message that it is important to set standards for inorganic arsenic in our food
6839919 rice bran solubles are being produced by commercial companies who profit from this commodity
6839920 the total cost to acquire a 3g iphone is rather high
6839921 the upfront payment is not high but when you combine it with the total subscription package it is still clearly a high end product
6839922 vodafone is talking to barclays and icici bank for introducing two monthly schemes for six and 12 months
6839923 we expect to sell anywhere between 50 to 100 phones a day
6839924 however it is too early to predict how the sales will shape up
6839925 we will only be able to figure out the trend only after a week or so the response has been overwhelming but its still not clear how many of the pre bookings will actually convert to sales
6839926 we were selling the 3g version till a few days ago for anything between rs 40 000 to rs 55 000 there will always be people who will spend anything the older 2g version sold for around rs 24 000 25 000 now we will have to undercut
6839927 we are aware of the hacking software that are available and are used to unlock the iphone but customers who will stay with airtel will be able to enjoy iphones full benefits including the data plans
6839928 more than 30 000 iphones 2g are running on the airtel network alone
6839929 mr rata tata should understand that bengal would not tolerate forcible acquisition of lands and a deathblow to its agriculture and the recent panchayat and municipal poll results in singur and nandigram reflects that
6839930 let industry and agriculture flourish together in singur and i believe that rs 1 500 crores already pumped in by the tatas for its plant here is not a big amount for a rich industrial house like the tatas so they can accommodate the vendors elsewhere
6839931 so the tatas should stick to only 650 acres of land
6839932 and if the tatas decide to do so the small car would roll out smoothly other technicalities can be resolved easily if the main issue is solved
